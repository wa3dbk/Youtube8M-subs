 during the first part I will be 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.180
 talking about the tea of my weight and what 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.250
 you're supposed to do the second 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.140
 part will do at the end of the 14 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.030
 days and I'll be practicing if I 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.010
 I noticed a difference or if I lose weight 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.290

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.420

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.160
 make you comfortable and keep watching him 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.900
 it tells you that it helps you burn fat that 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.660
 helps you lose weight that helps you 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.210
 improve your immune system and that helps you 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.370
 to clean your digestive system is supposed

 that you have to take it every morning and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.750
 every time you go to exercise I 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.970
 I came with 14 bags of this style 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.920
 I've seen several videos that say that 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.200
 This does not come in the bags but I 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.940
 I bought mine and came with the bags 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.040
 the best if they send it to you 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.750
 you will get there without bags but if 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.920
 shopping already comes with the bags 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.480
 that you do not have to fight to 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.700
 divide it now I'll be 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.310
 commenting on how I prepared mine I would 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.590
 I drink my tea in this cup every morning and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.750
 What I do is put a little honey 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.270
 in the factor I after I put my 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.640
 tea bag in this factor yo and 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.700
 luciana I put between one or two glasses 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.670
 of hot water I put the tea blind my 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.180
 cup and once I have my cup closed 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.180
 I mix it 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.880
 and as you can see, everything was mixed 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.740
 and once everything is mixed I put it in 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.960
 the refrigerator all night so that 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.210
 the morning is super cool and the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.800
 taste is well charged because with this 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.450
 I can not have a tea 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.580
 hot in the mornings because I feel 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.840
 I'm going to make a roasted chicken 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.360
 as I had already mentioned in another 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.440
 video I'm trying to lose weight yo 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.630
 I started thinking 134.8 pounds but I managed 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.390
 lose 3 pounds during the month of March 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.270
 and my challenge was to lose 5 pounds because 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.370
 like who says I weighed 135 and I want 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.500
 go from 130 and during the month of March 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.570
 I managed to lose 3 pounds by eating a 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.060
 little bit healthier by exercising 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.920
 and not drinking sodas for anything so 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.110
 I'm starting to open with a new 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.510
 challenge that is being the deficit was without 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.480
 dentists my weight to the whole before 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.370
 begin this challenge is 131 points 2 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.500
 pounds to me it makes me much more 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.450
 realistic put little goals for 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.400
 lose weight at the beginning because it is 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.260
 much easier to say I want to lose 5 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.709
 pounds that if I want to lose 10 pounds 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.860
 so as I mentioned those 131.2 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.020
 pounds before starting this 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.640
 and I do not just want to lose weight using the 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.170
 Fiti but I 'm also doing 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.360
 exercise and I'm improving my 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.700
 feeding little by little and I do 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.830
 exercise a day yes and a day no and what 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.230
 minimum that way and as in the days that 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.330
 I exercise is a mile and a half but 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.100
 I can get to do two miles 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.650
 three miles too I'm not taking 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.990
 Soda for nothing my portions of meals 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.090
 they are small but very nutritious and 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.830
 not like tortillas but if I tell myself 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.200
 I eat like corn 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.150
 golden and I just like one and a lot 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.370
 less like potatoes and hamburgers and 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.470
 meals that are fried in the morning 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.600
 like some proteins and now that I'm 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.730
 starting this delphi method if I take 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.130
 the tea after my protein for me 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.930
 meal of the day I eat a chicken with the 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.970
 half of a tupper die and half a 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.800
 avocado or changed the things but 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.140
 safer not to eat where not eat 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.730
 tortillas in commercials and things for 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.250
 the style and for my dinner I'm 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.080
 eating a bread with jam and other bread 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.850
 with peanut butter and if not for me 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.830
 I'm also eating a bread dinner 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.870
 toasted with sliced ​​avocado and 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.610
 be above so how can you see 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.650
 I'm trying very hard not to 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.340
 eat fatty foods good girls 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.080
 this is going to be 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.599
 for the first part of this video and 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.340
 come back in 14 days and I'll tell you what 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.410
 so me no longer girls that's the 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.780
 part number 2 of the video and I'm going to 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.660
 tell my experience with the fit and today 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.819
 indicates sorry but telling them that the 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.190
 fit and for me it did not work in fact I 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.720
 I feel that he did not do anything for me I know that 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.849
 many people here on youtube that 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.530
 they mention that sexy is a very good tea and 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.510
 that has helped them lose enough 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.130
 pounds but personally I feel that 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.930
 I did not do it but I had only one 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.150
 Libra has not made me have more energy and 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.550
 He has done absolutely nothing for me 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.080
 this is the little bag where the tea comes from and 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.120
 As you can see, all of them are left to me 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.130
 some sachets I'm missing 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.810
 four bags to finish the baby and 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.880
 I'm not going to finish the challenge because I feel 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.130
 that the tea did absolutely nothing for 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.020
 me apart that after five days 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.540
 I could not drink tea anymore 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.040
 hot be cold as it was not happening to me 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.770
 for the big region I was making tea 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.870
 super bad I could not stand the smell and like 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.580
 I did not feel it was much for me and I said no 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.470
 I'm going to finish it because it did not help 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.180
 to lose weight and why I 'm going to take 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.070
 something that I do not even like to go feel 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.070
 that I was dumb 25 dollars when 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.710
 buy this tea because the truth is not me 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.810
 for nothing he did nothing and I do not know 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.540
 I recommend for nothing girls right now 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.430
 and weights 131 but I do not feel that it was 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.470
 the one that made me lose weight just 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.230
 was that I exercise I will be able to 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.390
 I walk I do sit-ups 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.100
 I do everything and I feel that 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.440
 it was what helped me to lose was not the 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.630
 tea itself I would recommend them better 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.490
 start running to be a 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.200
 little exercise 2 3 times 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.120
 week because that will help them a lot 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.770
 more than having a tea and good many 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.750
 Sometimes I do not know what to tell you more about this 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.880
 since it did not work for me and I did not 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.010
