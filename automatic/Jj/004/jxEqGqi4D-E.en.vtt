00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
the two basic vendors we have starting

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.950 
the two basic vendors we have starting
with<00:00:48.650> about<00:00:48.829> vendor<00:00:49.430> you<00:00:49.579> want<00:00:49.760> to<00:00:49.850> explain<00:00:50.239> a

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
with about vendor you want to explain a

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.650 
with about vendor you want to explain a
little<00:00:51.079> bit<00:00:51.530> about<00:00:51.590> this<00:00:51.980> vendor<00:00:52.370> here<00:00:52.579> okay

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
little bit about this vendor here okay

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.389 
little bit about this vendor here okay
originally<00:00:54.410> when<00:00:54.560> we<00:00:54.710> had<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.310> original

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
originally when we had the original

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.360 
originally when we had the original
benders<00:00:56.140> there<00:00:57.140> was<00:00:57.260> a<00:00:57.290> piece<00:00:58.100> of<00:00:58.220> metal

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
benders there was a piece of metal

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.670 
benders there was a piece of metal
called<00:00:58.579> a<00:00:58.730> choux<00:00:58.970> which<00:00:59.329> kind<00:00:59.600> of<00:00:59.690> was<00:00:59.809> a<00:00:59.870> it

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
called a choux which kind of was a it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.229 
called a choux which kind of was a it
wasn't<00:01:00.860> really<00:01:01.190> regulated<00:01:01.610> too<00:01:01.820> well<00:01:02.000> with

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
wasn't really regulated too well with

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.590 
wasn't really regulated too well with
heat<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.549> the<00:01:04.549> main<00:01:04.759> problem<00:01:05.210> that<00:01:05.239> we<00:01:05.420> had

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
heat and the main problem that we had

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.950 
heat and the main problem that we had
was<00:01:05.869> pressure<00:01:06.639> so<00:01:07.639> now<00:01:07.789> with<00:01:08.030> with<00:01:08.719> the<00:01:08.840> new

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
was pressure so now with with the new

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.719 
was pressure so now with with the new
bender<00:01:09.319> here<00:01:09.499> we<00:01:09.679> have<00:01:09.799> a<00:01:09.829> shim<00:01:10.159> that's<00:01:10.369> has

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
bender here we have a shim that's has

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.969 
bender here we have a shim that's has
even<00:01:11.119> pressure<00:01:11.359> you<00:01:11.840> can<00:01:11.990> see<00:01:12.139> my<00:01:12.289> hand<00:01:12.530> yeah

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
even pressure you can see my hand yeah

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.529 
even pressure you can see my hand yeah
kind<00:01:13.340> of<00:01:13.429> doesn't<00:01:13.609> really<00:01:13.759> move<00:01:13.999> it<00:01:14.149> -<00:01:14.240> too

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
kind of doesn't really move it - too

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:15.730 
kind of doesn't really move it - too
much<00:01:14.689> huh

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
much huh

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.199 
much huh
it's<00:01:15.979> even<00:01:16.280> pressure<00:01:16.490> in<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:16.850> middle<00:01:16.999> of<00:01:17.149> the

00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:17.209 
it's even pressure in the middle of the

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.239 
it's even pressure in the middle of the
way<00:01:17.329> so<00:01:17.389> as<00:01:17.719> soon<00:01:17.869> as<00:01:18.020> we<00:01:18.139> hit<00:01:18.889> one<00:01:19.069> of<00:01:19.100> the

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.249 
way so as soon as we hit one of the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:22.239 
way so as soon as we hit one of the
buttons<00:01:19.539> the<00:01:20.539> way<00:01:20.719> starts<00:01:21.049> to<00:01:21.170> bend<00:01:21.319> okay<00:01:21.979> so

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:22.249 
buttons the way starts to bend okay so

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.050 
buttons the way starts to bend okay so
we<00:01:22.369> have<00:01:22.459> even<00:01:22.670> pressure<00:01:22.969> even<00:01:23.659> heat<00:01:23.899> I<00:01:24.109> mean

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
we have even pressure even heat I mean

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.849 
we have even pressure even heat I mean
perfect<00:01:26.060> pressure<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:26.959> so<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.289> idea<00:01:27.319> is

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
perfect pressure so that so the idea is

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.969 
perfect pressure so that so the idea is
that<00:01:28.179> we've<00:01:29.289> dissected<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.409> bending<00:01:30.799> into

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
that we've dissected the bending into

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.080 
that we've dissected the bending into
nothing<00:01:31.459> but<00:01:31.490> outside<00:01:32.029> curves<00:01:33.670> so<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:34.880> one

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
nothing but outside curves so this one

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.849 
nothing but outside curves so this one
is<00:01:35.270> really<00:01:35.600> just<00:01:35.959> bending<00:01:36.319> the<00:01:36.350> waist<00:01:36.619> that's

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
is really just bending the waist that's

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.859 
is really just bending the waist that's
all<00:01:37.069> I<00:01:37.100> do<00:01:37.399> is<00:01:37.520> we're<00:01:38.090> gonna<00:01:38.149> slip<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.630> sides

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
all I do is we're gonna slip the sides

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.139 
all I do is we're gonna slip the sides
in<00:01:39.079> there<00:01:39.289> in<00:01:39.409> a<00:01:39.499> few<00:01:39.649> minutes<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:40.219> we'll<00:01:40.909> bend

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
in there in a few minutes and we'll bend

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.269 
in there in a few minutes and we'll bend
the<00:01:41.270> waist<00:01:41.450> now<00:01:41.899> after<00:01:42.469> the<00:01:42.590> waist<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:43.009> bent

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:43.279 
the waist now after the waist is bent

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:45.849 
the waist now after the waist is bent
then<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.899> comes<00:01:45.139> over<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.469> what<00:01:45.590> we<00:01:45.619> call<00:01:45.709> the

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
then it comes over to what we call the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.039 
then it comes over to what we call the
bow<00:01:46.130> fenders<00:01:46.639> and<00:01:46.849> maybe<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:47.569> can<00:01:47.719> give<00:01:47.840> us<00:01:47.959> a

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
bow fenders and maybe you can give us a

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.719 
bow fenders and maybe you can give us a
little<00:01:48.229> rundown<00:01:48.409> on<00:01:48.649> this<00:01:49.039> okay<00:01:49.459> the<00:01:49.579> bow

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
little rundown on this okay the bow

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.819 
little rundown on this okay the bow
bender<00:01:50.149> as<00:01:50.779> soon<00:01:50.959> as<00:01:51.079> the<00:01:51.200> sides<00:01:51.409> come<00:01:51.619> out<00:01:51.740> of

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
bender as soon as the sides come out of

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.529 
bender as soon as the sides come out of
the<00:01:51.889> waist<00:01:52.069> bender<00:01:52.429> to<00:01:52.969> place<00:01:53.179> it<00:01:53.359> in<00:01:53.450> the

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
the waist bender to place it in the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.599 
the waist bender to place it in the
valve<00:01:53.719> inner<00:01:53.929> no<00:01:54.319> so<00:01:55.159> I<00:01:55.189> showed<00:01:55.490> earlier

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
valve inner no so I showed earlier

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.969 
valve inner no so I showed earlier
there's<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.149> little<00:01:57.109> things<00:01:57.259> we<00:01:57.380> call<00:01:57.499> locator

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
there's a little things we call locator

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.209 
there's a little things we call locator
locator<00:01:58.639> tabs<00:01:59.349> once<00:02:00.349> we<00:02:00.439> put<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.709> in<00:02:00.829> here<00:02:01.039> the

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
locator tabs once we put it in here the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.339 
locator tabs once we put it in here the
locator<00:02:01.579> tab<00:02:01.849> tells<00:02:02.119> tells<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.959> science

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
locator tab tells tells the science

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:05.469 
locator tab tells tells the science
where<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.069> middle<00:02:04.279> of<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.429> way<00:02:04.549> okay

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
where the middle of the way okay

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.469 
where the middle of the way okay
once<00:02:06.049> it<00:02:06.229> once<00:02:06.469> I<00:02:06.590> find<00:02:06.859> that<00:02:07.009> area<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.669> go<00:02:08.240> ahead

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
once it once I find that area I go ahead

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.130 
once it once I find that area I go ahead
and<00:02:08.630> make<00:02:08.750> sure<00:02:08.899> it's<00:02:09.050> centered<00:02:09.200> on<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.530> sham

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and make sure it's centered on the sham

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.680 
and make sure it's centered on the sham
I<00:02:10.200> use<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.670> wheel<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.120> clamp<00:02:12.390> down<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
I use this this wheel to clamp down the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.860 
I use this this wheel to clamp down the
waste<00:02:12.840> press<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.620> button<00:02:14.720> now<00:02:15.720> these

waste press the button now these

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.930 
waste press the button now these
machines<00:02:16.020> have<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.470> lot<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.709> interlocks<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.430> you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
machines have a lot of interlocks on you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.120 
machines have a lot of interlocks on you
know<00:02:18.060> for<00:02:18.330> example<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.560> have<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.860> have<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
know for example you have to have the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.940 
know for example you have to have the
correct<00:02:20.400> pressure<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.110> order<00:02:22.590> for

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
correct pressure on this in order for

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.530 
correct pressure on this in order for
the<00:02:23.040> machine<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.459> move<00:02:23.580> into<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:23.940> there's<00:02:24.480> a

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
the machine to move into this there's a

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.820 
the machine to move into this there's a
sensor<00:02:24.870> located<00:02:25.200> here<00:02:25.590> uh-huh

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
sensor located here uh-huh

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.040 
sensor located here uh-huh
and<00:02:28.830> there's<00:02:28.980> also<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.340> sensor<00:02:30.240> located<00:02:30.600> two

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
and there's also a sensor located two

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.530 
and there's also a sensor located two
sensors<00:02:31.440> on<00:02:31.770> each<00:02:32.010> side<00:02:32.280> located<00:02:32.850> one<00:02:33.270> tells

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
sensors on each side located one tells

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.449 
sensors on each side located one tells
you<00:02:33.720> when<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.350> alarms<00:02:34.830> are<00:02:34.980> supposed<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.250> stay

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
you when the alarms are supposed to stay

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.310 
you when the alarms are supposed to stay
in<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.700> area<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.570> they<00:02:36.690> start<00:02:36.989> in<00:02:37.110> and

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
in the area that that they start in and

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.840 
in the area that that they start in and
then<00:02:37.739> when<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:37.950> gets<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.340> top<00:02:38.520> they<00:02:38.730> also

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
then when it gets to the top they also

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.400 
then when it gets to the top they also
has<00:02:39.060> another<00:02:39.300> locator<00:02:39.690> telling<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.140> Machine

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
has another locator telling the Machine

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.620 
has another locator telling the Machine
when<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.650> stop<00:02:40.890> okay<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.970> those<00:02:42.030> proximity

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
when to stop okay so those proximity

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.840 
when to stop okay so those proximity
sensors<00:02:43.230> tell<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.650> where<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.830> then<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:44.640> one

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
sensors tell it where to then this one

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.940 
sensors tell it where to then this one
tells<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.540> you've<00:02:46.050> got<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.350> proper<00:02:46.380> amount

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
tells that you've got the proper amount

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.410 
tells that you've got the proper amount
of<00:02:47.040> pressure<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:47.820> go<00:02:47.940> forward<00:02:48.239> and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
of pressure so it can go forward and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.150 
of pressure so it can go forward and
also<00:02:48.930> there's<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.200> temperature<00:02:49.560> sensor<00:02:50.070> it

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
also there's a temperature sensor it

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.800 
also there's a temperature sensor it
won't<00:02:50.340> bend<00:02:50.610> unless<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.090> sight<00:02:51.300> is<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.570> gap<00:02:51.780> I

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
won't bend unless the sight is the gap I

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.220 
won't bend unless the sight is the gap I
think<00:02:52.050> even<00:02:53.600> now<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.660> think<00:02:54.780> it's<00:02:55.050> actually

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
think even now I think it's actually

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.920 
think even now I think it's actually
higher<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:56.580> yeah<00:02:57.390> closer

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
higher like yeah closer

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.979 
higher like yeah closer
most<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.440> 300<00:02:58.860> degrees<00:02:58.950> it's<00:02:59.400> pretty<00:02:59.640> hot<00:02:59.989> okay

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
most of 300 degrees it's pretty hot okay

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.479 
most of 300 degrees it's pretty hot okay
so<00:03:01.050> now<00:03:01.260> we<00:03:01.320> come<00:03:01.590> over<00:03:01.620> here<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.130> we<00:03:02.310> have<00:03:02.459> a

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
so now we come over here and we have a

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.150 
so now we come over here and we have a
set<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.910> sides<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.690> we're<00:03:04.350> gonna<00:03:04.440> notice<00:03:04.980> I'm

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
set of sides and we're gonna notice I'm

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.130 
set of sides and we're gonna notice I'm
gonna<00:03:05.310> show<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.730> camera<00:03:06.120> here<00:03:06.420> but<00:03:06.570> these

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
gonna show the camera here but these

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.890 
gonna show the camera here but these
sides<00:03:07.440> have<00:03:07.620> been<00:03:07.769> cut<00:03:08.040> on<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.880> laser<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:09.750> can

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
sides have been cut on a laser you can

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.759 
sides have been cut on a laser you can
see<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.350> brown<00:03:11.690> burnt<00:03:12.690> edges<00:03:13.019> from<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.470> laser

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
see the brown burnt edges from the laser

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.060 
see the brown burnt edges from the laser
and<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:15.060> can<00:03:15.239> also<00:03:15.390> see<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:16.049> we<00:03:16.739> have<00:03:16.769> these

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
and you can also see that we have these

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.979 
and you can also see that we have these
notches<00:03:17.310> cut<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:18.060> call<00:03:18.239> those<00:03:18.390> keyways

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
notches cut in and we call those keyways

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.380 
notches cut in and we call those keyways
and<00:03:19.470> those<00:03:19.590> are<00:03:19.739> where<00:03:19.860> keys<00:03:20.130> are<00:03:20.370> going<00:03:20.549> to<00:03:20.850> go

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
and those are where keys are going to go

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.289 
and those are where keys are going to go
in<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.570> locate<00:03:22.079> everything<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:24.090> later

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
in to locate everything and the later

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.630 
in to locate everything and the later
will<00:03:24.570> do<00:03:24.750> well<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:25.829> cutaway<00:03:26.310> piece

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
will do well this is a cutaway piece

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.930 
will do well this is a cutaway piece
isn't<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:27.090> Gil<00:03:27.530> yeah<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.370> we<00:03:29.489> have<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.640> cutaway

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
isn't it Gil yeah so we have a cutaway

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.270 
isn't it Gil yeah so we have a cutaway
piece<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.780> see<00:03:31.049> there's<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.799> compound

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
piece so you can see there's a compound

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.340 
piece so you can see there's a compound
curve<00:03:32.670> here<00:03:33.060> because<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.600> as<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.989> cutaway

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
curve here because the as the cutaway

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.729 
curve here because the as the cutaway
comes<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:34.980> goes<00:03:35.100> out<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:36.090> arch<00:03:36.329> of<00:03:36.420> the

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
comes in and goes out the arch of the

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.440 
comes in and goes out the arch of the
side<00:03:37.739> has<00:03:38.100> got<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.430> be<00:03:38.519> projected<00:03:38.730> onto<00:03:39.209> this

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
side has got to be projected onto this

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.600 
side has got to be projected onto this
straight<00:03:39.750> piece<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.290> then<00:03:40.890> this<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.370> part

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
straight piece and then this is the part

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.020 
straight piece and then this is the part
that<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:42.980> wraps<00:03:43.980> all<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.280> way<00:03:44.400> around<00:03:44.489> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
non cutaway piece actually has to be

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.770 
non cutaway piece actually has to be
longer<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.400> work<00:03:47.610> its<00:03:47.760> way<00:03:47.910> all<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.180> way<00:03:48.420> over

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
longer to work its way all the way over

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.039 
longer to work its way all the way over
and<00:03:48.810> under<00:03:49.079> underneath<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.799> neck<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.190> Beyond

paper does first thing it does keeps the
oils<00:05:33.230> from<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:34.490> different<00:05:34.820> types<00:05:35.030> of<00:05:35.210> wood

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
oils from the different types of wood

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.790 
oils from the different types of wood
now<00:05:35.600> here<00:05:35.780> we're<00:05:35.900> bending<00:05:36.080> maple<00:05:36.500> and<00:05:36.590> it<00:05:36.680> has

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
now here we're bending maple and it has

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.130 
now here we're bending maple and it has
an<00:05:36.920> oil<00:05:37.010> in<00:05:37.490> it<00:05:37.640> but<00:05:38.420> if<00:05:38.510> this<00:05:38.630> were<00:05:38.780> a<00:05:38.840> rosewood

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
an oil in it but if this were a rosewood

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.900 
an oil in it but if this were a rosewood
piece<00:05:39.560> which<00:05:39.800> we'll<00:05:39.980> do<00:05:40.130> next

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
piece which we'll do next

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.180 
piece which we'll do next
oils<00:05:41.690> are<00:05:41.840> gonna<00:05:41.960> boil<00:05:42.350> out<00:05:42.680> of<00:05:42.830> that<00:05:42.980> wood

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
oils are gonna boil out of that wood

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.550 
oils are gonna boil out of that wood
which<00:05:44.000> gets<00:05:44.210> all<00:05:44.420> over<00:05:44.450> the<00:05:44.900> side<00:05:45.110> bender<00:05:45.440> and

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
which gets all over the side bender and

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.740 
which gets all over the side bender and
turns<00:05:45.710> everything<00:05:46.010> into<00:05:46.220> a<00:05:46.370> filthy<00:05:46.670> mess<00:05:47.000> so

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
turns everything into a filthy mess so

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.990 
turns everything into a filthy mess so
the<00:05:47.870> paper<00:05:48.080> kind<00:05:48.470> of<00:05:48.560> acts<00:05:48.740> as<00:05:48.980> a<00:05:49.010> disposable

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
the paper kind of acts as a disposable

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000 
the paper kind of acts as a disposable
diaper<00:05:50.120> so<00:05:50.630> to<00:05:50.690> stamp<00:05:51.020> protects<00:05:51.440> or<00:05:51.770> it's<00:05:51.890> all

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
diaper so to stamp protects or it's all

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.610 
diaper so to stamp protects or it's all
that<00:05:52.190> of<00:05:52.340> oil<00:05:52.640> it<00:05:53.450> does<00:05:53.630> something<00:05:53.840> else<00:05:54.110> with

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
that of oil it does something else with

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.590 
that of oil it does something else with
the<00:05:54.740> moisture<00:05:55.100> content<00:05:55.550> of<00:05:55.610> the<00:05:55.670> wood<00:05:55.730> too<00:05:56.120> yes

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
the moisture content of the wood too yes

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.420 
the moisture content of the wood too yes
it<00:05:56.630> also<00:05:56.930> it<00:05:57.320> holds<00:05:57.560> the<00:05:57.620> moisture<00:05:57.770> content<00:05:58.070> in

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
it also it holds the moisture content in

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.970 
it also it holds the moisture content in
it<00:05:58.580> it<00:05:59.240> kind<00:05:59.480> of<00:05:59.540> kind<00:06:00.470> of<00:06:00.530> makes<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:00.800> wood

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
it it kind of kind of makes the wood

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.630 
it it kind of kind of makes the wood
sweat

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
sweat

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.910 
sweat
yeah<00:06:02.150> and<00:06:02.270> by<00:06:02.840> blending<00:06:03.140> making<00:06:03.410> a<00:06:03.470> sweat<00:06:03.740> if

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
yeah and by blending making a sweat if

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.190 
yeah and by blending making a sweat if
we<00:06:04.040> can<00:06:04.190> use<00:06:04.370> the<00:06:05.360> moisture<00:06:05.690> that's<00:06:05.840> inside

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
we can use the moisture that's inside

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.080 
we can use the moisture that's inside
the<00:06:06.350> wood<00:06:06.500> we<00:06:07.010> don't<00:06:07.160> have<00:06:07.280> to<00:06:07.400> longer<00:06:07.820> spray

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
the wood we don't have to longer spray

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.630 
the wood we don't have to longer spray
it<00:06:08.270> you<00:06:08.480> know<00:06:08.600> extra<00:06:09.140> with<00:06:09.290> it<00:06:09.500> yeah<00:06:10.010> we<00:06:10.460> worked

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640

it you know extra with it yeah we worked
so<00:06:10.790> hard<00:06:10.820> to<00:06:11.060> try<00:06:11.120> to<00:06:11.240> get<00:06:11.390> out<00:06:11.570> that's<00:06:12.080> right

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
so hard to try to get out that's right

so hard to try to get out that's right
so<00:06:12.740> so<00:06:13.340> with<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.610> side<00:06:13.970> benders<00:06:14.900> such<00:06:15.380> a<00:06:16.000> with

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
so so with the side benders such a with

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.630 
so so with the side benders such a with
that<00:06:17.150> shim<00:06:17.540> wrapping<00:06:18.050> around<00:06:18.170> the<00:06:18.980> bender<00:06:19.370> so

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
that shim wrapping around the bender so

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.180 
that shim wrapping around the bender so
well<00:06:19.880> and<00:06:20.180> it<00:06:20.930> and<00:06:21.200> the<00:06:21.320> feed<00:06:21.530> rate<00:06:21.710> being<00:06:21.950> so

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
well and it and the feed rate being so

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.670 
well and it and the feed rate being so
good

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
good

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.770 
good
and<00:06:22.770> the<00:06:23.190> paper<00:06:23.400> wrapped<00:06:23.729> around<00:06:23.940> here<00:06:24.419> we

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
and the paper wrapped around here we

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.300 
and the paper wrapped around here we
actually<00:06:25.169> utilized<00:06:25.590> the<00:06:25.800> moisture<00:06:26.130> content

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
actually utilized the moisture content

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.730 
actually utilized the moisture content
of<00:06:26.729> the<00:06:26.789> wood<00:06:26.910> itself<00:06:27.449> to<00:06:28.199> bend<00:06:28.380> the<00:06:28.500> sides

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
of the wood itself to bend the sides

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.980 
of the wood itself to bend the sides
we're<00:06:29.520> typically<00:06:29.850> when<00:06:30.389> you've<00:06:30.509> been<00:06:30.630> guitar

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
we're typically when you've been guitar

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.379 
we're typically when you've been guitar
sides<00:06:31.289> you're<00:06:31.770> soaking<00:06:32.310> spraying<00:06:33.060> it<00:06:33.210> down

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
sides you're soaking spraying it down

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.300 
sides you're soaking spraying it down
which<00:06:33.690> causes<00:06:34.139> a<00:06:34.169> lot<00:06:34.410> of<00:06:34.440> warping<00:06:34.860> rippling

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
which causes a lot of warping rippling

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.010 
which causes a lot of warping rippling
that<00:06:35.520> type<00:06:35.729> of<00:06:35.759> thing<00:06:36.060> okay<00:06:36.509> so<00:06:36.539> let's<00:06:36.900> go
