I<00:00:00.530> later<00:00:01.530> learned<00:00:01.650> that<00:00:02.070> there<00:00:02.790> was<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:02.970> great

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
I later learned that there was a great

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.910 
I later learned that there was a great
deal<00:00:03.360> of<00:00:03.389> interrogation<00:00:04.020> behind<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.680> scenes

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
deal of interrogation behind the scenes

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.330 
deal of interrogation behind the scenes
that<00:00:05.100> went<00:00:05.279> on<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:06.080> possibly<00:00:07.080> hypnosis<00:00:08.010> and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
sodium pentathol and I don't know that

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.650 
sodium pentathol and I don't know that
firsthand<00:00:10.980> but<00:00:11.219> I've<00:00:11.370> heard<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:11.759> two<00:00:12.509> or

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
firsthand but I've heard that two or

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.490 
firsthand but I've heard that two or
three<00:00:12.690> different<00:00:12.990> sources<00:00:13.380> okay<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:15.139> is<00:00:16.139> that

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
three different sources okay and is that

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.620 
three different sources okay and is that
possible<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.279> mean<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.670> being<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.420> deputy

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
possible I mean you being the deputy

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.480 
possible I mean you being the deputy
base<00:00:18.930> commander<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:20.010> some<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.430> your

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
base commander that some of your

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.080 
base commander that some of your
security<00:00:21.090> personnel<00:00:21.539> would<00:00:22.140> be<00:00:22.850> debriefed<00:00:23.850> by

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
security personnel would be debriefed by

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.990 
security personnel would be debriefed by
other<00:00:24.300> groups<00:00:24.779> without<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.350> knowing<00:00:26.000> very

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
other groups without you knowing very

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.400 
other groups without you knowing very
common<00:00:27.650> really<00:00:28.699> and<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:30.359> recall<00:00:30.660> who<00:00:31.019> would<00:00:31.230> do

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
common really and I recall who would do

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.270 
common really and I recall who would do
that<00:00:31.619> sort<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.980> debriefing<00:00:33.739> well<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:35.130> this

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
that sort of debriefing well in this

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.979 
that sort of debriefing well in this
case<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.700> would<00:00:35.790> probably<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.270> initiated<00:00:36.960> by

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
case it would probably be initiated by

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.280 
case it would probably be initiated by
the<00:00:37.170> OSI<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> OSI<00:00:38.910> probably<00:00:39.750> didn't<00:00:40.170> do

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the OSI but the OSI probably didn't do

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.500 
the OSI but the OSI probably didn't do
it<00:00:40.440> directly<00:00:41.040> mm-hmm<00:00:41.850> as<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.480> remember<00:00:42.690> the

I<00:00:52.050> think<00:00:52.320> Brian<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.739> not<00:00:52.920> sure<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
I think Brian I'm not sure about the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.209 
I think Brian I'm not sure about the
Marine<00:00:53.520> Corps<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.840> as<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.140> remembered

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
Marine Corps but and as I remembered

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.700 
Marine Corps but and as I remembered
n<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.910> now<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.629> called<00:00:57.840> NCIS<00:00:58.469> has<00:00:58.649> a

n is now it's called NCIS has a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.939 
n is now it's called NCIS has a
fantastic<00:00:59.129> program<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.879> TV<00:01:00.030> about<00:01:00.480> them<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.949> had

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
fantastic program on TV about them I had

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.160 
fantastic program on TV about them I had
responsibilities<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.090> England<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:04.019> would

intelligence service and probably their

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.649 
intelligence service and probably their
British<00:01:09.570> counterparts<00:01:09.600> were<00:01:10.470> involved<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
British counterparts were involved I

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.630 
British counterparts were involved I
suspected<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> local<00:01:13.260> OSI<00:01:13.710> handled<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.520> all

not<00:01:30.630> true<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.650> again<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:32.909> very<00:01:32.939> naive<00:01:33.360> and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
not true but again I was very naive and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.810 
not true but again I was very naive and
trusting<00:01:33.630> yeah<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.979> how<00:01:35.130> much<00:01:35.280> stock<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.729> you

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
trusting yeah so how much stock do you

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.719 
trusting yeah so how much stock do you
put<00:01:36.060> into<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:37.560> possibility<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.549> other

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
put into the possibility that this other

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.910 
put into the possibility that this other
interrogation<00:01:39.329> went<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.930> why<00:01:43.560> would<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
interrogation went on and why would the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.310 
interrogation went on and why would the
heli<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> would<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.790> willing<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.270> bet<00:01:45.479> that

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
heli be I would be willing to bet that

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.120 
heli be I would be willing to bet that
one<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> alleged<00:01:47.759> participants<00:01:48.770> has<00:01:49.770> been
