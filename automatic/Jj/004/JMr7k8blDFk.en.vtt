just because I was not at my house so I

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.819 
just because I was not at my house so I
didn't<00:03:37.970> have<00:03:38.060> like<00:03:38.780> thread<00:03:39.139> or<00:03:39.379> fabric<00:03:39.739> glue

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
or anything so mine wasn't actually a

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.179 
or anything so mine wasn't actually a
pocket<00:03:41.540> but<00:03:41.930> more<00:03:42.109> of<00:03:42.200> like<00:03:42.409> an<00:03:42.560> illusion<00:03:42.859> of<00:03:43.099> a

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:43.189
