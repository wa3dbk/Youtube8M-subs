my dad added two and a half feet of
concrete<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.640> fish<00:01:57.970> pond

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
concrete to the fish pond

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
concrete to the fish pond
hi<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:02.780> total<00:02:03.200> death<00:02:03.440> was<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.710> fish<00:02:04.040> pond<00:02:04.310> is

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
hi the total death was the fish pond is

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.540 
hi the total death was the fish pond is

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
know the concrete wall is about 12

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.430 
know the concrete wall is about 12
inches<00:02:26.680> thick<00:02:27.680> or<00:02:27.980> 1p<00:02:28.760> quick<00:02:29.210> as<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:30.080> can<00:02:30.140> see

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
inches thick or 1p quick as you can see

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.610 
inches thick or 1p quick as you can see
that<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:30.830> actually<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.460> waterfall<00:02:32.330> but<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.440> is

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
that is actually a waterfall but it is

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.220 
that is actually a waterfall but it is
not<00:02:33.770> hooked<00:02:34.070> up<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.240> there<00:02:35.600> is<00:02:35.720> no<00:02:35.990> water

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
not hooked up so and there is no water

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.030 
not hooked up so and there is no water
in<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.240> can<00:02:38.240> see<00:02:38.420> there's<00:02:38.630> such<00:02:38.960> a

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
in it and you can see there's such a

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.510 
in it and you can see there's such a
filtration<00:02:40.040> system<00:02:43.300> itself<00:02:44.300> is<00:02:44.630> fun<00:02:44.960> so<00:02:45.890> my

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
filtration system itself is fun so my

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.730 
filtration system itself is fun so my
dad<00:02:46.820> would<00:02:47.810> put<00:02:48.620> up<00:02:49.160> light<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:50.230> connect<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.380> to

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
dad would put up light and connect it to

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.930 
dad would put up light and connect it to
that<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:53.050> lick<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.230> wadi<00:02:54.680> go<00:02:55.130> up<00:02:55.340> into<00:02:55.580> that

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
that and lick the wadi go up into that

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.100 
that and lick the wadi go up into that
and<00:02:56.390> then<00:02:56.750> suck<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.170> up<00:02:57.820> to<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.570> is<00:02:59.870> what

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
and then suck it up to and that is what

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.720 
and then suck it up to and that is what
the<00:03:00.520> filtration<00:03:01.520> system<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.920> can<00:03:04.130> see<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
the filtration system you can see the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.130 
the filtration system you can see the
green<00:03:05.209> things<00:03:05.450> under<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.959> ice<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:08.630> cleanings

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
green things under the ice the cleanings

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.190 
green things under the ice the cleanings
are<00:03:09.350> actually<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:09.950> trance<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:11.200> grounder

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
are actually a trance that grounder

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.860 
are actually a trance that grounder
water<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:13.360> pooja<00:03:14.360> come<00:03:15.290> see

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
water and pooja come see

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.100 
water and pooja come see
that<00:03:17.440> is<00:03:17.860> not<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:19.030> some<00:03:19.510> people<00:03:19.870> might<00:03:20.049> think

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
that is not that some people might think

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.339 
that is not that some people might think
that<00:03:20.560> what<00:03:20.890> may<00:03:21.220> look<00:03:21.430> like<00:03:21.640> a<00:03:21.670> monster<00:03:22.019> but<00:03:23.019> it

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
that what may look like a monster but it

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.800 
that what may look like a monster but it
actually<00:03:23.830> gets<00:03:24.580> plants<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:27.849> plants<00:03:28.060> provide

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
actually gets plants the plants provide

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.940 
actually gets plants the plants provide
natural<00:03:29.560> food<00:03:30.340> for<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.819> fish

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.370 

the<00:03:36.950> wine<00:03:37.220> though<00:03:37.580> students<00:03:38.030> pipe<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:38.660> and

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
the wine though students pipe and and

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.940 
the wine though students pipe and and
goes<00:03:40.010> beneath<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:41.030> rocks<00:03:41.470> then<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.709> body

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
goes beneath the rocks then the body

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.910 
goes beneath the rocks then the body
goes<00:03:43.310> up<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.970> then<00:03:44.270> used<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:45.050> on<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.650> bottom

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
goes up and then used it on the bottom

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.040 
goes up and then used it on the bottom
and<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:47.750> water<00:03:47.989> is<00:03:48.170> salty<00:03:48.440> is<00:03:48.739> dirt<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.780> body

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
and the water is salty is dirt the body

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.059 
and the water is salty is dirt the body
