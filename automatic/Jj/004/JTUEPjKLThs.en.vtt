see<00:01:44.579> if<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.909> zoom<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.750> y'all<00:01:46.040> if

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
see if I can zoom in here for y'all if

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.740 
see if I can zoom in here for y'all if
my<00:01:47.850> camera<00:01:48.360> will<00:01:48.810> work<00:01:49.049> no<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.509> kind

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
my camera will work no and you can kind

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.270 
my camera will work no and you can kind
of<00:01:51.810> see<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.409> there's<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.890> layer<00:01:53.159> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
of see that there's a layer of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.580 
of see that there's a layer of
fiberglass<00:01:55.070> right<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:58.140> graphics

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
fiberglass right here and the graphics

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.380 
fiberglass right here and the graphics
actually<00:01:58.740> under<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.310> miss<00:01:59.880> ed<00:02:00.060> helps

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
actually under that miss ed helps

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.030 
actually under that miss ed helps
protect<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> graphic<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> reality<00:02:02.009> of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
protect the graphic but the reality of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.609 
protect the graphic but the reality of
the<00:02:02.189> matter<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.380> even<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.500> your

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the matter is is that even if your

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.020 
the matter is is that even if your
bottom<00:02:04.950> gets<00:02:05.100> scratched<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> look

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
bottom gets scratched it's going to look

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.459 
bottom gets scratched it's going to look
like<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.299> graphic<00:02:06.600> got<00:02:06.719> messed<00:02:06.930> up<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.320> it's

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
like the graphic got messed up so it's

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.490 
like the graphic got messed up so it's
kind<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.680> pointless<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.160> my<00:02:08.280> opinion<00:02:09.500> but

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
kind of pointless in my opinion but

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.140 
kind of pointless in my opinion but
anyway<00:02:10.800> those<00:02:10.890> are<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.129> specs<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.819> comes

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
anyway those are the specs for it comes

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.760 
anyway those are the specs for it comes

of y'all are looking for in review this
this<00:02:37.710> board<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.070> great<00:02:38.340> honestly<00:02:38.880> it's<00:02:39.000> a

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
this board is great honestly it's a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.420 
this board is great honestly it's a
great<00:02:39.270> all-around<00:02:39.450> board<00:02:39.960> but<00:02:40.290> it's<00:02:40.590> my<00:02:41.070> main

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
great all-around board but it's my main

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.830 
great all-around board but it's my main
use<00:02:41.610> for<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:42.000> actually<00:02:42.090> downhill<00:02:42.690> and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
use for it is actually downhill and

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.320 
use for it is actually downhill and
freeride<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:44.010> that's<00:02:44.280> kind<00:02:44.490> of<00:02:44.550> what<00:02:44.790> my<00:02:45.000> setup

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
freeride so that's kind of what my setup

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.600 
freeride so that's kind of what my setup
was<00:02:45.450> based<00:02:45.690> around<00:02:45.900> these<00:02:46.500> bear<00:02:46.830> tracks<00:02:47.190> these

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
was based around these bear tracks these

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.540 
was based around these bear tracks these
are<00:02:47.790> actually<00:02:48.860> they<00:02:49.860> can<00:02:49.920> be<00:02:50.130> used<00:02:50.250> for<00:02:50.310> both

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
are actually they can be used for both

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.760 
are actually they can be used for both
so<00:02:50.760> downhill<00:02:51.060> or<00:02:51.240> freeride<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.690> cruising<00:02:52.140> the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
so downhill or freeride and cruising the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.680 
so downhill or freeride and cruising the
reason<00:02:53.070> for<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.520> is<00:02:53.820> because<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.480> this

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
reason for that is is because of this

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.630 
reason for that is is because of this
you<00:02:55.170> can<00:02:55.530> see<00:02:55.710> -<00:02:55.890> oh<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.190> there's<00:02:56.370> kind<00:02:56.460> of<00:02:56.550> a

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
you can see - oh but there's kind of a

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.700 
you can see - oh but there's kind of a
curvature<00:02:57.000> on<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.390> hanger<00:02:57.690> right<00:02:57.780> there<00:02:58.050> so

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
curvature on the hanger right there so

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.870 
curvature on the hanger right there so
if<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:58.830> were<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.010> flip<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.280> around<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.730> gives

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
if you were to flip that around it gives

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.460 
if you were to flip that around it gives
you<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.000> more<00:03:00.180> stable<00:03:00.360> ride<00:03:00.630> for<00:03:00.810> Don<00:03:00.960> Howe<00:03:01.200> but

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
you a more stable ride for Don Howe but

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.750 
you a more stable ride for Don Howe but
the<00:03:01.590> way<00:03:01.710> it's<00:03:01.830> set<00:03:01.980> up<00:03:02.010> now<00:03:02.100> it's<00:03:02.460> more<00:03:02.610> for

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
the way it's set up now it's more for

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.500 
the way it's set up now it's more for
cruising<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:04.640> freeride<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:06.300> that's<00:03:06.420> the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
cruising and freeride so that's the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.670 
cruising and freeride so that's the
reason<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.780> got<00:03:06.810> these<00:03:07.170> they're<00:03:07.470> working

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
reason I got these they're working

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.320 
reason I got these they're working
really<00:03:07.800> nice<00:03:08.070> is<00:03:08.340> my<00:03:08.490> first<00:03:08.670> experience<00:03:09.210> with

my<00:03:20.910> bearing<00:03:21.240> there<00:03:21.420> but<00:03:21.630> it's<00:03:21.750> less<00:03:21.930> fun<00:03:22.170> to

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
my bearing there but it's less fun to

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.770 
my bearing there but it's less fun to
fast

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
fast

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.510 
fast
but<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.990> like<00:03:25.230> them<00:03:25.440> slide<00:03:26.010> really<00:03:26.280> nice

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
but I like them slide really nice

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.460 
but I like them slide really nice
actually<00:03:26.850> leave<00:03:27.150> little<00:03:27.360> marks<00:03:28.110> kind<00:03:28.320> of<00:03:28.380> like

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
actually leave little marks kind of like

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.840 
actually leave little marks kind of like
butter<00:03:28.650> balls<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.340> think<00:03:29.459> that's<00:03:29.700> pretty

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
butter balls so I think that's pretty

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.180 
butter balls so I think that's pretty
cool<00:03:30.120> -<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:31.200> mean<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.410> Reds<00:03:31.770> there<00:03:32.070> all

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
cool - and I mean the Reds there all

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.170 
cool - and I mean the Reds there all
right<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.640> didn't<00:03:33.300> want<00:03:33.330> to<00:03:33.510> spend<00:03:33.720> like<00:03:33.950> $30<00:03:34.950> on

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
right I didn't want to spend like $30 on

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.280 
right I didn't want to spend like $30 on
bangs<00:03:36.180> again<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:36.810> stick<00:03:37.080> with<00:03:37.200> the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
bangs again so I just stick with the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.420 
bangs again so I just stick with the
Reds<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.920> they're<00:03:38.459> doing<00:03:39.000> okay<00:03:40.040> so<00:03:41.040> I'm<00:03:41.340> going

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
you're 5 4 and under I'd go to 36 it's

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.370 
you're 5 4 and under I'd go to 36 it's
going<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.510> be<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.660> right<00:04:03.810> size<00:04:03.990> for<00:04:04.020> you

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
going to be the right size for you

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.720 
going to be the right size for you
weight<00:04:04.830> height<00:04:05.370> all<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:06.380> 5<00:04:07.380> 5<00:04:07.560> -<00:04:07.740> 5<00:04:07.890> 6<00:04:08.280> this

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
weight height all that 5 5 - 5 6 this

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.949 
weight height all that 5 5 - 5 6 this
would<00:04:08.880> be<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.120> good<00:04:09.270> length<00:04:09.390> for<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:09.690> and

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
would be the good length for you and

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.530 
would be the good length for you and
five<00:04:10.380> six<00:04:10.709> or<00:04:10.800> five<00:04:10.920> seven<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.370> over<00:04:11.670> I'd<00:04:12.270> go

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
five six or five seven and over I'd go

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.080 
five six or five seven and over I'd go
and<00:04:12.600> get<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.870> 40<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:14.100> thing<00:04:14.310> about<00:04:14.340> boards<00:04:15.000> is

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
and get the 40 the thing about boards is

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.520 
and get the 40 the thing about boards is
you<00:04:15.180> don't<00:04:15.360> want<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.570> get<00:04:15.750> one<00:04:15.959> that's<00:04:16.140> too<00:04:16.320> big

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
you don't want to get one that's too big

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.300 
you don't want to get one that's too big
because<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.980> is<00:04:17.280> harder<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.790> slide<00:04:19.160> so<00:04:20.160> that's

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
because it is harder to slide so that's

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.460 
because it is harder to slide so that's
something<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.640> take<00:04:20.700> into<00:04:20.820> consideration

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
something to take into consideration

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.960 
something to take into consideration
then<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:22.500> saw<00:04:22.710> pretty<00:04:22.770> on<00:04:23.130> this

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
then I saw pretty on this

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.090 
then I saw pretty on this
is<00:04:24.350> for<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.410> deck<00:04:26.310> it<00:04:26.580> was<00:04:26.700> just<00:04:27.140> 1:30<00:04:28.140> and

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
is for the deck it was just 1:30 and

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.160 
is for the deck it was just 1:30 and
then<00:04:29.250> for<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.550> 40<00:04:30.120> inches<00:04:30.360> it's<00:04:30.540> 140<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:33.000> then

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
then for the 40 inches it's 140 and then

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.430 
then for the 40 inches it's 140 and then
my<00:04:34.170> setup<00:04:34.470> was<00:04:34.800> around<00:04:35.190> 250<00:04:35.970> so<00:04:36.840> it's<00:04:37.320> a

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
my setup was around 250 so it's a

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.840 
my setup was around 250 so it's a
decently<00:04:37.860> priced<00:04:38.010> board<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:38.580> you're<00:04:38.670> getting

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
decently priced board but you're getting

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.130 
decently priced board but you're getting
a<00:04:38.910> lot<00:04:39.120> for<00:04:39.150> what<00:04:39.390> you<00:04:39.510> pay<00:04:39.660> for

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
a lot for what you pay for

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.960 
a lot for what you pay for
it's<00:04:40.260> totally<00:04:41.100> worth<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.280> money<00:04:41.580> every

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
it's totally worth the money every

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.760 
it's totally worth the money every
single<00:04:42.000> penny<00:04:42.360> of<00:04:42.510> it<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:42.840> I'm<00:04:43.350> liking<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.710> lot

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
single penny of it and I'm liking a lot

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.070 
single penny of it and I'm liking a lot
so<00:04:44.100> far<00:04:44.340> haven't<00:04:45.300> had<00:04:45.390> any<00:04:45.540> issues<00:04:45.690> with<00:04:45.870> it

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
so far haven't had any issues with it

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.530 
so far haven't had any issues with it
although<00:04:46.760> one<00:04:47.760> of<00:04:47.790> my<00:04:47.910> friends<00:04:48.180> who<00:04:48.240> gets<00:04:48.420> out

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
although one of my friends who gets out

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.000 
although one of my friends who gets out
this<00:04:48.660> Fork<00:04:48.900> he<00:04:49.050> said<00:04:49.260> that<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:49.470> cracks<00:04:49.740> really

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
this Fork he said that it cracks really

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.070 
this Fork he said that it cracks really
easily<00:04:50.220> he<00:04:50.520> said<00:04:50.730> he<00:04:50.790> didn't<00:04:51.000> remedy<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.330> curb

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
easily he said he didn't remedy a curb

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.580 
easily he said he didn't remedy a curb
that<00:04:52.410> hard<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:54.300> it's<00:04:54.510> actually<00:04:54.840> cracked<00:04:55.170> so

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
that hard and it's actually cracked so

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.680 
that hard and it's actually cracked so
one<00:04:56.010> thing<00:04:56.220> you<00:04:56.310> want<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.550> watch<00:04:56.940> out<00:04:57.180> for<00:04:57.210> is

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
one thing you want to watch out for is

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
one thing you want to watch out for is
the<00:04:59.060> cracks<00:05:00.060> on<00:05:00.360> it<00:05:00.480> or<00:05:01.020> cracking<00:05:01.620> it<00:05:03.470> but<00:05:04.470> yeah

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
the cracks on it or cracking it but yeah

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.350 
the cracks on it or cracking it but yeah
