00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.590

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.439
 people who want to stop making us 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.370

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.730
 exercise routine and a drink that is 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.010
 healthy that is made from 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.960
 Yogurt ice cream really that is very 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.629

 this is the drink that with this network of 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.100
 I took the complaint of an Arab restaurant 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.300
 I'm going to have a drink, I think it's 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.520
 call to Iran 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.890

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.740
 averaged subscribe the god that's what 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.470
 the best in the world how rich and I asked 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.330
 I asked the man who made the juice 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.700
 how he says juice and he told me it was with 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.770
 yogurt ice cream 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.780

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.000
 they have not hurt I'm going to show you this 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.770
 it's an exercise routine because I already 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.840
 know that not always eat what 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.030
 it was enough where we have eaten too much 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.789
 in December here in venezuela we do 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.549
 a typical thing like that of food 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:34.630
 Venezuelan that is for Christmas this is 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.689
 hallacas is made with corn flour 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.299
 which is then stuffed with meat 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.369
 olives raisins and good is one thing is 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.289
 super delicious, so I'm going 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.619
 to show what this is 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.929
 this is good comes as I am here is 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.640
 really rich here venezuelas all 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.619
 we are like in December so eating 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.049
 that every day as well as that mom that 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.579
 There is no breakfast here and then money 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.189
 in general is where you have to 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.289
 propose the diet so you do not want to but it's 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.729
 important to be me I really do not 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.340
 I can force you to do 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.349
 exercises with apple trees really goes 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.630
 to be very much missing if you're young and 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.450
 then when this one is great I also 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.549
 yes a young girl and I love eating this 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.840
 burgers and things that have enough 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.090
 fat but 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.250
 I realize that after the future 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.260
 when I have my thirty or forty years 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.330
 I'm going to have complications with the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.160
 fatty arteries and I also have to 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.950
 follow that line of doing exercise 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.750
 so be thin because equal to any 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.879
 thin you can raise your cholesterol 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.629
 but still with the heart and arteries 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:42.010
 so it's better to take care of yourself and well nothing 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.010
 let's start with the video 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.480
 and we started doing 10 squats without 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.060
 take off the feet of the floor this we 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.270
 will help tone your buttocks and 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.270
 legs 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.160
 the following exercise helps us to have 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.160
 flexibility we do 15 repetitions 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.920
 we went to the front and we grabbed 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.680
 the feet behind important to emphasize 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.480
 that the flexibility exercises 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.150
 they help the muscles stretch and 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.860
 these are protected from injuries 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.739
 next exercise is called the 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.530
 In addition to toning this 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:45.090
 posture burns fat and shapes the 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.090
 buttocks thighs and calves 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.290
 for many of this exercise is the 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.840
 hell but although it costs a bit 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.549
 doing it is helps you improve your posture 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.549
 and flexibility in your legs 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.990
 3 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.039
 but if I consist of sleeping in a 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.199
 flat and lift your back straight up 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.780
 that this helps you win the 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:48.400
 spine flexibility and 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.400
 Rest your back 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:55.379
 this exercise is to strengthen your 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.749
 abdomen if you help someone who 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:02.929
 hold your feet and you can get up 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:02.929
 easily and you can tone your abdomen 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.830
 plus 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.689
 remember that the repetition limit is 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.779
 you put it all suddenly of your rhythm of 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:17.110
 life and remember to take vitamins and lots 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.110
 Water 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.560
 3 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.650
 3 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.300
 what I'm going to do is take my ice cream from 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.670
 yogurt and I'm going to put in the blender 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.670
 without water without milk without anything 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.860
 once finished liquefying I will take 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.810
 my glass and I'm going to put jam of 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.000
 dwells in everything around then we do 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.000
 our drink we put a cigarette 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.440
 As you can see, the exercises are a little more 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.569
 complicated and of resistance but already as 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.699
 they heard this is depending on your 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:24.370
 rhythm of life I for example I do 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:27.069
 Exercise a week three times Monday 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.319
