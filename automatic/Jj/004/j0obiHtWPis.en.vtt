boxes<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:39.499> they<00:01:40.249> all<00:01:40.369> pretty<00:01:40.549> much<00:01:40.670> do<00:01:40.939> the

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:41.029 
boxes and they all pretty much do the

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:42.429 
boxes and they all pretty much do the
same<00:01:41.060> thing<00:01:41.539> but<00:01:41.689> they<00:01:41.810> are<00:01:41.929> different<00:01:42.349> in

same thing but they are different in
price<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:42.950> that's<00:01:43.009> because<00:01:43.479> they're<00:01:44.479> a

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
price and that's because they're a

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.929 
price and that's because they're a
little<00:01:44.810> bit<00:01:44.990> different<00:01:45.499> with<00:01:45.889> regards<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.700> how

1999<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:10.069> reason<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:10.759> it

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
1999 and the reason so is it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.190 
1999 and the reason so is it
kind<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.550> flimsy<00:02:11.700> okay<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.630> tell<00:02:12.810> as<00:02:13.020> soon

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
kind of flimsy okay you can tell as soon

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.420 
kind of flimsy okay you can tell as soon
as<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.350> pick<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.650> up<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.100> not<00:02:14.250> as

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
as you pick it up that it's not as

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.400 
as you pick it up that it's not as
sturdy<00:02:14.610> as<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.940> other<00:02:15.090> ones<00:02:15.270> but<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.840> gets<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
sturdy as the other ones but it gets the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.960 
sturdy as the other ones but it gets the
job<00:02:16.440> done<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.190> really<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.550> only<00:02:17.580> reason

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
job done and it's really the only reason

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.320 
job done and it's really the only reason
you<00:02:18.060> need<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.650> Aries<00:02:19.920> Peck<00:02:20.160> box<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.700> pretty

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
you need it the Aries Peck box is pretty

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.670 
you need it the Aries Peck box is pretty
different<00:02:21.600> as<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.900> can<00:02:22.020> see<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.260> already<00:02:22.410> has

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
different as you can see it already has

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.140 
different as you can see it already has
the<00:02:22.830> stickers<00:02:23.160> installed<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:23.850> it

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
the stickers installed on it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.270 
the stickers installed on it
and<00:02:24.240> it's<00:02:24.900> pretty<00:02:25.050> sturdy<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.620> it's<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.160> little

and it's pretty sturdy and it's a little

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.920 
and it's pretty sturdy and it's a little
heavier<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.819> that's<00:02:27.090> because<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.540> amount<00:02:27.750> is

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
heavier and that's because the amount is

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.600 
heavier and that's because the amount is
actually<00:02:28.200> made<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.470> metal<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.340> one<00:02:29.489> is

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
actually made of metal and this one is

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.640 
actually made of metal and this one is
operated<00:02:30.120> by<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.330> thumb<00:02:30.840> screw<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.350> don't

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
operated by a thumb screw so you don't

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.780 
operated by a thumb screw so you don't
need<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.830> tool<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.100> use<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.489> one<00:02:32.670> it's<00:02:32.730> pretty

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
need a tool to use this one it's pretty

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.640 
need a tool to use this one it's pretty
user<00:02:33.150> friendly<00:02:33.239> another<00:02:34.170> thing<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.500> makes

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
user friendly another thing that makes

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.550 
user friendly another thing that makes
this<00:02:34.830> thing<00:02:35.040> cool<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:36.150> laser<00:02:36.690> which<00:02:37.530> is

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
this thing cool is the laser which is

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.290 
this thing cool is the laser which is
built<00:02:38.040> into<00:02:38.250> right<00:02:38.520> here<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:38.970> cool<00:02:39.120> thing

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
built into right here and the cool thing

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.630 
built into right here and the cool thing
about<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.660> laser<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:41.250> doesn't<00:02:41.520> take

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
about the laser is that it doesn't take

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.160 
about the laser is that it doesn't take
up<00:02:41.730> any<00:02:41.819> space<00:02:42.150> alright<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.630> laser<00:02:42.810> stops

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
up any space alright the laser stops

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.380 
up any space alright the laser stops
right<00:02:43.350> here<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.890> leaves<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.250> entire<00:02:44.580> space

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
right here so it leaves the entire space

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.449 
right here so it leaves the entire space
of<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.810> Peck<00:02:45.989> box<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.650> be<00:02:46.800> used<00:02:47.040> for<00:02:47.160> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
of the Peck box to be used for the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.699 
of the Peck box to be used for the
battery<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:49.080> one<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.260> guess<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.560> out<00:02:49.680> of

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
battery and this one I guess is out of

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:50.150 
battery and this one I guess is out of
battery

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
battery

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.550 
battery
otherwise<00:02:50.430> I'd<00:02:50.610> show<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:52.050> final

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
otherwise I'd show you it and this final

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.259 
otherwise I'd show you it and this final
one<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.070> ICS<00:02:53.489> Peck<00:02:53.730> box<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.120> comes

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
one this is the ICS Peck box that comes

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.300 
one this is the ICS Peck box that comes
with<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:55.170> m4<00:02:55.500> pistol<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:55.950> one<00:02:56.100> kind<00:02:56.280> of

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
with the m4 pistol this one kind of

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.430 
with the m4 pistol this one kind of
stumped<00:02:56.640> me<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:57.000> while<00:02:57.630> ago<00:02:57.959> when<00:02:58.319> we<00:02:58.380> were

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
stumped me a while ago when we were

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.240 
stumped me a while ago when we were
first<00:02:58.590> trying<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:58.860> figure<00:02:59.069> out<00:02:59.100> what

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
first trying to figure out what

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.280 
first trying to figure out what
batteries<00:02:59.580> fit<00:02:59.790> inside<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.420> that's<00:03:00.930> because

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
batteries fit inside and that's because

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.020 
batteries fit inside and that's because
the<00:03:01.470> only<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.100> fits<00:03:02.250> inside<00:03:02.459> here<00:03:02.880> is

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
the only one that fits inside here is

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.140 
the only one that fits inside here is
this<00:03:03.390> intellect<00:03:03.900> 96<00:03:04.410> nunchuck<00:03:05.190> battery<00:03:05.610> all

certain way otherwise you're going to be
get<00:03:10.230> really<00:03:10.680> frustrated<00:03:11.220> trying<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.430> put<00:03:11.580> this

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
get really frustrated trying to put this

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.940 
get really frustrated trying to put this
in<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.480> battery<00:03:12.780> cells<00:03:13.050> have<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.440> be<00:03:13.530> arranged

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
in the battery cells have to be arranged

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.430 
in the battery cells have to be arranged
like<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.190> t<00:03:14.900> perpendicular<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.930> each<00:03:16.230> other

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
like a t perpendicular to each other

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.160 
like a t perpendicular to each other
like<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:17.370> order<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.610> fit<00:03:17.850> this<00:03:18.030> on<00:03:18.239> okay

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
like this in order to fit this on okay

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.440 
like this in order to fit this on okay
so<00:03:19.680> many<00:03:20.100> batteries<00:03:20.519> don't<00:03:20.760> fit<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.090> here<00:03:21.120> you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
so many batteries don't fit in here you

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.569 
so many batteries don't fit in here you
