00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.620
 so hello to all today I 'm going 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.330
 talk to you quickly about sony speaker 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.179
 srs btv 25 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.980
 so it's a whole where all that 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.349
 I received with my xperia z 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.030
 so it's virgin who sell that he has 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.730
 offered to the first 200 subscribers in fact 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.529
 and it's not the same as the one put in 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.619
 value on sony's website because she 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.029
 it is not lfc and necessarily 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.789
 power there is no battery in 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.390
 done so I talked to you a little bit so 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.949
 otherwise 113 watts are at 360 Â° world too 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.420
 well it spreads well are everywhere 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.969
 so we have a button on / off the volume the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.000
 button to activate the headset input 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.550
 dallaire the device the synchronization 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.039
 bluetooth and a button to boost 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.620
 the bass 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.129
 so normally I synchronize them 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.300
 with my xperia 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.850
 so we turn on the bluetooth to 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.960
 synchronize so I do not know the sound 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.120
 in the video what will it give 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.489
 good so he's not super strong either 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.220
 but it diffuses very well for a 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.670
 room or a small living room does so 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.670
 it's very nice 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.490
 I do not know what that gives in the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.490
 video 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.229
 m 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.229
 2 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.229
 2 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.660
 in the bass we removed the last 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:43.240
 this debate but we feel that the basics 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.840
 a little more nervous to note that the 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.620
 small penalty 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.430
 we can actually plug a cable 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:57.580
 usb to recharge a mobile so we 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:59.590
 will try to do it together sony 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.300
 so at the same time you will see the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.780
 little difficulty to hook up a 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.320
 sony xperia z device is to remove 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.810
 the caches 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.290
 So here we come back that the mobile is 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.340
 so loading so well if 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.270
 you only have one jack actually 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.350
 you can really plugged your 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.300
 mobile 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.070
 at the same time as the costs so voila 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.620
 it was when it was a small s on 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.850
 the sony and crs btv 25 which if you have 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.850
 question put in comment
