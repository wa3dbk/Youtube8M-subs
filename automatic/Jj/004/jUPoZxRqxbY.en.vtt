my hyacinth I grew it in my refrigerator
for<00:00:10.380> four<00:00:10.679> months<00:00:11.330> I<00:00:12.330> tried<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.500> force<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.950> to

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
for four months I tried to force it to

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.890 
for four months I tried to force it to
bloom<00:00:14.280> it's<00:00:14.759> actually<00:00:15.210> doing<00:00:15.420> pretty<00:00:15.660> well

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.679 

and<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> fragrance<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.590> pretty<00:00:19.949> nice<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.689> tried

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
and the fragrance is pretty nice I tried

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.509 
and the fragrance is pretty nice I tried
one<00:00:22.140> before

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
one before

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.689 
one before
a<00:00:23.720> few<00:00:24.720> months<00:00:24.990> ago<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.439> did<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> whole

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
a few months ago I did a whole

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.429 
a few months ago I did a whole
experiment<00:00:27.150> ahead<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.140> I'm<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.320> my

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
experiment ahead so I'm in my

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.870 
experiment ahead so I'm in my
refrigerator<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:29.160> four<00:00:29.340> months<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
refrigerator for four months in the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.930 
refrigerator for four months in the
other<00:00:30.260> outside<00:00:31.460> exposed<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> regular

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
other outside exposed to the regular

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.729 
other outside exposed to the regular
environment<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.110> same<00:00:34.260> amount<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.530> time

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
environment for the same amount of time

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.119 
environment for the same amount of time
and<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.670> one<00:00:35.850> outside<00:00:36.180> bloomed<00:00:36.719> first<00:00:37.320> but

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
and the one outside bloomed first but

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.780 
and the one outside bloomed first but
the<00:00:38.250> blooms<00:00:38.520> didn't<00:00:39.270> spike<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.739> did<00:00:41.010> so

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the blooms didn't spike like this did so

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.630 
the blooms didn't spike like this did so
I<00:00:41.820> guess<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> forcing<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.200> go<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
I guess the forcing it to go in the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.889 
I guess the forcing it to go in the
refrigerator<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.149> four<00:00:45.360> months<00:00:45.600> actually

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
