turntable<00:00:27.449> lists<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:27.810> um<00:00:28.099> yeah<00:00:29.099> I've<00:00:29.250> decided

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
turntable lists but um yeah I've decided

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.030 
turntable lists but um yeah I've decided
to<00:00:29.670> go<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:29.939> make<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.240> into<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> max<00:00:30.720> for<00:00:30.869> live

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
to go and make it into a max for live

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.979 
to go and make it into a max for live
device<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.790> rack<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.780> only

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
device and in a rack so that you only

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.080 
device and in a rack so that you only
have<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.190> one<00:00:35.460> channel<00:00:35.700> that's

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
have to have this on one channel that's

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.610 
have to have this on one channel that's
all<00:00:36.329> there<00:00:36.570> there's<00:00:36.809> no<00:00:36.899> tummy<00:00:37.170> clips<00:00:37.440> there's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
all there there's no tummy clips there's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.410 
all there there's no tummy clips there's
no<00:00:37.710> audio<00:00:37.980> routing<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.120> chuck<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
no audio routing you can just chuck it

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.819 
no audio routing you can just chuck it
in<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.840> play<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> sample<00:00:40.260> through<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.739> it

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
in and play a sample through it and it

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.310 
in and play a sample through it and it
will<00:00:40.980> mangle<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.969> um<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.750> way<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.960> works<00:00:43.110> is

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
will mangle it so um the way it works is

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.540 
will mangle it so um the way it works is
there's<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.739> increments<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.370> you'll

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
there's the increments here you'll

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.920 
there's the increments here you'll
notice<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.910> click<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.180> these<00:00:45.360> it'll<00:00:45.690> change

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
notice if I click on these it'll change

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.319 
notice if I click on these it'll change
the<00:00:46.170> rhythm<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.649> getting<00:00:47.340> value<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.820> then

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the rhythm of getting value and then

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.760 
the rhythm of getting value and then
there's<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.690> something<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> pitch<00:00:49.140> knob<00:00:49.379> so

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
there's just something a pitch knob so

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.930 
there's just something a pitch knob so
let's<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.610> play<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> sample<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.940> that's

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
let's just play a sample for you that's

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.369 
let's just play a sample for you that's
what<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.180> device<00:00:54.420> off<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.899> turn<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> on

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
what the device off with it turn it on

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.920 
what the device off with it turn it on
I<00:00:57.710> can<00:00:58.710> pick<00:00:58.859> these<00:00:58.980> increments<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.430> gate<00:00:59.670> it

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
I can pick these increments to gate it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:24.050 
I can pick these increments to gate it
and<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.109> move<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> pitch<00:01:01.710> around<00:01:22.610> in<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and then I move the pitch around in a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.240 
and then I move the pitch around in a
for<00:01:24.270> some<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:25.080> edit<00:01:25.320> auto<00:01:25.439> scratch<00:01:25.740> button<00:01:26.070> so

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
for some to edit auto scratch button so

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.340 
for some to edit auto scratch button so
this<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.490> randomizes<00:01:27.180> all<00:01:27.299> these<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.780> moves

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
this just randomizes all these and moves

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.899 
this just randomizes all these and moves
the<00:01:28.470> pitch<00:01:28.590> around<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.369> instant

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
the pitch around for you so instant

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:42.170 
the pitch around for you so instant
gratification<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:40.400> there's<00:01:41.400> also<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.670> chaos

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
gratification and there's also a chaos

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.999 
gratification and there's also a chaos
button<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.689> what<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.990> does<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.409> move<00:01:43.829> it

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
button and what that does is move it

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:44.749 
button and what that does is move it
really<00:01:44.430> fast

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
really fast

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.160 
really fast
sorry<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.420> bit<00:01:45.450> too<00:01:45.659> much<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.049> me

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
sorry it's a bit too much for me

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:57.730 
sorry it's a bit too much for me
sometimes<00:01:46.530> but<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.860> here<00:01:47.070> listen

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.310 

and<00:01:59.150> of<00:02:00.150> course<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:00.659> go<00:02:00.780> into<00:02:00.900> MIDI<00:02:01.140> mode

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
and of course if we go into MIDI mode

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.560 
and of course if we go into MIDI mode
you'll<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:02.460> assign<00:02:02.759> MIDI

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
you'll see that we can assign MIDI

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.510 
you'll see that we can assign MIDI
controllers<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.500> buttons<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.340> pitch

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
controllers to the buttons and the pitch

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.609 
controllers to the buttons and the pitch
in<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.540> random<00:02:06.780> stuff<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.080> feel<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.560> you

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
in the random stuff I feel like so you

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.960 
in the random stuff I feel like so you
can<00:02:07.770> actually<00:02:07.890> play<00:02:08.130> this<00:02:08.280> live<00:02:08.520> yourself

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
can actually play this live yourself

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.370 
can actually play this live yourself
using<00:02:09.149> buttons<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> slider<00:02:10.080> which<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.350> a

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
using buttons and a slider which is a

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.870 
using buttons and a slider which is a
lot<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.619> fun<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.069> I'm<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.580> finish<00:02:11.730> the

video with an example of using a MIDI
controller<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:14.850> control<00:02:15.239> this<00:02:15.330> device<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.900> lot

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
controller to control this device a lot

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.330 
controller to control this device a lot
of<00:02:16.470> fun<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.970> yeah<00:02:18.569> at<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.230> moment<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.709> for

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
of fun so yeah at the moment this is for

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
pro members of some testing phase so if

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.210 
pro members of some testing phase so if
your<00:02:22.290> app<00:02:22.380> remember<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.890> calls<00:02:23.040> them<00:02:23.100> by

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
your app remember it calls them by

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.680 
your app remember it calls them by
proteins<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.850> can<00:02:23.970> download<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.360> right

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
proteins it you can download this right
