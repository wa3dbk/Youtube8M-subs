00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:08.610
 i want to flash the dflp 56 for you today 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:14.250
 and led continuous light we introduce 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.809
 first in the packaging at the bitz 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.180
 or that becomes clear in one 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.890
 This handy bag is delivered 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.300
 nicely upholstered beautiful and small 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.789
 handy so ideally fix any packaging 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.980
 yourself the usual quick guide with 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.689
 all the information you have to 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.110
 operating the flash respectively 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.640
 the clear brown of the dlp 56 itself 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.610
 the front one looks nice that 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.329
 Do not rain the connection for the bottom 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:51.090
 Shoe on the back of the LCD display 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:53.430
 I request the same place when carrying strap 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.800
 the whole package on the way 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:03.809
 want to take along the vote fold 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.320
 if you like the villages b56 for example 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.939
 for video recordings with their dsl use 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.400
 you want to be here will be beautiful 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.890
 make directional light or it relative 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.890
 make far as motive illuminate her well 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.799
 also a small adapter who 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.070
 you can freely swing it 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:29.549
 steady light or your lightning outstanding 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:34.590
 for example, build on a tripod 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:37.650
 or shine tripod and can so the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.880
 lightning also unleashed so trigger that 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.229
 it does not benefit directly from the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.090
 Camera comes but for example of 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:48.540
 the side of the radio trigger hereby is 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.040
 It is possible via three different channels 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.810
 to direct the lightning directly 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.070
 this one has the channels integrated so 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.680
 the receiver on the bottom 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.090
 that is, they do not need a specially since 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.659
 again you can do this with lightning 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.420
 excellently via radio to control 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.230
 This winter I was on the camera 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.610
 on the 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.910
 hot shoe man bring the battery pack 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.920
 4a come in here so enormous batteries 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.570
 there is also the alternative the whole 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.160
 to operate with a battery or in the 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.130
 power supply that is not inclusive can 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.260
 but separately without problems 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:27.210
 nachgestellt the battery pack is 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.440
 simply mounted on the top and 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.350
 the lightning is now theoretical 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.030
 ready for backward activation 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.100
 we all have now is the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.210
 continuous light to that means it theoretically 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.940
 ready for immediate use 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.430
 on the back a nice 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.470
 clear display blue illuminated 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.530
 where to find the most important attitudes to 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.700
 lightning also master or slave 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.000
 or if a beep from 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.160
 should give or how strong that 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.530
 LED light should be or also 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.120
 the lightning should be controlled or 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.530
 not know one is for example for it 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.980
 as recordings otherwise need the lightning 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.800
 yes not the strength is relatively free of 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.020
 20 to 6 adjustable that means also here 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.020
 you have the necessary flexibility 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.750
 and he has a lot of power 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.220
 if you shoot video now 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:24.090
 you can just do the protection classes 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.220
 put on and even has one more 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.470
 cold light offender that is if the 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.860
 Recording internal art light 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.360
 this typical somewhat yellowish light 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.310
 every matching filter so that you can 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.890
 white balance also gets no problems 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.890
 the light can adjust accordingly 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.640
 he is thus attached to the camera 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.190
 Great for video graffy and can 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.300
 at the same time still be used around 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.860
 to take pictures 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.900
 The folk trigger has a reach 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.190
 of 30 meters that means always one 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.830
 shooting makes you go further 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.050
 A telephoto lens is gone without it 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:05.930
 problems still be possible motive 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.930
 continue to attract with a flash
