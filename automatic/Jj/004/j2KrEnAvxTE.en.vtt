00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello dear friends in front of us 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.190
 samsung galaxy tab 8 9 is a small preview 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.339
 naturally there will be a big cross 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.219
 well, we can look at the camera 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.219
 in Thessaloniki work 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.359
 here we go 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.029
 close the minimum 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.060
 after perfect on the spacious system 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.060
 Antonov 3 1 3 2 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.769
 look carefully about 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.380
 device 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.900
 1 OS 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.620
 close unfortunately there was a hair 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.900
 from a small plus 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.940
 frames per second falls as 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.910
 flipping images 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.990
 at least desktops 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.870
 I do not know that with time they saved us 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.200
 which is normal but unfortunately here is not 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.070
 gone 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.160
 hit 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.850
 but here everything is honest project they 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.850
 good moving images clearly 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.100
 it knocked a little stone incomprehensible 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.930
 why 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.350
 what else is interesting here on the press release 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.740
 camera but in general it can easily element 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.790
 walk light sensor 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.530
 video camera 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.970
 volume control 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.970
 on off 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.400
 below we have two speakers and a dock 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.570
 ram station 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.810
 and on this side there is nothing 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.320
 for the scenery and a half millimeter 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.300
 and and microphone apparently 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.240
 the screen is not bad but 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.810
 but honestly I admit 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.159
 Can not see advantage by half a meter 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.120
 was compared to 40 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.100
 ipod chapter heads for example i.e. 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.259
 I do not see him so much clarity in 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.960
 conditions when what is in the resolution of it 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.040
 this vacation is not the biggest diagonal 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.680
 what's wrong there is 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.380
 I can not remember 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.350
 but nevertheless apparently seen 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.400
 Pictures 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.720
 because on the menu foul play 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.250
 no significant difference 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.740
 maybe worth it 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.569
 need to see but the brightness and here was 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.899
 nested brightness and 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.519
 but the brightness is not bad though 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.980
 I would like a little bit brighter compared to 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.980
 ii so mmvb slightly less brightness 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.489
 subjectively UAH 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.189
 at the construction site 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.249
 here there is to dynamically mode 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.169
 standard movies cost correctly with 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.379
 standard dynamic 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.229
 image family distorted advice 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.359
 station tracks saturated 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.649
 so here we are in the room now 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:45.259
 general then 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:48.619
 to a man from there is normal 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:50.899
 we would like half a glass of polish los 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:52.739
 angeles 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.129
 that is, the brightness is not very high
