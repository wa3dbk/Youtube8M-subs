take<00:00:07.519> a<00:00:07.550> look<00:00:07.729> at<00:00:07.880> the<00:00:08.120> block<00:00:08.420> breaker<00:00:08.750> block

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
take a look at the block breaker block

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.590 
take a look at the block breaker block
from<00:00:09.440> the<00:00:09.620> minefactory<00:00:10.040> reloaded<00:00:10.390> Mart<00:00:11.390> now

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:11.600 
from the minefactory reloaded Mart now

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.750 
from the minefactory reloaded Mart now
I've<00:00:11.990> got<00:00:12.440> a<00:00:12.470> little<00:00:12.740> setup<00:00:13.040> here<00:00:13.160> with<00:00:13.610> a

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:13.760 
I've got a little setup here with a

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.400 
I've got a little setup here with a
block<00:00:14.030> breaker<00:00:14.330> which<00:00:14.600> has<00:00:14.750> been<00:00:14.960> powered<00:00:15.260> by

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
block breaker which has been powered by

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.830 
block breaker which has been powered by
a<00:00:15.440> redstone<00:00:15.980> energy<00:00:16.550> cell<00:00:16.789> now<00:00:17.420> from

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
a redstone energy cell now from

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.170 
a redstone energy cell now from
experimentation<00:00:18.770> I've<00:00:19.130> noticed<00:00:19.580> that<00:00:19.820> this

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
experimentation I've noticed that this

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.200 
experimentation I've noticed that this
block<00:00:20.510> breaker<00:00:20.780> can<00:00:21.110> hold<00:00:21.730> 7400<00:00:22.730> minecraft

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
block breaker can hold 7400 minecraft

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.870 
block breaker can hold 7400 minecraft
tools<00:00:23.449> and<00:00:23.960> it<00:00:24.110> takes<00:00:24.350> about<00:00:24.500> 96<00:00:25.310> minecraft

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
tools and it takes about 96 minecraft

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.029 
tools and it takes about 96 minecraft
tools<00:00:26.090> to<00:00:26.420> break<00:00:26.630> a<00:00:26.690> single<00:00:27.080> block<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.010> that

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
tools to break a single block so that

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.750 
tools to break a single block so that
means<00:00:28.460> it<00:00:28.640> can<00:00:28.880> break<00:00:29.119> roughly<00:00:29.630> 77<00:00:30.380> blocks<00:00:30.760> for

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
means it can break roughly 77 blocks for

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.540 
means it can break roughly 77 blocks for
a<00:00:31.789> full<00:00:32.419> charge<00:00:32.780> of<00:00:32.930> course<00:00:33.190> but<00:00:34.190> of<00:00:34.309> course

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
a full charge of course but of course

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.239 
a full charge of course but of course
I'm<00:00:35.059> currently<00:00:35.620> continuously<00:00:36.620> supplying<00:00:37.100> it

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:37.249 
I'm currently continuously supplying it

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:38.709 
I'm currently continuously supplying it
with<00:00:37.280> power<00:00:37.609> from<00:00:37.699> this<00:00:37.969> redstone<00:00:38.300> energy

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
with power from this redstone energy

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.899 
with power from this redstone energy
cell<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:39.199> until<00:00:39.739> that's<00:00:39.979> empty<00:00:40.309> it<00:00:40.489> will<00:00:40.519> keep

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:40.909 
cell so until that's empty it will keep

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.479 
cell so until that's empty it will keep
breaking<00:00:41.300> blocks<00:00:41.479> so<00:00:42.409> if<00:00:42.920> we<00:00:43.100> have<00:00:43.249> a<00:00:43.280> look

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
breaking blocks so if we have a look

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.389 
breaking blocks so if we have a look
here<00:00:43.850> it<00:00:44.389> has<00:00:44.629> an<00:00:44.780> output<00:00:44.989> face<00:00:45.440> like<00:00:45.889> a<00:00:45.920> most

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
here it has an output face like a most

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.669 
here it has an output face like a most
manufactory<00:00:47.059> rope<00:00:47.449> machines<00:00:47.809> it's<00:00:48.109> just<00:00:48.499> a

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
manufactory rope machines it's just a

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.509 
manufactory rope machines it's just a
nice<00:00:49.389> hole<00:00:50.559> apparently<00:00:51.559> in<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:51.979> middle<00:00:52.219> like

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
nice hole apparently in the middle like

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.319 
nice hole apparently in the middle like
this<00:00:52.879> sorry<00:00:53.719> I<00:00:53.809> like<00:00:54.079> some<00:00:54.709> minecraft<00:00:55.339> vanilla

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
this sorry I like some minecraft vanilla

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.199 
this sorry I like some minecraft vanilla
blocks<00:00:56.690> as<00:00:56.989> well<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:57.499> on<00:00:58.399> this<00:00:58.549> side<00:00:58.760> it<00:00:58.999> has

00:00:59.199 --> 00:00:59.209 
blocks as well and on this side it has

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:01.479 
blocks as well and on this side it has
the<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.989> actual<00:01:00.379> site<00:01:00.589> where<00:01:00.829> it<00:01:00.949> will<00:01:01.190> start

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
the the actual site where it will start

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.279 
the the actual site where it will start
breaking<00:01:01.609> block<00:01:02.030> so<00:01:02.269> this<00:01:02.479> won't<00:01:02.780> be<00:01:02.929> moving

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
breaking block so this won't be moving

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.320 
breaking block so this won't be moving
until<00:01:03.619> you<00:01:03.679> power<00:01:04.159> it<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:04.610> if<00:01:04.790> we<00:01:04.940> add<00:01:05.089> some

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
until you power it so if we add some

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.480 
until you power it so if we add some
power<00:01:05.570> here<00:01:05.900> you<00:01:06.380> notice<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:06.890> starts<00:01:07.190> moving

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
power here you notice it starts moving

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.600 
power here you notice it starts moving
and<00:01:08.060> yeah<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.170> it<00:01:09.320> will<00:01:09.500> just<00:01:09.770> break<00:01:10.040> any<00:01:10.310> block

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
and yeah so it will just break any block

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.330 
and yeah so it will just break any block
in<00:01:10.760> front<00:01:10.970> of<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:11.180> including<00:01:11.530> obsidian<00:01:12.560> which

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
in front of it including obsidian which

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.990 
in front of it including obsidian which
is<00:01:13.520> great<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.300> it<00:01:15.260> will<00:01:15.410> pass<00:01:15.740> there<00:01:16.010> here<00:01:16.820> in

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
is great and it will pass there here in

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.640 
is great and it will pass there here in
the<00:01:17.090> chest<00:01:17.390> but<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:17.630> can<00:01:17.870> also<00:01:17.990> connect<00:01:18.380> pipes

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
the chest but you can also connect pipes

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.940 
the chest but you can also connect pipes
to<00:01:18.920> that<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.250> course<00:01:19.520> now<00:01:20.510> do<00:01:21.260> keep<00:01:21.470> in<00:01:21.620> mind<00:01:21.650> if

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
to that of course now do keep in mind if

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.010 
to that of course now do keep in mind if
you<00:01:22.100> place<00:01:22.400> a<00:01:22.670> redstone<00:01:22.940> energy<00:01:23.630> cell<00:01:23.840> in

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
you place a redstone energy cell in

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.680 
you place a redstone energy cell in
front<00:01:24.260> of<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.470> here<00:01:24.800> it<00:01:24.980> will<00:01:25.510> insert<00:01:26.510> a

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
front of it here it will insert a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.010 
front of it here it will insert a
depleted<00:01:27.170> cell<00:01:27.560> into<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.240> chest<00:01:29.540> at<00:01:29.960> the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
depleted cell into the the chest at the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.400 
depleted cell into the the chest at the
back<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:31.090> don't<00:01:32.090> think<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:32.930> is<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.170> good

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
back so don't think this is a good

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.150 
back so don't think this is a good
method<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:34.130> retrieve<00:01:35.050> for<00:01:36.050> filled<00:01:36.590> up<00:01:36.740> energy

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
method to retrieve for filled up energy

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.710 
method to retrieve for filled up energy
cells<00:01:37.430> it<00:01:37.970> will<00:01:38.180> just<00:01:38.800> output<00:01:39.800> empty<00:01:40.130> cells

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
cells it will just output empty cells

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.020 
cells it will just output empty cells
okay<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:41.780> that's<00:01:42.740> basically<00:01:43.340> how<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.610> block

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
okay so that's basically how the block

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.120 
okay so that's basically how the block
works<00:01:44.420> there's<00:01:44.900> not<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.380> much<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:45.980> so

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
works there's not that much to it so

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.830 
works there's not that much to it so
let's<00:01:46.370> have<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.550> quick<00:01:46.730> look<00:01:47.000> at<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.420> crafting

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
let's have a quick look at the crafting
