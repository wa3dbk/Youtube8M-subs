00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:02.419 
hello everyone welcome to this review of

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.099 
hello everyone welcome to this review of
the<00:00:03.419> Yuke's<00:00:03.840> n'<00:00:04.279> 3x3<00:00:05.540> this<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.690> cube<00:00:06.960> that

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
the Yuke's n' 3x3 this is a cube that

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.470 
the Yuke's n' 3x3 this is a cube that
came<00:00:07.290> out<00:00:07.440> recently<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.820> really<00:00:09.210> one<00:00:09.450> of

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
came out recently and is really one of

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.299 
came out recently and is really one of
the<00:00:09.630> only<00:00:09.750> contenders<00:00:10.410> with<00:00:10.830> all<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.219> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
the only contenders with all of the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.129 
the only contenders with all of the
three<00:00:11.580> batteries<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.330> Moe<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.630> has<00:00:12.929> been

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
three batteries that Moe you has been

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.400 
three batteries that Moe you has been
releasing<00:00:13.759> it's<00:00:14.759> got<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:14.969> very<00:00:15.240> fast<00:00:15.719> yet

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
releasing it's got a very fast yet

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.890 
releasing it's got a very fast yet
smooth<00:00:16.920> tongue<00:00:17.400> there<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> slight<00:00:18.390> crispy

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
smooth tongue there is a slight crispy

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.859 
smooth tongue there is a slight crispy
feeling<00:00:19.050> when<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.470> corner<00:00:19.830> cut<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.869> overall

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
feeling when you corner cut and overall

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.859 
feeling when you corner cut and overall
pretty<00:00:22.289> nice<00:00:22.529> turning<00:00:23.039> lockups<00:00:23.970> they<00:00:24.660> don't

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
pretty nice turning lockups they don't

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.650 
pretty nice turning lockups they don't
really<00:00:25.230> happen<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:26.090> lot<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.210> people<00:00:27.480> have<00:00:27.570> been

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
really happen a lot of people have been

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.269 
really happen a lot of people have been
noting<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> corner<00:00:28.529> cutting<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.099> which

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
noting the corner cutting on this which

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.150 
noting the corner cutting on this which
is<00:00:29.519> something<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.119> note<00:00:30.300> that's<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.710> well

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
is something to note that's it's well

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.620 
is something to note that's it's well
over<00:00:32.369> 45<00:00:32.910> degrees<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.260> does<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.630> there

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
over 45 degrees and it it does it there

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.569 
over 45 degrees and it it does it there
is<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> bit<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.260> snap<00:00:37.649> when<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:37.980> do<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.340> but

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
is a bit of a snap when you do it but

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.490 
is a bit of a snap when you do it but
it's<00:00:38.760> not<00:00:39.210> enough<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.510> complain<00:00:40.320> about

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
it's not enough to complain about

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.209 
it's not enough to complain about
anything<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.250> look<00:00:41.969> that's<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.719> almost

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
anything and look that's like almost

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.150 
anything and look that's like almost
half<00:00:44.219> way<00:00:44.520> reverse<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:46.350> was<00:00:46.620> doing<00:00:46.920> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
half way reverse and it was doing it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.040 
half way reverse and it was doing it
before<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.670> obviously<00:00:48.149> now<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.809> I'm

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
before but obviously now that I'm

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.529 
before but obviously now that I'm
reviewing<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.770> will<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.370> will<00:00:50.460> lock<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.700> but

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
reviewing it it will it will lock up but

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.330 
reviewing it it will it will lock up but
again<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.590> need<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.100> solve

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
again not going to need that and a solve

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.400 
again not going to need that and a solve
what<00:00:53.610> only<00:00:53.850> matters<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.510> how<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.989> corner<00:00:55.199> cuts

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
what only matters is how it corner cuts

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.200 
what only matters is how it corner cuts
a<00:00:55.530> little<00:00:55.680> bit<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.250> does<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.699> pretty

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
a little bit and it does that pretty

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
a little bit and it does that pretty
well<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:58.739> stickers<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.579> fitted<00:01:00.000> and

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
well the stickers on this are fitted and

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.889 
well the stickers on this are fitted and
it<00:01:01.230> gives<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.010> cube<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.550> very<00:01:03.180> different<00:01:03.660> look

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
it gives the cube a very different look

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.890 
it gives the cube a very different look
from<00:01:04.489> really<00:01:05.489> most<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.270> other<00:01:06.450> three<00:01:06.750> by

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
from really most of the other three by

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.039 
from really most of the other three by
threes<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.950> does<00:01:08.189> look<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.939> Jan's<00:01:09.390> puzzle

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
threes it does look like a Jan's puzzle

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.170 
threes it does look like a Jan's puzzle
but<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.979> own<00:01:11.220> any<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.610> those<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.119> I

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
but I do not own any of those so I

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.240 
but I do not own any of those so I
cannot<00:01:12.479> say<00:01:12.540> how<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:13.049> performs<00:01:13.500> next<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> them

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
cannot say how it performs next to them

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.330 
cannot say how it performs next to them
I<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.640> say<00:01:14.909> though<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:16.020> enjoy<00:01:16.860> solving

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
I can say though that I enjoy solving

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
I can say though that I enjoy solving
this<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.939> quite<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> bit<00:01:19.070> my<00:01:20.070> sixth<00:01:20.729> solve<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
this one quite a bit my sixth solve that

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.719 
this one quite a bit my sixth solve that
I<00:01:21.390> did<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.900> cube<00:01:22.170> was<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:23.009> nine<00:01:23.369> point

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
I did on this cube was a nine point

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.390 
I did on this cube was a nine point
something<00:01:24.720> second<00:01:25.290> solve<00:01:25.560> which<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.100> pretty

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
something second solve which is pretty

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.399 
something second solve which is pretty
good<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:26.700> me<00:01:27.030> especially<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.990> brand<00:01:28.290> new

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
good for me especially on a brand new

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.130 
good for me especially on a brand new
cube<00:01:28.890> straight<00:01:29.250> out<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.610> box<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
cube straight out of the box so that

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.020 
cube straight out of the box so that
goes<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.350> show<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.040> don't<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:32.790> need

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
goes to show that you don't really need

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
goes to show that you don't really need
to<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.329> anything<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.049> but<00:01:34.650> once<00:01:34.829> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
to do anything to this but once you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.679 
to do anything to this but once you
loosen<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.820> little<00:01:36.119> bit<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.450> add<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
loosen it just a little bit and add a

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.960 
loosen it just a little bit and add a
couple<00:01:37.049> drops<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.619> lube<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.400> does<00:01:38.640> become

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
couple drops of lube it does become

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.719 
couple drops of lube it does become
pretty<00:01:39.299> fast<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.930> actually<00:01:40.619> quite<00:01:40.770> nice<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
pretty fast and actually quite nice the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.460 
pretty fast and actually quite nice the
mechanism<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.540> cube<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.049> one<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.439> I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
mechanism on this cube is one that I

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.399 
mechanism on this cube is one that I
actually<00:01:43.649> really<00:01:44.549> liked<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.119> looks<00:01:45.390> weird<00:01:45.720> but

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
actually really liked it looks weird but

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
actually really liked it looks weird but
performs<00:01:47.159> pretty<00:01:47.790> well<00:01:48.149> other<00:01:48.780> mechanisms

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
performs pretty well other mechanisms

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.100 
performs pretty well other mechanisms
that<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.860> tried<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.189> go<00:01:50.549> similar<00:01:51.119> roots<00:01:51.390> like

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
that have tried to go similar roots like

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.440 
that have tried to go similar roots like
this<00:01:52.140> haven't<00:01:53.100> been<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.790> great<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.270> have

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
this haven't been that great and have
