00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello friends welcome to the video 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.819
 presentation of verses in three sets and 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.379
 if I believe k lite before I want to clarify that 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.970
 when talking about that tour we will be 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.219
 referring to both the target and the group 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.380
 since almost during the whole series they were 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.389
 presented as a single being let's see 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.289
 first to white be your target is 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.090
 carefree 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.070
 happy and in the habit of making fun of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.289
 others their techniques are based on 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.789
 the espionage with the technique has not really 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.590
 proven to be able to function 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.750
 be with the earth and flora to be able 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.099
 travel great distances can also 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.570
 record everything you see and then 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.180
 project it although it is not your specialty 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.829
 in battle he has shown control 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.170
 of the wood element but on a scale 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.910
 minor this same applies to your domain 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.280
 about the elements that form it 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.530
 they are land and water, although in the latter 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.270
 it is unknown what techniques a 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.770
 very useful skill of this center is the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.030
 to be able to create spores that 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.340
 deposit in the body of your opponent 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.649
 without him noticing it later 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.390
 immobilize it this technique was used 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.949
 in the meeting of the streets which 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.510
 they proved able to escape from it 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.770
 different ways either 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.199
 transforming them into stone or 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.789
 disintegrating the acquaintances of their target 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.100
 he also proved able to create several 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.720
 copies of himself although they are much more 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.760
 weak that the original 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.580
 he could act jointly with 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.380
 them communicating telepathically 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.060
 now let's see black sex this 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.040
 character is more serious and cold than the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.380
 white sex and in fact it is much more 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.030
 smart black sex shares the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.770
 same white sex skills to 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.870
 exception of the spore technique and the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.280
 cloning but instead has the 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.170
 ability to fuse with the body 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.570
 of the opponent who is difficult 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.700
 break free as it absorbs at the same time 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.860
 its chaca weakening it this technique is 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.660
 somewhat risky since if the enemy still 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.340
 is not strong enough this one 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.770
 could take control of the same sex 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.450
 already jointly both sexes are 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.790
 able to fight as one and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.619
 split into two parts plus both have 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.660
 proven to be able to survive 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.180
 be cut however this has 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.460
 managed to immobilize let's see now like this 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.920
 crocodile created tail and ate the fruits 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.900
 a cloud of typology 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.700
 he became a man of sand this 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.860
 gave the ability to be intangible to 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.050
 any damage and that's why none 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.490
 conventional weapon works against him the 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.900
 Most of their techniques are based on 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.670
 cuts and extraction of water from the body 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.280
 of his opponents going back to the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.260
 practically dust on many occasions 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.140
 now let's review a more familiar attacks 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.939
 bryant this technique allows you to create a 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.310
 sand dune which leaves a trail of 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.019
 dust behind it and everything that touches that 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.810
 trail leaves it dry due to the 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.400
 moisture extraction capacity 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.780
 desert enclosure this skill will 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.849
 allow I think that by extracting water from 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.170
 everything he touched showed her against 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.390
 several opponents in the arab room 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.790
 until I also use to return powder the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.319
 prison doors of imphal don 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.909
 sunflower of the desert with this technique 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.709
 actor with him creates a giant hole in 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.079
 the ground that catches your opponent like 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.120
 if they were quicksand 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:47.519
 immobilizing him and drowning the sword of 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.049
 desert with this trick technique of creating 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.150
 a sand sword which extends 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.470
 all over the earth making him advance 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.069
 cutting everything that is put in its 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.680
 trajectory 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.450
 tierraseca this technique allows you to create 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.069
 coral by just touching the ground drain 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.079
 all your water transforming it into a 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.629
 desert to thus put the field of 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.909
 battle to your advantage dead earth this 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.500
 technique is similar to dry land without 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.180
 But the difference is that besides 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.920
 extract water from the ground too 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.639
 extracts water from any living being that is 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.900
 under or over it killing him instantly 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.120
 turning it into dust this includes 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.960
 plants people animals and even 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.970
 buildings and rocks 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.530
 this technique allows you I think I can create 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.360
 a sandstorm that forms a 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.580
 tornado that depending on its strength commands 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.740
 to fly your opponents saber is heavy 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.450
 this technique is to create a 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.460
 tornado destroyer that generates a wave 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.140
 of shock of great impact other 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.060
 Troop skills observed are 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.470
 the following has shown power 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.390
 turn your body into a storm of 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.010
 circular sand that covers its surroundings 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.600
 drawing water from all those who are 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.250
 achieved by this can also 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.650
 move become sand by air 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.050
 and under the ground and even under the ice 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.670
 his secondary weapon is a grapple which 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.190
 possesses a poison so powerful as to 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.410
 melt the rock and in case it breaks under 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.700
 this hides a blade despite 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.590
 that can not be a user of 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.840
 Typology is invulnerable to almost everything 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.580
 type of attack if you get to wet this one 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.960
 loses its intangibility however if 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.000
 is prevented in the series showed 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.710
 be able to evade water attacks by absorbing 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.720
 directly in the air so the 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.580
 best option to fight it seems to be 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.380
 wet the object or part of the body 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.420
 with which you think to attack good 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.160
 friends open the polls if you think 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.350
 that the winner of this duel deserves to be 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.720
 sex writes set his followed by your 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.580
 arguments why would win but as 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.889
 if you think the winner deserves to be 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.139
 crocodile writes crocodile 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.460
 of your arguments so you can see 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.270
 the techniques that I mentioned earlier 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.159
 of each character 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.990
 I left it down in description two 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:36.610
 Video links where you can see them 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.139
 in action if you liked the video you
