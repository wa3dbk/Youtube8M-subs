00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.790
 Hi dare friends 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.590
 we'll show you today with what clots like the string and sure at one 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.689
 can fix 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:10.549
 either 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.959
 a burden 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.009
 or 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.869
 one more day 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.369
 yes the whole thing 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.369
 larger dimensions and it can be seen more clearly 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.759
 and we want to show you today the winner knot of SsangYong 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:26.689
 coming 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.689
 the name of the grinning node is called why 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.690
 The famous English ranger the Croats Richert loose 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.690
 has this knot his five year old son of my strength 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.300
 because that was a sense of achievement for his son that they had this 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.700
 So every time he finished, knots could be limited 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.680
 and since then this gravedigger is called the founder of the grinning Kloten 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.610
 we plug the cord end by listening 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.660
 about 20 centimeters 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.030
 put the cord 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.490
 parallel 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.690
 to the secondary school 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.690
 do not just put the course in a loop 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.780
 and started 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.490
 the short end 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.470
 four times 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.940
 because of the snow over the loop and 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.940
 the long dormant one 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.710
 we hold both strings tight 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.860
 and 7 the loop 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.150
 together 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.130
 because the loop has contracted 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.130
 before I get this whole thing 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.820
 the frictional heat 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.690
 not to arise 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.500
 and sin in Kloten 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.630
 clean 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.740
 would be different 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.780
 and now 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.650
 put on the whole thing firmly 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.650
 the knot is ready 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.170
 the short end 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.990
 quickly noticeable 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.210
 the knot is ready
