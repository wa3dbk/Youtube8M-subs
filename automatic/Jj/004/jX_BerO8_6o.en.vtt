a bit we even get an extra four missiles
included<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.170> case<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:03.470> get<00:03:03.620> carried

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
included just in case you get carried

you've ever played with an RC car before

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.370 
you've ever played with an RC car before
it<00:03:58.700> should<00:03:59.090> be<00:03:59.210> easy<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.540> figure<00:03:59.780> out<00:03:59.900> how<00:04:00.200> this

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
it should be easy to figure out how this

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.950 
it should be easy to figure out how this
works<00:04:00.680> but<00:04:01.610> just<00:04:01.640> in<00:04:01.970> case<00:04:02.000> an<00:04:02.450> instruction

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
works but just in case an instruction

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.800 
works but just in case an instruction
sheet<00:04:02.990> is<00:04:03.350> included<00:04:04.390> each<00:04:05.390> of<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.690> two

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
sheet is included each of the two

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.230 
sheet is included each of the two
joysticks<00:04:06.320> controls<00:04:06.740> one<00:04:07.040> of<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.310> wheels<00:04:07.520> so

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
joysticks controls one of the wheels so

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.730 
joysticks controls one of the wheels so
pushing<00:04:08.480> both<00:04:08.810> forward<00:04:09.170> moves<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.560> droid

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
pushing both forward moves the droid

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.220 
pushing both forward moves the droid
forward<00:04:10.220> pushing<00:04:11.060> them<00:04:11.210> both<00:04:11.390> back<00:04:11.690> it<00:04:12.050> makes

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
forward pushing them both back it makes

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.230 
forward pushing them both back it makes
them<00:04:12.350> go<00:04:12.380> in<00:04:12.500> reverse<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:13.220> then<00:04:13.880> you<00:04:13.970> can<00:04:14.120> turn

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
them go in reverse and then you can turn

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.580 
them go in reverse and then you can turn
in<00:04:14.360> either<00:04:14.570> direction<00:04:14.750> by<00:04:15.080> pushing<00:04:15.350> one

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
in either direction by pushing one

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.150 
in either direction by pushing one
joystick<00:04:16.040> up<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:16.459> one<00:04:16.670> joystick<00:04:17.090> down

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.370 

overall<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.430> thing<00:04:22.640> works<00:04:22.910> pretty<00:04:23.150> great<00:04:23.510> it

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
overall the thing works pretty great it

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.470 
overall the thing works pretty great it
is<00:04:24.560> quite<00:04:24.920> sensitive<00:04:25.430> so<00:04:25.760> it<00:04:25.910> takes<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.270> little

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
is quite sensitive so it takes a little

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.390 
is quite sensitive so it takes a little
bit<00:04:26.780> of<00:04:26.870> practice<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.410> get<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.650> just<00:04:27.800> right<00:04:27.950> and

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
bit of practice to get it just right and

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.700 
bit of practice to get it just right and
he<00:04:29.060> does<00:04:29.270> seem<00:04:29.510> to<00:04:29.540> pull<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.020> left<00:04:30.200> just<00:04:30.530> to

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
he does seem to pull to the left just to

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.890 
he does seem to pull to the left just to
pit<00:04:30.919> so<00:04:31.190> it's<00:04:31.340> not<00:04:31.550> exactly<00:04:32.090> easy<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.510> always

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
pit so it's not exactly easy to always

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.100 
pit so it's not exactly easy to always
go<00:04:33.110> in<00:04:33.260> a<00:04:33.350> straight<00:04:33.380> line<00:04:34.150> but<00:04:35.150> man<00:04:35.480> does<00:04:35.930> this

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
go in a straight line but man does this

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.740 
go in a straight line but man does this
thing<00:04:36.350> turn<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:37.160> well<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.910> check<00:04:38.570> out<00:04:38.720> that

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
thing turn so well and check out that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.370 
thing turn so well and check out that

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
seems he'd do quite well on some rougher

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.650 
seems he'd do quite well on some rougher
terrain

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
holding that button on the top will fire

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.400 
holding that button on the top will fire
the<00:04:54.310> missiles<00:04:54.699> they<00:04:55.360> fire<00:04:55.660> in<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:55.870> rotation

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
the missiles they fire in a rotation

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.439 
the missiles they fire in a rotation
shooting<00:04:56.800> three<00:04:57.190> missiles<00:04:57.610> at<00:04:57.760> a<00:04:57.790> time<00:04:58.090> and

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
shooting three missiles at a time and

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:04.710 
shooting three missiles at a time and
they<00:04:59.020> get<00:04:59.290> quite<00:04:59.650> good<00:04:59.919> distance<00:05:03.479> and<00:05:04.479> by<00:05:04.660> the

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
they get quite good distance and by the

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.740 
they get quite good distance and by the
way<00:05:04.960> I<00:05:05.199> had<00:05:05.770> way<00:05:06.340> too<00:05:06.400> much<00:05:06.850> fun<00:05:06.910> chasing<00:05:07.600> and

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
way I had way too much fun chasing and

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.500 
way I had way too much fun chasing and
shooting<00:05:07.780> my<00:05:08.199> dog<00:05:08.410> with<00:05:08.680> this<00:05:08.830> thing

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
shooting my dog with this thing

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:22.409 
shooting my dog with this thing
seriously<00:05:10.510> it<00:05:10.690> was<00:05:11.110> a<00:05:11.139> total<00:05:11.530> blast<00:05:21.419> the

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
seriously it was a total blast the

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.779 
seriously it was a total blast the
Hellfire<00:05:22.900> droid<00:05:23.260> retails<00:05:23.830> for<00:05:23.949> about<00:05:24.160> sixty

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
Hellfire droid retails for about sixty

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.129 
Hellfire droid retails for about sixty
$9.99<00:05:25.690> so<00:05:26.139> it<00:05:26.289> is<00:05:26.620> a<00:05:26.650> bit<00:05:26.949> on<00:05:27.130> the<00:05:27.160> pricey<00:05:27.580> side

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
$9.99 so it is a bit on the pricey side

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.570 
$9.99 so it is a bit on the pricey side
however<00:05:29.139> there<00:05:29.440> is<00:05:29.530> no<00:05:29.770> question<00:05:30.280> that<00:05:30.400> this

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
however there is no question that this

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.719 
however there is no question that this
thing<00:05:30.850> is<00:05:31.090> a<00:05:31.360> lot<00:05:31.750> of<00:05:31.930> fun<00:05:32.280> it's<00:05:33.280> been<00:05:33.460> a<00:05:33.490> long

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
thing is a lot of fun it's been a long

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.370 
thing is a lot of fun it's been a long
time<00:05:33.970> since<00:05:34.210> I've<00:05:34.330> played<00:05:34.449> around<00:05:34.750> with<00:05:34.930> an<00:05:35.050> RC

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
time since I've played around with an RC

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.230 
time since I've played around with an RC
car<00:05:35.410> so<00:05:35.919> maybe<00:05:36.160> that<00:05:36.400> helped<00:05:36.639> in<00:05:36.760> my<00:05:36.880> enjoyment

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
car so maybe that helped in my enjoyment

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.290 
car so maybe that helped in my enjoyment
but<00:05:37.930> I<00:05:37.960> honestly<00:05:38.199> got<00:05:38.979> a<00:05:39.160> lot<00:05:39.490> of<00:05:39.699> fun<00:05:40.000> out<00:05:40.270> of

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
but I honestly got a lot of fun out of

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.270 
but I honestly got a lot of fun out of
playing<00:05:40.660> with<00:05:40.870> this<00:05:41.050> thing<00:05:41.110> so<00:05:41.560> I<00:05:41.830> can<00:05:41.919> imagine

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
playing with this thing so I can imagine

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.060 
playing with this thing so I can imagine
that<00:05:42.610> any<00:05:42.850> kid<00:05:43.180> would<00:05:43.720> absolutely<00:05:44.110> love<00:05:44.680> it<00:05:44.889> it

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
that any kid would absolutely love it it

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.010 
that any kid would absolutely love it it
seems<00:05:45.910> like<00:05:46.000> they<00:05:46.300> would<00:05:46.479> definitely<00:05:46.660> be<00:05:46.990> the

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
seems like they would definitely be the

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.340 
seems like they would definitely be the
target<00:05:47.470> audience<00:05:47.830> for<00:05:47.889> this<00:05:48.039> one<00:05:49.199> until<00:05:50.199> next

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
target audience for this one until next
