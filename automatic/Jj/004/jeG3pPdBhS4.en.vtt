suspension for better ride last year but

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.340 
suspension for better ride last year but
I<00:01:49.850> suspect<00:01:50.330> there<00:01:50.540> have<00:01:50.660> been<00:01:50.900> additional

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
I suspect there have been additional

adjustments to based on feedback
now<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.659> right<00:01:55.929> does<00:01:56.259> feel<00:01:56.499> better<00:01:56.710> whether

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
now the right does feel better whether

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.700 
now the right does feel better whether
you're<00:01:57.280> at<00:01:57.429> low<00:01:57.640> speeds<00:01:58.030> or<00:01:58.450> at<00:01:58.659> cruising<00:01:59.140> it's

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
you're at low speeds or at cruising it's

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.709 
you're at low speeds or at cruising it's
only<00:01:59.950> when<00:02:00.189> you<00:02:00.280> crash<00:02:00.609> through<00:02:00.939> a<00:02:00.969> bump<00:02:01.420> a

larger one at higher speeds like that

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.959 
larger one at higher speeds like that
did<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.289> reminded<00:02:05.890> of<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.159> stiffer<00:02:06.549> setup

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
did you reminded of the stiffer setup

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.270 
did you reminded of the stiffer setup
however<00:02:07.689> there's<00:02:07.990> an<00:02:08.080> added<00:02:08.560> line<00:02:08.830> see<00:02:09.129> now

however there's an added line see now
that<00:02:09.459> just<00:02:09.640> seems<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:10.030> take<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.360> edge<00:02:10.599> off<00:02:10.869> all

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
that just seems to take the edge off all
