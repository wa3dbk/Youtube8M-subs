00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 cd such talks guys came in and 36 more 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.869
 this time we're just going to talk about 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.960
 good upgrade as you should already know 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.630
 was released the third snic by the super 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.400
 sky team speaks of factories 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.109
 rain fetish especially in the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.939
 poison spell 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.399
 along with this poison fetish 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.649
 there were also some changes in the light in 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.750
 system of spell factories 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.410
 Good now you have an ability to 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.540
 do 11 spells and accomplish this you have to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.030
 there are some changes, it 's good too, you 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.219
 normal elixir spells go to 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.890
 two spaces and phishing sites 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.500
 black were 1 I believe that in this 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.510
 update at least 31 2 t 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.860
 shirt I do not think I'll be alone 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.199
 a bundle of poison 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.239
 unless it is super selman of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.340
 gradually for example this same 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.589
 send one less and another send another and 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.970
 another from the other because that 's how they 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.580
 have been able to test on having 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.439
 best staff is playing think 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.299
 it would even be clever of him 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.780
 so do not be surprised cause you win 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.159
 divine soft I think probably 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.320
 other spells would be cast 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.240
 will gradually give a 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.310
 bit of this kind of poison or he is 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.830
 very useful but no one determined 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.409
 situations for example when in the castle 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.220
 of Clans and Troops with Berry Witches 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.200
 barbarians akira nishino people troops 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.970
 typical that the staff leaves a lot and I 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.000
 I think that's what the people are going to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.770
 used to leave more dragon lounges 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.110
 your troops who deal more damage than they are 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.500
 much stronger because how can you 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.450
 see there they can not detonate 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.000
 dragon at least very costly 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.340
 example you would not use 10 5 records 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.479
 poison to kill a dragon 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.369
 just not 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.170
 Another thing that's cool is people's point. 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.070
 that they accumulate different from other 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.020
 services 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.939
 well then this done that too 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.070
 works with heroes is not just with the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.530
 troops but it did not work but much 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.319
 can you see on the screen 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.810
 is being used against inflatable 1 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.909
 And it's not killing so forget that you 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.010
 will not use it to kill heroes in the 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.319
 your attack at least does not have to 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.629
 You do this they are not good like that 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.030
 against strong troops dragons is 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.489
 drug and valkyrie forget you not 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.349
 will not be able to use so it's not a 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.719
 possibility then you can even try 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.400
 but will spend a lot of spell good people 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.980
 so basically I hope you 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.139
 You liked it there and if you did not leave me 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.269
 and opinion of you is the feedback in 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.040
 comments and if you liked barbecue it is 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.959
 Delicious you did not like the skewer of 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.609
 barbecue is not liked because so 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.680
 we will have a sense of how it is 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.750
 Super sky is bringing me motorizations. 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.099
 I really liked it so let's go then 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.139
 with the opinion of you people will decide 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.909
 the people will see are updated is 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.959
 being good or not so I was not I will 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.639
 staying here I hope you have 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.560
 liked to leave there and also write the 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:02.659
 itself is not registered then the people 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.659
 said I went to the next video I went
