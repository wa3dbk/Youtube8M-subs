00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.769
 so the first paulo speaks of the love of 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.769
 God who was something a Jew 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.289
 also waited for the Messianic kingdom 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.230
 He speaks of the love of God as something 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.420
 that God here now already pours into our 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.400
 heart by the Holy Spirit through 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.970
 a process that is a process of 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.710
 suffering not only that 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.170
 or not only do we boast in the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.750
 hope of the glory of kingdom god and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:45.780
 lennar when all is well but also 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:47.820
 we rejoice in tribulations and in 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.489
 An example, you have a beautiful son. 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.260
 Pretty clever wonderful that 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.199
 pass the entrance exam 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.030
 beyond joy when she speaks of lenia 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:03.000
 mouth globe on your son speaks well of him 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.530
 is pleased to speak and extol your 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.840
 qualities and so that is one thing 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.340
 that gives joy and mobile 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.979
 glory to your son then look like 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.920
 You speak well of something to the Pac. 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.110
 it's a paulo thing previous version said 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.630
 we do so with respect to 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.850
 glory of god that is our hope 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.080
 but now in verse 3 he said that we 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.080
 we rejoice in tribulations 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.430
 the last thing I want to do is 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.280
 do when not going through a 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.090
 court without glory of my window 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.439
 It's up to being sad to claim to know 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.520
 and ask God what is 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:53.579
 happening because I just happen to me 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:58.680
 these things glory in the tribulations of 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.659
 various types of diseases and loss of 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.210
 loved one in the difficult situation of the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.850
 work in family relationship 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.909
 neighbor 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.130
 thing we call the crew and 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.830
 what occurs to us what Paul is saying 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.720
 here is that which was justified 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.209
 by faith in jesus christ 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.480
 He has peace with God, they glory not. 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.459
 only in the future manifestation of glory 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:29.090
 of God in that realm that is listening 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:31.580
 but he himself also in the tribulations glory 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.739
 in the future kingdom and the suffering of the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:42.410
 present in the actions 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:47.090
 I have 3 because we know that 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.459
 tribulation produces perseverance 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.190
 ability to continue to believe in God 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:57.410
 when everything goes wrong because you believe in 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.750
 God with everything okay but you continue 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.930
 big when you lose your health standby 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.799
 job loses an old loved one 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.799
 friendship 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.430
 corinthians lose come out for me it's easy 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.989
 You continue to profess faith in God. 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:27.440
 follow the Lord, obey Him in the 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.299
 most adverse circumstances and cons 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.329
 this is something that we learn the 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.989
 day of the other has something that has 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:39.079
 to be learned in the school of life 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:43.730
 suffering saying you're following me 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:46.100
 why because they believe because by 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.280
 because of the beauty because of promises 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.010
 what you really know is a sinner 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.709
 saved by the grace that follows me because 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.220
 loves and gratefully takes away everything you 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:06.560
 has 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:08.660
 I want to continue here the young man followed the 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.640
 that you believe 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.750
 and that is why trials come 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.350
 because they teach us persevere and 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.350
 perseverance 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.900
 experience 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.080
 experienced mature believers are 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.789
 forged in the commission furnace does not 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.650
 another way for you to become a great 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.410
 you can read many books 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.389
 want of a father for fired a house 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.590
 You can watch the videos of them. 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.330
 do seminars you can see the school 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.210
 All these things are bad from the market. 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.940
 they are wonderful but there is nothing going on 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.030
 replace the day-to-day experience 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.430
 you face on a day to day 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.470
 suffering of this world as a believer 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.259
 day-to-day to apply the principles of 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.810
 God's word 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:06.320
 experienced is no use wanting to pass the 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:06.320
 novice has no experience 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:18.650
 this is something that takes advantage and 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:18.650
 finally hope not to confuse 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.110
 experience to produce hope because 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.880
 that the believer the more he spent with 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.760
 the suffering in this life 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.190
 and he saw that he did not abandon the 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.650
 God and God did not abandon it fills up 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.060
 sure that these promises of the 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.060
 of the kingdom of God 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.669
 they are sure why the 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.949
 experience will produce hope 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.009
 hope of the kingdom of God 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.560
 God's kingdom 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:52.560
 the trials take not only the things 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:57.090
 of this world and make us want 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.639
 the kingdom promised to correct the 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.289
 tribulations end up producing hope 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.550
 and finally won five that hope 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:07.050
 do not confuse it is right because any 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.389
 certified by the Holy Spirit in our 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.240
 heart to hope do not confuse with what 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:14.130
 The love of God is poured out on our 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.830
 by the holy spirit that was 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:24.120
 thank god gave us his spirit not 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:27.150
 only help us to change sin 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.180
 here and perseveres but also for us 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:33.449
 persuade and convince us 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.520
 But God's love, this experience is 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.949
 an extraordinary experience that paulo 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.949
 is talking about an experience the 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:42.270
 here is the thirst of our heart. 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:46.259

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.039
 if anything God does it us 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.830
 convinces 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:02.280
 he speaks to our heart and whispers to him 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:09.360
 our ear that he loves us despite 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:12.690
 of all that we are going through is 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:16.289
 the difference between you and the one who is not 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:19.320
 because in the midst of the pain of suffering 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:22.650
 terminal separation and fusion disease 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:26.759
 in the middle the voice of God whispers in the 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:30.650
 Our hearts, I love you, these things do not 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:30.650
 They mean I love you.
