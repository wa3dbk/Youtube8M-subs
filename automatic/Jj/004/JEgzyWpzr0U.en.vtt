00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:15.599
 the most experienced journey the veil 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.850
 music of joy ngozi this on wii that is 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.000
 Anp languages in FÃ¡bio in the Uruguayan goal 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.000
 the country 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.840
 involves not ceasing to gain prominence 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.160
 since the first demonstration in e3 of 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.370
 2014 when he received the best 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.550
 game of the event with the promise of being a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.559
 of the biggest titles of 2015 the game gives you 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.780
 the option of playing as hunters who 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.480
 must prevent the imminent threat of life 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.760
 wild planet or else as the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.589
 own monster whose sole purpose is to 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.010
 destroy any trace of 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:58.229
 chinese civilization han planet and we 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.900
 pinto with unfriendly fauna and flora 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:03.210
 for the fragile human conditions 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.489
 everything went well with the colonization of rake 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.690
 until the appearance of the greatest monsters of the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.820
 planet 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.770
 at that moment the best 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.990
 universe were called to save the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.450
 colony or else rescue whoever is left 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.400
 debris 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.930
 the developer behind the title is 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.409
 have rock studios 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.280
 the same person responsible for left coded 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.470
 involves following the standards to 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.649
 developer focusing on multiplayer and 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.420
 in teamwork but each player 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.670
 owns a distinguished paper grade 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.159
 which should perform its function in the hour 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.530
 right to contribute to victory 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.689
 this is the main element of the game and the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.450
 greater characteristic to distinguish the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.429
 title of other games of the rock torture 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.649
 The addition of class history involves 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.020
 much more dynamic because the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.749
 multiplayer games killer does not have 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.819
 space in the game mechanic forcing the 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:56.039
 characters to carry out their missions 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.319
 correctly to succeed 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.850
 the gameplay works great when 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.069
 Do you have a group of friends to meet you? 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.109
 keep track of the hunt since everyone is 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.679
 united under the same strategy 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.869
 there are four roles to take on the 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.390
 assault the team's strongest man 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.350
 support the face that will guarantee several 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.460
 benefits to the group as invisibility 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.830
 trap one of the most 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.720
 of the game responsible for 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.540
 Hold a monster on power Sunday 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.100
 and finally a doctor who can cure 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.500
 the allies 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.900
 every class has three characters with 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.840
 different skills that are released 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.060
 in the course of gambling 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.920
 in return a monster a wolf 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.440
 solitary battle attacking the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.480
 hunters who distance themselves from the group or 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.450
 feeding on the local fauna to stay 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.700
 stronger and evolve food guarantees 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.730
 amateur and experience points but not 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.410
 recovers life throughout the hunt is 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.810
 possible to evolve up to two 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.629
 ensuring improvement and new 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.340
 abilities to the monster in more 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.950
 process takes time and leaves you 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.910
 vulnerable for a few seconds creating 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.099
 a very good opportunity the hunters 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.110
 by reaching the last level a monster 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.750
 must destroy a power relay to 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.730
 win the match or else kill all 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:19.640
 hunters at once involves 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.040
 end graphics created in the clean and 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.840
 graphical engine and many 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.700
 other games that are references to 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.950
 quality visuals 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.690
 the visual combined with the effects 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.849
 sound quality creates an environment 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.849
 much to see if seen during the hunt 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.280
 there is no narrative campaign 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.560
 involved but to the evacuation mode the 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.260
 context here is that colonization failed 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.329
 due to the hostility of Che then the 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.730
 hunters are sent with the aim of 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.160
 save the largest number of people in 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.720
 five days remaining for the last ship 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.299
 leave the planet 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.700
 each day is represented by a match 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.040
 that varies between the rescue and nest modes 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.720
 hunt that can never be repeated 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.060
 twice in a row 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.250
 much of the fun of the game is 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.620
 concentrated here because there are 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.389
 for the winner of each round by 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.430
 example if hunters fail to 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:15.650
 first day the technology responsible 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.560
 to avoid major damage to a large 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.019
 storm will not work and the scenario 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.090
 will be flooded giving life to plants 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.400
 carnivores that act as traps 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.740
 for humans 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.660
 despite the more than 800 thousand variations of 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.669
 gameplay guaranteed of rock plateaus 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.710
 studio and involves demonstrating your 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.900
 first signs of repetition after 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.250
 some hours because of the structure of 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.380
 game 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.469
 in the mode most played online 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.390
 You always repeat the same things with 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.590
 few strategies to achieve the 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.180
 victory 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.630
 sometimes the persecution of a 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.060
 strange lasts more than 15 minutes or 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.640
 an endless boredom 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.920
 it is easy to observe the imbalance of 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.230
 game because the hunters are much more 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.980
 slow during search and more 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.020
 weak during battle in the other 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.850
 extreme when a closed team knows 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.490
 play their role well 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.530
 the other comes at a disadvantage for the most part 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.110
 of the time for not being able to choose the field 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.150
 ideal battle 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.550
 this kind of thing becomes less obvious 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.290
 in ransom and little boy when the game is 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.030
 if an early meeting between the 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.430
 enemies 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.380
 but rarely do you find players 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.460
 to have fun in these games 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.840
 exclusive to evacuation mode 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.990
 the campaign mode was one of the elements 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.900
 more fun and left by 10 and went 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.000
 here is a narrative 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.070
 that simple ensures a feeling of 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.380
 progression in conquest 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.900
 It is a pity that there is a canteen and 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.150
 to enter the evacuation mode and 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.760
 nothing is reused in the 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.740
 plot 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.680
 Another point that bothered her a lot was the 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.180
 inability to choose the class 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.580
 desired whether Hunter 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.690
 the monster although there is a ranking 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.730
 preferences 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:08.020
 we often play with the character 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.020
 least desired 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.990
 in the end it involves presents 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.280
 a great idea but it does not work as well 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.530
 as well as other games 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.330
 cooperatives since if a class 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.030
 failed to perform their function 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.270
 the whole group has enormous chances of 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.070
 lose even left handed himself 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.720
 borderlands uses a concept of 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.240
 teamwork in a very 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.180
 fairer and more rewarding 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.070
 although it is fun in situations 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.280
 some of the brightness is lost in the 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.480
 protracted persecution in the 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.310
 imbalance and exploitation of 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.110
 propellers paid to extend the 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.930
 title diversity 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.280
 this one was another video analysis of the 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.720
 DOWNLOAD GAMES 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.610
 I really hope you liked it. 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.610
 and until the next video
