00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
and a woodworking friends we're going to

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.350 
and a woodworking friends we're going to
show<00:00:08.770> you<00:00:08.799> how<00:00:09.070> to<00:00:09.129> rip<00:00:09.400> wood<00:00:09.610> on<00:00:09.879> the<00:00:10.000> table

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
show you how to rip wood on the table

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.440 
show you how to rip wood on the table
saw<00:00:10.540> in<00:00:10.690> the<00:00:10.809> safest<00:00:11.170> manner<00:00:11.410> possible

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
saw in the safest manner possible

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.640 
saw in the safest manner possible
first<00:00:13.450> I'll<00:00:13.630> compare<00:00:13.929> are<00:00:14.019> three<00:00:14.230> types<00:00:14.469> of

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
first I'll compare are three types of

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.990 
first I'll compare are three types of
common<00:00:14.980> push<00:00:15.190> sticks<00:00:15.490> and<00:00:15.700> see<00:00:15.880> the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
common push sticks and see the

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.240 
common push sticks and see the
advantages<00:00:16.599> and<00:00:16.710> disadvantages<00:00:17.710> of<00:00:17.830> each<00:00:17.950> one

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
advantages and disadvantages of each one

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.970 
advantages and disadvantages of each one
and<00:00:19.180> then<00:00:19.420> demonstrates<00:00:20.050> which<00:00:20.289> type<00:00:20.590> of<00:00:20.800> push

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
and then demonstrates which type of push

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.320 
and then demonstrates which type of push
stick<00:00:21.160> is<00:00:21.310> the<00:00:21.460> safest<00:00:21.820> of<00:00:22.000> all<00:00:24.150> there<00:00:25.150> are

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
stick is the safest of all there are

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.609 
stick is the safest of all there are
three<00:00:25.480> different<00:00:25.810> types<00:00:25.840> of<00:00:26.170> push<00:00:26.350> sticks

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
three different types of push sticks

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.220 
three different types of push sticks
commonly<00:00:27.100> found<00:00:27.250> in<00:00:27.460> a<00:00:27.580> woodworking<00:00:28.029> shop<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
commonly found in a woodworking shop the

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.050 
commonly found in a woodworking shop the
regular<00:00:29.590> left<00:00:29.890> seems<00:00:30.070> to<00:00:30.279> be<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:30.490> most<00:00:30.640> common

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
regular left seems to be the most common

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.660 
regular left seems to be the most common
variety<00:00:31.449> one<00:00:31.599> comes<00:00:31.810> across<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:33.309> one<00:00:33.489> in<00:00:33.610> the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
variety one comes across the one in the

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.979 
variety one comes across the one in the
middle<00:00:33.820> which<00:00:34.090> is<00:00:34.120> usually<00:00:34.510> called<00:00:34.719> a<00:00:34.780> push

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
middle which is usually called a push

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.780 
middle which is usually called a push
bump<00:00:35.290> is<00:00:35.469> sometimes<00:00:35.829> also<00:00:36.040> used<00:00:36.280> on<00:00:36.430> until<00:00:36.700> the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
bump is sometimes also used on until the

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.880 
bump is sometimes also used on until the
saw<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.050> last<00:00:38.230> one<00:00:38.380> on<00:00:38.469> the<00:00:38.530> right<00:00:38.590> is<00:00:38.860> a

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
saw and the last one on the right is a

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.680 
saw and the last one on the right is a
model<00:00:39.219> that<00:00:39.250> has<00:00:39.370> other<00:00:39.640> features<00:00:40.149> engineered

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
model that has other features engineered

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.810 
model that has other features engineered
to<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:40.960> design<00:00:41.260> okay<00:00:42.100> so<00:00:42.160> let's<00:00:42.460> see<00:00:42.610> how<00:00:42.760> to

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
to the design okay so let's see how to

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.430 
to the design okay so let's see how to
use<00:00:42.879> each<00:00:43.149> one<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:43.600> any<00:00:43.690> problems<00:00:44.170> that<00:00:44.230> may

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
use each one and any problems that may

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.530 
use each one and any problems that may
come<00:00:44.620> up

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.970 

this<00:00:48.540> push<00:00:48.810> tick<00:00:48.990> works<00:00:49.260> by<00:00:49.560> pressing<00:00:49.890> your

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
this push tick works by pressing your

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.500 
this push tick works by pressing your
wood<00:00:50.160> into<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> notch<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> front<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
wood into the notch on the front and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.080 
wood into the notch on the front and
pushing<00:00:51.810> forward<00:00:52.430> my<00:00:53.430> problem<00:00:53.790> here<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
pushing forward my problem here is that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.520 
pushing forward my problem here is that
the<00:00:54.240> wood<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.510> actually<00:00:54.660> loose<00:00:55.080> between<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the wood is actually loose between the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.690 
the wood is actually loose between the
fence<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.040> sabe

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
fence and sabe

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.910 
fence and sabe
especially<00:00:57.150> when<00:00:57.240> cutting<00:00:57.510> short<00:00:57.720> boards

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.260 

here<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.040> see<00:01:02.220> that<00:01:02.310> the<00:01:02.460> back<00:01:02.640> end<00:01:02.880> of<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.060> saw

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
here we see that the back end of the saw

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.910 
here we see that the back end of the saw
peg<00:01:03.540> can<00:01:03.810> actually<00:01:04.170> lift<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.440> word<00:01:04.620> off<00:01:04.800> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
peg can actually lift the word off the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.640 
peg can actually lift the word off the
table<00:01:05.309> now<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.570> situation<00:01:06.720> has<00:01:07.110> potential

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
table now this situation has potential

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.140 
table now this situation has potential
to<00:01:07.800> catch<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.250> wood<00:01:08.370> and<00:01:08.550> throw<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.910> so<00:01:09.030> this

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
to catch the wood and throw it so this

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.459 
to catch the wood and throw it so this
is<00:01:09.210> really<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.810> safe<00:01:10.110> situation

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.020 

now<00:01:13.710> let's<00:01:13.920> look<00:01:14.070> up<00:01:14.219> close<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.820> how<00:01:14.969> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
now let's look up close and see how the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.959 
now let's look up close and see how the
wood<00:01:15.240> could<00:01:15.780> come<00:01:15.990> away<00:01:16.170> from<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> fence<00:01:16.969> this

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
wood could come away from the fence this

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.130 
wood could come away from the fence this
happens<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> other<00:01:18.600> side<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:18.960> can

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
happens the other side that we can

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.749 
happens the other side that we can
actually<00:01:19.439> touch<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.950> back<00:01:20.130> end<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> saw

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
actually touch the back end of the saw

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.210 
actually touch the back end of the saw
blade<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.869> thrown<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:23.039> there<00:01:23.189> are

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
blade and be thrown so really there are

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
blade and be thrown so really there are
several<00:01:23.520> disadvantages<00:01:24.049> using<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.140> type<00:01:25.380> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
several disadvantages using this type of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.190 
several disadvantages using this type of
push<00:01:25.710> stick

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.710 

which<00:01:28.830> me<00:01:29.040> fear<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.820> push<00:01:30.120> stick<00:01:30.270> works<00:01:30.479> fine

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
which me fear this push stick works fine

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.020 
which me fear this push stick works fine
along<00:01:31.020> boards<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.590> also<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.760> this<00:01:32.970> is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
along boards I also know that this is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.180 
along boards I also know that this is
the<00:01:33.270> only<00:01:33.420> push<00:01:33.659> ticket<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.080> have<00:01:34.110> please<00:01:34.650> use

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
the only push ticket you have please use

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.700 
the only push ticket you have please use
it<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:35.580> any<00:01:35.940> push<00:01:36.180> stick<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.810> better<00:01:37.350> than

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
it because any push stick is better than

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.210 
it because any push stick is better than
none<00:01:37.920> at<00:01:38.070> all<00:01:39.229> now<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.409> push<00:01:40.680> tick<00:01:40.920> which<00:01:41.100> is

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
none at all now this push tick which is

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.010 
none at all now this push tick which is
more<00:01:41.400> commonly<00:01:41.700> called<00:01:41.760> a<00:01:42.030> push<00:01:42.210> block<00:01:42.510> uses<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
more commonly called a push block uses a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.740 
more commonly called a push block uses a
friction<00:01:43.440> pad<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.920> push<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.280> wood<00:01:44.400> through

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
friction pad to push the wood through

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.180 
friction pad to push the wood through
but<00:01:45.750> there's<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:46.080> three<00:01:46.619> main<00:01:46.860> issues

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
but there's really three main issues

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.440 
but there's really three main issues
here<00:01:47.369> first<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.759> all<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.090> see<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.330> your

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
here first of all you can see that your

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.899 
here first of all you can see that your

this third pusher design has several
features<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.230> not<00:02:16.560> only<00:02:16.650> increases<00:02:17.160> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
features that not only increases the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.010 
features that not only increases the
safety<00:02:17.490> level<00:02:17.820> but<00:02:18.060> also<00:02:18.210> really<00:02:18.510> reduces<00:02:18.990> the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
safety level but also really reduces the

anxiety when you're ripping wood first

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.390 
anxiety when you're ripping wood first
notice<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.230> height<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.830> your<00:02:22.950> handle<00:02:23.250> by<00:02:23.340> the

anxiety is reduced or completely gone
second<00:02:34.590> notice<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.980> large<00:02:35.430> body<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> push

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
second notice the large body of the push

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.090 
second notice the large body of the push
tick<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:37.020> prevents<00:02:37.470> your<00:02:37.560> hand<00:02:37.740> from<00:02:37.890> being

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
whatever this is also another anxiety

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.470 
whatever this is also another anxiety
reducer<00:02:43.610> also<00:02:44.610> notice<00:02:44.850> how<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.030> push<00:02:45.270> stick

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
reducer also notice how the push stick

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.320 
reducer also notice how the push stick
sits<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:45.930> top<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.350> wood<00:02:46.730> this<00:02:47.730> prevents<00:02:48.210> us

to<00:03:02.400> push<00:03:02.610> forward<00:03:03.290> okay<00:03:04.290> now<00:03:04.560> let's<00:03:04.830> look<00:03:04.920> at

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
to push forward okay now let's look at

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.330 
to push forward okay now let's look at
the<00:03:05.220> traction<00:03:05.460> tread<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:07.590> elastic<00:03:08.100> tread

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
the traction tread this elastic tread

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.010 
the traction tread this elastic tread
looks<00:03:08.580> just<00:03:08.760> like<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.120> tread<00:03:09.390> on<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.570> farmer's

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
looks just like the tread on a farmer's

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.260 
looks just like the tread on a farmer's
tractor<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:11.370> reason<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.790> as<00:03:12.060> long<00:03:12.090> as

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
tractor the reason is that as long as

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.940 
tractor the reason is that as long as
accumulates<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.170> gets<00:03:13.320> trapped<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.830> between

accumulates it gets trapped in between

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.500 
accumulates it gets trapped in between
the<00:03:14.250> Chevron's<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.090> doesn't<00:03:15.360> lose<00:03:15.450> its

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
the Chevron's so it doesn't lose its

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.630 
the Chevron's so it doesn't lose its
