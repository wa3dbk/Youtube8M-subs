00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.540
 the model that brought a new reference 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.679
 design for the coupe class 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.320
 sports 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:16.119
 audi tt arrived in its third generation 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:27.609
 and of course even more provocative is what 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:30.369
 It took men to show us the 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.860
 audi tt passed through 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.530
 a beautiful one of an evolution was absorbed 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.690
 technology but also improved 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.879
 a point where it was already very good now 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.879
 it delivers even more sportiness 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.329
 after appearing in the car show 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.390
 from SÃ£o Paulo in 2014 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.730
 the third generation of audi tt arrived 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.010
 officially to Brazil in the visual 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.070
 appreciated the straight lines of the second 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.210
 generation has now gained a new and 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.550
 lower 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.310
 more tapered headlights with lamps 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.930
 xenon in the a traxon version or in leds 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.930
 nambi floor that is the top 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.759
 behind with spoiler on the cover of the 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:23.740
 trunk that opens automatically 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.899
 when it exceeds 120 kilometers per 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.750
 hour and the two large tailpipes of 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.060
 exhaust in finish of 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.789
 first and new appeals that deserve 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.770
 attention for example in the ambition version 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.819
 see the air control system 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.420
 conditioning 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:44.459
 they are integrated into the air vents 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.459
 different in good taste and very practical 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.470
 an important point was also the 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.450
 improvement of the bodywork already 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.970
 mixed steel and aluminum 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.460
 but has won a new project with five 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.290
 types of steel and three aluminum 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:13.750
 changes that have brought more security 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:15.640
 and torsional resistance for good tt 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.280
 with all these improvements 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.340
 The cool thing is that the pt got even lighter 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.150
 in the second audi he reduced the weight of 50 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.830
 pounds 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.590
 Then you remember that he got stronger. 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.239
 it is also because he won 19 more horses 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.550
 power output 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.230
 the result you should already imagine it 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.150
 it was even more aloof now 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.220
 important is that it continues 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.220
 delivering high-level sportsmanship 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.709
 exactly under the hood the t was also gone 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.200
 improved the modern 2.0 turbo engine that 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.230
 has even a double injection system 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.430
 direct and indirect costs gained 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.709
 power and torque 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.810
 now there are 230 horses and 37.7 kilos of 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.200
 torque and that can be almost all 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.079
 used before 2,800 turns to 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.269
 follow the automatic transmission s 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.609
 tronic double clutch and six 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:19.109
 speeds with the right of the letter 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.109
 steering wheel for manual exchanges 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.710
 it would already be enough novelty 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.260
 but look more this what the audi calls 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.970
 virtual cockpit and bringing together the new 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.270
 control system unit . 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.310
 Connectivity mm no tt 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.010
 it is displayed in the registration panel 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.410
 resolution that occupies the traditional space 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.020
 of the set of instruments with 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.500
 to very precise animations and graphics 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.170
 everything virtual which means that we can 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.140
 for example reducing the display 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.810
 and the speedometer and fill the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.420
 screen with your browser information is 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.220
 a bet but shows how much 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.010
 technology is bringing changes 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.350
 sensitive to our cars and here 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.060
 when you first observe and 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.040
 even creates a strange impact like this 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.300
 It seems like you're looking at a beautiful 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.459
 of a video game 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.760
 but look in practice the result is well 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.760
 interesting 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.419
 the new tt is already in the dealerships of the 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.310
 audio and at least the input version to 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.740
 traxon that has almost everything that 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.650
 we show here maintains the price of the version 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.950
 old the expectation now is the arrival 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.180
 tt roadster what should happen in the 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.180
 beginning of next semester
