00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
a point escape or two but it's been

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.160 
a point escape or two but it's been

I'm hoping whoever looked at missed

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.990 
I'm hoping whoever looked at missed
something<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:26.689> know<00:01:26.810> be<00:01:27.619> tempting<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:28.100> try<00:01:28.880> to

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
something you know be tempting to try to

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.420 
something you know be tempting to try to
find<00:01:29.150> another<00:01:29.270> place<00:01:29.689> but<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:30.290> pick<00:01:31.009> up<00:01:31.159> a<00:01:31.250> lot

looked<00:05:43.139> at<00:05:43.290> it<00:05:43.320> this<00:05:43.530> way<00:05:43.740> thought<00:05:43.980> this<00:05:44.190> stop

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
looked at it this way thought this stop

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.129 
looked at it this way thought this stop
is<00:05:44.460> broken<00:05:45.000> i<00:05:45.090> thought<00:05:45.330> it<00:05:45.419> was<00:05:45.510> a<00:05:45.600> bifurcate

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
is broken i thought it was a bifurcate

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.370 
is broken i thought it was a bifurcate
most<00:05:46.410> of<00:05:46.590> you<00:05:47.090> are<00:05:48.090> way<00:05:48.300> smarter<00:05:48.600> than<00:05:48.780> me<00:05:49.050> knew

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
most of you are way smarter than me knew

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.620 
most of you are way smarter than me knew
that<00:05:49.410> this<00:05:50.340> is<00:05:50.400> actually<00:05:50.820> the<00:05:51.150> way<00:05:51.240> the<00:05:51.389> point

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
that this is actually the way the point

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
that this is actually the way the point
goes<00:05:51.980> and<00:05:52.980> it's<00:05:53.130> missing<00:05:53.610> a<00:05:53.700> little<00:05:53.970> bit<00:05:54.650> the

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
goes and it's missing a little bit the

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.740 
goes and it's missing a little bit the
base<00:05:55.860> right<00:05:56.190> here<00:05:57.560> it's<00:05:58.560> actually<00:05:58.800> a<00:05:59.750> lot

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
base right here it's actually a lot

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:08.210 
base right here it's actually a lot
fuller<00:06:01.050> point<00:06:01.410> than<00:06:01.620> I<00:06:01.740> originally<00:06:01.860> thought

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.300 

okay<00:06:09.470> well<00:06:10.470> we've<00:06:10.590> got<00:06:10.620> some<00:06:10.740> good<00:06:11.100> rain
