have also have an allergy clean cycle
which<00:04:10.909> means<00:04:10.939> spring<00:04:11.359> and<00:04:11.509> fall<00:04:11.659> when<00:04:11.689> you

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
which means spring and fall when you

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.629 
which means spring and fall when you
have<00:04:12.049> all<00:04:12.169> the<00:04:12.290> pollen<00:04:12.590> in<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.739> air<00:04:12.829> in<00:04:13.549> your

coughing and sneezing allergy clean does

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.920 
coughing and sneezing allergy clean does
that<00:04:16.190> full<00:04:16.400> power<00:04:16.970> air<00:04:17.239> cleaning<00:04:17.449> cycle<00:04:17.780> for

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
that full power air cleaning cycle for

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.379 
that full power air cleaning cycle for
24<00:04:18.289> hours<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.799> guess<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.699> last<00:04:19.820> little<00:04:20.090> piece<00:04:20.239> I

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
24 hours I guess the last little piece I

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.969 
24 hours I guess the last little piece I
have<00:04:20.539> is<00:04:20.720> this<00:04:20.870> also<00:04:21.079> doubles<00:04:21.349> as<00:04:21.560> a<00:04:21.620> zoning

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
have is this also doubles as a zoning

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.070 
have is this also doubles as a zoning
control<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:23.030> if<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.210> want<00:04:23.389> to<00:04:23.509> zone<00:04:23.750> your<00:04:23.900> home

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
control so if you want to zone your home

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.429 
control so if you want to zone your home
put<00:04:24.380> mechanical<00:04:24.889> dampers<00:04:25.250> in<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.849> duct

00:04:26.429 --> 00:04:26.439 
put mechanical dampers in the duct

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:27.989 
put mechanical dampers in the duct
so<00:04:26.889> that<00:04:27.009> you<00:04:27.129> can<00:04:27.249> only<00:04:27.370> heat<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.729> cool<00:04:27.879> the

00:04:27.989 --> 00:04:27.999 
so that you can only heat and cool the

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:29.909 
so that you can only heat and cool the
rooms<00:04:28.210> that<00:04:28.360> you're<00:04:28.509> living<00:04:28.629> in<00:04:28.870> that<00:04:29.590> along

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
rooms that you're living in that along

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.409 
rooms that you're living in that along
with<00:04:29.979> programmability<00:04:30.729> will<00:04:31.150> actually

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
with programmability will actually

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.969 
with programmability will actually
increase<00:04:31.719> your<00:04:32.050> potential<00:04:32.439> for<00:04:32.710> saving

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
increase your potential for saving

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.399 
increase your potential for saving
energy<00:04:33.129> in<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.490> home<00:04:33.689> and<00:04:34.689> all<00:04:34.990> this<00:04:35.139> can<00:04:35.289> be

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
energy in the home and all this can be

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.080 
energy in the home and all this can be
customizable<00:04:36.009> you<00:04:36.219> can<00:04:36.249> add<00:04:36.460> as<00:04:36.580> much<00:04:36.759> on<00:04:36.999> the
