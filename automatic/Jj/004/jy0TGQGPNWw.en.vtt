00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
view is that Canadian Brewers tend to be

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.179 
view is that Canadian Brewers tend to be
very<00:01:07.890> conservative<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.960> we're<00:01:10.439> not<00:01:10.470> out<00:01:10.890> there

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
very conservative so we're not out there

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
we're not exploring the fringes like our

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.719 
we're not exploring the fringes like our
neighbors<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> South<00:01:13.770> quite<00:01:14.040> frankly<00:01:14.430> but

just<00:02:20.760> read<00:02:20.909> a<00:02:20.939> story<00:02:21.239> today<00:02:21.450> talking<00:02:21.810> about

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
just read a story today talking about

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.849 
just read a story today talking about
sabmiller<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.159> molson<00:02:23.519> coors<00:02:23.760> merging<00:02:24.859> the

sabmiller and molson coors merging the

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.789 
sabmiller and molson coors merging the
idea<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.819> this<00:02:27.540> consolidation<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.590> keep

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
idea that this consolidation can keep

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.069 
idea that this consolidation can keep
going<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:29.189> in<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.430> huge<00:02:29.819> level<00:02:30.269> is<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.930> course

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
going on in this huge level is of course

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.559 
going on in this huge level is of course
there's<00:02:31.500> there's<00:02:31.709> limit<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.189> that<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.909> what

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
there's there's limit to that so what

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.319 
there's there's limit to that so what
you're<00:02:33.750> seeing<00:02:33.989> is<00:02:34.409> you're<00:02:34.620> seeing<00:02:35.329> emerging

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
you're seeing is you're seeing emerging

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.599 
you're seeing is you're seeing emerging
multinationals<00:02:37.079> like<00:02:37.260> Sapporo<00:02:37.739> sweep<00:02:38.159> in<00:02:38.370> and

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
multinationals like Sapporo sweep in and

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.020 
multinationals like Sapporo sweep in and
buy<00:02:39.049> Sleeman<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.310> then<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.459> pickings<00:02:41.790> start

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
buy Sleeman and then the pickings start

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.670 
buy Sleeman and then the pickings start
getting<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.299> little<00:02:42.329> smaller<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.079> they<00:02:43.379> start

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
getting a little smaller so they start

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.670 
getting a little smaller so they start
going<00:02:43.829> after<00:02:44.159> smaller<00:02:44.939> companies<00:02:45.540> whether<00:02:46.260> an
