00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.130
 today I want to share with all of you 

00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:07.220
 this recipe so easy that are some 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.030
 Parmesan cheese lollipops with ham 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.500
 in sweet and oregano and then you 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.120
 I leave step by step on teeth that 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.380
 we will use to make these 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:22.740
 lollipops are ham in sweet 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:26.730
 a wedge of Parmesan cheese and oregano 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.529
 now we will cut 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.759
 the ham in sweet we will do it like this 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:37.500
 bits and then we will also go to 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.620
 grate the parmesan cheese 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.670
 in a baking sheet we put a leaf 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 of vegetable paper and we will put a ring of 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.890
 this type in which we do for 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.890
 plating 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.770
 and we will also use the skewers and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.800
 the skewers of medium size and these 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.100
 that they sell in the bazaars of for 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.160
 fruits are not the big big are 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.160
 the medians and now we will pass 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.400
 to put the parmesan cheese inside 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.659
 we will put the grated cheese inside 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:26.410
 not much but you have to be all 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.200
 all the water without gaps but neither that 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.440
 have a thickness because this think that 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.860
 It has to be like a tile and once 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.560
 we have distributed the cheese we put the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.770
 ham is sweet a little bit either in 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.299
 excess 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.299
 with a little bit of oregano 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:58.719
 we take out the ring and put the skewer 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.759
 the skewer stick to seal the 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.789
 part of the stick we put a 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.300
 little bit more cheese and we would have a 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.260
 shaped 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.560
 we would go to the next one we will be 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:17.470
 separated so then the other way 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.470
 we can put the other one and we will do the same 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.490
 we distribute cheese well that are not 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.200
 holes without 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.200
 with nothing 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.920
 or not 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.920
 we can ham in sweet 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.680
 and the little bit of oregano 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.510
 ah 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.470
 ah 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.340
 now let's investigate what we put like this for 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.340
 that we have left more 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.590
 are very good these of these 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:19.290
 lollipops of parmesan cheese and for a 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.980
 appetizer as 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.980
 they are very 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.350
 very attractive also at the time of 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.350
 decorate on the table 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.879
 and so we will be doing successively in 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.000
 all the plate now we have them and 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:02.150
 now we will move to bring the tray to 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.879
 oven that I have previously hot 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.750
 already 200 degrees we will have 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.760
 approximately seven minutes already 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.980
 we know that depending on the oven there 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.769
 to be watching but approximately 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.370
 about seven minutes and we've taken them out 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:23.020
 from the oven and they come out very easily as 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.660
 You see put the cheese then dismisses the 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.960
 fat and then there are no problems in 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.510
 catch them in removing them from the paper and 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.100
 then you make us a container 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:40.010
 I think I 've taken a presley and I've 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.560
 put a little silver wrapped in 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.330
 silver and there is only power left 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.909
 clicking the 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.220
 in any place that you choose 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:53.000
 I turned this one on and then we go 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.810
 clicking the lollipops and we're going 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.860
 placing to be able to serve on the table 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.639
 functions we have ready for 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.889
 present them on the table and as you can see 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.759
 result a super simple recipe for 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:11.240
 do but the result is very attractive 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:14.300
 and it's a super appetizer to make 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.430
 on a holiday because nothing encourage you to 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.840
 that you do thank you as always 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.840
