00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
I have to say that my review of the band

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.000 
I have to say that my review of the band
is<00:01:34.000> you<00:01:34.450> know<00:01:35.050> it's<00:01:35.380> okay<00:01:37.080> it<00:01:38.080> just<00:01:38.140> pops<00:01:38.770> off

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
is you know it's okay it just pops off

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.720 
is you know it's okay it just pops off
like<00:01:39.250> this<00:01:39.690> it's<00:01:40.690> not<00:01:41.260> that<00:01:41.320> securus<00:01:42.280> I<00:01:42.460> mean

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
like this it's not that securus I mean

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.750 
like this it's not that securus I mean
it<00:01:42.820> is<00:01:42.970> secure<00:01:43.390> but<00:01:43.690> it's<00:01:44.590> just<00:01:44.920> silicone<00:01:45.400> so

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
it is secure but it's just silicone so

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.990 
it is secure but it's just silicone so
it's<00:01:46.480> not<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.660> strong<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:48.430> loops<00:01:48.700> through

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
ah see it goes like this so you match up

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.110 
ah see it goes like this so you match up
the<00:03:46.320> power<00:03:46.620> button<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:47.220> meet<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:47.880> power

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
the power button to meet that power

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.340 
the power button to meet that power
button<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.630> is<00:03:48.810> what<00:03:48.960> i<00:03:48.990> don't<00:03:49.260> like

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
button and this is what i don't like

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.920 
button and this is what i don't like
about<00:03:49.470> this<00:03:49.860> case<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.520> is<00:03:50.550> really<00:03:51.210> hard<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.720> get

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
about this case it is really hard to get

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.070 
about this case it is really hard to get
in<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.290> out<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:53.250> not<00:03:53.430> only<00:03:53.580> that<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:54.210> have<00:03:54.930> to

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
in and out and not only that you have to

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.440 
in and out and not only that you have to
take<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.470> out<00:03:55.590> if<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:56.310> want<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.610> charge<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:57.030> so

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
take it out if you want to charge it so

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.630 
take it out if you want to charge it so
it's<00:03:57.630> kind<00:03:57.840> of<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:58.020> pain<00:03:58.230> but<00:03:59.010> they<00:03:59.250> do<00:03:59.310> have

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
it's kind of a pain but they do have

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.440 
it's kind of a pain but they do have
these<00:03:59.790> little<00:03:59.940> notches<00:04:00.270> here<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:01.620> help<00:04:02.450> give

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
these little notches here that help give

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.300 
these little notches here that help give
it<00:04:03.540> some<00:04:03.750> wiggle<00:04:04.260> room<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:04.740> you<00:04:04.830> can<00:04:04.920> get<00:04:05.070> it<00:04:05.220> in

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
it some wiggle room so you can get it in

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.100 
it some wiggle room so you can get it in
there<00:04:05.520> but<00:04:06.000> that's<00:04:06.390> probably<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.020> only

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
there but that's probably the only

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.720 
there but that's probably the only
negative<00:04:07.620> thing<00:04:07.650> about<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:08.190> case<00:04:08.460> it's

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
negative thing about this case it's

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.540 
negative thing about this case it's
really<00:04:09.000> strong<00:04:09.500> not<00:04:10.500> cheap<00:04:10.920> filling<00:04:11.370> it's

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
really strong not cheap filling it's

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.810 
really strong not cheap filling it's
actually<00:04:11.880> very<00:04:11.910> comfortable<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.720> wear<00:04:12.960> and

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
wiggle it in their kind of get in there

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.740 
wiggle it in their kind of get in there
got<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.530> fiddle<00:04:25.950> with<00:04:26.100> it<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.280> little<00:04:26.430> bit<00:04:26.750> and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
got a fiddle with it a little bit and

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.080 
got a fiddle with it a little bit and
the<00:04:27.960> only<00:04:28.080> other<00:04:28.170> thing<00:04:28.350> is<00:04:28.680> you<00:04:29.550> can<00:04:29.730> turn<00:04:29.910> it

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
the only other thing is you can turn it

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.460 
the only other thing is you can turn it
that<00:04:30.180> way<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:30.690> it<00:04:30.840> has<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.410> right<00:04:31.530> orientation

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
that way so it has the right orientation

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.470 
that way so it has the right orientation
let's<00:04:34.470> get<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.770> watch<00:04:35.370> part<00:04:35.700> back<00:04:35.910> there<00:04:36.360> we

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
let's get the watch part back there we

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.740 
let's get the watch part back there we
go<00:04:37.190> there<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.280> is<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.850> you<00:04:39.120> can<00:04:39.300> turn<00:04:39.450> it<00:04:39.510> off

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
go there it is so you can turn it off

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.820 
go there it is so you can turn it off
turn<00:04:40.050> it<00:04:40.920> on<00:04:41.130> it's<00:04:42.000> pretty<00:04:42.180> responsive<00:04:42.990> and

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
turn it on it's pretty responsive and

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.170 
turn it on it's pretty responsive and
then<00:04:43.950> let's<00:04:44.100> put<00:04:44.280> it<00:04:44.430> on<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.730> one's<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.030> little

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
then let's put it on this one's a little

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.510 
then let's put it on this one's a little
tricky<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:45.630> get<00:04:45.810> on<00:04:45.990> but<00:04:46.290> I've<00:04:46.440> found<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.340> if

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
tricky to get on but I've found that if

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:55.090 
tricky to get on but I've found that if
you<00:04:47.640> put<00:04:48.600> it<00:04:48.720> down<00:04:48.900> on<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:49.250> table<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:52.370> then<00:04:53.370> you

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
you put it down on a table and then you

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.650 
you put it down on a table and then you
find<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.340> nacho<00:04:56.790> that<00:04:56.970> you<00:04:57.120> need<00:04:57.360> like<00:04:58.200> this<00:04:58.680> I

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
find the nacho that you need like this I

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.600 
find the nacho that you need like this I
use<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:01.260> last<00:05:01.470> notch<00:05:01.980> folks<00:05:02.250> that<00:05:02.460> have

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
use the last notch folks that have

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.740 
use the last notch folks that have
really<00:05:02.880> small<00:05:03.060> risks<00:05:05.000> make<00:05:06.000> it<00:05:06.120> pop<00:05:06.270> in<00:05:06.510> like

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
really small risks make it pop in like

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.190 
really small risks make it pop in like
that<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.260> then<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:07.980> just<00:05:08.130> tuck<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.460> in<00:05:09.200> like

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
that and then you just tuck it in like

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.660 
that and then you just tuck it in like
that<00:05:10.230> so<00:05:10.680> as<00:05:10.800> long<00:05:10.920> as<00:05:10.980> you<00:05:11.160> have<00:05:11.310> something<00:05:11.640> to

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
that so as long as you have something to

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.970 
that so as long as you have something to
rest<00:05:11.970> it<00:05:12.180> on<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:12.600> okay<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.110> put<00:05:13.350> on<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.860> then

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
rest it on it's okay to put on and then

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.650 
rest it on it's okay to put on and then
you're<00:05:14.100> set<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:14.310> go<00:05:14.430> like<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.210> said<00:05:15.360> this<00:05:15.600> is

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
you're set to go like I said this is

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.250 
you're set to go like I said this is
good<00:05:16.020> for<00:05:16.260> when<00:05:16.380> you're<00:05:16.500> running<00:05:16.710> because

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
good for when you're running because

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.080 
good for when you're running because
your<00:05:19.260> sweat<00:05:19.590> doesn't<00:05:19.830> get<00:05:20.100> all<00:05:20.250> over<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.700> ipod

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
your sweat doesn't get all over the ipod

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.440 
your sweat doesn't get all over the ipod
this<00:05:21.510> is<00:05:21.720> actually<00:05:22.050> waterproof<00:05:22.350> and<00:05:22.860> so<00:05:23.450> when

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
this is actually waterproof and so when

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.150

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
easy to take out to charge but like I

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.480 
easy to take out to charge but like I
said<00:05:56.919> worst<00:05:57.610> thing<00:05:57.819> about<00:05:57.909> this<00:05:58.210> case<00:05:58.509> so<00:05:59.349> far

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
said worst thing about this case so far

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.420 
said worst thing about this case so far
is<00:06:00.490> that<00:06:01.050> it's<00:06:02.050> hard<00:06:02.229> to<00:06:02.349> get<00:06:02.469> in<00:06:02.650> and<00:06:03.009> a<00:06:03.129> little

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
is that it's hard to get in and a little

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.209 
is that it's hard to get in and a little
bit<00:06:03.490> of<00:06:03.550> lint<00:06:03.879> sometimes<00:06:04.389> collects<00:06:04.840> here

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:05.219 
bit of lint sometimes collects here

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.550 
bit of lint sometimes collects here
because<00:06:06.219> this<00:06:06.490> material<00:06:07.270> actually<00:06:07.629> attracts

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
because this material actually attracts

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.610 
because this material actually attracts
lint<00:06:09.039> and<00:06:09.569> dust<00:06:10.569> so<00:06:11.020> you<00:06:11.080> just<00:06:11.259> take<00:06:11.439> the

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
lint and dust so you just take the

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.179 
lint and dust so you just take the
little<00:06:13.229> microfiber<00:06:14.229> cloth<00:06:14.620> that<00:06:14.830> they<00:06:14.949> send

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:15.189 
little microfiber cloth that they send

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:16.890 
little microfiber cloth that they send
you<00:06:15.279> and<00:06:15.400> wipe<00:06:15.520> it<00:06:15.639> down<00:06:15.789> this<00:06:16.330> one<00:06:16.569> I<00:06:16.689> mean<00:06:16.810> you

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
you and wipe it down this one I mean you

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.929 
you and wipe it down this one I mean you
can<00:06:17.020> see<00:06:17.169> a<00:06:17.199> difference<00:06:17.409> these<00:06:18.310> are<00:06:18.460> totally

00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:18.939 
can see a difference these are totally

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:20.850 
can see a difference these are totally
different<00:06:19.060> cases<00:06:19.449> this<00:06:19.779> is<00:06:19.839> very<00:06:20.199> flimsy<00:06:20.560> the

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
different cases this is very flimsy the

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.749 
different cases this is very flimsy the
orange<00:06:21.279> ones<00:06:21.490> very<00:06:21.849> flimsy<00:06:22.499> very<00:06:23.499> cheap<00:06:23.919> you
