of<00:02:49.750> these<00:02:49.840> Titans<00:02:50.230> okay<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.860> bigger<00:02:51.040> the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
of these Titans okay so the bigger the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.410 
of these Titans okay so the bigger the
biggest<00:02:51.519> difference<00:02:51.670> they'll<00:02:52.120> do<00:02:52.239> almost

difference between this and one of the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.750 
difference between this and one of the
expensive<00:02:56.200> models<00:02:56.500> use<00:02:56.620> horsepower<00:02:57.130> it's

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
horsepower I just got right around 21

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.540 
horsepower I just got right around 21
yeah<00:03:02.800> but<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.010> don't<00:03:03.100> have<00:03:03.250> any<00:03:03.370> weight
