00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:03.130
 go try all 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.160
 hilarious humor meet for the always-awaited tutorials 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.870
 % 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.210
 funny of his antenna earth 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.389
 secondly project 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.090
 the man whose coordinator I call sir that I used to 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.240
 the general tinder fall who does eraser for his request why 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.869
 the Senate is a political choice 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.559
 so had the skeptical watch so the competition takes heart again 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.319
 the software to download so the link he is in the disappointment 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.079
 enough to do right now 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.780
 in nidwalden 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.560
 we will call him for 100 th 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.630
 earlier 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.760
 so the direction% 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.790
 once you have to know that one unit so at five by five 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.820
 % represent 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.820
 to 128 blocks so the safer% to 5 times 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.289
 it goes above the weight 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.410
 5 68% 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.920
 good bah ferrand who worked I am Corsican 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.020
 for that it is necessary that m 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.200
 it's automatic he flatters yes they know 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.850
 but by the way, that means 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.790
 tomorrow synonymous with natural children 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.660
 for me a child presses what I could see by testing the little ones 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.520
 useful tips 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.340
 The software 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.240
 burst ccpr so we'll do 18 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.740
 however, the vuelta 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.920
 during a four-day trip 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.140
 so lady that is needed after a touch 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.450
 saw we're going to do a green tariff of useless edf for the game reminiscent for those 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.720
 who do not know because it means 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.640
 the beach 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.680
 So the terracotta bearel 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.189
 so that's mm 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.950
 brand mapping 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.990
 so I just wanted and relief and everything and everything and everything 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.520
 so a walk women who would not without knowing who is the big one 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.740
 mountain in the middle 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.970
 we will do absolutely the same thing 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.900
 so look I know this is tooling 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.360
 so it's useful to also you do to anyone the level of the ground 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.320
 at least if you right click they are in France 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.320
 so we will make a mountain on the whole length 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.950
 so like that you just hold the left click do not go up too much because 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.969
 that otherwise it touched me the limit 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:12.229
 on the contrary 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.229
 the block limit is a 1,628 holding motor 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.890
 it crumbles 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.890
 all my godson top of the mountain any case 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.159
 ould abdel aziz did not remake 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.269
 monclar world can see 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.349
 here is a pretty mountain m 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.669
 we keep our hand 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.049
 I think that will suffice 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.710
 for this group after 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.040
 you could see that there are clues so also estimated the daily 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.489
 ice cube of water 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.279
 and it was the right click in a difficult 3 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.270
 percent deep no more or less strength 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.270
 to do this I lose a player will be ready 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.599
 secondary like terrorists he says 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.340
 so here is able to establish a right click you have to fill in for 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.589
 hundred several levels etc 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.339
 so we'll fill several holes 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:04.489
 for the moment we are learning in the capital 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.920
 so there he has with him and with whom and year 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:12.449
 and we can do as big as stupidity 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.879
 click here so a place that of course she is at the head of the fleet 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.229
 all over 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.229
 for a few years yet as soon as it does not fly high 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.349
 the road to india 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.859
 I understand 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.709
 Washington already offers a bit of a say 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.709
 his father 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:39.019
 so our neighbors there are still a lot of gaps but it's not very 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.379
 serious we will say 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.649
 at harlem 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:44.440
 we now find for sale 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.999
 generate trees we listen to you that will be decisive 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:50.339
 of the day for the time 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:53.110
 generate once a night I could arrive 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.270
 and so the representative cited three abilities which is defined in intensity 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.819
 rare 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.179
 there are no more limits to which we could generate more trees 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:04.849
 intense who is strong 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.349
 the trees will be served 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.540
 enough to whet your appetite 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.089
 the 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:12.539
 tool not there 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:15.539
 the phillies 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:18.680
 the 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.289
 alas why not 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.780
 so now we did everything they had to do to make the powerful 

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:26.990
 now we'll go to the party 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.150
 so here you go so go export ward 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.330
 so the value 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.629
 noble material so that means a secret that ask us if we want 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:37.919
 find the order 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.210
 how to choose 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.669
 so there in fact we must choose what we will find as murray underground 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.050
 in feast we go now where they are six so percent 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.029
 the procedure 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:51.740
 Spain who worry the most 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.740
 a man on the ground we will put to the sources so what does not correspond 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.699
 stone camatte gap 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.739
 none did not address when that is what will define at best 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:02.639
 regarding 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.639
 everything he delineated in front lacombe has generated 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.360
 we generated% 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.010
 an ode to 428 block 3 428 blacks 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.610
 so that we can smile Bordeaux novus ordo eurovoirie it's 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.969
 free to put it 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:20.319
 no borders 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.479
 we can also put a year 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.100
 it is a moment of relaxation 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.460
 a competitor in caen 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.450
 a fairer jestaz currencies c 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.870
 the text signed a request if we want to put to sport or not 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.949
 a dog 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.389
 this box with limited resources 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.330
 christophe pitard the choir took a second term in the barracks 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:45.429
 so the light intensities on cases how much 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.410
 so we're not going to be mastered but because the manager is racing 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.949
 his momentum in your projects that speaks everywhere 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.339
 because we vote 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:54.520
 we will put some 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.069
 we already knew it well enough 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.159
 e 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.490
 it's pretty much everything we did little sports tea the day finds the game for 

00:06:03.489 --> 00:06:04.380
 show what he knew 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.199
 see you later 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.219
 So here we are, we are simply on the 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.089
 on the map is appropriate 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:12.229
 degrees 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.859
 aso we will turn on the mountain so 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.600
 montanier who she 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.039
 one year ago 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:24.249
 Nicolas lying on Toulon 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:30.089
 alas we have 10 7% the day before and long term laps that would accentuate who 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.400
 have so many caverns from time to time 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.199
 surface but m 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.590
 so no more worrying today 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.599
 Sand successes 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.740
 as at 17 6% 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.000
 Yes 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.419
 so yes he does not hesitate so the snowball I can 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:48.080
 lle crci 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.520
 it's a small mistake I know it's not all that with his paws and 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.749
 very serious 

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:57.519
 in terms of wagering on the map, now it's just 

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:58.999
 appreciate 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:02.099
 and who offered women who can only talk 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:06.349
 for legislative haiti 

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:09.389
 the time spent 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:10.240
 5 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.309
 gates 

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:14.180
 it's so huge to do that 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.800
 So here I am, I will tell you 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.599
 now 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:18.550
 1 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.869
 just good i'm going to burst borough 

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:26.129
 the income from the weather channel at gm have a look at the site on facebook 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.899
 equiterre wallace had a lot of things 

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:33.669
 and I tell you later and that shows too dear fans who lady
