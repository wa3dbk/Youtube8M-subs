00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.650
 good serves everyone and welcome back to 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.779
 this new player review 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.329
 I am a call girl today we are here 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:23.590
 precisely with the review of doumbia fu 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:25.290
 of pink and pink as you want to call it is 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.180
 a player surely that 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.189
 apparently it looks very very fast 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.840
 since at that speed of 96 that 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.730
 certainly stands out against the other values 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.600
 in fact he is already a highly paid player 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.179
 in its basic version 82 both of the cska 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.269
 that of Rome when uselessness 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:48.159
 actors are unleashed by sabatini rumors 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:48.909
 that plays fifa but this is another 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.579
 history 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.729
 let's start talking about the speed 94 of 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.379
 acceleration 97 of shutter speed is a 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.359
 Unreachable player of speed 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.190
 so it's an absolute pro there is a 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.819
 player who will run for you 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.070
 defended in a crazy way lived 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:07.930
 mineral the worst defenders even the most 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.580
 fast so there is neither defender in the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.180
 full back that manages to stop this 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.530
 not even the fastest player to trust 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.780
 let's talk now about dribbling with four 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.780
 ski stars that are always a junta 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.730
 always a prodi every player of 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:27.310
 some skis usually go to complete 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:30.310
 the grid ing we used to sing if 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.250
 liquids drink 73 of agility 80 among the 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.160
 reflections 85 of ball control and 90 of 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.500
 dribbling agility in fact is not the 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.440
 maximum, however, thanks for checking 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.350
 ball thanks to reflexes will be able to do 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.110
 to be left very quickly and 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.950
 very quickly even in the moment in 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.020
 you need to discard a defender 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.700
 passing the ball left and right 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.450
 then you can also use the skills e 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.570
 of course we speak now of the shot after 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.370
 evidence of the dribbling of the shooting 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.470
 it is only the power to me more than to 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.580
 84 because in the end to finalization of 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.050
 90 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.110
 sometimes he misses something too much 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.150
 in front of the door then we have 89's 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.480
 placement 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.659
 with a good medium to high works 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.310
 attack then works I entered 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.079
 particularly in the pros not always 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.049
 I insert in my reviews but 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.180
 anyway I entered it this time then 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.470
 we have a position value of 84 which 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.829
 precisely of selections precisely because it is 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.870
 very good the long shot 79 sincerely 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.689
 you will not use it because it is a player with 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.390
 which starts at speed and does not stop anymore 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.159
 arrive at the door and finish 82 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.190
 of penalties did not bring them down from Christmas 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.319
 declares the flight takes second place 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.780
 I didn't like the ride 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.329
 value of 80 I failed to do 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.519
 particular goals per lap and just like 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.250
 I said before the finalization 90 e 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.870
 but let's say that seven out of ten 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.730
 they are always goals 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.530
 I did not do so many goals precisely 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.129
 for this little problem of 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.069
 finalization we sometimes talk now 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.230
 of the passage we do not say together with 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.620
 cavani i was paired with cavani si si 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.489
 really exchanged goals and assists 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.680
 in fact we have only seven i 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.169
 short passages and 66 of long done 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.970
 also some assists and I must say that the 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:24.500
 short passage I liked it because 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.500
 however it made good shores 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.180
 maybe he used cavani to do 12 or 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.730
 however to pass the ball to the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.680
 outside of midfield so it is me 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.780
 I also liked the passage I did not 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.909
 inserted in the 33 in the 3 against because the 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.280
 end an attacker must not have the 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.709
 passage from my point of view 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.889
 we end up with the physical we have a strength 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.500
 physical of 68 a very low value that 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:52.530
 honestly I don't have that much 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.630
 he is not so sorry, not because 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.330
 value is good but why not 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.100
 you will be able to take it with speed and 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.080
 however since it has a discrete value 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.280
 of balance will succeed however to stay in 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.410
 walking 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.630
 the thing I liked instead at 97 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.970
 of resistance because really until the end 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.840
 game will be able to run as much as it can 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.790
 give can run as much as he wants 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.840
 practically because it is still a good one 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.920
 resistance the elevation of 85 is not 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.870
 fantastic let's say the header 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.090
 it is not very good even if at 76 of 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.800
 precision some cross you will also 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.630
 to try it honestly I didn't either 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.910
 tried in fact is not in its lines 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.040
 in his specialties he sells his features 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.410
 so a header is a player 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.390
 in short, to use speed and then 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.070
 in front of the door look for at least 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.960
 certainly mark a player who can 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.240
 starting from midfield discard of 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.080
 all with ball control with 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.060
 skills and then mark therefore between the 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.440
 pro i forgot to tell you that there 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.700
 they are also the four-star foot 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.530
 weak because both of right and of 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.680
 left will make you the difference 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.810
 I don't always say in front of the door but 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.460
 some good time will be able to do it 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.229
 therefore these as you see in 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.450
 overlay only for and against 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.180
 seydou doumbia, the stoner of the 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.610
 roma left footies on the occasion 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.740
 of the food oscars 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.200
 I just have to say goodbye leave you at 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.790
 an upcoming review of these cutis 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.290
 we would probably all do it 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.790
 we probably won't do any not 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.919
 we still know it 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.750
 and so I greet you and feel in one 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.750
 next review hello everyone
