00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.120 
get into position so basically as long
as<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.759> mark<00:01:30.210> turns<00:01:30.479> red<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:31.079> guaranteed<00:01:31.560> kill

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
as that mark turns red a guaranteed kill

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.950 
as that mark turns red a guaranteed kill
correct<00:01:32.460> exactly<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.570> that's<00:01:33.810> really

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
correct exactly and that that's really

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.870 
correct exactly and that that's really
the<00:01:34.170> idea<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.470> idea<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.770> when<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.369> mark<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
the idea the idea is when you mark you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.580 
the idea the idea is when you mark you
know<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.240> need<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:37.079> line<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.290> sight<00:01:37.439> with

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
know you need to have line of sight with

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.350 
know you need to have line of sight with
everyone<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.280> right<00:01:38.579> now<00:01:38.610> when<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.939> mark<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
everyone so right now when we mark the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.640 
everyone so right now when we mark the
icons<00:01:39.630> are<00:01:39.810> great<00:01:40.049> if<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.229> don't<00:01:40.320> have<00:01:40.470> line

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
icons are great if you don't have line

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.020 
icons are great if you don't have line
of<00:01:40.680> sight<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.400> course<00:01:41.430> when<00:01:41.729> you're<00:01:41.850> using

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
of sight so of course when you're using

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.490 
of sight so of course when you're using
the<00:01:42.180> mirror<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.780> look<00:01:42.899> under<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> door

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
the mirror to look under the door

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.260 
the mirror to look under the door
they're<00:01:44.220> very<00:01:44.549> automatically<00:01:45.090> because

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
they're very automatically because

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.399 
they're very automatically because
there's<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.540> door<00:01:45.689> between<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.290> enemy

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
there's a door between you and the enemy

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.590 
there's a door between you and the enemy
so<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.009> really<00:01:47.189> about<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.909> know<00:01:48.000> observing

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
so it's really about you know observing

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.749 
so it's really about you know observing
getting<00:01:48.930> into<00:01:49.110> position<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.740> then<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.670> know

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
getting into position and then you know

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.789 
getting into position and then you know
going<00:01:51.270> around<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.200> writing<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
going around and then writing for the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.920 
going around and then writing for the
right<00:01:52.950> people<00:01:53.159> waiting<00:01:53.520> for

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
right people waiting for

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.990 
right people waiting for
and<00:01:54.350> then<00:01:54.440> hunting<00:01:55.160> on<00:01:55.280> your<00:01:55.400> enemies<00:01:55.670> but

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
and then hunting on your enemies but

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.730 
and then hunting on your enemies but
there<00:01:56.180> are<00:01:56.300> some<00:01:56.810> weapons<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.560> could

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
there are some weapons that you could

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.290 
there are some weapons that you could
actually<00:01:57.920> use<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.580> get<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.730> red<00:01:58.910> mark<00:01:59.120> through

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
actually use and get a red mark through

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.090 
actually use and get a red mark through
a<00:01:59.360> door<00:01:59.510> right<00:01:59.570> like<00:01:59.870> the<00:02:00.170> shotgun<00:02:00.530> is<00:02:00.650> exactly

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
a door right like the shotgun is exactly

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.230 
a door right like the shotgun is exactly
that's<00:02:01.340> what<00:02:01.430> we<00:02:01.550> show<00:02:01.700> at<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.910> end<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.090> the

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
that's what we show at the end of the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.030 
that's what we show at the end of the
demo<00:02:02.540> there's<00:02:03.140> two<00:02:03.320> guys<00:02:03.440> that<00:02:03.620> flip<00:02:03.860> tables

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
demo there's two guys that flip tables

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.920 
demo there's two guys that flip tables
and<00:02:04.520> then<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:05.090> go<00:02:05.210> with<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.390> shotgun<00:02:05.600> the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
and then you go with the shotgun the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.420 
and then you go with the shotgun the
shotgun<00:02:06.290> special<00:02:06.620> ability<00:02:06.979> it<00:02:07.100> goes<00:02:07.250> through

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
shotgun special ability it goes through

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.580 
shotgun special ability it goes through
cover<00:02:07.670> when<00:02:07.940> it<00:02:08.060> executes<00:02:08.330> but<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.350> this

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
cover when it executes but is this

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.500 
cover when it executes but is this
advantage<00:02:10.100> if<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:10.340> can<00:02:10.520> say<00:02:10.729> is<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.270> it's<00:02:11.390> no

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
advantage if I can say is that it's no

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.270 
advantage if I can say is that it's no
