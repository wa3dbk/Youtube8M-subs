so<00:03:12.920> that's<00:03:13.069> that<00:03:13.220> eight<00:03:13.340> millimeter<00:03:13.700> bolt

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
so that's that eight millimeter bolt

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.220 
so that's that eight millimeter bolt
there<00:03:14.830> now<00:03:15.830> with<00:03:15.980> that<00:03:16.160> down<00:03:16.370> out<00:03:16.550> of<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.700> way

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
there now with that down out of the way

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.220 
there now with that down out of the way
we<00:03:18.230> can<00:03:18.349> access<00:03:18.770> that<00:03:18.950> last<00:03:19.750> eight<00:03:20.750> millimeter

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
we can access that last eight millimeter

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:38.890 
we can access that last eight millimeter
bolt

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.620 

you

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.470 

there<00:03:45.630> we<00:03:45.810> go<00:03:46.580> now<00:03:47.580> eight<00:03:47.820> millimeter<00:03:48.180> bolts

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
there we go now eight millimeter bolts

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.110 
there we go now eight millimeter bolts
out<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:50.660> blower<00:03:51.660> motor<00:03:51.930> drops<00:03:52.230> straight<00:03:52.560> down

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
out a blower motor drops straight down

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.490 
out a blower motor drops straight down
we<00:03:54.120> can<00:03:54.210> go<00:03:54.270> ahead<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.480> pull<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.720> out<00:03:54.810> it's<00:03:55.380> now

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
we can go ahead and pull it out it's now

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.870 
we can go ahead and pull it out it's now
completely<00:03:55.860> free<00:03:56.070> now<00:03:56.520> there's<00:03:56.700> nothing

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
completely free now there's nothing

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.280 
completely free now there's nothing
wrong<00:03:56.940> with<00:03:57.060> ours<00:03:57.330> so<00:03:57.930> what<00:03:58.050> we're<00:03:58.140> going<00:03:58.230> to

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
wrong with ours so what we're going to

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
wrong with ours so what we're going to
do<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.440> we're<00:03:58.560> going<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.800> put<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.010> one<00:03:59.160> right

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
do is we're going to put this one right

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.230 
do is we're going to put this one right
back<00:03:59.520> in<00:04:01.250> just<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.370> matter<00:04:02.580> just<00:04:02.880> pushing<00:04:03.150> it

back in just a matter just pushing it

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.400 
back in just a matter just pushing it
right<00:04:03.270> up<00:04:03.450> inside<00:04:05.810> I'll<00:04:06.810> try<00:04:06.990> and<00:04:07.140> line<00:04:07.290> up

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
right up inside I'll try and line up

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:14.449 
right up inside I'll try and line up

your screw holes with the mounting holes
there<00:04:14.730> that<00:04:15.030> can<00:04:15.209> be<00:04:15.330> a<00:04:15.360> difficult<00:04:16.280> venture

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
there that can be a difficult venture

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.530 
there that can be a difficult venture

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
check out this gasket we'll put it on

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:55.060 
check out this gasket we'll put it on
first

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.820 

there<00:04:56.070> we<00:04:56.190> go

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:16.000 

go<00:05:00.830> ahead<00:05:00.950> and<00:05:01.040> melt<00:05:01.160> it<00:05:01.340> up<00:05:01.460> in<00:05:01.610> there<00:05:15.010> make

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
go ahead and melt it up in there make

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.460 
go ahead and melt it up in there make
sure<00:05:16.190> that<00:05:16.280> your<00:05:16.490> as<00:05:17.420> I<00:05:17.540> said<00:05:17.780> the<00:05:17.930> cables<00:05:18.290> got

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
sure that your as I said the cables got

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.880 
sure that your as I said the cables got
to<00:05:18.560> stay<00:05:18.710> out<00:05:18.830> of<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:19.010> way<00:05:20.560> including<00:05:21.560> your

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
to stay out of the way including your

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:31.170 
to stay out of the way including your
cable<00:05:22.160> plug<00:05:22.340> I<00:05:23.620> can<00:05:24.620> get<00:05:24.770> that<00:05:24.980> in<00:05:25.190> there

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.950 

that'll<00:05:32.180> mount<00:05:32.390> up<00:05:32.600> just<00:05:32.930> like<00:05:33.140> that<00:05:33.410> a<00:05:37.930> lot<00:05:38.930> of

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
that'll mount up just like that a lot of

00:05:38.960 --> 00:06:02.580 
that'll mount up just like that a lot of
the<00:05:39.140> screw<00:05:39.380> holes<00:05:39.590> here

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.770 

easiest<00:06:03.590> way<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:03.800> do<00:06:03.950> this<00:06:03.980> is<00:06:04.310> to<00:06:04.600> get<00:06:05.600> one

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
easiest way to do this is to get one

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.800 
easiest way to do this is to get one
lined<00:06:06.050> up<00:06:06.700> so<00:06:07.700> we<00:06:07.790> got<00:06:07.970> one<00:06:08.120> here<00:06:10.480> lined<00:06:11.480> up<00:06:11.630> and

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
lined up so we got one here lined up and

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.780 
lined up so we got one here lined up and
screw<00:06:12.350> hole<00:06:12.500> above<00:06:12.770> it<00:06:15.430> push<00:06:16.430> it<00:06:16.580> up<00:06:16.670> into

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
screw hole above it push it up into

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.870 
screw hole above it push it up into
place<00:06:17.680> and<00:06:18.680> get<00:06:18.800> that<00:06:18.980> first<00:06:19.250> one<00:06:19.460> tightened

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
place and get that first one tightened

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:29.640 
place and get that first one tightened
in

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.650 

now<00:06:30.490> with<00:06:30.669> that<00:06:30.760> in<00:06:30.820> place<00:06:31.030> we<00:06:31.270> go<00:06:31.389> and<00:06:31.540> tighten

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
now with that in place we go and tighten

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.080 
now with that in place we go and tighten
the<00:06:31.840> remaining<00:06:32.169> screws<00:06:32.729> connect<00:06:33.729> our<00:06:33.880> wiring

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
the remaining screws connect our wiring

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.090 
the remaining screws connect our wiring
harness<00:06:34.320> remount<00:06:35.320> that<00:06:35.580> and<00:06:36.580> we're<00:06:36.729> all<00:06:36.820> set
