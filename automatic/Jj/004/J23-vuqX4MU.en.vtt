00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.920 
bit more fun fun games of the ball but
every<00:01:29.820> session<00:01:30.060> has<00:01:30.240> been<00:01:30.390> more<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
every session has been more of a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.649 
every session has been more of a
technical<00:01:31.400> emphasis<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.540> be

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
technical emphasis to it but to be

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.969 
technical emphasis to it but to be
honest<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.020> last<00:01:34.200> two<00:01:34.350> days<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.799> looked

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
honest in last two days I have looked

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.350 
honest in last two days I have looked
really<00:01:35.250> bright<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:36.000> there's<00:01:36.150> quite<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
really bright I think there's quite a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
really bright I think there's quite a
hunger<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.500> then<00:01:37.740> played<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> while

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
hunger because then played for a while

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.710 
hunger because then played for a while
so<00:01:38.610> he<00:01:38.670> might<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.090> pull<00:01:39.390> them<00:01:39.570> back

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
so he might just have to pull them back

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.170 
so he might just have to pull them back
a<00:01:39.750> bit<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.640> yeah<00:01:41.640> they've<00:01:41.820> looked<00:01:41.970> really

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
a bit but yeah they've looked really

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.630 
a bit but yeah they've looked really
sharp<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.840> bright<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.159> think<00:01:44.369> more

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
sharp really bright and I think more

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.490
