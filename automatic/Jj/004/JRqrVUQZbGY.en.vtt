00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
kind of interesting to me due to the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.790 
kind of interesting to me due to the
fact<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.980> Toby<00:00:20.970> actually<00:00:21.600> can<00:00:22.110> like<00:00:22.380> work

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800

through<00:00:23.130> time<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.580> space<00:00:23.730> or<00:00:24.060> whatever<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
through time and space or whatever and

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.840 
through time and space or whatever and
my<00:00:24.720> guy<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.260> only<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.590> like<00:00:25.770> hand<00:00:26.130> turn<00:00:26.340> combat
