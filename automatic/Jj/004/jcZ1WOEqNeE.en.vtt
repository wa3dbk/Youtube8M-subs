00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
good there you go you see so really I

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.860 
good there you go you see so really I
think<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> best<00:01:03.180> ways<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.390> deal<00:01:03.719> with

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
think one of the best ways to deal with

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.850 
think one of the best ways to deal with
this<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.489> try<00:01:05.790> cutting<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.330> half<00:01:06.420> oh<00:01:07.049> I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
this you can try cutting in half oh I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.490 
this you can try cutting in half oh I
saw<00:01:08.189> about<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.820> last<00:01:08.939> Aria<00:01:09.180> try<00:01:10.049> cutting<00:01:10.260> in

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
saw about that last Aria try cutting in

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.310 
saw about that last Aria try cutting in
half<00:01:10.820> that<00:01:11.820> might<00:01:12.689> work<00:01:13.640> probably<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> peak

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
half that might work probably the peak

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.570 
half that might work probably the peak
so<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> nice<00:01:16.770> sort<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.189> artistic

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
so you got a nice sort of artistic

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.789 
so you got a nice sort of artistic
effect<00:01:18.150> actually<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.409> what<00:01:19.530> might<00:01:19.770> be

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
effect actually I think what might be

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.149 
effect actually I think what might be
better<00:01:20.100> no<00:01:21.060> hammerfest<00:01:21.810> camera<00:01:22.740> will<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:22.979> good

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
better no hammerfest camera will be good

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.359 
better no hammerfest camera will be good
here<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.490> go<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.570> good<00:01:25.409> strike<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> front

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369

better<00:03:05.070> now<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.610> think<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:06.410> PCB<00:03:07.410> 13<00:03:07.739> 90<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.520> dash

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
better now I think so PCB 13 90 to dash

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.990 
better now I think so PCB 13 90 to dash
double<00:03:09.360> 05<00:03:09.980> so<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.220> not<00:03:11.280> like<00:03:11.430> an<00:03:11.550> American

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
double 05 so it's not like an American

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.130 
double 05 so it's not like an American
I'm<00:03:12.180> american<00:03:13.140> sitcom<00:03:13.790> um<00:03:14.790> see<00:03:15.750> how<00:03:15.840> father's

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
now we know that not easy to break the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.270 
now we know that not easy to break the
PCB<00:03:27.959> with<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.230> pair<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.470> pliers<00:03:28.680> let's<00:03:29.100> just

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
PCB with the pair of pliers let's just

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.729 
PCB with the pair of pliers let's just
break<00:03:30.090> into<00:03:30.299> their<00:03:30.570> this<00:03:31.110> but<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.380> think<00:03:31.470> that's

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
break into their this but I think that's

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.300 
break into their this but I think that's
where<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.570> wanted<00:03:33.570> from<00:03:33.660> their<00:03:33.950> burning<00:03:34.950> I

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
where the wanted from their burning I

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.490 
where the wanted from their burning I

can't do that we write this one here
let's<00:03:39.989> try<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.260> get<00:03:40.350> into<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.590> top<00:03:40.860> bit<00:03:41.040> where

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
let's try and get into the top bit where

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.850 
let's try and get into the top bit where
the<00:03:41.250> battery<00:03:41.519> compartment<00:03:41.670> was<00:03:42.590> not<00:03:43.590> know

the battery compartment was not know
what<00:03:44.070> what<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:44.670> key<00:03:44.790> wants<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.090> know<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.269> got

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
what what the key wants to know you got

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.960 
what what the key wants to know you got
our<00:03:45.720> there's<00:03:46.260> look<00:03:46.620> about<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:47.010> much<00:03:47.670> easier

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
our there's look about that much easier

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.000 
our there's look about that much easier
