00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.210
 Now I'm going to talk about the theory of 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.810
 the layers you will surely have heard 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.000
 many times this topic but for which 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.130
 it is not clear to him I will explain what is 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.219
 that of the activity of the layers the 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.519
 layer theory is the way to 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.910
 dress as if we were an onion 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:25.699
 by layers then normally the layers 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.180
 are composed of three or four layers the 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:32.830
 first layer is a layer 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.830
 which is in synthetic material 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.390
 It is usually cool more than 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.859
 it does is keep us dry this layer is 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.970
 very important because it is the one that separates 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.280
 the humidity of the body 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:50.500
 if for example in cold conditions 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.420
 there are also there are clothes that in 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.400
 instead of taking pullman carry others 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.770
 tissues that really keep warm 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.250
 but because the moisture evacuation is 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.930
 smaller in our latitudes then 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.510
 we should fill the first 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.140
 layer one pullman and the second one already 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:12.700
 it would be a slightly more thermal layer worth 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:16.899
 that the thickness would depend in this case he 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.229
 the kind of thickness it has can be 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.939
 light medium or expedition are the 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.490
 three types of thicknesses that there are for the 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.890
 intermediate layer that this layer in which 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.110
 let's say the one that shelters us the layer 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.780
 intermediate serves to maintain 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.520
 our heat attached to the body and the 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.280
 third layer that for example I carry 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.369
 today is a layer that what makes us 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.829
 isolates from the outside in this case a 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.250
 chalet proporta winds that also 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.619
 transpires then what gives us is the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.000
 mobility for example of the vest in the 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.670
 sleeves and in protection against 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.380
 wind or against the cold in case 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.780
 made it colder it would take you to a 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.170
 fourth layer that would be what is the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.750
 equivalent to a goretex parka or 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.970
 any material that is waterproof and 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.069
 breathable to avoid 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.649
 inclement weather that would be a lot 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.840
 wind 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.060
 rain snow or granite 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.970
 for we have regular us with the layers 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.370
 you do not have to remove all the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.080
 clothes of blows wearing several layers 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.700
 we provide the regular thermos 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.250
 depending on the temperature that goes 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.870
 doing in this case in my case of 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.360
 today for example when it has started to 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.269
 come up a way we have regular it 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.459
 raising the sleeves opening a little 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.160
 zipper and zipper 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:43.110
 that I have below with this simple 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.420
 maneuver and I get a thermoregulation 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.090
 good for you to avoid excess 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.530
 sweating so that when you have to 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.530
 to go down not to stay cold
