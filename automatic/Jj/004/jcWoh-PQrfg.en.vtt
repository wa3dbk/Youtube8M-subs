00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
to confirm and this my main computer is

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.550 
to confirm and this my main computer is
going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.449> getting<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.989> antec<00:01:04.739> 1200<00:01:05.299> watt

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
going to be getting the antec 1200 watt

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.830 
going to be getting the antec 1200 watt
so<00:01:07.560> I'm<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.979> basically<00:01:08.700> taking<00:01:09.510> both<00:01:09.689> of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
so I'm gonna be basically taking both of

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.890 
so I'm gonna be basically taking both of
them<00:01:09.960> apart<00:01:10.350> are<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:11.610> doing<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> cable

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
them apart are we doing the cable

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.990 
them apart are we doing the cable
management<00:01:13.049> making<00:01:13.740> them<00:01:13.890> even<00:01:14.010> neater<00:01:14.340> even

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
management making them even neater even

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.460 
management making them even neater even
better<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.780> unacceptable<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
better because this is unacceptable to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.429 
better because this is unacceptable to
me<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.720> make<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.990> neither<00:01:19.110> cuz

second 5970 next week so this computer

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.760 
second 5970 next week so this computer
is<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.100> quad<00:01:41.970> fire<00:01:42.470> after<00:01:43.470> all<00:01:43.590> my

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
is going to have quad fire after all my

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.100 
is going to have quad fire after all my
tests<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.540> comparisons<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> triple

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
tests and comparisons with a triple

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.870 
tests and comparisons with a triple
cross<00:01:46.259> fire<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:47.100> i<00:01:47.189> will<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.399> doing<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
cross fire because i will be doing the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.800 
cross fire because i will be doing the
quad<00:01:48.090> fire<00:01:48.299> two<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.840> my<00:01:49.259> main<00:01:49.470> pc<00:01:49.909> so<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.780> is

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
quad fire two in my main pc so this is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.499 
quad fire two in my main pc so this is
going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.140> running<00:01:52.350> 259<00:01:53.189> 70s<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.360> is

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
going to be running 259 70s and this is
