that's one song a little bit of

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.669 
that's one song a little bit of
difference<00:00:12.030> between<00:00:12.540> two<00:00:12.780> because<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.200> their

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
difference between two because of their

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.200 
difference between two because of their
kind<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.190> different<00:00:14.549> than<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.790> same<00:00:14.940> like

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
kind of different than the same like

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.230 
kind of different than the same like
because<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:16.379> one<00:00:16.590> has<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> 22-minute<00:00:17.550> pixel<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
because this one has a 22-minute pixel a

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.630 
because this one has a 22-minute pixel a
twenty<00:00:18.840> point<00:00:19.080> two<00:00:19.439> megapixel<00:00:19.770> sensor<00:00:20.520> in

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
twenty point two megapixel sensor in

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.460 
twenty point two megapixel sensor in
there<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.150> one<00:00:21.359> has<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> 18<00:00:21.930> megapixel

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
there and this one has the 18 megapixel

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.170 
there and this one has the 18 megapixel
sensor<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.430> pitches<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.000> one

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
sensor in it so the pitches on this one

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.400 
sensor in it so the pitches on this one
might<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> little<00:00:24.750> bit<00:00:24.900> better<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
might be a little bit better and the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.870 
might be a little bit better and the
video<00:00:25.650> might<00:00:25.980> be<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> little<00:00:26.340> bit<00:00:26.490> better<00:00:26.640> but

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
video might be a little bit better but

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.450

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
balloon so it was like I can't just do

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.200 
balloon so it was like I can't just do
an<00:01:25.470> unfair<00:01:25.830> comparison<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.000> I

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
an unfair comparison like that but I

one<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> main<00:01:29.280> things<00:01:29.579> I've<00:01:29.790> noticed

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
one of the main things I've noticed

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.850 
one of the main things I've noticed
about<00:01:30.270> these<00:01:30.659> cameras<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.439> little<00:01:31.619> so

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
about these cameras is just little so

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.340 
about these cameras is just little so
differences<00:01:32.460> between<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.880> two<00:01:33.079> you<00:01:34.079> got<00:01:34.200> your

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
differences between the two you got your

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.690 
differences between the two you got your
shutter<00:01:34.530> button<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.890> both<00:01:35.040> side<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.579> got

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
shutter button on both side but you got

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.700 
shutter button on both side but you got
one<00:01:35.970> all<00:01:36.210> squirts<00:01:36.509> right<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:37.110> right<00:01:37.439> next<00:01:37.590> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
one all squirts right here right next to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.649 
one all squirts right here right next to
shutter<00:01:37.950> button<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.310> corner<00:01:38.640> Sony<00:01:38.880> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
shutter button on that corner Sony and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.179 
shutter button on that corner Sony and
on<00:01:39.780> here<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.110> right<00:01:40.290> next<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.740> Modoc

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
on here it's right next to the Modoc

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.889 
on here it's right next to the Modoc
well<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.030> said<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.329> fine<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.780> see

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
well just like I said it's fine but see

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.350 
well just like I said it's fine but see
the<00:01:43.079> mode<00:01:43.290> dial<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> Sony<00:01:44.189> that's<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the mode dial and the Sony that's on the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.870 
the mode dial and the Sony that's on the
other<00:01:45.509> side<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.460> okay<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.520> know

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
other side so it's like okay you know

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.460 
other side so it's like okay you know
like<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.060> said<00:01:48.180> no<00:01:48.420> subtle<00:01:48.689> difference<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.049> one

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
like I said no subtle difference but one

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.679 
like I said no subtle difference but one
thing<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:50.009> say<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.149> may<00:01:51.299> be<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.509> little

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
thing I can say that it may be a little

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.590 
thing I can say that it may be a little
nitpicking<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.350> my<00:01:52.470> opinion<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:54.270> one

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
nitpicking in my opinion but this one

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.359 
nitpicking in my opinion but this one
the<00:01:54.720> mold<00:01:54.930> I'll<00:01:55.170> kind<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.530> continuously

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the mold I'll kind of just continuously

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.810 
the mold I'll kind of just continuously
turns<00:01:56.759> where<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:58.500> more<00:01:58.710> down<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:58.950> stops<00:01:59.610> at

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
turns where the more down here stops at

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.459 
turns where the more down here stops at
the<00:01:59.909> movie<00:02:00.180> button<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:00.899> like<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.259> said

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
the movie button so it's like I said

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.819 
the movie button so it's like I said
it's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:02.420> little<00:02:03.420> subtle<00:02:03.750> thing<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.710> know

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
it's a little subtle thing but you know

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.880 
it's a little subtle thing but you know
is<00:02:05.630> I'm<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.899> kind<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.140> nitpicking<00:02:07.500> at<00:02:07.710> that

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
is I'm just kind of nitpicking at that

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.600 
is I'm just kind of nitpicking at that
but<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.099> don't

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
but I don't

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.360 
but I don't
I<00:02:09.170> mean<00:02:10.170> break<00:02:10.470> your<00:02:10.649> experience<00:02:11.069> using<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
I mean break your experience using the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.670 
I mean break your experience using the
camera<00:02:11.700> now<00:02:11.849> far<00:02:12.450> as<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> button<00:02:13.020> layout

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
camera now far as the button layout

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.220 
camera now far as the button layout
there's<00:02:14.400> pretty<00:02:14.819> Simula<00:02:15.510> in<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.959> same

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
there's pretty Simula in the same

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.229 
there's pretty Simula in the same
fashion<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.190> like<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:17.519> said<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.819> mode<00:02:18.000> on

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
fashion is that like I said the mode on

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.539 
fashion is that like I said the mode on
the<00:02:18.629> Canon<00:02:19.140> t3i<00:02:19.319> on<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.069> right<00:02:20.220> hand<00:02:20.430> side

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
the Canon t3i on the right hand side

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.089 
the Canon t3i on the right hand side
instead<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> left<00:02:21.239> hand<00:02:21.569> side<00:02:21.860> but<00:02:22.860> if<00:02:23.010> you

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
instead of the left hand side but if you

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.059 
instead of the left hand side but if you
flip<00:02:23.340> them<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> back<00:02:23.909> here<00:02:24.920> you're<00:02:25.920> gonna

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
flip them to the back here you're gonna

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.649 
flip them to the back here you're gonna
take<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> look<00:02:26.580> like<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.940> movie<00:02:27.150> buttons<00:02:27.540> in

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
take a look like the movie buttons in

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.920 
take a look like the movie buttons in
the<00:02:27.750> same<00:02:27.959> place<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.819> arm<00:02:30.060> focus<00:02:30.629> in<00:02:30.810> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the same place the arm focus in the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.839 
the same place the arm focus in the
digital<00:02:31.260> zoom<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.680> digital<00:02:32.069> zoom<00:02:32.340> zoom<00:02:32.700> out

digital zoom and digital zoom zoom out

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.670 
digital zoom and digital zoom zoom out
there<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.720> got<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.260> know<00:02:34.379> like<00:02:34.409> your

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
there and you got you know like your

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.990 
there and you got you know like your
directional<00:02:35.129> pad<00:02:35.340> buttons<00:02:35.700> here<00:02:35.819> they're

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
directional pad buttons here they're

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.690 
directional pad buttons here they're
like<00:02:36.959> one<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.349> main<00:02:37.560> differences<00:02:37.829> between

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
like one of the main differences between

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.580 
like one of the main differences between
these<00:02:39.090> two<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.599> I<00:02:39.810> talked<00:02:40.079> about<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.379> in<00:02:40.560> my

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
these two and I talked about this in my

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.940 
these two and I talked about this in my
review<00:02:40.860> with<00:02:41.129> my<00:02:41.280> Canon<00:02:41.519> t3i<00:02:41.849> is<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.950> this

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
review with my Canon t3i is that this

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.520 
review with my Canon t3i is that this
bad<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.579> green<00:02:44.940> flips<00:02:45.239> out<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:46.290> if<00:02:46.379> you<00:02:46.500> want

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
bad this green flips out so if you want

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.009 
bad this green flips out so if you want
to<00:02:46.739> do<00:02:46.829> like<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.040> selfie<00:02:47.549> or<00:02:47.750> video<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.900> yourself

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
to do like a selfie or video of yourself

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.780 
to do like a selfie or video of yourself
you<00:02:49.379> can<00:02:49.530> see<00:02:49.739> if<00:02:50.010> you're<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.370> shot<00:02:50.609> or<00:02:50.760> not

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
you can see if you're in the shot or not

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.000 
you can see if you're in the shot or not
things<00:02:51.180> like<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.750> that's<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.829> big

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
things like this so that's a big

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.410 
things like this so that's a big
advantage<00:02:53.129> when<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.549> comes<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:54.000> doing<00:02:54.209> one

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
advantage when it comes to doing one

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.319 
advantage when it comes to doing one
like<00:02:54.599> some<00:02:54.840> videos<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.349> yourself<00:02:55.650> because

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
like some videos of yourself because

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.780 
like some videos of yourself because
when<00:02:57.329> it<00:02:57.450> comes<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.900> sony<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:59.310> only<00:02:59.609> thing

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
when it comes to the sony the only thing

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.690 
when it comes to the sony the only thing
this<00:02:59.909> thing<00:02:59.970> has<00:03:00.299> is<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.540> typical<00:03:01.470> strip<00:03:01.700> just

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
this thing has is a typical strip just

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.949 
this thing has is a typical strip just
like<00:03:02.819> my<00:03:03.980> rx100<00:03:04.980> mark<00:03:05.370> -<00:03:05.519> god<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.450> got<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.599> total

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
like my rx100 mark - god you got a total

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.869

well<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.180> lot<00:03:45.510> of<00:03:45.540> times<00:03:45.840> if<00:03:46.049> you<00:03:46.139> got<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.470> right

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
well a lot of times if you got the right

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.879 
well a lot of times if you got the right
lens<00:03:46.919> and<00:03:47.879> you<00:03:48.030> just<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.540> mean<00:03:49.199> just<00:03:49.440> zoom<00:03:49.739> it

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
lens and you just I mean just zoom it

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.229 
lens and you just I mean just zoom it
out<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.310> can<00:03:50.430> probably<00:03:50.639> get<00:03:50.879> most<00:03:51.120> of

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
out and you can probably get most of

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.240 
out and you can probably get most of
them<00:03:51.419> I<00:03:51.690> mean<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.560> area<00:03:52.739> you're<00:03:52.980> trying<00:03:53.190> to

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
them I mean the area you're trying to

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.009 
them I mean the area you're trying to
get<00:03:53.370> with<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.579> wide-angle<00:03:53.819> lens<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:54.629> it<00:03:54.750> doesn't

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
get with a wide-angle lens so it doesn't

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.400 
get with a wide-angle lens so it doesn't
really<00:03:55.139> matter<00:03:55.459> but<00:03:56.459> when<00:03:56.699> it<00:03:56.790> comes<00:03:56.970> down<00:03:57.120> to

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
really matter but when it comes down to

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.720 
really matter but when it comes down to
like<00:03:58.410> what<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.889> want<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.099> use<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.220> camera<00:03:59.459> for
