I<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:44.280> know<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:44.670> if<00:00:45.270> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
I think that you know what if you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.779 
I think that you know what if you
recreate<00:00:46.260> something<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.160> exists<00:00:47.640> already

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
recreate something that exists already

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.660 
recreate something that exists already
that's<00:00:48.539> pretty<00:00:48.809> boring<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.460> great

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
that's pretty boring and it's a great

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.930 
that's pretty boring and it's a great
skill<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.390> know<00:00:51.899> how<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.670> because<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.789> can

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
skill to know how to do because you can

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.209 
skill to know how to do because you can
always<00:00:54.090> incorporate<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.930> skill<00:00:55.230> later<00:00:55.500> when

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
always incorporate that skill later when

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.270 
always incorporate that skill later when
I<00:00:56.250> draw<00:00:56.610> I'm<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.390> interested<00:00:57.629> in

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
using illustration markers these are so

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.600 
using illustration markers these are so
versatile<00:02:03.659> they<00:02:04.380> could<00:02:04.710> be<00:02:04.829> used<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.460> many

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
versatile they could be used in so many

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.160

ways and in fact you're going to see me
use<00:02:07.350> these<00:02:08.340> markers<00:02:08.879> on<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.179> few<00:02:10.080> different

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
use these markers on a few different

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.190 
use these markers on a few different
layers<00:02:10.790> of<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.180> work<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.750> you're<00:02:12.989> seeing

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
layers of the work that you're seeing

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.910 
layers of the work that you're seeing
right<00:02:13.410> now

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
right now

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.890 
right now
but<00:02:14.700> I'm<00:02:14.819> just<00:02:14.970> getting<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.360> first<00:02:15.540> layer<00:02:15.870> of

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
but I'm just getting the first layer of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.720 
but I'm just getting the first layer of
color<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.530> it's<00:02:17.069> almost<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.580> an

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
color in it's almost like an

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.490 
color in it's almost like an
underpainting<00:02:18.239> for<00:02:18.630> those<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.050> who<00:02:19.260> are

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
might seem that the colors are off and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.790 
might seem that the colors are off and
they<00:02:25.739> are<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:27.300> know<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:28.319> blue<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.709> the

hair the red on the face that's going to

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.720 
hair the red on the face that's going to
peak<00:02:31.050> through<00:02:31.290> later<00:02:31.560> when<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.220> start<00:02:32.550> putting

the end of this video so I'm looking at
the<00:02:49.350> entire<00:02:50.100> picture<00:02:50.400> I'm<00:02:51.000> trying<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.780> kind<00:02:51.930> of

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
the entire picture I'm trying to kind of

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.350 
the entire picture I'm trying to kind of
tie<00:02:52.290> everything<00:02:52.319> together<00:02:53.040> because<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:54.120> gets

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
tie everything together because it gets

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.809 
tie everything together because it gets
tricky<00:02:54.810> when<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.500> when<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.280> put<00:02:56.489> different

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
tricky when you when you put different

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.410 
tricky when you when you put different
photographs<00:02:57.569> in<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:58.769> know<00:02:58.860> it's<00:02:59.010> almost<00:02:59.160> like

and you know this step right here with
the<00:03:15.090> paint<00:03:15.269> markers<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.870> going<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.560> help<00:03:16.739> with

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
the paint markers is going to help with

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.620 
the paint markers is going to help with
that<00:03:17.069> you're<00:03:17.760> going<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.940> see<00:03:18.090> me<00:03:18.239> use<00:03:18.269> color

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
that you're going to see me use color

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.110 
that you're going to see me use color
pencil<00:03:19.079> as<00:03:19.200> well<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.650> put<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.609> sheet<00:03:20.850> of<00:03:20.970> paper

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
pencil as well I put a sheet of paper

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.560 
pencil as well I put a sheet of paper
there<00:03:21.650> because<00:03:22.650> when<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.060> can<00:03:24.269> mix

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
there because when you you you can mix

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.599 
there because when you you you can mix
these<00:03:24.780> markers<00:03:25.290> but<00:03:25.829> you're<00:03:26.040> going<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.400> need

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
these markers but you're going to need

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.880 
these markers but you're going to need
to<00:03:26.790> wipe<00:03:27.000> off<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.390> tips<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:28.170> for<00:03:28.410> instance<00:03:28.739> I

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
to wipe off the tips so for instance I

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.380 
to wipe off the tips so for instance I
could<00:03:28.950> use<00:03:29.190> two<00:03:29.459> different<00:03:29.579> colors<00:03:29.820> with<00:03:30.269> the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
could use two different colors with the

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.900 
could use two different colors with the
paint<00:03:30.600> markers<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.859> I<00:03:32.160> could<00:03:32.370> use<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.670> tips

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
paint markers and I could use the tips

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.150 
paint markers and I could use the tips
to<00:03:33.090> blend<00:03:33.359> them<00:03:33.570> but<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.109> don't<00:03:34.350> want<00:03:34.709> the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
to blend them but you don't want the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.360 
to blend them but you don't want the
paint<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.489> dry<00:03:35.820> in<00:03:35.970> there<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.630> always<00:03:37.370> after

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
paint to dry in there so I always after

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.520 
paint to dry in there so I always after
I<00:03:38.400> finish<00:03:39.090> blending<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.630> colors<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.109> wipe<00:03:40.350> it

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
I finish blending the colors I wipe it

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.229 
I finish blending the colors I wipe it
off<00:03:40.680> on<00:03:40.859> another<00:03:41.310> sheet<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.640> paper<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:42.150> it

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
off on another sheet of paper and it

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.080 
off on another sheet of paper and it
works<00:03:42.420> like<00:03:42.660> new<00:03:42.840> again

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
works like new again

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.259 
works like new again

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
I'm tired you know I keep that promise

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.449 
I'm tired you know I keep that promise
that<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:09.900> made<00:04:10.109> to<00:04:10.139> myself<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.799> do<00:04:10.889> one<00:04:11.100> work<00:04:11.310> of

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
that I made to myself to do one work of

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.360 
that I made to myself to do one work of
art<00:04:11.639> per<00:04:11.790> day<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.410> you<00:04:13.410> know<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.680> think<00:04:13.950> that

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
art per day and you know I think that

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.460 
art per day and you know I think that
you<00:04:14.670> could<00:04:14.819> get<00:04:15.000> more<00:04:15.180> sophisticated<00:04:15.470> results

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
you could get more sophisticated results

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.219 
you could get more sophisticated results
with<00:04:17.010> actual<00:04:17.459> painting<00:04:17.880> but<00:04:18.570> these<00:04:18.959> come<00:04:19.200> a

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
with actual painting but these come a

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.529 
with actual painting but these come a
very<00:04:19.650> close<00:04:20.010> second<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.669> they're<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.239> really

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
very close second and they're a really

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.110 
very close second and they're a really
cool<00:04:21.870> material<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.680> try<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.190> if<00:04:23.760> worse<00:04:23.940> comes

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
cool material to try and if worse comes

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.610 
cool material to try and if worse comes
to<00:04:24.240> worst<00:04:24.510> if<00:04:24.690> I<00:04:24.780> don't<00:04:24.960> like<00:04:25.140> what<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.349> do<00:04:25.470> I

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
to worst if I don't like what I do I

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.740 
to worst if I don't like what I do I
could<00:04:25.950> always<00:04:26.099> put<00:04:26.729> some

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
could always put some

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.530 
could always put some
fool<00:04:27.900> paint<00:04:28.140> well<00:04:28.800> there<00:04:29.670> is<00:04:29.820> actual<00:04:30.120> paint<00:04:30.390> on

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
fool paint well there is actual paint on

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.960 
fool paint well there is actual paint on
the<00:04:30.630> inside<00:04:30.660> but<00:04:31.500> I<00:04:31.740> could<00:04:32.070> what<00:04:32.640> I'm<00:04:32.730> trying

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
the inside but I could what I'm trying

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.670 
the inside but I could what I'm trying
to<00:04:33.000> say<00:04:33.210> is<00:04:33.420> I<00:04:33.600> could<00:04:33.780> do<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.140> traditional

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
to say is I could do the traditional

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.250 
to say is I could do the traditional
process<00:04:34.890> right<00:04:35.760> on<00:04:35.880> top<00:04:36.120> of<00:04:36.300> this<00:04:36.450> I<00:04:38.870> think<00:04:39.870> of

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
process right on top of this I think of

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.290 
process right on top of this I think of
these<00:04:40.410> materials<00:04:41.040> just<00:04:41.370> as<00:04:41.580> means<00:04:41.880> like

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
these materials just as means like

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.910 
these materials just as means like
there's<00:04:42.570> some<00:04:42.780> artists<00:04:43.260> that<00:04:43.410> define

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
there's some artists that define

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.180 
there's some artists that define
themselves<00:04:44.130> as<00:04:44.550> painters<00:04:45.470> or<00:04:46.470> people<00:04:47.070> that

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
themselves as painters or people that

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.040 
themselves as painters or people that
draw<00:04:47.460> you<00:04:48.000> know<00:04:48.090> they<00:04:48.270> just<00:04:48.480> like<00:04:48.720> they

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
draw you know they just like they

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.660 
draw you know they just like they
pigeon-toed<00:04:49.470> themselves<00:04:50.040> into<00:04:50.280> one<00:04:50.490> category

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
pigeon-toed themselves into one category

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.270 
pigeon-toed themselves into one category
I<00:04:51.240> think<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.260> know<00:04:52.380> being<00:04:52.590> an<00:04:52.740> artist<00:04:53.040> is

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
I think you know being an artist is

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.280 
I think you know being an artist is
about<00:04:53.580> being<00:04:54.090> an<00:04:54.240> image<00:04:54.540> maker<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:55.110> there's

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
about being an image maker and there's

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.380 
about being an image maker and there's
so<00:04:55.590> many<00:04:55.740> ways<00:04:56.010> to<00:04:56.700> do<00:04:56.850> that<00:04:57.000> today

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
so many ways to do that today

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.500 
so many ways to do that today
and<00:04:57.740> if<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:59.070> label<00:04:59.340> yourself<00:04:59.640> is<00:05:00.060> just<00:05:00.090> one

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
and if you label yourself is just one

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.870 
and if you label yourself is just one
thing<00:05:00.780> it's<00:05:01.080> it's<00:05:01.260> ridiculous

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
thing it's it's ridiculous

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.270 
thing it's it's ridiculous
