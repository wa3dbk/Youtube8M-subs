00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.420
 let's go guys once more 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.549
 the first incorrect bullet to the right and 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.949
 Let's move as close as we can 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.099
 from the second goal and leave the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.579
 beacon in the back seat 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.579
 OK 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:34.380
 the reverse gear to the right and to the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.760
 Let's now guide us in the rear view mirror. 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.780
 central analyzes from behind to disappear is the hour 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.780
 that I'm going to stop 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:57.310
 everything went to the left and now I go 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:01.000
 enter until you have aligned the side of the car 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.710
 in case the tire hit as it hit the 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.070
 people are going to put the first gear 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.560
 also and turn everything to the right 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.710
 only realize that you do not have space 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.479
 enough ahead of us to be able to 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.030
 align the car so I'll pull the 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.520
 car driving me in the side mirror 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.340
 until you realize that the end of the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.340
 car it will take off the curb 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:33.479
 when installed in the middle 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.030
 is the time I'll stop flying spin 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.610
 all to the left and put a rule 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.210
 because if I continue, it will hit 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:47.700
 So I do not want to knock, I'll finish with 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.590
 werre everything to the left slowly until 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.220
 the side of the car align with the middle 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.250
 thread 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.180
 remembering that this is the third and last 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.180
 movement 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.770
 so the car the line I stop 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:12.600
 cock direction with two shots to the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.860
 Beacon can leave sent out does not 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.260
 space 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:22.739
 I'll take a defendant again all 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.590
 correction is necessary to take a defendant to be able to 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.300
 leave because your name is dr 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.590
 I will not have room to leave 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.320
 left arrow 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.300
 all left so with the rear view mirror 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.990
 to align with the goal 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.420
 I'm going to stop everything to the left, not everything. 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.230
 three turns left arrow to 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.480
 right 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.690
 Look at the end of the street and I can go on with 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.690
 safety
