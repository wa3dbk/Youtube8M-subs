00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.699 
again you can see the fiber salesman
wheel<00:01:54.289> with<00:01:55.249> the<00:01:55.279> four<00:01:56.109> steps<00:01:57.109> on<00:01:57.319> the<00:01:57.409> way<00:01:57.439> out

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
wheel with the four steps on the way out

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.940 
wheel with the four steps on the way out
and<00:01:58.069> also<00:01:58.880> basically<00:01:59.149> it's<00:01:59.569> carpeted<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.439> we

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
and also basically it's carpeted and we

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.069 
and also basically it's carpeted and we
obviously<00:02:01.159> got<00:02:01.669> a<00:02:01.729> Persian<00:02:02.179> rule<00:02:02.389> as<00:02:02.899> I'm

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
obviously got a Persian rule as I'm

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.809 
obviously got a Persian rule as I'm
walking<00:02:03.259> out<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.829> weight<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.189> it<00:02:04.490> towards

along ok now I've moved into all this is
his<00:03:04.330> engine<00:03:04.690> room<00:03:04.900> this<00:03:05.170> they<00:03:05.380> threw<00:03:05.620> one<00:03:05.650> of

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
his engine room this they threw one of

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.030 
his engine room this they threw one of
the<00:03:05.950> top<00:03:06.160> arches<00:03:06.640> as<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.720> can<00:03:07.900> see<00:03:08.110> because<00:03:08.380> we

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
the top arches as you can see because we

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.010 
the top arches as you can see because we
have<00:03:09.310> been<00:03:09.610> doing<00:03:09.790> some<00:03:09.970> coastal<00:03:10.390> passes<00:03:10.780> work

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
have been doing some coastal passes work

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.960 
have been doing some coastal passes work
in<00:03:11.560> our<00:03:11.739> data<00:03:11.980> sheets<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.310> can<00:03:12.430> actually<00:03:12.640> see

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
in our data sheets you can actually see

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.110 
in our data sheets you can actually see
that<00:03:13.150> on<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.480> top<00:03:13.690> we've<00:03:13.959> got<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.410> Merlin

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
that on the top we've got the Merlin

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.750 
that on the top we've got the Merlin
fourth<00:03:16.120> stage<00:03:16.390> battery<00:03:16.780> management<00:03:16.989> system

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
fourth stage battery management system

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.580 
fourth stage battery management system
we've<00:03:18.760> got<00:03:18.970> basically<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.570> red<00:03:19.840> car<00:03:20.080> filters

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
we've got basically the red car filters

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.699 
we've got basically the red car filters
with<00:03:20.830> which<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.790> you're<00:03:22.000> over<00:03:22.180> on<00:03:22.330> them

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
with which and you're over on them

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.100 
with which and you're over on them
basically<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:24.090> serve<00:03:25.090> as<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.390> engine<00:03:25.750> so<00:03:26.019> it

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
basically to serve as the engine so it

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.600 
basically to serve as the engine so it
should<00:03:26.260> have<00:03:26.380> one<00:03:26.500> filter<00:03:26.769> block<00:03:27.130> or<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:27.549> can

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
should have one filter block or you can

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.039 
should have one filter block or you can
just<00:03:27.940> waste<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.239> underwater<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.900> other

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
just waste the underwater to the other

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.590 
just waste the underwater to the other
and<00:03:29.950> they<00:03:30.070> actually<00:03:30.220> out<00:03:30.489> on<00:03:30.519> dual<00:03:30.910> tanks<00:03:31.239> port

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
and they actually out on dual tanks port

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.270 
and they actually out on dual tanks port
and<00:03:31.810> starboard<00:03:32.200> tanks<00:03:32.410> which<00:03:32.709> actually<00:03:33.070> take

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
and starboard tanks which actually take

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.820 
and starboard tanks which actually take
roughly<00:03:33.519> rain<00:03:33.850> about<00:03:34.060> 1,250<00:03:34.900> litres<00:03:35.260> first<00:03:35.560> up

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
roughly rain about 1,250 litres first up

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.150 
roughly rain about 1,250 litres first up
an<00:03:36.010> important<00:03:37.000> as<00:03:37.900> we<00:03:38.200> move<00:03:38.230> around<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.890> side

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
an important as we move around this side

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.920 
an important as we move around this side
you<00:03:39.430> can<00:03:39.640> actually<00:03:39.760> see<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.540> cooling

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
you can actually see that the cooling

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.630 
you can actually see that the cooling
system<00:03:41.290> on<00:03:41.410> our<00:03:41.470> dash<00:03:41.829> is<00:03:42.010> an<00:03:42.160> engine<00:03:42.489> is

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
system on our dash is an engine is

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.880 
system on our dash is an engine is
basically<00:03:42.850> there<00:03:43.390> with<00:03:43.510> the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
basically there with the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.930 
basically there with the
Borman<00:03:45.989> f100<00:03:46.989> each<00:03:47.140> exchanger<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.610> as<00:03:48.790> you

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
Borman f100 each exchanger and as you

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.350 
Borman f100 each exchanger and as you
can<00:03:49.090> see<00:03:49.329> we've<00:03:49.660> got<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.959> clarify<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.440> take<00:03:50.799> off

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
can see we've got to clarify a take off

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.020 
can see we've got to clarify a take off
with<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.570> seek<00:03:53.170> evolved<00:03:53.680> then<00:03:54.549> I'm<00:03:54.670> moving

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
with the seek evolved then I'm moving

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.920 
with the seek evolved then I'm moving
