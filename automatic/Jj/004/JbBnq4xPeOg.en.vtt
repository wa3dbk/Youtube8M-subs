00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Re-repairing a broken Gibson headstock.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The Midtown as it arrived. An older headstock repair gave up in transit.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The previous finish work was dull and grainy.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The refinish on the back of the headstock was so thick that the serial number was obscured. Note the unrepaired crack through the tuner hole.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Overspray on the truss rod nut, string nut and around the cover

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The back of the neck was oversprayed leaving a dry, textured look.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Getting started on the repair

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We used structural epoxy to reattach the headstock and to fill in the missing bits of overlay / cracks. The tape forms a dam to help the epoxy build up at the edges without running over.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Smoothing out the transition

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Sanded flush and just about ready for refinishing

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Since the material had built up so much in the last repair, we had to chemically remove the finish down to the wood to recover the stamped numbers / letters.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Making a veneer for the trussrod cavity

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Flattened and ready to go

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Veneer glued in place

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And trimmed to shape

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Color coat

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Adding the clear coats

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Rolling the tape over itself creates a smooth break between the new and old finishes, which will disappear once rubbed out.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Clear coating the rear

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Sanded smooth, polished and reassembled
0:02:34.000,0:02:30.000
The dull finish of the previous repair is no more.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
An invisible transition between old and new finishes
