00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.059
 gregorio has a very difficult one right now 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:08.190
 phase you know because of levy, but I mean 

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:10.380
 basically a difficult phase 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.820
 Anyway, I want to ask you 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:20.760
 that you have a little patience with him 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:28.350
 Patience he is cool can take care of 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:30.930
 I can not believe that 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.340
 you can not give it you are else 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.840
 always the last one to me the monthly 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.030
 student submits and submits this 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.560
 you are the first one so far that good 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.560
 I have to note in the calendar because that 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.899
 unbelievable I still understand 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.710
 not something that should be so funny 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.390
 what's up you might have one 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.090
 problem or bad mood no 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.550
 problem i have a problem i think rather 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.260
 that you have a problem and I over 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.940
 made me laugh because of it 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.829
 I'm not even the first one is what is with 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.270
 you go pablo obviously you have one 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.530
 problem otherwise there would be no reason for it 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.910
 that you are me in this way and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.199
 but I should not have it right 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.650
 I am right and laugh 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.530
 me out 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.060
 i make you out you are my man you 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.500
 you are a man you are like all you realize 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.880
 not at all the ones you are facing 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.470
 provoked and what we do to others 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.580
 triggered it does not matter, I did not 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.170
 the least idea of what she herself 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.640
 understand what I tell you when you enter 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.049
 Man, you are just not in the world 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.189
 able to notice something in the other one 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.420
 you are not able to 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.400
 Feel what the other person needs 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.510
 you are not like me and accepted 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.060
 not what in the other person 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.740
 has triggered and can not focus on anything 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.259
 what you do not and they still hurt us 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.460
 continue from that, anyway, no one knows what 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.470
 you what I suspect you are coming from 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.150
 the House 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.120
 That is not always when you are so bad 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.860
 it is the fault of Herrmann 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.470
 sorry how awkward of 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.180
 the other appears quite typical as well 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.240
 always right or not what was wrong with 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.240
 him 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:02:00.040
 So what does she or I ask why I ask 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.040
 have me
