00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.190
 versions of this recipe the how 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.470
 prefer to add in the cream 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.869
 or a yolk to mix well 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.550
 other ingredients prefer to combine 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.830
 instead of onion or salmon 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.570
 guys take pen and paper I'm going to 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.660
 give you a recipe will consist of 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.890
 ice cream to prepare curry paste 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.040
 we need 300 grams of pasta 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.360
 300 grams of veal 80 g of 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.690
 fresh bacon a teaspoon of curry 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.320
 strange peppers just 50 mm approx 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.910
 dry white wine 1 2 tablespoons of oil 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.539
 extra virgin 20 grams of approx 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.590
 grana cheese this recipe really is 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.930
 very simple and also very fast 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.210
 because the sauce will be cooked so that the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.550
 pasta give so we dip ours 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.239
 pasta in plenty of water slightly 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.489
 salt 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.590
 I hear the butterflies you can use 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.500
 the pens I like the most 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.299
 we mix and wait for boiling e 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.740
 we cook the pasta for the indicated time 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.759
 on the packaging and now we prepare 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 the sauce 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.170
 I have prepared a beautiful e 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.299
 very good veal cut into 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.860
 knife you see positive little ones 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.049
 my butcher helped me 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.079
 trust or my dad and here I have 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.320
 always cut the pancetta into small pieces 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.299
 fresh 80 grams are enough 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.220
 now we move directly into 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.130
 pan I have already warmed up a lot 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:46.680
 a pan and we first isolate the pancetta 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.979
 at this stage we do not add oil 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.250
 precisely because we will use fat 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.250
 of pancetta 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.930
 sustained flame and turn the same pro 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.930
 2 3 minutes 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.130
 at this point we also add i 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.130
 small pieces of veal 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.080
 we always keep a sustained flame e 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:18.230
 we turn often so as to brown 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:21.170
 also this paper our subject is 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:26.600
 it is nicely browned and now 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.400
 we rise to taste we fade with wine 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.180
 dry white pd we always keep one 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.880
 nice lively flame ok 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.430
 we wait a while that it evaporates all the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:43.070
 ricoh and now we combine the most ingredient 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.110
 important is the curry and you know what 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.880
 I do a little add it too 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.620
 directly of the pasta 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.760
 so it will turn a little yellow and 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.760
 will buy a perfect one 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.569
 now back to our pan 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.500
 we mix well we cover with the 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.209
 cover lower and throw at 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.200
 culture until the end of cooking 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.569
 pasta is very good the pasta is ready 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.760
 and now we must do nothing but 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.189
 tasteless and but with our sauce 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.989
 I advise you not to go 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.579
 directly into the dark pasta because a 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.439
 little of the cooking water will help us 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:29.989
 also to prevent it from becoming too much 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:32.530
 dry so we set ourselves one 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:37.220
 We raise the flame in his skimmer 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:41.629
 book we are the pasta I recommend you 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:45.980
 keep the pasta a little al dente and di 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:48.700
 finish cooking in the pan do a 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.700
 how wonderful 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.800
 here it is the dough we're almost a little 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.530
 of fresh pepper before serving as 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.390
 oil then I wouldn't put it there because 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.290
 I think the bacon and has already done the 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.970
 his duty 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.340
 however in short if you want to add one or 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.530
 two spoons based on what you get 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.760
 like more 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:16.820
 let's turn off some parmesan cheese 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.709
 and we can go up a plate 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.780
 very simple but impressive from 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.460
 consume together with your family 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.720

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.850
 on great occasions 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.830
