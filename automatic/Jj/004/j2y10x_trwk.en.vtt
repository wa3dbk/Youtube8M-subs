secret doors or anything they wanted him

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.480 
secret doors or anything they wanted him
because<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:23.990> some<00:01:24.290> machine<00:01:24.710> or<00:01:25.040> other<00:01:25.190> that's

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
a corner there but yeah i'll save over

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.060 
a corner there but yeah i'll save over
the<00:01:44.659> slot<00:01:44.930> we<00:01:45.080> haven't<00:01:45.320> gone<00:01:45.470> significant

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
the slot we haven't gone significant

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.399 
the slot we haven't gone significant
distance<00:01:46.460> enough<00:01:46.729> to<00:01:46.970> warrant<00:01:47.659> an<00:01:47.900> entire<00:01:48.170> new

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
distance enough to warrant an entire new

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.670 
distance enough to warrant an entire new
oh<00:01:48.700> oh<00:01:51.970> yes<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.180> can<00:01:53.360> do<00:01:53.540> a<00:01:53.570> diagonal<00:01:53.840> blow<00:01:54.409> I

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
oh oh yes you can do a diagonal blow I

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.859 
oh oh yes you can do a diagonal blow I
forget<00:01:55.610> what<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.850> actual<00:01:56.090> bonuses<00:01:56.600> on<00:01:56.720> that

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
forget what the actual bonuses on that

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.100 
forget what the actual bonuses on that
are<00:01:57.080> um<00:01:57.409> I<00:01:58.340> think<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.790> diagonal<00:01:59.210> blow<00:01:59.390> is<00:01:59.689> kind

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
are um I think a diagonal blow is kind

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.260 
are um I think a diagonal blow is kind
of<00:02:00.229> like<00:02:00.380> halfway<00:02:00.710> between<00:02:01.130> an<00:02:01.520> overhead<00:02:01.939> blow

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
of like halfway between an overhead blow

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.190 
of like halfway between an overhead blow
and<00:02:02.659> and<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:04.520> sideways<00:02:05.000> blow<00:02:05.330> so<00:02:05.600> it's<00:02:05.750> like<00:02:05.930> a

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
and and a sideways blow so it's like a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.320 
and and a sideways blow so it's like a
little<00:02:06.710> less<00:02:06.979> accuracy<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.790> little<00:02:08.149> more

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
little less accuracy and a little more

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.660 
little less accuracy and a little more
damage<00:02:10.450> it's<00:02:11.450> harder<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.140> pull<00:02:12.440> off<00:02:12.670> just

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
damage it's harder to pull off just

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.220 
damage it's harder to pull off just
because<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.880> have<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.090> do<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> diagonal<00:02:14.810> motion

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
because you have to do a diagonal motion

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.910 
because you have to do a diagonal motion
with<00:02:15.530> your<00:02:15.560> mouse<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.989> it's<00:02:17.989> just<00:02:18.290> more

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
with your mouse and it's just more

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.979 
with your mouse and it's just more
nothing<00:02:19.280> than<00:02:19.519> just<00:02:19.910> doing<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.330> full<00:02:20.570> overhead

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
nothing than just doing a full overhead

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.030

hockey<00:02:44.269> cause<00:02:45.049> I<00:02:45.170> mean<00:02:45.349> you<00:02:45.409> could<00:02:45.560> pause<00:02:45.859> and

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
big big room big room go job oh yeah

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.540 
big big room big room go job oh yeah
yeah<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.220> don't<00:03:25.400> want<00:03:25.579> to<00:03:25.669> accidentally

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.430 

you<00:03:28.940> know<00:03:29.000> what<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:33.110> don't<00:03:33.230> want<00:03:33.350> to

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
you know what you don't want to

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.790 
you know what you don't want to
accidentally<00:03:33.950> jump<00:03:34.340> into<00:03:34.490> people<00:03:34.910> um<00:03:35.350> so

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.090 

what's<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:41.320> special<00:03:42.320> moves<00:03:42.500> our<00:03:42.590> space<00:03:42.830> bar

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
what's the special moves our space bar

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.210 
what's the special moves our space bar
that's<00:03:43.460> why<00:03:43.610> so<00:03:44.270> special<00:03:44.780> move<00:03:45.130> special<00:03:46.130> move

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
that's why so special move special move

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.980 
that's why so special move special move
forward<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.030> oh<00:03:48.160> right<00:03:49.600> special<00:03:50.600> hold

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
forward and oh right special hold

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.620 
forward and oh right special hold
special<00:03:51.440> move<00:03:51.590> mouse<00:03:52.100> up<00:03:52.400> is<00:03:52.730> RAM<00:03:53.240> with<00:03:53.480> your

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
special move mouse up is RAM with your

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.850 
special move mouse up is RAM with your
forehead<00:03:54.250> special<00:03:55.250> move<00:03:55.340> mouse<00:03:55.580> down<00:03:55.910> is<00:03:56.860> duck

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
forehead special move mouse down is duck

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.920 
forehead special move mouse down is duck
so<00:03:58.490> if<00:03:58.580> you<00:03:58.700> move<00:03:58.880> forward<00:03:59.090> special<00:03:59.810> move

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
so if you move forward special move

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.410 
so if you move forward special move
mouse<00:04:00.140> down<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:01.070> conduct<00:04:01.520> do<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:01.940> little<00:04:02.150> duck

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
mouse down you conduct do a little duck

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:10.470 
mouse down you conduct do a little duck
slide<00:04:03.940> it's<00:04:05.110> not<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.170> useful<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.920> head<00:04:10.130> but

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
slide it's not that useful the head but

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.540 
slide it's not that useful the head but
is<00:04:11.480> massively<00:04:12.380> damaging<00:04:12.890> to<00:04:12.980> yourself<00:04:13.340> and

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
is massively damaging to yourself and

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.670 
is massively damaging to yourself and
also<00:04:14.210> really<00:04:14.630> not<00:04:14.810> useful<00:04:15.050> so<00:04:15.410> I<00:04:15.440> wouldn't

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
also really not useful so I wouldn't

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.759 
also really not useful so I wouldn't
suggest<00:04:15.770> using<00:04:16.070> that<00:04:16.310> either<00:04:16.549> but<00:04:17.209> in<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:18.410> pinch

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
suggest using that either but in a pinch

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.880 
suggest using that either but in a pinch
I<00:04:19.130> guess<00:04:19.400> there's<00:04:19.670> no<00:04:20.480> maybe<00:04:21.350> I'll<00:04:21.470> find<00:04:21.680> a<00:04:21.769> way

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
I guess there's no maybe I'll find a way

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:39.070 
I guess there's no maybe I'll find a way
to<00:04:21.950> use<00:04:22.160> it<00:04:22.190> may<00:04:23.180> be<00:04:23.680> here<00:04:37.750> so<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:38.870> looks<00:04:39.020> like

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
to use it may be here so it looks like

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.480 
to use it may be here so it looks like
the<00:04:39.260> head<00:04:39.410> butts<00:04:39.650> really<00:04:39.830> good<00:04:40.130> for<00:04:40.340> just

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
the head butts really good for just

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.870 
the head butts really good for just
knocking<00:04:40.640> people<00:04:41.240> back

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:05:06.720

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
reeling it means you're knocking across

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.100 
reeling it means you're knocking across
the<00:05:08.680> room<00:05:08.890> when<00:05:09.640> you<00:05:09.760> stun<00:05:10.090> your<00:05:10.300> opponent<00:05:10.900> it
