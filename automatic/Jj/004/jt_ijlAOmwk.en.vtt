feet<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.770> still<00:01:32.070> planted<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.640> could<00:01:33.390> go

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
feet are still planted I could go

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.440 
feet are still planted I could go
farther<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.290> then<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.500> rotate<00:01:35.100> too<00:01:35.340> much<00:01:35.549> so

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
farther but then I rotate too much so

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.830 
farther but then I rotate too much so
Mike<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.110> come<00:01:37.590> all<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> way<00:01:37.920> up<00:01:38.070> here

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
Mike I just come all the way up here

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.160 
Mike I just come all the way up here
hold<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.530> 5<00:01:40.740> seconds<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.810> slowly<00:01:42.810> back<00:01:43.140> down

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
hold for 5 seconds and slowly back down

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.690 
hold for 5 seconds and slowly back down
so<00:01:43.860> that's<00:01:44.040> step<00:01:44.280> 1

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
so that's step 1

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.520 
so that's step 1
so<00:01:44.820> knees<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.210> line<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> hip<00:01:45.899> that's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
so knees in line with the hip that's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.810 
so knees in line with the hip that's
about<00:01:46.710> how<00:01:46.860> high<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.070> raise<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.520> correct

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
about how high you raise it correct

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.749 
about how high you raise it correct
great<00:01:48.509> maybe<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:49.079> above<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:50.159> all<00:01:50.460> about

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759

feeling the burn deep in my glutes here
and<00:02:21.070> I<00:02:22.070> slowly<00:02:22.430> lower<00:02:22.760> down<00:02:23.080> all<00:02:24.080> right

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
and I slowly lower down all right

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.970 
and I slowly lower down all right
step<00:02:25.400> 4<00:02:25.910> or<00:02:26.210> step<00:02:26.450> 3<00:02:26.810> you're<00:02:27.470> gonna<00:02:27.620> lift<00:02:27.950> up

step 4 or step 3 you're gonna lift up
again<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.460> is<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.790> common<00:02:32.120> mistake<00:02:32.210> runners

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
again this is the common mistake runners

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.780 
again this is the common mistake runners
make<00:02:32.990> it<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.620> needs<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.040> be<00:02:34.160> tabletop

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
make it this it needs to be tabletop

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.090 
make it this it needs to be tabletop
even<00:02:35.270> like<00:02:35.840> I'm<00:02:35.990> resting<00:02:36.380> two<00:02:36.560> glasses<00:02:36.890> of

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
even like I'm resting two glasses of

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.370 
even like I'm resting two glasses of
water<00:02:37.400> on<00:02:37.730> my<00:02:37.970> foot<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:38.959> me<00:02:39.910> step<00:02:40.910> 4<00:02:41.380> you

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
water on my foot and me step 4 you

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.680 
water on my foot and me step 4 you
really<00:02:43.040> want<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.340> challenge<00:02:43.520> your<00:02:43.790> glute<00:02:44.060> is

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
really want to challenge your glute is

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.440 
really want to challenge your glute is
to<00:02:44.870> slowly<00:02:45.140> internally<00:02:45.740> rotate<00:02:46.450> externally

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
to slowly internally rotate externally

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.510 
to slowly internally rotate externally
rotate<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.230> my<00:02:48.380> knee<00:02:48.440> just<00:02:48.830> goes<00:02:48.980> down<00:02:49.280> towards

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
rotate so my knee just goes down towards

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.780 
rotate so my knee just goes down towards
the<00:02:49.730> floor<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.300> then<00:02:51.050> back<00:02:51.260> up<00:02:51.370> down<00:02:52.370> towards

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
the floor and then back up down towards

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.930 
the floor and then back up down towards
the<00:02:52.880> floor<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.510> back<00:02:54.440> up<00:02:54.680> very<00:02:55.130> tough<00:02:55.550> to<00:02:55.790> do

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
the floor and back up very tough to do

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.020 
the floor and back up very tough to do
right<00:02:56.270> so<00:02:56.750> build<00:02:57.590> up<00:02:57.800> to<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.070> one<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.550> then<00:02:58.910> I

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
right so build up to this one and then I

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.290 
right so build up to this one and then I
slowly<00:02:59.300> lower<00:02:59.570> down<00:02:59.660> now<00:03:00.530> my<00:03:00.709> butt<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.300> burning

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
slowly lower down now my butt is burning

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.960 
slowly lower down now my butt is burning
now<00:03:02.480> but<00:03:03.380> that<00:03:04.040> lets<00:03:04.250> me<00:03:04.400> know<00:03:04.430> that<00:03:04.610> I've<00:03:04.940> just

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
now but that lets me know that I've just

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.000 
now but that lets me know that I've just
sent<00:03:05.390> messages<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:06.170> my<00:03:06.350> nerves<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.950> my

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
sent messages to my nerves and my

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.370 
sent messages to my nerves and my
gluteal<00:03:07.670> so<00:03:08.239> when<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.420> would<00:03:08.660> go<00:03:08.780> take<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.080> run

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
gluteal so when I would go take a run

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.860 
gluteal so when I would go take a run
they're<00:03:10.010> gonna<00:03:10.100> fire<00:03:10.489> engage<00:03:11.000> cuz<00:03:11.600> if<00:03:11.750> they

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
they're gonna fire engage cuz if they

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.789 
they're gonna fire engage cuz if they
don't<00:03:12.140> fire<00:03:12.500> any<00:03:12.739> age<00:03:13.989> on<00:03:14.989> one<00:03:15.200> side<00:03:15.500> when<00:03:15.769> I

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
don't fire any age on one side when I

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.250 
don't fire any age on one side when I
take<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.070> run<00:03:16.370> stride<00:03:16.790> then<00:03:17.299> this<00:03:17.510> whole<00:03:17.750> foot

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
take a run stride then this whole foot

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.960 
take a run stride then this whole foot
collapses<00:03:18.950> because<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.400> glutes<00:03:19.670> are<00:03:19.880> in

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
collapses because the glutes are in

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.210 
collapses because the glutes are in
charge<00:03:20.239> of<00:03:20.390> stabilizing<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.739> whole<00:03:21.950> lower

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
charge of stabilizing the whole lower

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.840 
charge of stabilizing the whole lower
quarter<00:03:23.090> okay<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:24.709> is<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:24.920> big<00:03:25.340> big<00:03:25.640> key

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
quarter okay so that is a big big key

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.979 
quarter okay so that is a big big key

knee up just a little higher maybe than

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.259 
knee up just a little higher maybe than
hip<00:03:42.830> level<00:03:43.040> but<00:03:43.280> what's<00:03:43.459> ever<00:03:43.640> appropriate

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
hip level but what's ever appropriate

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.910 
hip level but what's ever appropriate
and<00:03:44.390> feels<00:03:44.630> right<00:03:44.900> how<00:03:45.320> long<00:03:45.380> do<00:03:45.560> we<00:03:45.590> hold<00:03:45.799> it

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
and feels right how long do we hold it

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.690 
and feels right how long do we hold it
for<00:03:46.660> about<00:03:47.660> five<00:03:48.019> seconds<00:03:48.560> step<00:03:49.190> two<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:49.670> to

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
for about five seconds step two is to

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.940 
for about five seconds step two is to
move<00:03:49.940> into<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.209> 90<00:03:50.630> just<00:03:50.810> lift<00:03:51.110> once<00:03:51.560> again<00:03:51.830> the
