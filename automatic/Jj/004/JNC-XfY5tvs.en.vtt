00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.369
 if you are watching this now you think ah 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.119
 we are going to use a manual espresso machine 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.559
 to test 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.779
 that's what i thought when i got it for it 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.359
 first saw this, however, is a half 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.550
 automatic espresso machine 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.910
 what is then automatically on so he went 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.769
 this video tell coffee over there 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.480
 we start putting espresso on it 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.130
 filling the water reservoir that must 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.960
 on a good level are different 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.640
 make a foundation espresso 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.500
 then we turn the device on it goes 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.220
 light and when it is out with 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.260
 click 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.820
 so that that star means that fire 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.950
 that the element in the device is enough 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.590
 warmed up then we can have the coffee 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.510
 add what the piston do a scoop 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.340
 coffee in the gun 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.650
 this does not touch my like with a 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.500
 manual device this is done by the device 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.620
 is fully automatic we to 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.270
 tamped coffee in a gun 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.540
 you press it in the device and that goes 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.940
 pretty easy because the teeth 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.340
 sit in this and that's how you run I 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.620
 few powers and it is him 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.910
 just tighten securely while you do that 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.690
 so does coffee become for you 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.210
 pressed 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.040
 so is ready for use time to the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.110
 lever and in lever position 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.120
 for adding water 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.590
 you turn it to the right then what 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.240
 happens that the first one is very small 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.100
 a little water has to go over the coffee 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.380
 seized so that the flavors or as one 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.810
 nice and loose and then comes the 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.190
 rest of the water over it with well 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.200
 you can't just walk away 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.670
 going to the toilet , I know a lot about what to do 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.860
 and hot water supply must be yourself 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.930
 by turning back 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.030
 other than your flooded tables we 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.170
 You must do it yourself 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.659
 arrange for 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.030
 and then you get a cookie and espresso 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.950
 who is nice to make is only one 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.870
 one thing and that is a good one 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.270
 a roman layer that corresponds 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.880
 namely directly with the tamping of 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.320
 the coffee that this machine makes itself 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.970
 and arranges itself 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.430
 and he does not do that well and that is bad 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.990
 frustrating 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.710
 if you enjoyed your cup 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.299
 espresso 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.830
 then you can't just take it easy on the couch 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.450
 sit down no you actually have to 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.520
 you clean this device 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.880
 does not last long well what keeps 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.920
 that in 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.300
 you press a button to make it special 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.410
 to take out that is easy 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.600
 Besides 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.640
 and then you have a blemish here so filthy 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.569
 cookie that you have to go loose in 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.220
 the bin 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.640
 that is handy because it is 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.880
 there is a button below the gun 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.160
 if you press it then it does in one 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.720
 gun the book out so you do too 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.769
 not as hard to beat as half a bottle 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.239
 solid solid and kind french mind 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.060
 material and that actually applies to 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.220
 the whole device is well built 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.330
 materials are not from the upper 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.739
 class maybe march 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.140
 You don't feel that it will be that way 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.250
 can fall and it works of all 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.650
 that also applies to the milk 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.130
 foaming does what he has to do 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.890
 fine milk the question is now sometimes it 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.720
 device that for you if you for 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.489
 experiment with one even completely 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.319
 putting a cup of espresso is this 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.940
 device might be something for you 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.820
 it is just well built and lasts a long time 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.190
 probably due to the build quality 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.530
 and he just looks pretty disadvantageous 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.820
 that he does one thing himself and that is 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.980
 tamping the coffee 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.109
 you have no influence on that yourself 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.269
 is directly related to aroma layer 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.200
 who gets espresso in the coffee and who 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.880
 is not so good 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.190
 so you can't do anything about it and that is 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.790
 frustrating conclusion 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.790
 three and a half stars
