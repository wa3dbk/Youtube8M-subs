doesn't<00:01:49.470> state<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.890> benefit<00:01:50.520> well<00:01:51.329> enough

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
doesn't state the benefit well enough

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.749 
doesn't state the benefit well enough
but<00:01:52.350> that's<00:01:52.530> an<00:01:52.710> example<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> mean<00:01:53.460> by

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
but that's an example of what I mean by

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.649 
but that's an example of what I mean by
a<00:01:53.790> phrase<00:01:54.619> so<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.040> do<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.390> your<00:01:57.509> web

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
a phrase so if you do not have your web

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.719 
a phrase so if you do not have your web
address<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.530> not<00:01:58.680> memorable<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.399> would

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
address and it's not memorable I would

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.450 
address and it's not memorable I would
correct<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.270> would<00:02:01.200> correct<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.619> immediately

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
correct I would correct that immediately

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.210

on<00:02:02.579> all<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.850> your<00:02:02.969> vehicles
