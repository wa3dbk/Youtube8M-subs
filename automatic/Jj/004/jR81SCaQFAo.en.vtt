00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 for all the kids today we will make a video 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.210
 demonstration on all teaching customs 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.330
 then put in spiderman then the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.080
 first costume is this I'm thinking here 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.619
 now that also what you will have in 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.010
 at the beginning of the game 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.020
 then there is this base here 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.330
 no belt but this one looks 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:30.029
 ps3 exclusive just being this one 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:34.170
 the basic one then there is the costume from 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.540
 hybrid that see spiderman always with 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.950
 the normal suit but I turned into 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.610
 hybrid 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:47.579
 and then there's my black suite that would be 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:52.230
 the costume that unlocks at 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.780
 completing 104 100 of the game like 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.449
 see having all the goals at 100 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.180
 percent of all 20 percent 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.500
 all with seed the jets and pages 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.110
 cartoon obtained 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:11.490
 yet there are 700 flying around 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.630
 nothing and then there's the scarlett spider that 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:21.270
 in red costume normal color with 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:24.060
 from above to see pectoral up is true 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.189
 which then is the future foundation 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.880
 no, there was no black costume here 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.610
 classic then that would be the antecedent 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.630
 of 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.960
 this one in black sea then there is the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:43.210
 fondation that would be black with spider 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.760
 white then there is the denied area and that 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.580
 it would be black but a little gray 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:54.300
 and then there is the bif time that the gray 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:58.870
 dark mercury color with spiders of the 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:03.340
 phosphorescent cuts this is nothing here 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.800
 nice room there are goals that 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.840
 he says in the missions where everyone is a hundred 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.910
 percent to unlock the costume has 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.140
 said my blacks the process that of 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.920
 first and nothing this here this that 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.890
 we have and these tasks we use then there is 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.250
 even the birthday hat of 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.380
 birthday that is no longer there 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.160
 because in August they give it to another 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.600
 what they say about customs and yes 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.520

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.260
 December but instead I did some time ago 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.860

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.830

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.910
