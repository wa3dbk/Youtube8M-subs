that<00:01:30.649> part<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:30.979> going<00:01:31.069> to<00:01:31.130> be<00:01:31.190> thrown<00:01:31.610> up<00:01:31.850> in<00:01:32.119> a

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
that part is going to be thrown up in a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.210 
that part is going to be thrown up in a
little<00:01:32.630> clippie<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.200> then<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.679> section<00:01:34.039> out

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
little clippie and then the section out

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
wand it's incredible so when I curl my

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:00.609 
wand it's incredible so when I curl my
hair<00:01:58.580> i<00:01:58.729> literally<00:01:59.239> just<00:01:59.420> take<00:01:59.840> any<00:02:00.319> size

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
hair i literally just take any size

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.529 
hair i literally just take any size
piece<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.190> don't<00:02:01.399> have<00:02:01.489> a<00:02:01.520> preference<00:02:01.940> of<00:02:02.330> how

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
piece I don't have a preference of how

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.119 
piece I don't have a preference of how
big<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:03.410> know<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:03.560> don't<00:02:03.770> want<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:03.950> get<00:02:04.009> it

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:04.129 
big you know you don't want to get it

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:05.680 
big you know you don't want to get it
too<00:02:04.160> thick<00:02:04.610> because<00:02:04.729> then<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.179> curl<00:02:05.420> won't

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
too thick because then the curl won't

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.180 
too thick because then the curl won't
look<00:02:05.899> really<00:02:06.289> like<00:02:06.410> a<00:02:06.440> curl<00:02:06.679> it's<00:02:06.890> gonna<00:02:06.979> look

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
look really like a curl it's gonna look

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.460 
look really like a curl it's gonna look
just<00:02:07.250> more<00:02:07.640> like<00:02:07.789> a<00:02:07.819> huge<00:02:08.149> wave<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:09.050> what<00:02:09.440> I

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
just more like a huge wave so what I

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.900 
just more like a huge wave so what I
like<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.679> do<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:09.950> just<00:02:10.250> take<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.429> decent<00:02:10.670> amount

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
like to do is just take a decent amount

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.910 
like to do is just take a decent amount
and<00:02:11.300> then<00:02:11.720> curl<00:02:12.319> it<00:02:12.470> I<00:02:12.560> don't<00:02:12.770> have<00:02:12.890> a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
and then curl it I don't have a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.680 
and then curl it I don't have a
particular<00:02:13.310> way<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.790> curling<00:02:14.300> not<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.660> I

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
particular way of curling not that I

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.750 
particular way of curling not that I
curl<00:02:15.020> towards<00:02:15.470> or<00:02:15.590> away<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:16.400> whatever<00:02:16.550> I

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
curl towards or away just whatever I

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.400 
curl towards or away just whatever I
feel<00:02:17.000> like<00:02:17.120> curling<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.660> how<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:17.959> do<00:02:18.200> it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
feel like curling is how I do it

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.470 
feel like curling is how I do it
generally<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.489> other<00:02:19.670> side<00:02:19.940> of<00:02:20.060> my<00:02:20.150> head<00:02:20.330> I'll

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
generally the other side of my head I'll

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.330 
generally the other side of my head I'll
curl<00:02:20.720> away<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.200> this<00:02:21.379> side<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.620> looks<00:02:22.069> like<00:02:22.129> i'm

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
curl away and this side I looks like i'm

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.430 
curl away and this side I looks like i'm
curling<00:02:22.700> towards<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.780> just<00:02:23.930> depends<00:02:24.319> on

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
curling towards so it just depends on

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.710 
curling towards so it just depends on
how<00:02:24.590> i'm<00:02:24.709> feeling<00:02:24.769> that<00:02:25.160> day<00:02:25.310> now<00:02:26.300> i'm<00:02:26.450> curling

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
how i'm feeling that day now i'm curling

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.390 
how i'm feeling that day now i'm curling
away<00:02:26.989> so<00:02:27.050> i<00:02:27.260> kind<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.500> just<00:02:27.560> go<00:02:27.890> back<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.250> forth

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
away so i kind of just go back and forth

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.670 
away so i kind of just go back and forth
with<00:02:28.640> what<00:02:29.030> i<00:02:29.060> want<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.420> deal<00:02:29.540> with<00:02:29.569> it<00:02:29.750> and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
with what i want to deal with it and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.140 
with what i want to deal with it and
then<00:02:30.860> as<00:02:31.010> you'll<00:02:31.190> see<00:02:31.340> i'll<00:02:31.459> hold<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.790> on<00:02:31.910> for

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
then as you'll see i'll hold it on for

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.610 
then as you'll see i'll hold it on for
just<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.360> few<00:02:32.540> seconds<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:32.989> then<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.230> just<00:02:33.290> crimp

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
just a few seconds and then I just crimp

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.199 
just a few seconds and then I just crimp
it<00:02:33.739> down<00:02:33.920> into<00:02:34.220> my<00:02:34.310> hand<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.670> scrunch<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.180> a

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
it down into my hand and scrunch it a

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.320 
it down into my hand and scrunch it a
little<00:02:35.330> bit<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.720> curl<00:02:36.050> really<00:02:36.500> stays<00:02:36.769> and

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
little bit so that curl really stays and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.790 
little bit so that curl really stays and
has<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.480> time<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.690> really<00:02:38.989> set<00:02:39.349> while<00:02:39.620> it's

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
has the time to really set while it's

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.830 
has the time to really set while it's
hot<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.250> then<00:02:40.819> I<00:02:40.849> will<00:02:41.180> just<00:02:41.360> continue<00:02:41.629> this

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
hot and then I will just continue this

00:02:41.840 --> 00:03:03.660 
hot and then I will just continue this
around<00:02:42.080> my<00:02:42.200> entire<00:02:42.290> head

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.059 

as<00:03:03.730> I'm<00:03:04.540> done<00:03:04.720> curling<00:03:05.260> these<00:03:05.500> sections<00:03:05.920> i

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
as I'm done curling these sections i

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.830 
as I'm done curling these sections i
will<00:03:06.190> also<00:03:06.340> start<00:03:06.790> clip<00:03:06.970> by<00:03:07.060> clipping<00:03:07.330> them<00:03:07.660> up

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
will also start clip by clipping them up

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.260 
will also start clip by clipping them up
into<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.260> little<00:03:08.530> clip<00:03:08.800> going<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:09.970> opposite

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
into a little clip going to the opposite

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.460 
into a little clip going to the opposite
side<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.480> my<00:03:10.660> head<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:10.989> further<00:03:11.200> away<00:03:11.319> from

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
side of my head just further away from

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.530 
side of my head just further away from
my<00:03:11.770> hair<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.370> curls<00:03:12.700> kind<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.090> set<00:03:13.360> in

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
my hair and the curls kind of set in

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.690 
my hair and the curls kind of set in
that<00:03:13.720> clip<00:03:14.050> I<00:03:14.319> don't<00:03:15.069> know<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.340> just<00:03:15.370> worked

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
that clip I don't know it just worked

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.309 
that clip I don't know it just worked
