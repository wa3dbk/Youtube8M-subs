have<00:00:00.240> a<00:00:00.269> little<00:00:00.599> bit<00:00:00.860> the<00:00:01.860> emphasis<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.580> on<00:00:02.610> the

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
have a little bit the emphasis is on the

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.690 
have a little bit the emphasis is on the
two<00:00:03.030> we've<00:00:03.600> decided<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.350> timing<00:00:04.980> or<00:00:05.160> we<00:00:05.460> know

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
two we've decided the timing or we know

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.880 
two we've decided the timing or we know
that<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.060> timing<00:00:06.330> is<00:00:06.690> three<00:00:06.990> quarter<00:00:07.440> quarter

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
that the timing is three quarter quarter

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.310 
that the timing is three quarter quarter
one<00:00:08.160> so<00:00:08.940> we<00:00:09.090> have<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> three<00:00:09.480> quarter<00:00:09.900> quarter

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
one so we have a three quarter quarter

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.950 
one so we have a three quarter quarter
one<00:00:10.620> three<00:00:11.070> quarter<00:00:11.490> quarter<00:00:11.849> one<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.690> if<00:00:12.809> that

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
one three quarter quarter one so if that

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.990 
one three quarter quarter one so if that
audience<00:00:13.469> starts<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.889> crap<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> two<00:00:14.639> we

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
audience starts to crap on the two we

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.359 
audience starts to crap on the two we
should<00:00:15.030> not<00:00:15.630> be<00:00:15.900> encouraged<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.770> make<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.160> two

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
should not be encouraged to make the two

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.269 
should not be encouraged to make the two
much<00:00:17.640> stronger<00:00:18.109> but<00:00:19.109> we<00:00:19.500> should<00:00:19.710> make<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.070> two

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
much stronger but we should make the two

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.140 
much stronger but we should make the two
much<00:00:20.789> longer<00:00:22.100> if<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.369> are<00:00:23.490> doing<00:00:23.910> three

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
much longer if we are doing three

or one which step do you think is the

one<00:00:39.829> now<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.160> know<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.879> considered

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
one now that I know you have considered

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.260 
one now that I know you have considered
this<00:00:42.629> problem<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.379> quite<00:00:43.559> awhile<00:00:43.770> or<00:00:44.520> those

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
this problem for quite awhile or those

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
this problem for quite awhile or those
of<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.600> who<00:00:45.750> too<00:00:46.020> lazy<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.530> think<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.950> will<00:00:47.190> tell

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
of you who too lazy to think I will tell

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.910 
of you who too lazy to think I will tell
you<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.670> answer<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.840> third<00:00:49.200> step<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
you the answer the third step is the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.770 
you the answer the third step is the
quickest<00:00:50.460> step<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> jive<00:00:51.120> chassis<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
quickest step in the jive chassis and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.080 
quickest step in the jive chassis and
I'll<00:00:52.079> tell<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.500> why<00:00:54.649> this<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.890> because<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I'll tell you why this is because the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.119 
I'll tell you why this is because the
three<00:00:57.300> quarter<00:00:57.750> quarter<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.289> timing<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
three quarter quarter one timing is the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.029 
three quarter quarter one timing is the
time<00:00:59.609> spent<00:01:00.210> between<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.079> steps<00:01:01.350> for

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
time spent between the steps for

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.250 
time spent between the steps for
instance<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.149> first<00:01:03.420> step<00:01:03.570> between

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
instance if I do the first step between

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.410 
instance if I do the first step between
the<00:01:04.409> first<00:01:04.710> step<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.489> second<00:01:05.939> step<00:01:05.970> is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the first step and the second step is

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.230 
the first step and the second step is
three<00:01:07.049> quarters<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.770> beat<00:01:08.030> between<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
three quarters of a beat between the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.080 
three quarters of a beat between the
second<00:01:09.840> step<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.619> third<00:01:10.650> step<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.549> only<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
second step and the third step is only a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.499 
second step and the third step is only a
quarter<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:13.049> beat<00:01:13.260> after<00:01:14.250> which<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.909> am<00:01:15.150> able

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
quarter of a beat after which I am able

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.399 
quarter of a beat after which I am able
to<00:01:15.960> use<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.409> rest<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.950> beat<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:18.080> by<00:01:19.080> lower

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
to use the rest of that beat up by lower

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.620 
to use the rest of that beat up by lower
in<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> hill<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> three<00:01:21.210> quarter

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
in the hill so we do a three quarter

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.219 
in the hill so we do a three quarter
quarter<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.619> three<00:01:22.890> quarter<00:01:23.340> quarter<00:01:23.790> one

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
quarter or on three quarter quarter one

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.469 
quarter or on three quarter quarter one
so<00:01:25.229> that's<00:01:25.470> why<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.280> third<00:01:26.520> step<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
so that's why the third step is the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.280 
so that's why the third step is the
quickest<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:29.009> arrive<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.299> longest

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
quickest to arrive but the longest

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.740 
quickest to arrive but the longest
because<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.490> lower<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.970> heel<00:01:33.390> in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
because we have to lower that heel in

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.100 
because we have to lower that heel in
order<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:35.009> change<00:01:35.340> direction<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.750> one<00:01:36.930> more

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
order to change direction so one more

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.310 
order to change direction so one more
time<00:01:37.140> three<00:01:38.040> quarter<00:01:38.520> quarter<00:01:38.939> won't<00:01:39.320> record

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
time three quarter quarter won't record

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.940 
time three quarter quarter won't record
a<00:01:40.439> quarter<00:01:40.770> what<00:01:40.979> very<00:01:41.880> quick<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.899> arrive<00:01:43.229> but

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
a quarter what very quick to arrive but

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.359 
a quarter what very quick to arrive but
very<00:01:44.399> long<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.600> lower<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.079> heel<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.710> to

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
very long to lower that heel and to

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.420 
very long to lower that heel and to
change<00:01:47.729> direction<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.159> are<00:01:50.250> using

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
change direction so if we are using

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.300 
change direction so if we are using
three<00:01:50.880> quarter<00:01:51.270> quarter<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:51.810> time<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
three quarter quarter one time in the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.520 
three quarter quarter one time in the
third<00:01:53.610> step<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.720> quickest<00:01:57.170> we<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.290> now

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
third step is the quickest we are now

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.950 
third step is the quickest we are now
going<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.130> see<00:01:59.430> if<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.939> little<00:02:00.210> drive<00:02:00.659> action

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
going to see if that little drive action

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.840 
going to see if that little drive action
that<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.439> have<00:02:01.590> been<00:02:01.770> talking<00:02:02.070> about<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that we have been talking about the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.760 
that we have been talking about the
pendulum<00:02:03.390> swing<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.869> timing<00:02:04.350> it's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
pendulum swing and the timing it's

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.490 
pendulum swing and the timing it's
possible<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.430> do<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.909> music<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:07.020> first<00:02:07.259> piece

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
possible to do to music the first piece

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.199 
possible to do to music the first piece
of<00:02:07.530> music<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.069> will<00:02:08.220> choose<00:02:08.459> will<00:02:08.879> be<00:02:09.000> much

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
of music I will choose will be much

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.490 
of music I will choose will be much
slower<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:10.679> more

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
slower so we can see more

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.560 
slower so we can see more
really<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.130> drive<00:02:12.340> action<00:02:12.580> we<00:02:13.300> will<00:02:13.390> then

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
really the drive action we will then

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.600 
really the drive action we will then
speed<00:02:13.960> up<00:02:14.200> in<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.560> second<00:02:14.920> piece<00:02:15.070> of<00:02:15.250> music

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
speed up in the second piece of music

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.400 
speed up in the second piece of music
and<00:02:15.760> see<00:02:16.270> if<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.630> still<00:02:16.870> possible<00:02:17.350> to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
and see if it is still possible to

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.690 
and see if it is still possible to
maintain<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:18.400> same<00:02:18.670> movements<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.400> begin

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
maintain the same movements so to begin

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.730 
maintain the same movements so to begin
with<00:02:22.060> we<00:02:22.510> have<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.840> make<00:02:22.990> sure<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.530> the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
with we have to make sure that the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.800 
with we have to make sure that the
weight<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.370> 1<00:02:24.760> over<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.120> balls<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.780> feet

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
weight is 1 over the balls of the feet

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.790 
weight is 1 over the balls of the feet
even<00:02:26.350> before<00:02:26.800> we<00:02:27.010> begin<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.520> chassis<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:29.590> then

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
even before we begin to chassis we then

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.620 
even before we begin to chassis we then
make<00:02:30.040> sure<00:02:30.070> that<00:02:30.340> we<00:02:30.820> do<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.030> three<00:02:31.240> quarter

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
make sure that we do in three quarter

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.230 
make sure that we do in three quarter
bottle<00:02:31.959> one<00:02:32.110> time<00:02:32.350> in<00:02:32.730> along<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.880> speed<00:02:34.090> at

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
head ways anticipate the movement we are

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.729 
head ways anticipate the movement we are
swinging<00:02:42.880> underneath<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.780> head<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.200> create<00:02:44.440> a

swinging underneath the head to create a

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.880 
swinging underneath the head to create a
pendulum<00:02:45.220> swing<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:46.060> not<00:02:46.870> transferring<00:02:47.620> too

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
pendulum swing and not transferring too

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.650 
pendulum swing and not transferring too
much<00:02:48.100> weight<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.670> outside<00:02:49.090> foot<00:02:49.300> because

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
much weight to the outside foot because

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.340 
much weight to the outside foot because
every<00:02:49.870> cannot<00:02:50.140> swing<00:02:50.440> back<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:52.080> will<00:02:53.080> do<00:02:53.230> that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
every cannot swing back I will do that

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.320 
every cannot swing back I will do that
backwards<00:02:53.800> for<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.130> three<00:02:54.670> quarter<00:02:55.030> quarter

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
backwards for you three quarter quarter

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.590 
backwards for you three quarter quarter
one<00:02:56.100> let<00:02:57.100> in<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.310> hip<00:02:57.459> swing<00:02:57.700> underneath<00:02:58.090> the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
one let in the hip swing underneath the

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.410 
one let in the hip swing underneath the
head<00:02:58.810> not<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.470> head<00:02:59.770> swing<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.820> then<00:03:01.239> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
head not the head swing and then the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.060 
head not the head swing and then the
body<00:03:01.630> following<00:03:04.230> well<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.500> for<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.860> I'm

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
body following well just for you I'm

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.070 
body following well just for you I'm
going<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.370> try<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.610> same<00:03:06.970> exercise<00:03:07.540> but<00:03:07.780> this

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
going to try the same exercise but this

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.990 
going to try the same exercise but this
time<00:03:08.380> we're<00:03:08.620> going<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.920> speed<00:03:09.220> up<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.580> music

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
time we're going to speed up the music

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.390 
time we're going to speed up the music
and<00:03:10.120> see<00:03:10.450> if<00:03:10.630> I<00:03:10.780> can<00:03:10.989> try<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.320> maintain<00:03:11.650> the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
and see if I can try and maintain the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.390 
and see if I can try and maintain the
same<00:03:12.700> movement<00:03:15.180> whoa<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.950> sounds<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.370> bit

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
same movement whoa that sounds a bit

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.789 
same movement whoa that sounds a bit
quicker<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.090> let's<00:03:19.930> establish<00:03:20.170> our<00:03:20.530> weight<00:03:20.650> on

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
quicker so let's establish our weight on

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.470 
quicker so let's establish our weight on
the<00:03:20.890> balls<00:03:21.130> of<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.430> feet<00:03:21.459> before<00:03:21.760> we<00:03:21.970> start<00:03:22.330> to

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
the balls of the feet before we start to

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.479 
the balls of the feet before we start to
chassis<00:03:22.930> remember<00:03:23.560> keep<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.920> hip<00:03:24.070> swinging

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
chassis remember keep the hip swinging

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.150 
chassis remember keep the hip swinging
underneath<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.480> head<00:03:25.690> we<00:03:26.530> are<00:03:26.650> not<00:03:26.830> going<00:03:27.070> to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
underneath the head we are not going to

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.650 
underneath the head we are not going to
let<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.730> head<00:03:27.910> lead<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.269> way

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
let the head lead the way

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.750 
let the head lead the way
and<00:03:29.080> we<00:03:29.320> are<00:03:29.440> not<00:03:29.680> going<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.070> transfer<00:03:30.549> too

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
and we are not going to transfer too

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.430 
and we are not going to transfer too
much<00:03:31.000> weight<00:03:31.299> to<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.600> last<00:03:31.810> step<00:03:32.049> before<00:03:32.110> that

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
much weight to the last step before that

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.039 
much weight to the last step before that
we<00:03:32.680> cannot<00:03:32.950> change<00:03:33.280> directions<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:34.330> very

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
we cannot change directions a very

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.990 
we cannot change directions a very
natural<00:03:35.380> hip<00:03:35.769> action<00:03:35.950> underneath<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.820> head

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
natural hip action underneath the head

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.920 
natural hip action underneath the head
let's<00:03:37.690> take<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:37.959> look<00:03:38.170> at<00:03:38.260> that<00:03:38.410> from<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.799> back

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
let's take a look at that from the back

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.390 
let's take a look at that from the back
remember<00:03:40.930> into<00:03:41.230> swing<00:03:41.530> underneath<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.160> heads

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
remember into swing underneath the heads

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:50.680 
remember into swing underneath the heads
not<00:03:43.030> let<00:03:43.300> them<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.750> leave<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.590> body

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.589 

and<00:03:51.890> now<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.160> more<00:03:53.370> serious<00:03:53.670> note<00:03:54.030> let's

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
and now to a more serious note let's

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.910 
and now to a more serious note let's
look<00:03:54.900> at<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.290> back<00:03:55.530> rock<00:03:55.830> in<00:03:56.069> Drive<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:58.709> two

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
look at the back rock in Drive the two

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.740 
look at the back rock in Drive the two
most<00:03:59.130> important<00:03:59.640> things<00:03:59.670> we<00:04:00.150> have<00:04:00.330> discussed

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
most important things we have discussed

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.930 
most important things we have discussed
so<00:04:00.900> far<00:04:01.020> are<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.709> three<00:04:01.980> quarter<00:04:02.370> quarter<00:04:02.700> one

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
so far are the three quarter quarter one

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.720 
so far are the three quarter quarter one
timing<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:04.380> swing<00:04:04.770> action<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.459> jive

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
timing and the swing action in the jive

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.540 
timing and the swing action in the jive
so<00:04:06.630> as<00:04:06.810> we<00:04:07.020> have<00:04:07.170> seen<00:04:07.440> already<00:04:07.739> from<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
so as we have seen already from the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.280 
so as we have seen already from the
chassis<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.209> little<00:04:09.480> demonstration<00:04:09.780> I

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
chassis and the little demonstration I

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.559 
chassis and the little demonstration I
did<00:04:10.470> for<00:04:10.650> you<00:04:10.709> earlier<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.610> is<00:04:11.850> very<00:04:12.060> easy<00:04:12.209> to

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
did for you earlier it is very easy to

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.479 
did for you earlier it is very easy to
achieve<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.380> swing<00:04:13.500> action<00:04:14.010> in<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.280> chassis

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
achieve the swing action in the chassis

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.670 
achieve the swing action in the chassis
but<00:04:15.269> how<00:04:15.450> do<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.690> achieve<00:04:15.870> this<00:04:16.200> in<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.530> back

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
but how do you achieve this in the back

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.400 
but how do you achieve this in the back
Rock<00:04:17.479> basically<00:04:18.479> by<00:04:18.750> applying<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.260> same

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
Rock basically by applying the same

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.820 
Rock basically by applying the same
principles<00:04:20.030> once<00:04:21.030> we<00:04:21.419> have<00:04:21.570> completed<00:04:22.229> the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
principles once we have completed the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.379 
principles once we have completed the
action<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:23.840> a<00:04:25.040> chassis<00:04:26.040> we<00:04:26.580> are<00:04:26.729> on<00:04:26.910> the

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
action of a chassis we are on the

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.110 
action of a chassis we are on the
upswing<00:04:27.660> of<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.590> pendulum<00:04:28.950> movement<00:04:29.520> so<00:04:30.030> if

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
upswing of the pendulum movement so if

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.330 
upswing of the pendulum movement so if
we<00:04:30.270> are<00:04:30.360> going<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.810> do<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:30.990> back<00:04:31.229> Rock<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:32.010> should

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
we are going to do a back Rock it should

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.879 
we are going to do a back Rock it should
be<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.580> down<00:04:32.940> swing<00:04:33.419> in<00:04:33.690> order<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.500> swing<00:04:34.770> up

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
be a down swing in order to swing up

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.700 
be a down swing in order to swing up
again<00:04:35.280> so<00:04:36.180> we<00:04:36.360> have<00:04:36.540> completed<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.500> third

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
again so we have completed the third

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.700 
again so we have completed the third
step<00:04:38.160> of<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.820> drive<00:04:39.060> chassis<00:04:39.389> we<00:04:40.260> have<00:04:40.470> to

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
step of the drive chassis we have to

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.280 
step of the drive chassis we have to
down<00:04:41.070> swing<00:04:41.639> in<00:04:41.970> order<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.479> get<00:04:42.660> our<00:04:42.810> back<00:04:42.990> Rock

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
down swing in order to get our back Rock

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.670 
down swing in order to get our back Rock
in<00:04:44.130> order<00:04:44.430> to<00:04:44.580> get<00:04:44.729> the<00:04:44.880> action<00:04:45.330> correct<00:04:45.750> from

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
in order to get the action correct from

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.370 
in order to get the action correct from
the<00:04:47.070> last<00:04:47.310> step<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.880> chassis<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.510> feeling

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
the last step of the chassis the feeling

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.110 
the last step of the chassis the feeling
is<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.770> leg<00:04:49.919> is<00:04:50.100> swinging<00:04:50.490> backwards

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
is the leg is swinging backwards

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.120 
is the leg is swinging backwards
remember<00:04:51.720> our<00:04:52.260> body<00:04:52.500> weights<00:04:52.770> is<00:04:52.919> still

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
remember our body weights is still

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.840 
remember our body weights is still
forwards<00:04:53.640> so<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.510> first<00:04:55.070> points<00:04:56.070> of<00:04:56.220> contact

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
forwards so the first points of contact

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.420 
forwards so the first points of contact
to<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.030> floor<00:04:57.479> is<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.289> inside<00:04:58.800> edge<00:04:59.100> of<00:04:59.340> the

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
to the floor is the inside edge of the

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.090 
to the floor is the inside edge of the
back
