00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.149 
all of our best talent into midfield
playing<00:01:30.630> four<00:01:30.810> or<00:01:30.900> five<00:01:31.049> central<00:01:31.500> midfielders

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.640 
playing four or five central midfielders
of<00:01:32.579> course<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> whole<00:01:33.090> midfield<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.229> net

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
of course the whole midfield and the net

of course the whole midfield and the net
result<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.479> we're<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.810> trying

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
result of that is that we're all trying

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.200 
result of that is that we're all trying
to<00:01:37.380> come<00:01:37.619> inside<00:01:37.770> we've<00:01:38.340> got<00:01:38.369> no<00:01:38.700> natural

width<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.170> look<00:01:40.470> at<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.650> right<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.430> just

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
width if you look at it right and just

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.069 
width if you look at it right and just
to<00:01:41.759> put<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.150> into<00:01:42.270> basic<00:01:42.630> football<00:01:42.899> times

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
to put that into basic football times

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.520 
to put that into basic football times
it's<00:01:43.259> much<00:01:43.439> harder<00:01:43.850> for<00:01:44.850> us<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.869> break<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.229> team

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it's much harder for us to break a team

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.260 
it's much harder for us to break a team
like<00:01:46.680> Sunderland<00:01:47.040> down<00:01:47.369> when<00:01:47.909> you're<00:01:48.060> playing

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
like Sunderland down when you're playing

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.920 
like Sunderland down when you're playing
5v5<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> edge<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> books<00:01:49.920> rather<00:01:50.220> than

5v5 on the edge of the books rather than

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.600 
5v5 on the edge of the books rather than

one person on the wing vs1 fullback

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.190 
one person on the wing vs1 fullback
where<00:01:54.060> something<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.659> more<00:01:54.899> than<00:01:54.990> likely

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
where something is more than likely

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.380 
where something is more than likely
going<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> happen<00:01:55.829> if<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.310> analyze<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.240> match

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
going to happen if you analyze the match

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.030 
going to happen if you analyze the match
tonight<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.869> all<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.200> our<00:01:58.290> best<00:01:58.530> chances<00:01:58.890> they

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
tonight and all of our best chances they

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.219 
tonight and all of our best chances they
came<00:01:59.250> from<00:01:59.399> crosses<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.689> most<00:02:00.899> dangerous

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
came from crosses the most dangerous

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.100 
came from crosses the most dangerous
players<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> pitch<00:02:01.950> Ross<00:02:02.219> rebellion<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
players on the pitch Ross rebellion and

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.319 
players on the pitch Ross rebellion and
Walcott<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.130> proves<00:02:05.610> point<00:02:05.909> Walcott

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
Walcott and so that proves point Walcott

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.809 
Walcott and so that proves point Walcott
to<00:02:06.479> me<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.950> probably<00:02:07.950> one<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.459> foot<00:02:08.670> after

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
to me is probably one of the foot after

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.430 
to me is probably one of the foot after
Sanchez<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.660> first<00:02:09.869> attackers<00:02:10.319> I'd

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
Sanchez one of the first attackers I'd

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.320

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
put on the team sheet just because he

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.640

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
being linked to a check i think it's an
