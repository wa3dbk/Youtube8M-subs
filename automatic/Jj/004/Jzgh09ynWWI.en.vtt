00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.630
 Hello dear swami friends that I 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:17.230
 Master League sleeps and today I wanted you 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.509
 show the fridge and left so here 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.820
 refrigerator and u ask how does he 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:25.810
 it works but for a start it works 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.970
 we need a special piece of it strongly 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.880
 out boxing and and I keep the freezer so 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.859
 now we will go to my freezer and so 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.949
 here is this freezer as always it is crammed 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:48.629
 here is this azbox 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:55.530
 actually modulo right there 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:01:00.579
 ice is heard if you hear and as you see it 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:06.909
 It opens so incomprehensible to me than 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:12.090
 you can tell them now we have to 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:14.020
 insert this ice box fridge itself 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.540
 close the door of the refrigerator 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.180
 opening scene here ate upstairs 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.509
 make it easy to open and see here 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:29.140
 such a compartment there is everything we take and 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:30.780
 adds this thing is not very worth it 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.729
 expensive 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:40.799
 20 rubles at least we have twenty years 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.950
 and now we need to shove that jar 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.289
 colas 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.299
 by the way in this fridge fit two 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.369
 such a bank can also be said that this 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.880
 the fridge works just like 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.380
 real, that is, but from boxing you need 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.380
 periodically put the freezer because 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.170
 he water inside him defrost 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.149
 and turns into warm water and the same 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.039
 most with a refrigerator if the refrigerator 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.009
 not you teams business card he won't 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:12.390
 work so there is cold there can 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:12.390
 even listen to open our fridge 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:22.760

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:25.640

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.700
 Well, I will try now to take a thermometer 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.769

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.939

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.640

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.390
 I have no so here I am back with 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.829
 walks 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:51.319
 now let's take a look at our cola 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:03:01.370
 oh there i understand it am really 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:03:09.069
 cold we hand over this and it is already warm then 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:09.069
 there is already water there that is now 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:19.150
 warmed up and wait for the water right now 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.889
 5 put out a box in the freezer and 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.590
 put the poet back here and then 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.000
 will we have a refrigerator 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.669
 thermometers attack you at home and have not found on 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.739
 I think you should believe me that 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:35.989
 opinion no one meaning you from small 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.560
 channel cold that's all thank you for 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.109
 viewing 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.519
 I think you liked your refrigerator and 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:45.069
 snow and you try to do the same 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:50.209
 There is nothing difficult in principle 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:53.030
 just put the parts and get xbox 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.870
 and the xbox date you can find in any 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.870
 hardware store
