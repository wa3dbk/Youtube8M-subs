to get barreled or to get a tube it

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.149 
to get barreled or to get a tube it
doesn't<00:00:50.699> matter<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:50.909> you<00:00:51.300> call<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.539> if<00:00:52.159> done

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
doesn't matter what you call it if done

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.040 
doesn't matter what you call it if done
correctly<00:00:53.210> it's<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.659> most<00:00:54.780> awesome

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
correctly it's one of the most awesome

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.469 
correctly it's one of the most awesome
maneuvers<00:00:55.859> you<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.250> master<00:00:58.219> step<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.489> so

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
maneuvers you can master step one so

what<00:01:00.719> exactly<00:01:00.839> is<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.440> barrel<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.909> part

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
what exactly is a barrel it's the part

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.969 
what exactly is a barrel it's the part
of<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.479> wave<00:01:03.659> that<00:01:03.690> has<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.199> yet<00:01:04.259> broken<00:01:04.649> or

is<00:01:05.159> about<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.519> break<00:01:05.940> but<00:01:06.899> the<00:01:07.020> actual<00:01:07.320> barrel

is about to break but the actual barrel
or<00:01:07.860> tube<00:01:08.130> depends<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:08.970> wave<00:01:09.270> is

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479

to stick to the wall of the wave or get

out too far away from it the lip could
hit<00:01:47.429> you<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> head<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.630> would<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.780> a

hit you on the head and that would be a
