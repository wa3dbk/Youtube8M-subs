get<00:01:37.690> her<00:01:37.780> name<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.170> percent<00:01:38.500> no<00:01:38.740> my<00:01:39.010> Carbone

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
get her name to percent no my Carbone

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.390 
get her name to percent no my Carbone
actually<00:01:39.880> I<00:01:40.380> should<00:01:41.380> have<00:01:41.470> too<00:01:41.890> bad<00:01:42.040> I<00:01:42.250> was

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
actually I should have too bad I was

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.520 
actually I should have too bad I was
actually<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.960> me<00:01:44.080> would<00:01:44.230> have<00:01:44.290> been<00:01:44.350> better

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
actually for me would have been better

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.470 
actually for me would have been better

Thaksin you know and I think they had a
really<00:02:53.370> good<00:02:53.490> stuff<00:02:53.760> here<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.150> track<00:02:54.450> for

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
really good stuff here on this track for

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.360 
really good stuff here on this track for
how<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.860> ruts<00:02:56.190> were<00:02:56.460> four<00:02:57.360> hour<00:02:57.420> mark<00:02:57.660> pack<00:02:58.370> it

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
how the ruts were four hour mark pack it

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.430 
how the ruts were four hour mark pack it
was<00:02:59.520> soft<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.090> sticky<00:03:00.390> but<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.750> also<00:03:00.930> had<00:03:01.290> like

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
was soft and sticky but it also had like

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.290 
was soft and sticky but it also had like
kind<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.710> sketchy<00:03:01.980> hard<00:03:02.190> packed<00:03:02.400> deep<00:03:02.970> ruts
