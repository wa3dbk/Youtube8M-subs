00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
forever 21 charlotte russe they probably

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.850 
forever 21 charlotte russe they probably
won't<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.420> exact<00:01:04.019> same<00:01:04.409> clothing

because<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:06.000> i<00:01:06.150> said<00:01:06.180> people<00:01:06.720> actually

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
because like i said people actually

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.530
