clip on just plug comes with a little
bit<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:48.990> grease<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.649> put<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.040> there

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
bit of grease you can put that on there

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.270 
bit of grease you can put that on there
or<00:01:51.659> whatever<00:01:51.810> purpose<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.880> so<00:01:54.770> let's<00:01:55.770> start

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
or whatever purpose it is so let's start

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.609 
or whatever purpose it is so let's start
again<00:01:57.740> with<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.030> cold<00:02:00.030> air<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.170> need<00:02:01.469> if

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
again with the cold air so you need if

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.920 
again with the cold air so you need if
you<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:02.040> anyway<00:02:02.540> whatever<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.750> have

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930

you have this anyway whatever you have
as<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.350> need<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:06.030> clamp<00:02:06.329> lose<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.439> up

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
as we need to do that clamp lose that up

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.850 
as we need to do that clamp lose that up
10<00:02:09.030> Mille<00:02:09.239> volt<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:09.989> there<00:02:11.030> this

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
10 Mille volt in there this

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
10 Mille volt in there this
and<00:02:13.160> be<00:02:14.120> sensor<00:02:14.630> so<00:02:15.310> let<00:02:16.310> me<00:02:16.400> remove<00:02:16.670> this

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
and be sensor so let me remove this

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.900 
and be sensor so let me remove this
first<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.570> then<00:02:18.220> we'll<00:02:19.220> go<00:02:19.370> from<00:02:19.400> there<00:02:19.550> okay

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.950 

so<00:02:24.700> another<00:02:25.700> way<00:02:25.880> that<00:02:26.230> that's<00:02:27.800> move

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
so another way that that's move

00:02:28.960 --> 00:03:06.850 
so another way that that's move
just<00:02:34.690> set<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.200> side<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:06.440> get<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.740> that

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
just set it to the side to get to that

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.380 
just set it to the side to get to that
little<00:03:07.160> hole<00:03:07.640> right<00:03:08.090> there<00:03:09.459> so<00:03:10.459> just<00:03:11.030> put<00:03:11.240> this

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
little hole right there so just put this

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.050 
little hole right there so just put this
light<00:03:11.720> over<00:03:11.750> here<00:03:12.110> says<00:03:12.530> no<00:03:12.709> way<00:03:13.160> but<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:13.820> can

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
light over here says no way but I can

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:38.020 
light over here says no way but I can
see<00:03:14.270> what<00:03:14.420> I'm<00:03:14.510> doing<00:03:36.519> put<00:03:37.519> some<00:03:37.670> grease<00:03:37.880> on

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
see what I'm doing put some grease on

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.340 
see what I'm doing put some grease on
that<00:03:38.830> but<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:40.040> kid<00:03:40.760> came<00:03:40.940> with<00:03:41.230> ya

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
they said to put a good amount on it and

00:03:45.560 --> 00:04:43.340 
they said to put a good amount on it and
then<00:03:46.130> we

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.770 

hey<00:04:44.090> so<00:04:45.090> let's<00:04:45.390> take<00:04:45.660> this<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.910> slide<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.480> to

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
hey so let's take this and slide it to

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:59.390 
hey so let's take this and slide it to
where<00:04:49.380> next<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.800> go<00:04:54.890> so<00:04:55.890> again<00:04:57.050> we<00:04:58.050> need<00:04:58.230> to<00:04:59.190> get

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
where next to go so again we need to get

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.650 
where next to go so again we need to get
into<00:04:59.730> that<00:05:00.620> hole<00:05:01.620> right<00:05:01.650> there

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
into that hole right there

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:30.820 
into that hole right there
so<00:05:03.660> we<00:05:03.780> try<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:03.960> get<00:05:04.230> my<00:05:04.350> hand<00:05:04.590> in<00:05:04.740> there

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:42.650 

should<00:05:31.830> just<00:05:32.040> clip<00:05:32.460> on<00:05:37.940> grease<00:05:38.940> and<00:05:41.570> there<00:05:42.570> it

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
should just clip on grease and there it

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.960 
should just clip on grease and there it
is<00:05:45.560> I'll<00:05:46.560> get<00:05:46.710> in<00:05:46.830> there<00:05:47.010> and<00:05:47.250> it's<00:05:47.400> not<00:05:47.640> on

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
is I'll get in there and it's not on
