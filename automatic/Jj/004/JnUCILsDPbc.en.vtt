because you have to collect a urine

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.020 
because you have to collect a urine
sample<00:01:37.860> from<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> middle<00:01:38.670> part<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.970> your

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.050 
a sample from the beginning of the urine
stream<00:01:43.860> because<00:01:44.610> there's<00:01:44.820> less

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
stream because there's less
