never<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.210> pipes<00:01:39.450> are<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.689> invisible<00:01:40.049> like

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
never the pipes are like invisible like

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.399 
never the pipes are like invisible like
if<00:01:40.680> you've<00:01:40.860> got<00:01:41.040> through<00:01:41.250> them<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.290> can

if you've got through them and you can
basically<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.890> forever<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.909> one<00:01:45.149> thing

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
basically do forever but the one thing

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.819 
basically do forever but the one thing
that's<00:01:45.479> gonna<00:01:45.630> stop<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.380> hitting<00:01:46.619> the
