00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.120
 check out our offer show and it seems 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.210
 that I played my team is more and more 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.200
 Trendy fashion looks only past now 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:16.379
 ufam company calls analogue mt launched the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.270
 a clear video game that the messi or ten 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.240
 times our dear understanding 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.939
 only completely remodeled then it is 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.150
 a pretty little all-metal version 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.130
 with all new components and expensive 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.500
 it seems they have found a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.719
 burden of starvation with what is to be 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.489
 discarded they took everything for them and 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.160
 start using some some 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.960
 components of famicom to 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.180
 this nintendo face that the whole nintendo 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.789
 cute where the board on it according to them 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.210
 took a while not to cost four times 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.370
 plus the stroke of a normal plate would be 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.680
 woman problem on the board top that 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.800
 It's them all pretty much everything done to 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.559
 hand full of face components them 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.510
 see it here for $ 500 the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.730
 silence face will it be worth paying 500 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.030
 little ninety dollars 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.080
 Only thing is if you pay more 78 79 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.000
 dollars 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.640
 besides the $ 500 and he also has 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.409
 a part that is a hd plaque that 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.600
 You call her because hd you can? 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.400
 put a little piece of furniture for you to have 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.320
 big televisions gives a look shopping 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.750
 here then we throw an antenna 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.159
 big it makes sense you can have a 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.140
 resident on your computer to do 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.680
 practically the effect but will do 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.530
 It makes sense for you to pay $ 500 plus 90 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.119
 lc dollars 80 US dollars for you to play 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.409
 with a console that is neither original nor 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.560
 more fucking hell 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.869
 thought guy is a little bold proposal 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.149
 I thought it was cool to make one for me. 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.390
 but I guess I do not I think I do not 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.119
 would pay $ 500 on that console who 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.180
 already say that comes within the memory 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.840
 various games and 200 games of some ds 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.780
 thing and it's behaving like 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.119
 the American tapes and tapes of the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.939
 famicom that are the japanese 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.399

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.750
 You may need to win, buy this. 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.370
 but I find it a little difficult that 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.440
 happen mainly in brazil 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.760
 pay the price you would pay in the video game 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.440
 a generation 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.879
 in mexico more in this already mass 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.920
