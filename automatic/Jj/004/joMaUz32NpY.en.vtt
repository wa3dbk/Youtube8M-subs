it<00:04:15.970> kind<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.150> reminds<00:04:16.449> you<00:04:16.479> of<00:04:16.539> the<00:04:16.659> new

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
it kind of reminds you of the new

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.420 
it kind of reminds you of the new
Mission<00:04:17.049> Impossible<00:04:17.139> trailer<00:04:17.889> like<00:04:18.159> it's

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
Mission Impossible trailer like it's

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.770 
Mission Impossible trailer like it's
really<00:04:18.579> big<00:04:18.849> and<00:04:18.880> scope<00:04:19.329> there's<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.599> lot<00:04:19.690> of

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
really big and scope there's a lot of

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.779 
really big and scope there's a lot of
cool<00:04:19.900> action<00:04:20.109> sequences<00:04:20.709> but<00:04:20.949> I<00:04:21.190> think<00:04:21.669> it

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
cool action sequences but I think it

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.969 
cool action sequences but I think it
might<00:04:21.909> be<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.210> same<00:04:22.419> music<00:04:22.930> too<00:04:23.139> and<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.830> way

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
might be the same music too and the way

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.310 
might be the same music too and the way
it<00:04:24.039> like<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.490> fades<00:04:24.820> go<00:04:25.150> a<00:04:25.449> whole<00:04:25.659> tone<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:26.169> it

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
it like the fades go a whole tone of it

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.689 
it like the fades go a whole tone of it
it's<00:04:26.500> like<00:04:26.590> an<00:04:26.740> action<00:04:27.130> movie<00:04:27.280> but<00:04:27.490> it's

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
it's like an action movie but it's

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.610 
it's like an action movie but it's
really<00:04:27.909> dark<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.419> serious<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:29.139> like<00:04:29.349> the<00:04:29.500> way

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
really dark and serious I like the way

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.200 
really dark and serious I like the way
it's<00:04:29.830> at<00:04:29.949> least<00:04:30.220> being<00:04:30.400> promoted<00:04:30.759> I<00:04:31.030> don't

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
it's at least being promoted I don't

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.189 
it's at least being promoted I don't
know<00:04:31.270> it's<00:04:31.419> gonna<00:04:31.539> be<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:31.930> way<00:04:32.139> but

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
know it's gonna be that way but

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.260 
know it's gonna be that way but
something<00:04:32.860> tells<00:04:33.099> me<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.550> might<00:04:33.759> take<00:04:33.970> itself

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
something tells me it might take itself

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.990 
something tells me it might take itself
too<00:04:34.479> seriously<00:04:35.310> but<00:04:36.310> then<00:04:36.460> again<00:04:36.580> it's<00:04:36.789> just<00:04:36.820> a

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
too seriously but then again it's just a

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.969 
too seriously but then again it's just a
trail<00:04:37.240> these<00:04:37.449> are<00:04:37.570> just<00:04:37.750> like<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.530> know<00:04:38.650> after

watching so many fucking trailers and

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.589 
watching so many fucking trailers and
then<00:04:41.530> you<00:04:41.620> watch<00:04:41.979> a<00:04:42.219> movie<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:42.969> you<00:04:43.180> spend

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
then you watch a movie and you spend

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.390 
then you watch a movie and you spend
your<00:04:43.659> time<00:04:43.750> just<00:04:44.289> breaking<00:04:44.620> down<00:04:44.770> trailers

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
your time just breaking down trailers

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.010 
your time just breaking down trailers
and<00:04:45.580> studying<00:04:45.880> them<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.270> do<00:04:46.449> start<00:04:46.750> to<00:04:46.780> notice

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
and studying them you do start to notice

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.640 
and studying them you do start to notice
like<00:04:47.590> what<00:04:48.039> the<00:04:48.250> film's<00:04:48.610> might<00:04:48.880> do<00:04:49.090> wrong

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
like what the film's might do wrong

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.719 
like what the film's might do wrong
immediately<00:04:50.650> from<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:50.979> trailer<00:04:51.370> but<00:04:51.520> that's

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
immediately from a trailer but that's

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.100 
immediately from a trailer but that's
not<00:04:51.880> to<00:04:51.969> say<00:04:52.120> that<00:04:52.150> I'm<00:04:52.360> right<00:04:52.539> I'm<00:04:52.810> saying

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
not to say that I'm right I'm saying

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.629 
not to say that I'm right I'm saying
that<00:04:53.349> that's<00:04:53.560> just<00:04:53.710> what<00:04:53.889> I'm<00:04:53.979> predicting<00:04:54.430> man

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
that that's just what I'm predicting man

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.010 
that that's just what I'm predicting man
these<00:04:54.820> people<00:04:54.940> gonna<00:04:55.150> go<00:04:55.300> watch<00:04:55.479> this<00:04:55.659> is<00:04:55.840> for

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
these people gonna go watch this is for

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.510 
these people gonna go watch this is for
the<00:04:56.080> action<00:04:56.440> sequences<00:04:56.889> and<00:04:56.949> I<00:04:57.130> think<00:04:57.340> for<00:04:57.430> the

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
the action sequences and I think for the

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.129 
the action sequences and I think for the
action<00:04:57.880> sequences<00:04:58.330> they<00:04:58.479> look<00:04:58.630> really<00:04:58.870> cool

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
action sequences they look really cool

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.120 
action sequences they look really cool
for<00:04:59.349> the<00:04:59.469> most<00:04:59.650> part<00:04:59.889> when<00:05:00.009> they're

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
for the most part when they're

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.649 
for the most part when they're
parachuting<00:05:00.789> and<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.000> money's<00:05:01.270> falling

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
parachuting and the money's falling

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.600 
parachuting and the money's falling
everywhere<00:05:01.930> that<00:05:02.500> looked<00:05:02.740> real<00:05:03.009> like<00:05:03.310> I'm

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
everywhere that looked real like I'm

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.090 
everywhere that looked real like I'm
sure

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
sure

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.010 
sure
was<00:05:04.250> real<00:05:04.430> in<00:05:04.640> some<00:05:04.850> way<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.240> gliders<00:05:05.720> looked

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
was real in some way the gliders looked

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.660 
was real in some way the gliders looked
real<00:05:06.290> even<00:05:06.650> at<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.860> end<00:05:07.010> when<00:05:07.250> he<00:05:07.280> jumps<00:05:07.580> off

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
real even at the end when he jumps off

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.130 
real even at the end when he jumps off
the<00:05:07.730> cliff<00:05:08.060> I'm<00:05:08.210> sure<00:05:08.360> that's<00:05:08.570> not<00:05:08.660> real<00:05:08.960> but

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
the cliff I'm sure that's not real but

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.960 
the cliff I'm sure that's not real but
that<00:05:09.200> looked<00:05:09.590> real<00:05:09.800> I<00:05:10.040> just<00:05:10.250> feel<00:05:10.550> like<00:05:10.760> that

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
that looked real I just feel like that

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.180 
that looked real I just feel like that
it's<00:05:11.210> not<00:05:11.360> going<00:05:11.510> to<00:05:11.570> be<00:05:11.720> so<00:05:12.350> overblown<00:05:13.040> with

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
it's not going to be so overblown with

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.640 
it's not going to be so overblown with
CGI<00:05:13.640> at<00:05:13.940> times<00:05:14.270> but<00:05:14.840> I<00:05:14.900> think<00:05:15.170> it's<00:05:15.470> going<00:05:15.620> to

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
CGI at times but I think it's going to

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.560 
CGI at times but I think it's going to
be<00:05:15.740> cool<00:05:15.980> to<00:05:16.010> watch<00:05:16.220> actual<00:05:16.670> action<00:05:17.060> sequences

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
be cool to watch actual action sequences

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.170 
be cool to watch actual action sequences
with<00:05:18.170> legit<00:05:18.920> stuntmen<00:05:19.580> in<00:05:19.640> there

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
with legit stuntmen in there

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.980 
with legit stuntmen in there
so<00:05:20.270> yeah<00:05:20.330> I'll<00:05:20.390> probably<00:05:20.450> wait<00:05:20.750> for<00:05:20.810> another

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
so yeah I'll probably wait for another

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.720 
so yeah I'll probably wait for another
trailer<00:05:21.500> before<00:05:21.650> deciding<00:05:22.190> to<00:05:22.220> watch<00:05:22.460> this

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730
