up<00:04:02.239> there<00:04:03.130> there<00:04:04.130> we<00:04:04.280> go<00:04:04.870> it<00:04:05.870> was<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.020> little<00:04:06.260> bit

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
up there there we go it was a little bit

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.250 
up there there we go it was a little bit
patient<00:04:06.500> there<00:04:06.920> I<00:04:07.069> saw<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:07.910> guy<00:04:08.090> cross<00:04:08.480> first

patient there I saw that guy cross first
but<00:04:09.620> I<00:04:09.800> thought<00:04:10.069> I'd<00:04:10.190> just<00:04:10.310> take<00:04:10.519> a<00:04:10.550> second

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
but I thought I'd just take a second

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.580 
but I thought I'd just take a second
because<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.269> thought<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:11.810> heard<00:04:12.050> his<00:04:12.230> teammate

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
because I thought I heard his teammate

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.710 
because I thought I heard his teammate
coming<00:04:12.860> behind<00:04:13.010> him<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.489> shoot<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.599> guy

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
coming behind him so shoot the guy

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.039 
coming behind him so shoot the guy
that's<00:04:14.959> more<00:04:15.170> of<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.319> threat<00:04:15.440> first<00:04:16.209> oh<00:04:20.019> he<00:04:21.019> just

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
that's more of a threat first oh he just

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.840 
that's more of a threat first oh he just
dropped<00:04:21.410> down<00:04:23.740> I<00:04:24.740> shouldn't<00:04:25.460> have<00:04:25.580> rushed

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
dropped down I shouldn't have rushed

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.370 
dropped down I shouldn't have rushed
sprinted<00:04:26.570> there<00:04:26.720> for<00:04:26.870> that<00:04:26.960> little<00:04:27.110> brief

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
sprinted there for that little brief

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.500 
sprinted there for that little brief
moment<00:04:27.770> I<00:04:27.830> was<00:04:27.950> trying<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.340> just<00:04:29.210> get<00:04:29.300> a<00:04:29.360> quick

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.950 

this<00:04:36.860> isn't<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:37.639> very<00:04:37.940> good<00:04:38.090> long-range<00:04:38.450> again

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
this isn't a very good long-range again
