and over here I think it's pretty pretty
similar<00:01:04.710> looks<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.450> you<00:01:06.450> know<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> kids<00:01:06.840> at

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
similar looks the you know the kids at

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.010

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
the young age with the letís and and I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.960 
the young age with the letís and and I
guess<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.890> Jared<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> participation

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
little bit more organized obviously all

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.190 
little bit more organized obviously all

the kids are all kitted out in all the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.440 
the kids are all kitted out in all the
gear<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:37.710> when<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.670> play<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.150> didn't<00:01:39.329> really

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
gear now when I play we didn't really

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.170 
gear now when I play we didn't really
have<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:40.439> mass<00:01:40.920> amount<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.220> gear<00:01:41.400> odd<00:01:41.610> socks<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
have a mass amount of gear odd socks the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.270 
have a mass amount of gear odd socks the
full<00:01:42.360> works<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.840> i<00:01:43.320> think<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
full works but i think the the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.039 
full works but i think the the
organization<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.119> i<00:01:45.210> could<00:01:45.509> say<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.659> level

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
organization and i could say the level

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.230 
organization and i could say the level
of<00:01:46.110> participation<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.890> more<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> moment

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
of participation is more at the moment

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.749 
of participation is more at the moment
