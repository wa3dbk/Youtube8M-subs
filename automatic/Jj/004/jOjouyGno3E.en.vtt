00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.639
 with i welcome all users 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.500
 World Wide Web and all 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.430
 lovers of old computer games i 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.250
 continue from the series in my reviews on 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.820
 old games in this case 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.210
 we want a career which was 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.259
 released in 2007 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.639
 is still one of the fabric of many 

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:29.429
 books devoted to the subject of the Vikings 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.429
 and in other children of the north 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.320
 so imagine 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.720
 but talk about two thousand Perm 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.000
 I am then still a young student 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.650
 freshman 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.060
 was obsessed with 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.840
 impression that look like 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.770
 well-known players 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.770
 which was the object of our last year 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.430
 and here my mind falls on the disk 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.500
 publishers 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.230
 and press service 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.730
 means translated human 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.140
 honestly about that 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.970
 that the game is made on a graphic engine 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.310
 unreal 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.240
 whatever you say 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.740
 the property in Kazan beauties 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.650
 in the presence 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.000
 fst of russia 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.020
 test we are not interested and stone 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.050
 the buildings 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.490
 other color revolutions unconditionally 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.490
 OK 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.820
 so want the representative himself 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.500
 kazakhstan 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.910
 hopelessly past 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.910
 clarity 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.230
 long storyline 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.230
 because everything is clear that there is 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.540
 it is important that this question be whether 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.500
 need to overcome a number of provocations 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.820
 responsible serious 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.820
 opponents have different platforms 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.729
 no way 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.459
 the situation is already heard avt 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.759
 perhaps that stock 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.259
 success 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.529
 15 seconds 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.409
 10 15 years 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.539
 that's all 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:44.539
 all this could be said 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.869
 besides moves than it was before 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:53.749
 note, by the way 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.749
 capital 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.059
 congratulate the teachers 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:00.859
 overcoming rocky total years 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.859
 European cups himself all sorts 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.929
 in Lithuania 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:09.929
 matter of principle 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:17.909
 again 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.909
 let all this beauty do 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:23.429
 well proven 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:25.089
 responsibility 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:27.509
 and you can endlessly write the remnants of 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.909
 banality right but account for order 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.909
 have to 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.099
 about this year 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.039
 during a trip 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:44.449
 in their abilities 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:45.029
 stopping
