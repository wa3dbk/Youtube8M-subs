00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 today in the prime contractors 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.910
 Swap the brush for the smock 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.710
 takes you to unsuspected areas of 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.110
 artistic practice between a rabbit 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.370
 jellyfish and a hairy cactus we discover 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.190
 what they plug in several artists 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.690
 contemporary bio art attach your 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.560
 mutant toques with spit 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.560
 it will hit hard 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.950
 do you know alba and it's me you 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.170
 to present it in appearance is a rabbit 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.400
 all that is most ordinary 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.590
 until you make him take 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.650
 walking under an ultraviolet lamp 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.760
 just like the dolly alba sheep was 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.620
 genetically modified 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.970
 except on the way we grafted him a 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.400
 jellyfish gene that gives him a 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.930
 alba fluorescence character is a 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.489
 fluorescent rabbit 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.260
 born in a French laboratory as 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.210
 that science project she was 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.160
 photographed and catapulted to the rank 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.250
 of art by eduardo four 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.120
 artists and teachers or chicago art 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.790
 institute 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.110
 she becomes a figure 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.450
 emblematic of what is called 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.120
 now bio art she joins as well 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.430
 a heteroclite clan of works whose 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.050
 main material is the living among 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.670
 his works we find a butterfly of which 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.890
 we changed the patterns on the wings 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.200
 skin cells that have been cultured 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.390
 to create a living tissue in the shape of 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.010
 coats or a cactus on which one has 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.430
 grow stoves instead of 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.780
 spines by grafting a keratin gene 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.310
 and why the artists are left 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.260
 suddenly and labs with as much 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.550
 of interest to talk about respect for the 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.450
 alive and trend because the man to 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.460
 to take oneself for god 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.290
 of course we test the limits of what 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.940
 is ethical but there is still 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.980
 something paradoxical to use 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.750
 biotechnology to criticize 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.600
 use of biotechnologies then there are 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.160
 more than that with alba arises the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.680
 question of the artwork is what a 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.390
 living object can be a work and if 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.300
 yes, the artist has copyright 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.550
 top with julliard and audika that makes 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.379
 push hymens comes the question of 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.900
 gender what determines gender 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.610
 and what gives it value 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.620
 fictitious leaves the vows confronts the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.720
 question of animal exploitation in 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.310
 the textile industry treat them the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.620
 quiet animals if we could create 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.510
 coats 100 years killed but in 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.420
 offering a leather-like fabric 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.610
 grown in the laboratory to another 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.140
 degree of 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.570
 artists go so far as to use their 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.970
 own body as material this is the case 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.400
 of the Australian stelarc who create 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.590
 complex and robotic extensions to his 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.360
 body he is also known for his 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.580
 ear and there we do not talk about donations 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.670
 musical but of the organ he carries 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.040
 on the arm as for the hints she 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.810
 practice surgeries performances at 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.370
 during which doctors are going 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.200
 literally changed his appearance 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.660
 so obviously all these artists do 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.459
 scandal for some the bio art is 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.410
 harmless and for others the limit 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.650
 between bio art and bio terrorism is 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.420
 really thin art and science are 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.550
 lovers for a long time but admit that 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.850
 since Leonardo da Vinci he has sunk 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.800
 water under the notice to patrons the 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.420
 next artwork you will buy will have 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.030
 may need daily care 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.750
 a walk in a park of a 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.750
 serum injection
