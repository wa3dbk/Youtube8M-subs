00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.320
 and here we are once again and we are going to 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.119
 doing a training exercise 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.099
 functional and I tell you why it work 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.410
 because that explains everyday life 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.570
 this is application for girls who 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.579
 use cleats to improve stability 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.349
 of the ankle so we're not just going to 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.090
 do a glute exercise 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.739
 hamstrings and back but that 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.829
 he also does a coordination job 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.120
 and balance so be prepared that there 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.120
 we go with something well complete 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.610
 the initial management the less wide 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.420
 shoulders, check that this is very stable 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.300
 keep balance and going to work 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.050
 with the right back as much as possible 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.050
 and turn 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.530
 low 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.050
 and a little more complex judgment 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.370
 raising the knee 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.130
 this works 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.580
 in the back the tail we 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.580
 ideals 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.680
 back balance what's important 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.330
 is when you go up fixed point to the front 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.820
 note that the gradation difficulty is 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.490
 with more weight it tries to maintain 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.040
 Leverage find your balance but 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.380
 I'll find the long lever ends the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.509
 travel well quiet look at the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.060
 great action of difficulty and varies the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.580
 weights according to the intensity that is consistent 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.759
 to your fitness track it is important that 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.799
 for him the dead weight keep the 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.590
 hip fixed with one or with feet 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.620
 always the weight goes forward and the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.990
 hip is fixed other errors 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.030
 the wool skirt 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.830
 you always have to take a little tail 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.520
 here on the back 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.680
 my right skirt and another thing is to do it 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.659
 faster it tries to keep the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.940
 balance with a rhythm 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.390
 try to make it easy for you to lose the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.390
 Balance 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.959
 or 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.110
 the basis of good nutrition and in 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.080
 balanced way has to have 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.350
 hydrates the proteins and lipids 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.560
 hydrates are the pasta the bread the 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.530
 cereals that have a lot of fiber and the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.920
 rice the potato the proteins are the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.500
 lean meats chicken and fish and the 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.410
 lipids are oils in general or 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.240
 dried fruits I always recommend you 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.450
 I put together the nutrition plan a 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.780
 sports nutritionist and that be 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.780
