 handed to become an electron can 2009 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.600
 years but then moved this period 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.010
 for 2018 yet any important event in 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.530
 life of a Russian citizen is a reason 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.379
 for walking on instances if

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.769
 child birth parents are no longer the case 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.680

 as our correspondent Elena 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.150

 a person is born including 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.470
 tradition begins right there 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.370

 and help for employers 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.310
 eligible for 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.430
 the game was with real help from the state 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.150
 411 thousand rubles 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.570
 it is important to remember the employees smell 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.250
 output 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.310
 not to come closed doors 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.920
 citizens in the russian federation semen 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.579
 Russians but he himself is not yet a Russian 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.490
 so that the child officially 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.799
 became a citizen and again on the reverse 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:43.939
 side testimony of 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.329

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.310
 stamp such stand in district administration 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.210
 Federal Migration Service 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.299
 here you can write a new service 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.729
 your passport promise that the procedure will take 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.010
 all day 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.359
 then the child needs to register on Tuesday 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:59.930
 for example the Artsakh party 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.590
 for this mother's registration in another 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.570
 the place will first have to drive your 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.760
 and single information 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.320
 clearing house for printing 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.649
 textbooks 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.189
 because she has nothing against it 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:12.869
 statement and so cruel and other 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.749
 documents of their copies go back to the juices 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.199
 in the passport office only on the way 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:19.869
 do not forget to look at a single settlement 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:21.709
 center at the place of residence of the husband to 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.469
 claim a single wallet there 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.129
 if all papers are prepared 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.419

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:34.709
 Now health insurance is originally 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.089
 born to attribute the district 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.920
 polyclinics 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.110
 I understand that this is the first month 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.050
 actions however some day after 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.639
 birth even a transition plan will make 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.549
 so children work insurance company 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.209
 inside the queue but on the hands immediately issues 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.260

 and only in kindergarten a child can now 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.440
 record without leaving home via the Internet 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.720
 computer automatically 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.730
 gets novice 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.970

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.049
 mail a similar system and not only 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.050
 one drawback 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.670
 since kindergartens moscow all 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.679
