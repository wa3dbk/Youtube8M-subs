00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 when falling you can enter the roll and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.460
 accepted starting position for this 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.460
 exposed in front of the foot 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.700
 look carefully at how this is done 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.190
 the shooter set foot forward and slightly 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.100
 leaned his pelvis back his rose his 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.990
 inertia work out and you too 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.730
 it will sometimes be useful to ride in 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.349
 lower level so as not to fall under 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.910
 hot bullet see how it is done 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.190
 inertial force 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.110
 the arrow literally puts on its feet after 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.879
 rolling he puts his foot 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.320
 it raises the starting position 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.250
 he can shoot from this position 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.250
 can get up 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.010
 starting position you can spin on 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.150
 earth 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.150
 control the situation around you 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.620
 for clarity, this is done slowly 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.010
 can do it with two pistols 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.750
 look at how all this is done in 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.120
 slow motion training 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.040
 try to repeat these movements in 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.700
 the combat situation is all done very 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.740
 quickly and on a large area this way 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.360
 guarantees 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.760
 avoiding enemy pistol fire 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.980
 at the same time controlling the installation 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.560
 around yourself from this position can 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.000
 shoot and you can get on your feet in any 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.000
 a moment to make a stave jerk 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.370
 like this from a standing position shooter enters 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.370
 in roll 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.640
 periodically he is squatting he 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.640
 has the ability to stand up when 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.310
 want a shooter with this method 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.620
 rolling can roll in the lower level 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.420
 where he wants and how he wants to change 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.420
 driving direction as you wish 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.000
 this is another soft way to enter 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.000
 roll 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.620
 worked rolls well develops 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.900
 vestibular apparatus 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:54.739
 which in itself contributes to the improvement 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:57.290
 shooting quality you see different 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.000
 ways to gently enter the bottom 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.680
 level 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.250
 the safest from oncoming fire 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.250
 adversary
