 It is level 8 for the fifth level; it is even 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:38.850
 okay ford gas engine of the seventh 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.850

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:52.530
 sixth level maximum load 40 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:56.460
 9.8 tonnes so much would they equal it 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.550
 maybe 15 only 6 cute lava will say 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.219
 you honestly system it is ineffective in 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.460
 mostly throws third quarter 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.700
 fifth there and lift up and see it 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.700
 the battle 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.180
 as you can see on the tables threw the main 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.180
 our enemy kv1 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:42.210
 as you can see our team has excelsior 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:45.420
 KV -1 is also 4-4 on us five in a team against 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.580
 us excelsior 2k in the first place for 4 t-34 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.399
 they go with us to one cafe 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.090
 because you know, I'll fix it 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.330
 ineffective 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.130
 we play on the map south coast standard 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.130
 fight in look in battle 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:16.299
 there is a good position here here you can 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.840
 cover shoot off for many enemy 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:23.260
 the place is not very not very home but also not 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.260
 drain 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.139
 with us behind the rear is drawn square-1 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.139
 together we can do a lot 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.950
 this position 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.760
 how do you know them as you see my forehead 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.380
 rebound can be considered 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.800
 neatly so no one rules 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:58.010
 most bounce well okay nothing 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:01.300
 do not break because their door also 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.110
 there is a very bad position on that side 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.110
 but it's closer to me 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.819
 take this position and wait for now 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.890
 someone will come out or highlight but 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.209
 it is better not to wait much if there is nobody 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.209
 go straight to the database 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.750
 kv-1 is almost approaching now we 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.750
 let's take positions we will wait 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:47.079
 from behind trying to get around to 70 you can go 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.139
 meet him preferably put where 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:54.150
 he will go of course we like us there 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.150
 artillery he can and or speed 10 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.840
 so see this 70 went after our 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.310
 artillery but not go far because 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.310
 that he does not come to me anywhere 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:38.419
 he is not a shot I will take him away what will go 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:42.770
 to our apt-1 as you see in this fight we 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:45.229
 while losing but no have yet 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.580
 meet with another kv-1 because 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.699
 there to us to the base comes to stretch 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.229
 or 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.229
 and accessories which rendered 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:11.320
 we put on it 97 damage we add some salt 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.320
 forehead he ricocheted over us 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.050
 lead us reluctantly makes my way 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:23.219
 we knock down the caterpillar we turn the body and 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:30.870
 we ricochet punched him too 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:30.870
 exchanged projectiles another breakout 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:53.009
 someone carried us 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.240
 as you can see in this house did not lose
