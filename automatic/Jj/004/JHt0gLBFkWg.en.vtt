00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
it but this is what's needed in order

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.610 
it but this is what's needed in order
for<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.910> sniper<00:03:15.630> function<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.170> work<00:03:16.200> so

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
for the sniper function to work so

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.320 
for the sniper function to work so
basically<00:03:17.100> you're<00:03:17.220> telling<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.610> look<00:03:18.120> for

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
basically you're telling it look for

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.800

anything<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.790> basically<00:03:20.790> ten<00:03:21.300> percent

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
anything that is basically ten percent

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
of these item values and you have to use

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.180 
of these item values and you have to use
a<00:03:26.280> lot<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.760> discretion<00:03:27.480> with<00:03:28.320> buying<00:03:28.800> stuff

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
a lot of discretion with buying stuff

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.000 
a lot of discretion with buying stuff
you<00:03:29.430> can't<00:03:29.700> just<00:03:29.970> let<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.570> rip<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.050> then<00:03:31.740> jump

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
you can't just let it rip and then jump

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.320 
you can't just let it rip and then jump
on<00:03:32.160> everything<00:03:32.700> it's<00:03:33.360> definitely<00:03:33.750> worth

on everything it's definitely worth

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.030 
on everything it's definitely worth
taking<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.600> look<00:03:36.630> at<00:03:36.870> items<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.530> see<00:03:37.710> if<00:03:37.830> they're

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040
