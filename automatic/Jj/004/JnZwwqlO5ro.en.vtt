really<00:01:22.220> didn't<00:01:22.369> think<00:01:22.430> that<00:01:22.549> that<00:01:22.700> would<00:01:22.850> even

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
really didn't think that that would even

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.719 
really didn't think that that would even
be<00:01:23.299> functional<00:01:23.900> on<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:24.560> level<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:25.579> was

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
be functional on the level that it was

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.260 
be functional on the level that it was
but<00:01:26.000> still<00:01:26.390> um<00:01:26.799> really<00:01:27.799> big<00:01:28.070> surprise<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:29.090> see

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
but still um really big surprise to see

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.179 
but still um really big surprise to see
that<00:01:29.509> we<00:01:30.049> really<00:01:30.290> underestimate<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:30.890> deck

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
that we really underestimate that deck

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.010 
that we really underestimate that deck
outside<00:01:31.759> of<00:01:31.970> that<00:01:32.060> though<00:01:32.240> once<00:01:32.780> again

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
outside of that though once again

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
which I mean combo wombo deck is combo

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.899 
which I mean combo wombo deck is combo
wombo<00:01:42.320> like<00:01:42.829> it's<00:01:43.070> just<00:01:43.340> how<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.670> deck

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
wombo like it's just how the deck

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.060 
wombo like it's just how the deck
functions<00:01:44.570> but<00:01:45.530> it's<00:01:45.680> still<00:01:45.829> definitely

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
functions but it's still definitely

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.090 
functions but it's still definitely
really<00:01:46.670> cool<00:01:46.700> not<00:01:47.270> knowing<00:01:47.689> that<00:01:48.409> infinity<00:01:49.040> is

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
really cool not knowing that infinity is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.240 
really cool not knowing that infinity is

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
they're not at their prime but it's

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.469 
they're not at their prime but it's
still<00:01:54.350> really<00:01:54.560> cool<00:01:55.240> seeing<00:01:56.240> how<00:01:56.360> things

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
still really cool seeing how things

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.499 
year I'm believe he got third place um I
was<00:02:01.430> actually<00:02:01.490> kind<00:02:01.790> of<00:02:01.820> hoping<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.149> Oliver

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
was actually kind of hoping that Oliver

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:03.670 
was actually kind of hoping that Oliver
would<00:02:02.630> win<00:02:02.810> that<00:02:02.840> way<00:02:03.020> we<00:02:03.140> could<00:02:03.229> say<00:02:03.409> that<00:02:03.439> the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
would win that way we could say that the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.410 
would win that way we could say that the
dragon<00:02:04.040> duelist<00:02:04.369> was<00:02:04.640> better<00:02:04.850> than<00:02:05.000> most<00:02:05.210> of

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
dragon duelist was better than most of

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.149 
dragon duelist was better than most of
the<00:02:05.509> players<00:02:05.719> in<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.049> States<00:02:06.289> but<00:02:07.009> all<00:02:07.130> over

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
the players in the States but all over

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.600 
the players in the States but all over
really<00:02:07.610> prove<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.179> you

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
really prove that you

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.850 
really prove that you
even<00:02:08.880> though<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.300> young<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:10.500> have

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
even though you can be young you have

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.920 
even though you can be young you have
some<00:02:11.250> level<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.580> skill<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.060> know<00:02:12.480> something

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
some level of skill I know something

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.060 
some level of skill I know something
that<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.080> lot<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.260> people<00:02:13.350> were<00:02:13.680> kind<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.920> under

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
that a lot of people were kind of under

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.130 
that a lot of people were kind of under
estimating<00:02:14.190> what<00:02:14.640> Oliver<00:02:14.760> was<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.300> but<00:02:16.080> it

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
estimating what Oliver was that but it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.720 
estimating what Oliver was that but it
seems<00:02:16.350> like<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.530> really<00:02:16.860> did<00:02:17.130> work<00:02:17.160> out<00:02:17.490> in<00:02:17.610> his

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730
