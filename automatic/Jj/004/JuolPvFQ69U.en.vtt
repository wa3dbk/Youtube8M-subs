00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.906
 Welcome everyone to watch Tech a Look 

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:06.856
 I am Yao Wei. 

00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:10.063
 I am Kevin. 

00:00:10.063 --> 00:00:11.680
 Did the audience see it as if it was a little raining? 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.178
 Have it? 

00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:16.324
 May be a little bit loud, if you hear a little voice, don't worry about it. 

00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:17.426
 Good illusion 

00:00:17.426 --> 00:00:20.456
 It is important to introduce two ASUS ASUS today. 

00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:24.062
 High-end graphics card for NVIDIA GTX 700 series 

00:00:24.062 --> 00:00:27.764
 The one I took in my hand is GTX 780. 

00:00:27.764 --> 00:00:30.011
 Mine is GTX 780 DirectCU II 

00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:31.428
 An upgraded version 

00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:32.924
喔Upgrade version yeah 

00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:36.532
 Both cards use NVIDIA GeForce GTX780 

00:00:36.532 --> 00:00:37.795
 a drawing core 

00:00:37.795 --> 00:00:42.046
 And a high-speed 3GB GDDR5 memory 

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:46.541
 Wow weight is actually quite heavy 

00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:51.090
 I am still okay, not heavy or light. 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.003
 Ok, let’s see that the two of them are actually designed. 

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:54.957
 Actually not the same 

00:00:54.957 --> 00:00:58.563
 Although the drawing core is the same 

00:00:58.563 --> 00:01:01.766
 Just like I am different from Kevin’s face, hahaha... 

00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:02.796
 a lot worse 

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:03.897
 There are so many differences 

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:08.211
 Ok, now we see the following two models using the GTX 780 graphics core. 

00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:12.793
 They all use NVIDIA's SLI series technology. 

00:01:12.793 --> 00:01:16.555
 Then use the power side is 8PIN plus 6PIN 

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:18.735
 Then we see the other side 

00:01:18.735 --> 00:01:23.740
 Use the same support is PCIe3.0 interface 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.695
 What they have in common is that they have two DVIs and one HDMI respectively. 

00:01:28.695 --> 00:01:30.759
 There is also a Display Port 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.435
 Let's take a look now 

00:01:33.435 --> 00:01:37.323
 In fact, this GTX 780 DirectCU II 

00:01:37.323 --> 00:01:40.437
 Actually it is an upgraded version than the GTX 780. 

00:01:40.437 --> 00:01:42.490
 So in its factory factory settings 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.530
 Just made an overclocking action 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.828
 So the GPU's clock has also improved. 

00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:54.083
 Like this DirectCU II, its dynamic core has been upgraded to 941MHz 

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:58.406
 Like my GTX 780, it originally set the GPU dynamic core. 

00:01:58.406 --> 00:01:59.903
 Is 902MHz 

00:01:59.903 --> 00:02:04.792
 The core clock of this DirectCU II GPU has been upgraded to 889MHz. 

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:07.881
 And this one is 863MHz 

00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:09.802
 So this upgraded overclocked version 

00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:15.104
 It’s better to be a little better in terms of display and performance. 

00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:18.941
 In addition, we see that its biggest difference is its appearance design. 

00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:21.663
 I only have one fan for the exterior design. 

00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:24.725
 This overclocked version is a dual fan design喔

00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:26.386
 Don't underestimate this fan 

00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:28.149
 This fan above this GPU 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:32.457
 It uses a fan technology from ASUS CoolTech 

00:02:32.457 --> 00:02:36.091
 So the wind flow is blowing down and going out. 

00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:40.830
 Therefore, the overall heat dissipation area has increased by two hundred and twenty two 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.326
 Wow, it’s too high. 

00:02:42.326 --> 00:02:45.381
 Cooling effect increased by 30% 

00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:46.939
 That's really bad, too much difference. 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:52.992
 See this additional auxiliary fan with this special CoolTech fan 

00:02:52.992 --> 00:02:55.654
 It has different designs in this circle. 

00:02:55.654 --> 00:03:00.821
 In addition, this auxiliary fan will improve the heat dissipation effect. 

00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:02.882
 Yes, it’s not afraid of heat. 

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:03.880
 Not afraid of overheating, not afraid to overheat 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.798
 The most important thing to see is that the display card is also a cooling effect. 

00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:10.093
 Another very important thing is the design of this copper tube. 

00:03:10.093 --> 00:03:10.975
 Let's take a look 

00:03:10.975 --> 00:03:12.266
 Heat pipe design 

00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:13.529
 Then this overclocked version 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:19.371
 You can see that there are two 0.8 heat pipes below. 

00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:22.761
 On the other side, we saw that there is a 1 cm heat pipe. 

00:03:22.761 --> 00:03:26.921
 It is 1 cm is not common 

00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:30.759
 So its cooling effect is really designed to be 1 cm. 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:36.403
 In addition, a copper base is used on the GPU chip. 

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:37.194
 a design 

00:03:37.194 --> 00:03:41.756
 So the copper tube is directly in contact with the GPU's wafer. 

00:03:41.756 --> 00:03:44.438
 Greatly improve the heat dissipation effect 

00:03:44.438 --> 00:03:46.937
 This is really cool. 

00:03:46.937 --> 00:03:49.185
 How is the heat in the hot summer? 

00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:51.135
 Really the computer has to dissipate heat. 

00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:52.807
 We saw the two pairs of fans on the front side 

00:03:52.807 --> 00:03:54.837
 Also look at this back 

00:03:54.837 --> 00:03:56.412
 Back 欸? Not the same? 

00:03:56.412 --> 00:03:57.507
 Different 

00:03:57.507 --> 00:03:59.498
 Our DirectCU II 

00:03:59.498 --> 00:04:02.074
 Its back is a metal back plate design 

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:04.223
 We see a lot of holes for heat dissipation 

00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:09.249
 So in fact, this backplane also improves the heat dissipation effect. 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:13.459
 In addition, his focus on this metal back is also a supporting action. 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.195
 Because we saw that this card is actually quite heavy. 

00:04:16.195 --> 00:04:18.572
 If installed in a computer system 

00:04:18.572 --> 00:04:21.412
 Then the metal back plate acts as a support 

00:04:21.412 --> 00:04:24.492
 Make this display card less vulnerable 

00:04:24.492 --> 00:04:26.205
 Yes, you must be sure 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.294
 Come see us this GTX 780 

00:04:29.294 --> 00:04:29.970
 Its front 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.975
 Actually this is above the design 

00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:34.786
 In fact, the top of the fan is pretty cool. 

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:36.750
 This is really cool and no blade for Ah. 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.156
 You see that you have blades 

00:04:38.156 --> 00:04:39.457
 More general 

00:04:39.457 --> 00:04:42.647
 I am two Double 

00:04:42.647 --> 00:04:44.862
 So which one do you think is better? 

00:04:44.862 --> 00:04:46.208
 I think I am better. 

00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:48.546
 Because it is both fashionable and silvery 

00:04:48.546 --> 00:04:52.099
 Plus, you see that the tube is hidden inside. 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:53.254
 And relatively light 

00:04:53.254 --> 00:04:57.903
 Good use of the GTX780 DirectCU II 

00:04:57.903 --> 00:05:02.825
 In fact, its overall performance will be better with its overclocking smoothness. 

00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:06.162
 So players are going to look at their pocket depth. 

00:05:06.162 --> 00:05:10.171
 It’s a choice to see what kind of graphics card you want. 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.419
 Today is the introduction above. 

00:05:14.613 --> 00:05:16.811
 OK, everyone's video about us and Tech a Look 

00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:18.563
 What do you want to tell us? 

00:05:18.563 --> 00:05:22.527
 In the following, everyone has to leave a lot of messages to let us know 啰

00:05:22.527 --> 00:05:24.013
 Ok then below the film 

00:05:24.013 --> 00:05:26.191
 There will be a link to Facebook Google+ 

00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:27.691
