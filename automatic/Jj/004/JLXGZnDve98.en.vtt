what we have seen the graphic style is
very<00:02:07.920> much<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.849> style

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
killzone 3 and they are definitely

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.600 
killzone 3 and they are definitely
making<00:02:11.410> use<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.920> touch<00:02:12.099> screen<00:02:12.280> for

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
touchscreen controls because in games

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.479 
touchscreen controls because in games
like<00:02:16.930> uncharted<00:02:17.410> golden<00:02:17.530> Abyss<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.010> found<00:02:18.250> them

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
like uncharted golden Abyss I found them

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.420 
like uncharted golden Abyss I found them
to<00:02:18.700> be<00:02:18.730> rather<00:02:19.500> they<00:02:20.500> broke<00:02:20.739> this<00:02:20.920> style<00:02:21.250> of

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
to be rather they broke this style of

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.070 
to be rather they broke this style of
gameplay<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.150> they<00:02:22.330> actually<00:02:22.480> broke<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
gameplay and they actually broke the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.110 
gameplay and they actually broke the
flow<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.349> gameplay<00:02:23.769> more<00:02:23.980> importantly<00:02:24.459> which

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
flow of gameplay more importantly which

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.660 
flow of gameplay more importantly which
led<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.989> real<00:02:26.290> dissatisfaction<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.310> often

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
led to a real dissatisfaction I often

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.940 
led to a real dissatisfaction I often
avoided<00:02:28.060> using<00:02:28.810> melee<00:02:29.140> attacks<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.650> golden

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
avoided using melee attacks and golden

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.949 
avoided using melee attacks and golden
Abyss<00:02:30.190> because<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.819> just<00:02:31.030> broke<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.540> flow<00:02:31.930> of

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
Abyss because it just broke the flow of

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.650 
Abyss because it just broke the flow of
the<00:02:32.230> game<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:33.280> just<00:02:33.459> was<00:02:33.760> not<00:02:33.910> fun<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.540> it

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
the game and it just was not fun and it

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.100 
the game and it just was not fun and it
didn't<00:02:35.019> suit<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.410> game<00:02:36.510> which<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.690> course<00:02:37.720> is

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
didn't suit the game which of course is

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.780 
didn't suit the game which of course is
a<00:02:38.170> big<00:02:38.440> concern<00:02:38.590> for<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.950> game<00:02:39.129> by<00:02:39.280> kill<00:02:39.549> zone

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
a big concern for a game by kill zone

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.509 
a big concern for a game by kill zone
which<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.060> all<00:02:40.480> about<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:41.470> very<00:02:42.310> visceral

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
which is all about a very visceral

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.670 
which is all about a very visceral
experience<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.870> i<00:02:44.110> believe<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.470> touch

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
experience and i believe the touch

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.920 
experience and i believe the touch
screens<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.430> controls<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:46.060> costs<00:02:46.420> that's

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
screens and controls of costs that's

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.390 
screens and controls of costs that's
what<00:02:47.110> I've<00:02:47.200> been<00:02:47.230> saying<00:02:47.380> would<00:02:47.890> not<00:02:48.010> suit<00:02:48.250> the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
what I've been saying would not suit the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.520 
what I've been saying would not suit the
game<00:02:48.579> however<00:02:49.420> they<00:02:49.630> do<00:02:50.019> appear<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.380> be

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
game however they do appear to be

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.130 
game however they do appear to be
definitely<00:02:50.860> in<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:52.360> you'll<00:02:52.569> just<00:02:52.780> have<00:02:52.989> to

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
definitely in so you'll just have to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.050 
definitely in so you'll just have to
learn<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.349> live<00:02:53.650> with<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:53.799> or<00:02:54.340> not<00:02:54.849> by<00:02:55.000> the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
learn to live with that or not by the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.670 
learn to live with that or not by the
game<00:02:55.299> personally<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:55.900> think<00:02:55.989> real<00:02:56.349> games<00:02:56.560> are

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
game personally I think real games are

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.990 
game personally I think real games are
very<00:02:56.860> prepared<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.579> benefit<00:02:57.879> of<00:02:57.910> the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
very prepared to the benefit of the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.910 
very prepared to the benefit of the
doubt<00:02:58.209> in<00:02:58.390> this<00:02:58.480> case<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:59.349> I<00:02:59.440> willing<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.769> give

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
doubt in this case and I willing to give

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.880 
doubt in this case and I willing to give
them<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.099> chance<00:03:00.370> in<00:03:00.780> shown<00:03:01.780> as<00:03:02.079> how<00:03:02.379> to<00:03:02.440> make<00:03:02.769> it

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
them a chance in shown as how to make it

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.770 
them a chance in shown as how to make it
work<00:03:03.099> even<00:03:03.849> though<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.030> hasn't<00:03:04.209> worked<00:03:04.390> into

work even though it hasn't worked into
the<00:03:04.900> past<00:03:05.110> now<00:03:06.099> we<00:03:06.160> also<00:03:06.489> see<00:03:06.819> that<00:03:06.849> there's<00:03:07.120> a

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
the past now we also see that there's a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
a Killzone game on the Vitter and I'd be

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.280 
a Killzone game on the Vitter and I'd be
rather<00:03:48.970> disappointed<00:03:49.540> if<00:03:49.630> it<00:03:49.750> did<00:03:49.900> turn<00:03:50.079> out

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
rather disappointed if it did turn out

rather disappointed if it did turn out
like<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.739> but<00:03:50.950> once<00:03:51.099> again<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.459> really<00:03:52.000> want

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
like that but once again I really want

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.280 
like that but once again I really want
to<00:03:52.209> stress<00:03:52.359> that<00:03:52.480> there's<00:03:52.780> nothing<00:03:52.900> wrong

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
to stress that there's nothing wrong

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.589 
to stress that there's nothing wrong
with<00:03:53.349> it<00:03:53.530> per<00:03:53.709> se<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.790> if<00:03:54.910> it<00:03:55.030> does<00:03:55.180> turn<00:03:55.209> out<00:03:55.480> in

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
with it per se so if it does turn out in

with it per se so if it does turn out in
such<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.810> way<00:03:56.019> I'll<00:03:56.290> be<00:03:56.590> initially

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919
