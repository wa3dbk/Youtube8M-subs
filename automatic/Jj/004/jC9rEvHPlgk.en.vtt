findings form 125 connector you i'm

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.470 
findings form 125 connector you i'm
using<00:00:10.480> about<00:00:10.870> 10<00:00:11.290> inches<00:00:11.320> of<00:00:12.269> artistic<00:00:13.269> wire

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
using about 10 inches of artistic wire

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.480 
using about 10 inches of artistic wire
so<00:00:14.260> that<00:00:14.290> i<00:00:14.440> can<00:00:14.500> go<00:00:14.680> around<00:00:14.890> all<00:00:15.130> of<00:00:15.309> these

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
so that i can go around all of these

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.210 
so that i can go around all of these

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
loops of course the more loops you have

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.279 
loops of course the more loops you have
the<00:00:18.400> more<00:00:18.580> distance<00:00:19.359> the<00:00:19.480> wire<00:00:19.689> it<00:00:19.869> needs<00:00:20.079> to

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
the more distance the wire it needs to

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.429 
the more distance the wire it needs to
go<00:00:20.849> insert<00:00:21.849> the<00:00:22.060> end<00:00:22.269> of<00:00:22.449> the<00:00:22.509> wire<00:00:22.720> into<00:00:23.320> the

intersections<00:01:30.290> of<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.560> wire<00:01:30.770> this<00:01:31.400> this

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
intersections of the wire this this

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.389 
intersections of the wire this this
helps<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:32.840> form<00:01:33.260> this<00:01:35.410> component<00:01:36.410> so<00:01:36.590> that

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
helps to form this component so that

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:38.950 
helps to form this component so that
when<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.610> pull<00:01:37.820> it<00:01:37.910> off<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:38.360> will<00:01:38.540> be<00:01:38.660> nicely

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
when you pull it off it will be nicely

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.590 
when you pull it off it will be nicely
made<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.800> just<00:01:40.340> about<00:01:40.550> ready<00:01:40.790> to<00:01:40.910> go<00:01:41.119> on<00:01:41.390> to

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
made and just about ready to go on to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.380 
made and just about ready to go on to
your<00:01:41.840> jewelry<00:01:42.259> so<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.220> release<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:44.030> need<00:01:44.180> to

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
your jewelry so to release you need to

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.590 
your jewelry so to release you need to
unbend<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.649> bottom<00:01:46.040> water<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.580> then<00:01:47.300> push

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
unbend that bottom water and then push

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.440 
unbend that bottom water and then push
up

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.690 

to<00:01:53.049> pull<00:01:53.350> these<00:01:53.909> wires<00:01:54.909> off<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.600> bindings<00:01:56.200> for

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
to pull these wires off the bindings for

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.359 
to pull these wires off the bindings for
just<00:01:57.700> like<00:01:57.939> so<00:01:58.500> now<00:01:59.500> we're<00:01:59.860> going<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.039> finish

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
just like so now we're going to finish

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.300 
just like so now we're going to finish
the<00:02:00.520> top<00:02:00.789> by<00:02:01.659> cutting<00:02:02.229> these<00:02:02.890> wires<00:02:04.770> both<00:02:05.770> here

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
the top by cutting these wires both here

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.430 
the top by cutting these wires both here
on<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.549> front<00:02:06.850> loop<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.830> on<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:10.149> back<00:02:10.330> loop

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.900 

now<00:02:14.440> once<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:14.860> get<00:02:15.040> proficient<00:02:15.370> with<00:02:15.700> this

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
now once you get proficient with this

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.059 
now once you get proficient with this
you<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.540> take<00:02:16.900> one<00:02:17.200> wire<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.830> wrap<00:02:18.010> around

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
you can take one wire and wrap around

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.180 
you can take one wire and wrap around
the<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.180> other<00:02:19.360> wire<00:02:19.660> but<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:21.069> beginning

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
the the other wire but in the beginning

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.240 
the the other wire but in the beginning
it's<00:02:21.760> good<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.390> learn<00:02:23.380> how<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.680> use<00:02:23.770> these

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
it's good to learn how to use these

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.300 
it's good to learn how to use these
loops<00:02:24.849> to<00:02:25.090> your<00:02:25.239> advantage<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.800> I'm<00:02:26.890> going<00:02:27.040> out

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
loops to your advantage so I'm going out

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.460 
loops to your advantage so I'm going out
that's<00:02:27.520> just<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.790> little<00:02:27.910> bit<00:02:28.090> shorter<00:02:28.470> you

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
that's just a little bit shorter you

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.750 
that's just a little bit shorter you
want<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.709> make<00:02:29.830> sure<00:02:29.860> these<00:02:30.160> are<00:02:30.340> about<00:02:30.430> the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
want to make sure these are about the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.290 
want to make sure these are about the
same<00:02:30.970> length<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.930> then<00:02:35.260> we're<00:02:35.470> going<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:36.300> grab

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
same length and then we're going to grab

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.009 
same length and then we're going to grab
both<00:02:37.630> of<00:02:37.840> these<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.319> twist<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:40.569> then<00:02:40.810> grab

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
both of these and twist and then grab

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.320 
both of these and twist and then grab
both<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.560> wires<00:02:41.800> on<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.250> other<00:02:42.519> loop<00:02:43.030> and

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
both of the wires on the other loop and

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.600 
both of the wires on the other loop and
twist<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.530> have<00:02:44.739> them<00:02:44.860> both<00:02:45.010> going<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.519> the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
twist so you have them both going in the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.180 
twist so you have them both going in the
same<00:02:45.819> direction<00:02:46.350> we're<00:02:47.350> going<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.709> angle

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
same direction we're going to angle

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.479 
same direction we're going to angle
slightly<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:49.360> then<00:02:49.860> enable<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.950> opposite

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
slightly and then enable the opposite

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.830 
slightly and then enable the opposite
one<00:02:51.640> slightly<00:02:51.970> those<00:02:52.269> are<00:02:52.360> going<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.569> set

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
one slightly those are going to set

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.400 
one slightly those are going to set
together<00:02:53.019> right<00:02:53.470> side<00:02:53.860> by<00:02:54.100> side<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:56.200> can

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
together right side by side and you can

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.890 
together right side by side and you can
dangle<00:02:57.100> from<00:02:57.519> that<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:58.120> can<00:02:58.299> use<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.720> as<00:02:58.870> a

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
dangle from that you can use it as a

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.110 
dangle from that you can use it as a
bail<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:01.750> can<00:03:01.959> also<00:03:02.080> be<00:03:02.290> used<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:03.280> dangle<00:03:03.730> from

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
bail it can also be used to dangle from

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.030 
bail it can also be used to dangle from
ear<00:03:04.420> wire

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.959 

so<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.269> your<00:03:09.569> 125<00:03:10.790> connector<00:03:13.969> there's

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:14.969 
so that is your 125 connector there's

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.729 
so that is your 125 connector there's
some<00:03:15.180> little<00:03:15.569> minor<00:03:15.780> adjustments<00:03:16.469> to<00:03:16.590> make

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
some little minor adjustments to make

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.819 
some little minor adjustments to make
this<00:03:16.980> come<00:03:17.849> on<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.150> sim<00:03:18.510> flat<00:03:18.900> against<00:03:19.650> one

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
this come on a sim flat against one

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.190 
this come on a sim flat against one
another<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.849> then<00:03:20.969> just<00:03:21.150> close<00:03:21.480> these<00:03:21.810> rings

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
another and then just close these rings

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.920 
another and then just close these rings
up<00:03:22.469> just<00:03:23.810> enough<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.620> they<00:03:25.920> won't<00:03:26.930> fall

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
up just enough so that they won't fall

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.559 
up just enough so that they won't fall
off<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:28.290> your<00:03:28.739> piece<00:03:30.920> just<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.129> so<00:03:32.489> so<00:03:33.420> that's

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
off of your piece just like so so that's

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.580 
off of your piece just like so so that's
a<00:03:33.689> nice<00:03:33.870> connector<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:36.260> findings<00:03:37.260> form<00:03:37.469> can

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
a nice connector this findings form can

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.520 
a nice connector this findings form can
also<00:03:37.709> be<00:03:37.980> used<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.609> make<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.299> dangled<00:03:42.530> 125

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
also be used to make a dangled 125

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.240 
also be used to make a dangled 125
connector<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:45.750> do<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.530> just<00:03:46.980> need

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
connector and to do that you just need

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.759 
connector and to do that you just need
of<00:03:47.579> course<00:03:47.819> to<00:03:47.909> pieces<00:03:48.389> of<00:03:48.540> water<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:49.650> will

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
of course to pieces of water it will

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.229 
of course to pieces of water it will
make<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.129> bottom<00:03:50.459> piece<00:03:50.700> first<00:03:53.239> again

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
make the bottom piece first again

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.490 
make the bottom piece first again
pushing<00:03:55.609> and<00:03:56.959> we're<00:03:57.959> going<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.109> bring<00:03:58.319> this

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
pushing and we're going to bring this

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.319 
pushing and we're going to bring this
just<00:03:58.889> around<00:03:59.310> because<00:03:59.849> we're<00:04:00.060> only<00:04:00.120> making

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
just around because we're only making

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.360 
just around because we're only making
the<00:04:00.540> bottom<00:04:00.810> portion<00:04:01.200> we<00:04:01.859> just<00:04:02.099> go<00:04:02.250> around

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
the bottom portion we just go around

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.860 
the bottom portion we just go around
these<00:04:02.819> loops<00:04:03.620> down<00:04:04.620> here<00:04:05.329> much<00:04:06.329> like<00:04:06.540> we<00:04:06.689> did

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
these loops down here much like we did

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.520 
these loops down here much like we did
the<00:04:06.989> first<00:04:07.019> time<00:04:07.290> only<00:04:08.040> we're<00:04:09.200> omitting<00:04:10.200> going

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
the first time only we're omitting going

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.810 
the first time only we're omitting going
up<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.250> top<00:04:11.959> loop<00:04:13.579> in

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.340 

and<00:04:18.360> once<00:04:18.810> we<00:04:18.900> get<00:04:19.170> here<00:04:20.630> angle<00:04:21.630> this<00:04:21.780> back<00:04:22.050> in

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
and once we get here angle this back in

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.790 
and once we get here angle this back in
and<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.650> bring<00:04:22.950> it<00:04:23.070> about<00:04:23.370> up<00:04:23.670> to<00:04:23.850> where<00:04:24.060> that

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
and just bring it about up to where that

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.950 
and just bring it about up to where that
where<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.920> hole<00:04:26.100> is<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:27.150> we<00:04:27.330> can<00:04:27.450> get<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.720> same

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
where the hole is so we can get the same

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.520 
where the hole is so we can get the same
shape<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.590> then<00:04:28.950> push<00:04:29.250> again<00:04:29.670> with<00:04:29.910> this

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
shape and then push again with this

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.570 
shape and then push again with this
pushing<00:04:31.530> piece<00:04:31.770> that<00:04:32.010> comes<00:04:32.190> with<00:04:32.460> the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
pushing piece that comes with the

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.200 
pushing piece that comes with the
findings<00:04:32.790> form<00:04:34.040> to<00:04:35.040> get<00:04:35.190> those<00:04:35.430> nice<00:04:35.670> and

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
findings form to get those nice and

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.960 
findings form to get those nice and
tight<00:04:36.660> down<00:04:36.930> on<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.230> bottom<00:04:37.430> then<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.640> release

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
tight down on the bottom then to release

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.030 
tight down on the bottom then to release
just<00:04:39.930> release<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:41.160> push<00:04:41.670> this<00:04:41.850> up

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.920 

and<00:04:45.460> I'm<00:04:45.610> going<00:04:45.730> to<00:04:45.820> cut<00:04:46.000> these<00:04:46.180> right<00:04:46.630> up<00:04:46.750> in

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
and I'm going to cut these right up in

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.170 
and I'm going to cut these right up in
here<00:04:48.270> one<00:04:49.270> side<00:04:49.600> then<00:04:50.050> on<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.620> other<00:04:51.120> may<00:04:52.120> be

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
here one side then on the other may be

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.530 
here one side then on the other may be
sure<00:04:52.480> we<00:04:52.690> get<00:04:52.780> that<00:04:52.840> flush<00:04:53.380> cut<00:04:54.000> left<00:04:55.000> on<00:04:55.360> the

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
sure we get that flush cut left on the

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.290 
sure we get that flush cut left on the
piece<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:57.070> actual<00:04:57.220> piece

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.730 

that's<00:05:01.300> our<00:05:01.450> bottom<00:05:01.780> portion<00:05:02.230> we<00:05:02.410> just<00:05:02.590> need

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
that's our bottom portion we just need

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.430 
that's our bottom portion we just need
to<00:05:02.860> close<00:05:03.160> these<00:05:03.430> loops

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.020 

right<00:05:08.040> there

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.660 

and<00:05:11.780> now<00:05:12.200> we<00:05:12.260> take<00:05:12.620> our<00:05:12.800> other<00:05:13.010> piece<00:05:13.250> of<00:05:13.280> wire

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
and now we take our other piece of wire

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.800 
and now we take our other piece of wire
and<00:05:14.000> we<00:05:14.870> need<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.050> make<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:16.660> portion<00:05:17.660> that's

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
and we need to make the portion that's

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.580 
and we need to make the portion that's
going<00:05:17.990> to<00:05:18.050> hold<00:05:18.320> our<00:05:18.740> dangle<00:05:19.660> so<00:05:20.660> the<00:05:21.350> best

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
going to hold our dangle so the best

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.250 
going to hold our dangle so the best
thing<00:05:21.710> that<00:05:22.310> I<00:05:22.400> like<00:05:22.640> to<00:05:22.760> do<00:05:22.910> is<00:05:23.150> to<00:05:23.390> hold<00:05:23.870> the

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
thing that I like to do is to hold the

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.230 
thing that I like to do is to hold the
wire<00:05:24.470> and<00:05:24.800> wrap<00:05:25.670> all<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.240> way<00:05:26.270> around<00:05:26.390> this

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
wire and wrap all the way around this

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.150 
wire and wrap all the way around this
outside<00:05:29.240> loop<00:05:29.480> then<00:05:30.410> go<00:05:30.710> up<00:05:30.980> and<00:05:31.340> around<00:05:32.060> and

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
outside loop then go up and around and

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.790 
outside loop then go up and around and
then<00:05:34.160> down<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:34.900> go<00:05:35.900> around<00:05:36.170> the<00:05:36.320> outside<00:05:36.350> of

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
then down and go around the outside of

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.300 
then down and go around the outside of
that<00:05:38.320> so<00:05:39.320> that's<00:05:39.500> going<00:05:39.680> to<00:05:39.740> be<00:05:39.860> our<00:05:39.890> holder

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
that so that's going to be our holder

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.950 
that so that's going to be our holder
best<00:05:43.310> always<00:05:43.580> to<00:05:43.940> push<00:05:44.180> this<00:05:44.360> down<00:05:44.600> so<00:05:44.930> that

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
best always to push this down so that

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.680 
best always to push this down so that
those<00:05:46.240> intersections<00:05:47.240> are<00:05:47.570> nice<00:05:47.870> and<00:05:48.170> flat

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
those intersections are nice and flat

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:56.810 
those intersections are nice and flat
remove<00:05:50.690> that<00:05:50.840> wire<00:05:53.380> cut<00:05:54.380> these

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:06.159 

cutter

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.550 

now<00:06:07.169> I<00:06:07.470> want<00:06:07.740> to<00:06:07.800> take<00:06:08.310> a<00:06:08.340> twist<00:06:08.790> on<00:06:09.090> the<00:06:09.270> top

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
now I want to take a twist on the top

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.930 
now I want to take a twist on the top
the<00:06:10.560> best<00:06:10.740> way<00:06:10.889> to<00:06:10.949> do<00:06:11.130> it<00:06:11.220> is<00:06:11.310> to<00:06:11.340> use<00:06:11.699> two

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
the best way to do it is to use two

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.279 
the best way to do it is to use two
pairs<00:06:12.210> of<00:06:12.330> pliers<00:06:12.860> hold<00:06:14.389> firmly<00:06:15.389> but<00:06:15.810> not<00:06:16.020> too

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
pairs of pliers hold firmly but not too

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.629 
pairs of pliers hold firmly but not too
firmly<00:06:16.590> and<00:06:16.949> just<00:06:17.759> twist<00:06:18.030> that<00:06:18.320> about<00:06:19.639> one

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
firmly and just twist that about one

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:28.909 
firmly and just twist that about one
turn<00:06:22.220> these<00:06:23.240> then<00:06:24.240> get<00:06:24.720> I<00:06:27.500> want<00:06:28.500> them<00:06:28.620> to<00:06:28.800> be

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
turn these then get I want them to be

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.760 
turn these then get I want them to be
just<00:06:29.190> like<00:06:29.280> a<00:06:29.400> I<00:06:29.789> pin<00:06:30.780> so<00:06:31.320> I'm<00:06:31.500> going<00:06:31.560> to

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
just like a I pin so I'm going to

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.879 
just like a I pin so I'm going to
correct<00:06:32.190> that<00:06:32.370> so<00:06:32.669> that<00:06:32.820> it's<00:06:32.970> right<00:06:33.180> on<00:06:33.389> that

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
correct that so that it's right on that

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.310 
correct that so that it's right on that
on<00:06:34.889> the<00:06:35.280> neck<00:06:35.759> is<00:06:35.789> it<00:06:36.539> has<00:06:36.780> sort<00:06:37.020> of<00:06:37.139> like<00:06:37.289> a

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
on the neck is it has sort of like a

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.890 
on the neck is it has sort of like a
little<00:06:37.560> head<00:06:38.430> on<00:06:38.610> it<00:06:38.789> and<00:06:39.000> then<00:06:39.270> twist<00:06:39.660> these

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
little head on it and then twist these

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.450 
little head on it and then twist these
so<00:06:40.590> that<00:06:40.620> they<00:06:40.919> will<00:06:41.070> be<00:06:41.990> ready<00:06:42.990> to<00:06:43.280> be<00:06:44.280> hooked

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
so that they will be ready to be hooked

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.710 
so that they will be ready to be hooked
on<00:06:44.729> to<00:06:44.970> our<00:06:45.120> component<00:06:45.870> piece<00:06:46.910> bottom<00:06:47.910> make

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
on to our component piece bottom make

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.110 
on to our component piece bottom make
sure<00:06:48.960> these<00:06:49.080> are<00:06:49.260> open<00:06:49.850> then<00:06:50.850> we're<00:06:50.970> going<00:06:51.060> to

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
sure these are open then we're going to

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.159 
sure these are open then we're going to
angle<00:06:51.510> this<00:06:51.690> one<00:06:51.930> down<00:06:52.699> and<00:06:53.699> two<00:06:54.479> angle<00:06:54.990> this

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
angle this one down and two angle this

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:59.640 
angle this one down and two angle this
one<00:06:55.380> down<00:06:55.800> as<00:06:56.190> well

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
don't worry too much about the angles at

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.439 
don't worry too much about the angles at
the<00:07:02.259> moment<00:07:02.740> just<00:07:03.550> need<00:07:03.699> to<00:07:03.790> kind<00:07:03.970> of<00:07:04.120> size

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
the moment just need to kind of size
