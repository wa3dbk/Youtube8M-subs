00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.099
 messed up having difficulties in those of these playoffs any time of 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.499
 summer okay so that m 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.499
 we went back reconstructed the things 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.039
 difficulties are only there for the match 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.720
 to us to make sure of you the worst for the second what happened 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.769
 yesterday it's not a surprise for me 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.149
 unfortunately it's a confirmation 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.970
 and despite that I think we have the capabilities 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.020
 and sincerely the qualities for gap to beat Belarus we did not 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.920
 made 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.910
 it's an observation 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.200
 but it is real 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.610
 so here we have prepared the match with the same group for the break will be there will be 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.290
 not 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.230
 both going on even though I have the right to call the little new player 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.320
 Thu 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.940
 sixteen new players 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.490
 I do not see who is playing to support first 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.530
 exhausted 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.190
 three months always the same the same problematic that is to say that 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.280
 experience 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.780
 mapa players 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.159
 who have a lot of experience 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.310
 internationally 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.420
 Luxembourgish 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.100
 especially in the defensive field can finally go about 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
 it's a tyrant agree that on international selection at 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.299
 all levels like that of the goal chances it is necessary to concretize them what 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.760
 could not bring them to life 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.250
 necessarily to take care of the first aid station 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.079
 the opponent still holds 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.490
 the score 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.409
 that he hoped that you give him morale you give me the word of the end 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.409
 of the match is approaching as long as he is still 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.760
 more than elsewhere is to say to oneself 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.320
 but it's in all disciplines as on the opportunity to kill 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.400
 the opponent must kill him 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.500
 if you do not want it's always the thanks of a counter 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.210
 and we saw that bourgoin 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.600
 on one of the few counters of belarus yesterday 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.680
 even though I think that here too we have been naive 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.510
 which they managed to score a goal 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.790
 because you'll put a team apparently on the paper more 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.340
 defensive that you think you have fewer opportunities 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.730
 then if they are lucky to score a goal what I want 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.680
 in football which we must note that the team of France what 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.890
 we are concerned 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.860
 he always takes goals so if you want to hope to make a result he 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.779
 must mark 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.809
 for now we do not score much 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.969
 and god knows that are well 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.459
 you have players who are scoring goals in their club 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.750
 and at the international level the top scorer of karine dark games 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:24.869
 vivi butte 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.969
 and top scorer I think it was louis saha with four goals and 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.659
 of malouda florent of four goals 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.739
 samantha not scoring goals and france team
