hell<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:21.180> then<00:00:21.390> someone<00:00:23.060> posted<00:00:24.060> on

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
hell that is and then someone posted on

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.179 
hell that is and then someone posted on
the<00:00:24.269> Midway<00:00:24.689> boards<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.320> Deathstroke<00:00:25.980> is

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
Slade from Teen Titans and then it made

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.999 
Slade from Teen Titans and then it made
sense<00:00:29.939> actually<00:00:30.240> when<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.710> want<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.769> look<00:00:31.920> at

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
sense actually when I want to look at

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.799 
sense actually when I want to look at
his<00:00:32.099> face<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.460> realize<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> same<00:00:33.390> sort<00:00:33.719> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
his face I realize it's the same sort of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.049 
his face I realize it's the same sort of
same<00:00:34.649> sort<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:36.469> style<00:00:37.469> as<00:00:37.890> Slade<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.879> just

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
same sort of style as Slade it just

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.360 
same sort of style as Slade it just
looks<00:00:39.270> different<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.899> know<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> Teen<00:00:40.320> Titans

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
looks different you know the Teen Titans

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.920 
looks different you know the Teen Titans
version<00:00:41.370> was<00:00:41.489> more<00:00:41.640> basic<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> looked

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
version was more basic and it looked

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.920 
version was more basic and it looked
more<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.320> hard<00:00:43.680> mask<00:00:44.040> where<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
more like a hard mask where the the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.170 
more like a hard mask where the the
master<00:00:46.500> Deathstroke's<00:00:47.250> wearing<00:00:47.730> looks<00:00:47.910> more

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
master Deathstroke's wearing looks more

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.290 
master Deathstroke's wearing looks more
like<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> cloth<00:00:49.110> mask<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.620> know<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.579> then<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
realized yeah they do look the same but

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.420 
realized yeah they do look the same but
um<00:00:54.350> yeah<00:00:55.350> see<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:55.949> like<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> Teen

Titans<00:00:56.460> cut<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.600> was<00:00:57.719> pretty<00:00:57.840> good<00:00:58.699> so<00:00:59.699> I

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
Titans cut in that was pretty good so I

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.880 
Titans cut in that was pretty good so I
was<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> guys<00:01:01.320> when<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.710> were

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
was one of the guys when they were

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.529 
was one of the guys when they were
asking<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.760> characters<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.390> want

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
asking like what characters do you want

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.359 
asking like what characters do you want
the<00:01:03.629> game<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.799> guys<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.129> said

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
think she would have been a good DC

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.179 
think she would have been a good DC
character<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.110> game<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.590> she

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
character to have in the game and she

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.980

there so this guy looks pretty equipped
for<00:01:58.079> any<00:01:58.229> situation<00:01:59.210> other<00:02:00.210> than<00:02:00.390> what<00:02:01.079> I've

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
for any situation other than what I've

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.649

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
is capable of but I think he'll be a lot

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.399 
is capable of but I think he'll be a lot
of<00:02:05.850> fun<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.180> play<00:02:06.360> as
