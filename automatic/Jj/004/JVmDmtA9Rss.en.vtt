00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
starters the two bugs the bird and the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.890 
starters the two bugs the bird and the
normal<00:02:35.560> type<00:02:35.740> get<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.250> idea<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:36.880> when<00:02:37.480> I<00:02:37.510> first

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
normal type get the idea so when I first

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.410 
normal type get the idea so when I first
heard<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.530> theory<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.400> was<00:02:39.550> sort<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.850> puzzled

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
heard this theory I was sort of puzzled

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.830 
heard this theory I was sort of puzzled
by<00:02:40.750> its<00:02:41.230> validity<00:02:41.920> when<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.940> started<00:02:43.570> thinking

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
by its validity when I started thinking

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.200 
by its validity when I started thinking
about<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.800> theory<00:02:45.220> became<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.610> bit<00:02:45.940> more

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
about it the theory became a bit more

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.060 
about it the theory became a bit more
realistic<00:02:46.720> than<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.320> originally<00:02:47.500> thought

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
realistic than I originally thought

personally<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.240> would<00:02:49.480> like<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.780> emphasize

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
personally I would like to emphasize

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.120 
personally I would like to emphasize
that<00:02:50.620> there<00:02:51.040> is<00:02:51.310> no<00:02:51.790> evidence<00:02:52.270> for<00:02:52.690> this<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.980> be

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
that there is no evidence for this to be
