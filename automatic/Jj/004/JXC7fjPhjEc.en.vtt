 this book 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.869
 Father Jorge does not say 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:52.759
 talking about the origin of the cosmos 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:55.159
 what things p 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.259
 they do not do themselves 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:59.059
 home 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:00.409
 a table 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:01.399
 the same 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:03.939
 sun the star lands 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.929

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:10.799
 the table has made a carpenter a house the masons with the help of a 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.999
 architect and that on earth expresses to them they have been texas for god 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.500
 that is number one of the book Father Jorge 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.579
 and starts 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.309
 to demonstrate 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:24.309
 the existence of god through observation 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.589
 the creatures through observation of creation 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:29.549
 and says it 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.809
 do not walk on a beach 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:34.759
 and in the sand 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:35.939
 a footprint sa 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.060
 you will realize perfectly if what happened was a bird 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:41.939
 a dog 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.879
 a person a man 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.369
 they left their flights when passing 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:48.280
 god when creating 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.280
 he also said his footprint in nature 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.199
 and we are going to try to speak that footprint of God 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.949
 n in creation 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.829
 Saint Paul tells us that God is 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.629
 coti nosiglia so we can not know through the creature to 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.169
 through creation 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.579
 first father jorge 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.769
 he tells us some since he already 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:13.999
 of God 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:15.799
 in the sky 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.540
 and it shows us with overwhelming 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.579
 scientific data because yes 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.479
 it's very impressive it was worth it 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.999
 stop haley and study 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:27.029
 as Father Jorge describes 

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:29.650
 the couple action that exists in the cosmos 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.310
 tells us about the rotation of the planets of the composition of the 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.139
 show up 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.330
 of the movement 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.890
 of the stars that allow you to do the calendar 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.529
 thing that has been done for years 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:44.529
 thousands of years before Jesus Christ 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.050
 the creator 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.350
 of the world was a great mathematician does not say much scientists like 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.590
 alberto aysén 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.210
 minute before using 86 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.689
 yahir professor ecosport 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.710
 this wonderful agreement that we find in the creation 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.499
 there is great intelligence 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.389
 the more perfect in the work 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.389
 greater intelligence required is much more difficult 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:11.919
 make it 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.979
 a red hero must be made 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.050
 a wheelbarrow
