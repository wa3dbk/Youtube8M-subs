method<00:03:36.870> used<00:03:37.200> on<00:03:37.350> Oprah<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.770> lot<00:03:37.980> she'll<00:03:38.640> just

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
method used on Oprah a lot she'll just

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.360 
method used on Oprah a lot she'll just
use<00:03:38.970> like<00:03:39.300> a<00:03:39.540> tiny<00:03:39.930> layer<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.739> her<00:03:40.920> real<00:03:41.160> hair

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
use like a tiny layer of her real hair

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.460 
use like a tiny layer of her real hair
in<00:03:41.520> front<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:41.970> then<00:03:42.750> if<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.050> look<00:03:43.230> closely

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
in front and then if you look closely

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.960 
in front and then if you look closely
she<00:03:43.890> doesn't<00:03:44.130> use<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.340> black<00:03:44.520> hair<00:03:44.730> spray

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
she doesn't use the black hair spray

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.060 
she doesn't use the black hair spray
that's<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.300> trick<00:03:45.590> if<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.680> look<00:03:46.860> closely

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
that's the trick if you look closely

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.610 
that's the trick if you look closely

right behind the hair is a full black

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.250 
right behind the hair is a full black
wing<00:03:49.860> so<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.550> you<00:03:51.330> could<00:03:51.480> really<00:03:51.690> plug<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.140> on

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
wing so it's you could really plug it on

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.699 
wing so it's you could really plug it on
