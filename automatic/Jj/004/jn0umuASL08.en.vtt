00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 welcome friends my name is romance and in 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.609
 I have a real video for this video 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.160
 opportunity to show on a live example 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.559
 guitar weaknesses and some bugs 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.130
 newbies and their consequences so look 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.759
 I have a classic guitar in my hands 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.820
 cremona 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.890
 Czech guitar basically by the way guitar 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.960
 not bad now on such are from seven 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.850
 eight thousand rubles, but look what with 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.420
 it happened her masters decided 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.580
 put on a guitar which like which 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.349
 designed nylon strings they 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.989
 decided to put metal strings then 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.489
 There is this in principle very familiar 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.100
 mistake is often mistake myself and i in my 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.579
 time allowed and see what happened 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.640
 with guitar 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.309
 firstly she bent over very much 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.230
 the fingerboard twisted I will show you he started 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.649
 straight out you see yes here in this 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.059
 a gap appeared in the place 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.050
 naturally see what became great 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.640
 and distances from the stand of the neck 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.770
 she became just huge they say a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.030
 what about the fact that it is metal strings 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.700
 and here in this place began 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.860
 come off stand and how am I now 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.659
 understood these guys knew what to do 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.610
 it is impossible and that the stand can come off 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.299
 with mittens made they took screwed 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.930
 here two screwed stuck just took 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.330
 manually 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.939
 apply here or two screws that 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.130
 Of course the appearance of the guitar is specific 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.659
 spoil 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.670
 but because of this start 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.170
 swell up here this dk that is she 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.869
 started swelling out of here 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.460
 that 's what happened to the guitar which 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.580
 which is designed nylon string 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.500
 and put metal on it 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.790
 well friends here I repaired the guitar and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.409
 so look what i did first 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.049
 changed the strings put nylon 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.470
 more or less decent 300,400 rubles 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.479
 worth it means further gave even repair 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.729
 master he 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.289
 leveled the neck here is all glue science 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.390
 everything is right here now no 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.479
 there are no gaps here, too, no gaps 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.310
 no and so the ministry of the string 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.209
 become at a normal distance so you 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.489
 must be and see what strings are now 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.739
 soft spacing between the strings of the neck 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.840
 the minimum is therefore clamping has become one 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.370
 the pleasure that is on this guitar already 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.390
 really very convenient and comfortable to learn 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.780
 play that is so we from 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.610

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.260

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.650
 not play 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.310
