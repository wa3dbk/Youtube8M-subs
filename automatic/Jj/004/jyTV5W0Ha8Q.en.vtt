 will quietly go back in time 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.420
 since we are here and in the place of 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.640
 suburb opposite the tourist office 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.530
 in the neighborhood we will say the most 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.030
 recent that is already a few years old but 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.890
 it's the newest and we're going to 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.830
 tranquilize to stroll to reach 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.260
 the fortress the fly you sweat go 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.549

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:50.500
 hiking in Aveyron on the horizon 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.780
 streets of najac the castle perched on his 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.260
 Hill announces a great effort to get there 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.110
 to prepare 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.820
 benoît knows the good addresses the 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:06.189
 times that date we had prowled and najac 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:07.479
 a round trip hike is good 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.640
 stop at home if najac 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.170
 distinguishes it's thanks to its castle but 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.659
 also to the singular form of his 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.710
 village aubert this is one of the many 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.719
 village views 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.820
 it is true that we have a lot of najac 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:21.310
 and around here it makes good 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.719
 see and we will have other points of view 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.520
 who show that the village is 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.070
 really sure about some kind of prompt 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.600
 rocky there is the aveyron that form 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.460
 a natural barrier that will make the 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.450
 complete tour of the castle I will see months 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.490
 of August so here you are will have 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.259
 the opportunity to see him later and 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.390
 so was built on this rocky outcrop 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.740
 this fortress so not pursued to 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.749
 the visit after by the bank would have in 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.240
 besides going it's because goal 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:45.880
 it's the top of the dungeon anyway yeah 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.380
 okay and yes the climb up to 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.390
 castle is serious 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.189
 there is way to go about it - fingers of 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.929
 kill how are you doing shola for a few 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.249
 meters by the castle street and we 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.759
 join the main entrance of 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:00.340
 the building 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.289
 the site really has the appeal and I 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.119
 really looking forward to discovering it and for 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.270
 we serve as a guide we join 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.009
 isabelle the undisputed specialist of the 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.450
 strong 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.280
 we can ask ourselves a question that was 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.510
 come to make the kings of France in najac 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.799
 to make us a fortress of war 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.299
 also impressive who had come 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.319
 to make the kings of France in najac for me 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.239
 plant a fortress too 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.739
 impressive 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.090
 so it's definitely only najac here 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.000
 there are political economic issues 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.560
 important we will really take 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.970
 awareness of the importance of najac 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.590
 when this city is going to be integrated as well 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.790
 that the rouergue in the county of 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.680
 Toulouse, which is behind us 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.360
 samnick huge territory that is going 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.310
 to the Pyrenees and the counts of 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.079
 toulouse so will use this rouergue and 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.019
 najac among others as porto north to 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.430
 their territory and in the thirteenth century the 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.329
 saint louis's brother who's called 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.010
 alphonse de poitiers 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.659
 he's going to marry our princess jeanne de 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.670
 Toulouse and at the death of the Count of 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.900
 toulouse raymond 7 so this is this man 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.849
 alphonse de poitiers will make saint louis 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.920
 who in turn will be count of toulouse 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.760
 kilrea take power and for us 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.620
 show that they were powerful 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.060
 militarily speaking he made us 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.739
 build this huge fortress of war 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.599
 on top of the count's castle 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.220
 Fortress in question abounds with 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.379
 stratagems to make it 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.690
 impregnable but it has a 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.569
 feature that makes it unique in 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.010
 gigantic archers of 6 meters 80 which 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.079
 allowed soldiers to sweep their 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.459
 firing range to the base of the tower 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.650
 so we have five archers at 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.870
 ground floor first seven 6 at 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.949
 second set on the roof these 25 beautiful 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.560
 loopholes are all built in 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.760
 staggered there is no blind spot so 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.379
 the circumference of the tower and under 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.000
 vision of roach so we can shoot 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.000
 in every way it does not be 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.290
 attacked the place is awesome 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.150
 no wonder that this fearsome 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.540
 military art works is summer 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.269
 described as an impregnable fortress 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.870
 with Benoit I then climb 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:45.310
 steps leading to the top of the tower 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.310
 west passing white of which 10.6 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.760
 the discovery of the tower at all of a 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.330
 final bouquet 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.310
 from there the view opens 360 ° on the 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.500
 rouergue and visitors to my feet 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.120
 look like good ants there it's 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.070
 one is impressive how high 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.110
 the about-up then the dungeon he climaxes 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.880
 40 meters from the entrance but we are at 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.640
 about aveyron about 120 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.820
 meters down here is the savak 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:22.070
 saw her and she can not hurt 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.870
 do basic jump and that's the time 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.640
 came to leave najac to attack the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.480
 part hike but before 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.430
 attack 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.870
 some details on the possibilities 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.380
 walking in the area are only 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.830
 required 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.770
 so we propose a little guidebook 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.940
 hui hike around najac 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.760
 it's these risks are pretty much a 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.610
 good 80 90 km of marked trails on the 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.330
 sector and we always in the front 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.350
 give a view on the village 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.580
 I'll let you give your opinion on the 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.680
 view but it's really every time 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.610
 quite mind-blowing this village while 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.190
 length the fortress 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.860
 Well, there is more to go 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.260
 check that to go to the banks 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.160
 of the aveyron benoît a big thank you for 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.980
 this visit of najac 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.630
 now it's time to market go 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.270
 we go on, I take you to discover the 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.400
 banks of the aveyron and go to 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.980
 through the forest trails that 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.230
 surrounds the village of najac a new 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.000
 cool and shady environment where the water 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.310
 made his appearance as here had the 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.320
 Brook Green Aubin Here we 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.780
 nature in the middle of the woods and 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.690
 birdsong 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:32.630
 it's really appreciable and soothing 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.290
 to discover this other face of najac 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.510
 and its surroundings 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.910
 a face of greenery and agriculture or 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.800
 cows graze peacefully in 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.570
 large spaces sunny and flowery 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.790
 as impressive legal and sea that 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.050
 defend their little calves 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.260
 I have rarely seen that they are afraid we 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:52.270
 approaching too close what is it 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.270
 to me that they are well fed 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:00.240
 as I was told by Benoit I 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.940
 enjoy a splendid view on najac and 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.490
 his castle and change of scenery after 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.830
 the hamlet of cassagnes plunges on the 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.629
 banks the v1 and here it is the famous 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.870
 aveyron river that gave its name to the 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:14.060
 department a little cool that makes 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.229
 good too 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.090
 changing river that aveyron to 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.729
 around najac sometimes sweet 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.349
 peaceful and welcoming land of welcome 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.270
 of duck on a spree drifting on 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.280
 his course at lempdes puy sometimes more 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.379
 animated and agitated as evidenced 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:32.159
 several fast that make the happiness of 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:34.080
 kayak lovers it's aveyron to both 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:36.330

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.039
 country good so there's no picture it's 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:44.310
 really the little path ideal for 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:48.629
 stroll along the Aveyron after 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:51.750
 visit najac not a meter of elevation 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:54.870
 we let ourselves be rocked by the rhythm of 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.229
 the river 1 to repeat is a without 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.150
 fault 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.860
 you just have to let yourself sink 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.120
 to the foot of the hill that 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.610
 will climb by one of the many 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.330
 trails he walks do not doubt 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.330
