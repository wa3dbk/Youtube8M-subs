you're still getting the whole wheat but
it's<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.049> much<00:01:43.229> finer<00:01:44.930> it's<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.170> much<00:01:46.350> finer

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
so that when the oil in the flour mixed

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.460 
so that when the oil in the flour mixed
together<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.759> makes<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.119> roux<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.630> what

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
together that makes a roux and what

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.740 
together that makes a roux and what
that's<00:01:55.680> gonna<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.390> do<00:01:57.509> two

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
that's gonna do is it's going to do two

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.499 
that's gonna do is it's going to do two
things<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.200> gonna<00:01:58.350> cook<00:01:59.189> some<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
things it's gonna cook some of the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.219 
things it's gonna cook some of the
flowery<00:02:01.020> taste<00:02:01.409> out<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.189> flour<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.869> your

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
flowery taste out of the flour so your

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.950 
flowery taste out of the flour so your
gravy<00:02:04.649> doesn't<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.369> taste<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.270> but

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
gravy doesn't have that taste to it but

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.699 
gravy doesn't have that taste to it but
it's<00:02:07.079> also<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.069> make<00:02:08.399> sure<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:09.709> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
it's also going to make sure that the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.610 
it's also going to make sure that the
flower<00:02:11.009> incorporates<00:02:11.879> evenly<00:02:12.390> into<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.780> oil

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
flower incorporates evenly into the oil

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.140 
flower incorporates evenly into the oil
so<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.860> way<00:02:14.010> when<00:02:14.159> you<00:02:14.280> add<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.610> liquid<00:02:14.970> to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
so that way when you add the liquid to

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.869 
so that way when you add the liquid to
it<00:02:15.330> you're<00:02:15.870> not<00:02:16.080> going<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.379> end<00:02:16.560> up<00:02:16.799> with<00:02:17.129> a

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
it you're not going to end up with a

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.839 
it you're not going to end up with a
bunch<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.540> lumps<00:02:18.959> from<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.409> flower<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.099> you

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
bunch of lumps from the flower so you

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.430 
bunch of lumps from the flower so you
just<00:02:20.970> want<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.239> turn<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.629> heat<00:02:21.840> up<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.230> maybe

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
just want to turn the heat up to maybe

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.399 
just want to turn the heat up to maybe
run<00:02:23.190> medium<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.180> we're<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:24.959> going<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.110> cook

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
run medium and we're just going to cook

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:31.130 
run medium and we're just going to cook
this<00:02:25.620> for<00:02:25.950> about<00:02:26.810> two<00:02:27.810> or<00:02:27.840> three<00:02:28.230> minutes<00:02:30.140> so

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140

thicker gravy cuz I know some people

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.650 
thicker gravy cuz I know some people
like<00:02:49.769> their<00:02:49.950> Grammys<00:02:50.340> really<00:02:50.640> thick<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.450> can

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
like their Grammys really thick you can

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.420 
like their Grammys really thick you can
just<00:02:51.810> add<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.019> couple<00:02:52.319> more<00:02:52.470> tablespoons<00:02:53.250> of

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
just add a couple more tablespoons of

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.580 
just add a couple more tablespoons of
flour<00:02:53.579> and<00:02:54.060> what<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.840> will<00:02:54.959> do<00:02:55.109> is<00:02:55.140> give<00:02:55.470> you

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
flour and what that will do is give you

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.710 
flour and what that will do is give you
more<00:02:55.859> like<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.069> paste<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:57.239> you'll<00:02:57.420> have<00:02:57.569> in

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
more like a paste that you'll have in

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.470 
more like a paste that you'll have in
here<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:58.819> cook<00:02:59.819> it<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.090> same<00:03:00.299> way<00:03:00.450> I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
here and you just cook it the same way I

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.240 
here and you just cook it the same way I
just<00:03:00.569> keep<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.379> want<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.650> stir<00:03:01.890> constantly

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
just keep you want to stir constantly

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.770 
just keep you want to stir constantly
because<00:03:02.849> you<00:03:02.970> don't<00:03:03.120> want<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.420> stick<00:03:03.629> to

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
because you don't want it to stick to

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.869 
because you don't want it to stick to
the<00:03:03.810> bottle<00:03:04.230> but<00:03:04.769> just<00:03:05.099> stir<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.609> paste

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
the bottle but just stir the paste

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.479 
the bottle but just stir the paste
around<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:07.049> it<00:03:07.319> really<00:03:07.349> just<00:03:07.709> depends<00:03:08.159> on<00:03:08.340> how

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
around so it really just depends on how

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.160 
around so it really just depends on how
thinner<00:03:08.849> how<00:03:09.090> thick<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.540> like<00:03:09.569> your<00:03:09.750> gravy

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
thinner how thick you like your gravy

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.069 
thinner how thick you like your gravy
but<00:03:10.950> um<00:03:11.190> actually<00:03:11.790> right<00:03:12.329> before<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.690> ask<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
but um actually right before I ask the

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.589 
but um actually right before I ask the
water<00:03:13.430> I'm<00:03:14.430> gonna<00:03:14.700> just<00:03:15.000> turn<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.390> heat<00:03:15.569> down

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
water I'm gonna just turn the heat down

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.089 
water I'm gonna just turn the heat down
a<00:03:15.810> little<00:03:16.019> bit<00:03:16.290> run<00:03:16.620> down<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.980> medium<00:03:17.430> low<00:03:18.299> and

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
a little bit run down the medium low and

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.690 
a little bit run down the medium low and
i'm<00:03:20.099> gonna<00:03:20.430> add<00:03:20.760> some<00:03:22.040> fresh<00:03:23.040> cracked<00:03:23.459> black

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
pepper in there that's kind of like an

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.550 
pepper in there that's kind of like an
essential<00:03:28.010> spice<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.370> we<00:03:29.489> need<00:03:29.669> in<00:03:29.700> here<00:03:29.849> and

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
essential spice that we need in here and

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.990 
essential spice that we need in here and
we<00:03:31.560> also<00:03:31.709> want<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.250> make<00:03:32.340> sure<00:03:32.400> we<00:03:32.730> put<00:03:32.970> a

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
we also want to make sure we put a

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.619 
we also want to make sure we put a
decent<00:03:33.450> amount<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:34.819> salt<00:03:35.819> or<00:03:36.599> um<00:03:37.220> as<00:03:38.599> what<00:03:39.599> i

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
decent amount of salt or um as what i

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.390 
decent amount of salt or um as what i
normally<00:03:39.780> do<00:03:40.349> is<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.709> put<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.950> little<00:03:41.069> bit<00:03:41.370> of

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
normally do is I put a little bit of

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.780 
normally do is I put a little bit of
salt<00:03:41.639> and<00:03:41.940> then<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:43.440> add<00:03:43.980> about<00:03:44.310> two

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
salt and then I add about two

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.229 
salt and then I add about two
tablespoons<00:03:45.379> of<00:03:46.379> tamari<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.160> what<00:03:48.090> the

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
tablespoons of tamari and what the

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.909 
tablespoons of tamari and what the
tamari<00:03:48.599> does<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.109> give<00:03:49.319> it<00:03:49.440> like<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.620> really

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
tamari does is give it like a really

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:55.809 
tamari does is give it like a really
smoky<00:03:50.730> flavor<00:03:51.260> almost<00:03:52.970> so<00:03:53.970> it's<00:03:54.209> good<00:03:54.480> for<00:03:54.810> the

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
smoky flavor almost so it's good for the

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.089 
smoky flavor almost so it's good for the
gravy<00:03:56.819> flavor<00:03:57.419> so<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.079> just<00:03:58.139> mix<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.620> tamari

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
gravy flavor so you just mix that tamari

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.800 
gravy flavor so you just mix that tamari
in<00:03:59.280> there<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.579> also<00:03:59.879> helps<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.239> give<00:04:00.419> the<00:04:00.569> gravy

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
in there it also helps to give the gravy

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.789 
in there it also helps to give the gravy
a<00:04:00.930> nice<00:04:01.169> dark<00:04:01.949> brown<00:04:02.400> color<00:04:02.840> so<00:04:03.840> after<00:04:04.199> I<00:04:04.500> mix

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
a nice dark brown color so after I mix

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.970 
a nice dark brown color so after I mix
the<00:04:04.949> tomariians<00:04:05.810> I'm<00:04:06.810> also<00:04:07.290> going<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:07.829> add

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
the tomariians I'm also going to add

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.689 
the tomariians I'm also going to add
this<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.549> some<00:04:09.120> just<00:04:09.720> some<00:04:09.930> ground<00:04:10.769> sage<00:04:11.280> and

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
this is some just some ground sage and

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:16.029 
this is some just some ground sage and
that's<00:04:12.359> kind<00:04:12.690> of<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.989> like<00:04:13.410> an<00:04:13.560> essential

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
that's kind of a like an essential

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.430 
that's kind of a like an essential

rosemary<00:04:30.970> and<00:04:31.870> throw<00:04:32.110> that<00:04:32.350> in<00:04:32.560> here<00:04:32.830> so

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
rosemary and throw that in here so

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.430 
rosemary and throw that in here so
really<00:04:33.880> it's<00:04:34.180> just<00:04:34.360> all<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.600> matter<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:35.080> taste

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
really it's just all a matter of taste

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.590 
really it's just all a matter of taste
and<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:36.310> can<00:04:36.490> see<00:04:36.669> how<00:04:36.820> it's<00:04:37.030> starting<00:04:37.180> to

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
and you can see how it's starting to

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.870 
and you can see how it's starting to
cook<00:04:37.810> down<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.380> a<00:04:38.410> paste<00:04:38.860> like<00:04:39.070> I<00:04:39.310> is<00:04:39.430> dead<00:04:39.700> and

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
cook down to a paste like I is dead and

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.570 
cook down to a paste like I is dead and
that's<00:04:40.000> fine<00:04:40.389> because<00:04:41.050> at<00:04:41.560> this<00:04:41.740> point<00:04:41.889> I'm

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
that's fine because at this point I'm

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.270 
that's fine because at this point I'm
just<00:04:42.880> going<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.090> go<00:04:43.240> ahead<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.750> add<00:04:43.870> about<00:04:44.280> a

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
just going to go ahead and add about a

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
just going to go ahead and add about a
cup<00:04:45.490> of<00:04:45.880> water<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.510> this<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.830> again<00:04:48.790> if<00:04:49.150> you

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
cup of water to this and again if you

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.030 
cup of water to this and again if you
like<00:04:49.450> it<00:04:49.690> thicker<00:04:49.990> then<00:04:50.350> you<00:04:50.470> add<00:04:50.620> more<00:04:50.860> water

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
like it thicker then you add more water

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.560 
like it thicker then you add more water
if<00:04:51.220> you<00:04:51.400> like<00:04:51.580> it<00:04:51.730> thinner<00:04:51.940> you<00:04:52.150> had<00:04:52.300> less

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
if you like it thinner you had less

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.379 
if you like it thinner you had less
water<00:04:52.930> but<00:04:53.830> it's<00:04:54.130> going<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.760> thicken<00:04:55.030> as<00:04:55.360> it

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
water but it's going to thicken as it

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.990 
water but it's going to thicken as it
cooks<00:04:55.870> here<00:04:56.200> so<00:04:57.100> I'm<00:04:57.220> just<00:04:57.430> going<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.639> go<00:04:57.850> ahead

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
cooks here so I'm just going to go ahead

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.300 
cooks here so I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:04:58.360> mix<00:04:58.540> all<00:04:58.780> this<00:04:59.050> in<00:04:59.639> and<00:05:01.740> just<00:05:02.740> make<00:05:03.280> sure

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
and mix all this in and just make sure

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.700 
and mix all this in and just make sure
there's<00:05:03.729> no<00:05:03.940> lumps<00:05:04.450> star<00:05:04.780> in<00:05:04.990> all<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.410> cooked

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
there's no lumps star in all the cooked

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.469 
there's no lumps star in all the cooked
flour<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:09.250> sometimes<00:05:09.850> if<00:05:10.030> it<00:05:10.150> seems<00:05:10.389> like

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
flour and sometimes if it seems like

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.050 
flour and sometimes if it seems like
it's<00:05:10.720> not<00:05:10.900> really<00:05:11.169> coming<00:05:11.470> together<00:05:11.850> you<00:05:12.850> just

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
it's not really coming together you just

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.940 
it's not really coming together you just
want<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:13.270> give<00:05:13.479> it<00:05:13.600> a<00:05:13.660> minute<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:14.350> sometimes

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
want to give it a minute and sometimes

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.780 
want to give it a minute and sometimes
it's<00:05:15.130> also<00:05:15.370> easier<00:05:16.090> if<00:05:16.600> you<00:05:16.990> have<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:17.889> whip<00:05:18.280> if

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
it's also easier if you have a whip if

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.629 
it's also easier if you have a whip if
you<00:05:19.510> want<00:05:19.720> to<00:05:19.810> go<00:05:19.930> ahead<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.440> use<00:05:21.310> a<00:05:21.340> little

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
you want to go ahead and use a little

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.940 
you want to go ahead and use a little
bit<00:05:21.760> of<00:05:21.820> a<00:05:21.970> whisk<00:05:22.240> in<00:05:22.540> here<00:05:22.780> that<00:05:23.440> will<00:05:23.620> help<00:05:23.770> to

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
bit of a whisk in here that will help to

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.719 
bit of a whisk in here that will help to
get<00:05:24.100> everything<00:05:24.370> incorporated<00:05:25.770> nicely<00:05:26.770> and

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
get everything incorporated nicely and

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.140 
get everything incorporated nicely and
you<00:05:27.760> can<00:05:28.240> see<00:05:28.419> it's<00:05:28.570> starting<00:05:28.780> to<00:05:29.020> thicken<00:05:29.260> up

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
you can see it's starting to thicken up

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.029 
you can see it's starting to thicken up
so<00:05:31.150> what<00:05:31.450> I'm<00:05:31.539> going<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:31.750> do<00:05:31.960> is<00:05:32.260> leave<00:05:32.770> it<00:05:32.919> on

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
so what I'm going to do is leave it on

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.969 
so what I'm going to do is leave it on
this<00:05:33.280> medium<00:05:34.180> heat<00:05:34.450> and<00:05:34.900> we're<00:05:35.470> gonna<00:05:35.620> let<00:05:35.860> it

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
this medium heat and we're gonna let it

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.760 
this medium heat and we're gonna let it
cook<00:05:36.250> for<00:05:36.550> about<00:05:36.610> another<00:05:37.169> probably<00:05:38.169> it

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
cook for about another probably it

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.800 
cook for about another probably it
usually<00:05:39.130> takes<00:05:39.370> about<00:05:39.520> 10<00:05:39.970> minutes<00:05:40.000> for<00:05:40.690> it<00:05:40.720> to

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
usually takes about 10 minutes for it to

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.710 
usually takes about 10 minutes for it to
thicken<00:05:41.169> up<00:05:41.410> so<00:05:42.070> we'll<00:05:42.340> check<00:05:42.910> back<00:05:42.970> in<00:05:43.419> on<00:05:43.539> it

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
thicken up so we'll check back in on it

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.070 
thicken up so we'll check back in on it
in<00:05:43.810> a<00:05:43.900> few<00:05:44.140> minutes<00:05:45.120> all<00:05:46.120> right<00:05:46.360> and<00:05:46.570> one<00:05:46.780> to

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
in a few minutes all right and one to

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.100 
in a few minutes all right and one to
see<00:05:47.410> that<00:05:48.310> the<00:05:48.700> gravy<00:05:49.180> is<00:05:49.210> the<00:05:49.479> consistency

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
see that the gravy is the consistency

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.379 
see that the gravy is the consistency
that<00:05:50.289> you're<00:05:50.560> looking<00:05:50.950> for<00:05:51.190> like<00:05:51.850> I<00:05:52.000> said<00:05:52.240> it's

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
that you're looking for like I said it's

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:53.790 
that you're looking for like I said it's
really<00:05:52.690> just<00:05:52.840> a<00:05:53.050> matter<00:05:53.260> of<00:05:53.410> personal

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
really just a matter of personal

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.340 
really just a matter of personal
preference<00:05:54.400> my<00:05:55.389> gravy<00:05:55.780> looks<00:05:56.770> about<00:05:58.350> just

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
preference my gravy looks about just

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.240 
preference my gravy looks about just
like<00:05:59.500> regular<00:05:59.770> traditional<00:06:00.280> gravy<00:06:01.770> style<00:06:02.770> um

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
like regular traditional gravy style um

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.310 
like regular traditional gravy style um
but<00:06:03.820> like<00:06:04.150> I<00:06:04.270> said<00:06:04.330> some<00:06:04.720> people<00:06:04.840> like<00:06:05.139> in<00:06:05.260> a

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
but like I said some people like in a

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.900 
but like I said some people like in a
little<00:06:05.410> thinner<00:06:05.770> some<00:06:06.100> people<00:06:06.370> like<00:06:06.490> a<00:06:06.520> little

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
little thinner some people like a little

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.060 
little thinner some people like a little
thicker<00:06:07.180> so<00:06:07.780> its<00:06:07.810> really<00:06:08.110> do<00:06:08.620> whatever<00:06:08.919> you

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
thicker so its really do whatever you

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.670 
thicker so its really do whatever you
want<00:06:09.280> with<00:06:09.340> it<00:06:09.460> but<00:06:10.270> I<00:06:10.570> just<00:06:11.080> remember<00:06:11.560> the

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
want with it but I just remember the

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.320 
want with it but I just remember the
three<00:06:11.950> things<00:06:12.160> that<00:06:12.370> you<00:06:12.520> really<00:06:12.610> need<00:06:13.090> that

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
three things that you really need that

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.870 
three things that you really need that

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
is going to thicken it and then um just

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.520 
is going to thicken it and then um just
some<00:06:23.530> amount<00:06:23.860> of<00:06:24.010> liquid<00:06:24.430> and<00:06:24.990> it's<00:06:25.990> all<00:06:26.289> gonna

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
some amount of liquid and it's all gonna

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.409 
some amount of liquid and it's all gonna
cook<00:06:26.830> down<00:06:27.039> and<00:06:27.370> make<00:06:27.490> a<00:06:27.520> nice<00:06:27.820> thick<00:06:28.120> gravy

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
about less than 15 minutes altogether so

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.960 
about less than 15 minutes altogether so
