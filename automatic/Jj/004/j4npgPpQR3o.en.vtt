aperture lens is something that we are
really<00:04:39.120> excited<00:04:39.330> about<00:04:39.750> because<00:04:40.319> the<00:04:40.590> image

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
really excited about because the image

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.950 
really excited about because the image
quality<00:04:41.039> we<00:04:41.550> tested<00:04:42.060> even<00:04:42.389> from<00:04:42.569> the<00:04:42.689> sraw

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.529 
quality we tested even from the sraw
floor<00:04:43.259> was<00:04:43.830> pretty<00:04:44.129> exciting<00:04:44.699> so<00:04:45.270> we<00:04:45.449> are

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
floor was pretty exciting so we are

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.290 
floor was pretty exciting so we are
raring<00:04:46.259> to<00:04:46.289> test<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:47.340> 16<00:04:47.789> megapixel<00:04:48.270> unit

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.439 
raring to test the 16 megapixel unit
here<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:48.960> as<00:04:49.830> usual<00:04:50.280> we<00:04:50.490> have<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.969> heart<00:04:51.240> rate

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
here and as usual we have the heart rate

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.219 
here and as usual we have the heart rate
sensor<00:04:51.479> and<00:04:52.229> a<00:04:52.949> single<00:04:53.639> LED<00:04:54.029> flash<00:04:54.060> here<00:04:54.779> at

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.719 
that there is a big front facing camera
which<00:05:02.430> again<00:05:02.879> is<00:05:03.289> excellent<00:05:04.310> from<00:05:05.310> what<00:05:05.580> we

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
which again is excellent from what we

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.390 
which again is excellent from what we
are<00:05:05.759> tested<00:05:06.360> at<00:05:06.509> the<00:05:06.930> event<00:05:07.259> so<00:05:07.590> let's<00:05:07.830> power

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
are tested at the event so let's power

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.159 
are tested at the event so let's power
it<00:05:08.490> on<00:05:08.759> and<00:05:09.029> see<00:05:09.870> what<00:05:10.349> it's<00:05:10.560> really<00:05:10.620> like

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
it on and see what it's really like

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.189 
it on and see what it's really like
we're<00:05:13.169> also<00:05:13.319> excited<00:05:13.650> to<00:05:14.039> use<00:05:14.279> the<00:05:14.610> latest

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
we're also excited to use the latest

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.769 
we're also excited to use the latest
lollipop<00:05:16.199> based<00:05:16.590> TouchWiz<00:05:17.279> and<00:05:17.580> for<00:05:18.569> a<00:05:18.599> quick

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:18.779 
lollipop based TouchWiz and for a quick

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:21.980 
lollipop based TouchWiz and for a quick
comparison<00:05:18.990> I<00:05:19.529> have<00:05:19.800> here<00:05:20.189> the<00:05:20.460> north<00:05:20.759> edge<00:05:21.090> so

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
comparison I have here the north edge so

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.439 
comparison I have here the north edge so
you<00:05:22.050> can<00:05:22.259> see<00:05:22.439> the<00:05:22.650> differences<00:05:23.520> here<00:05:23.729> in

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
you can see the differences here in

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.959 
you can see the differences here in
terms<00:05:24.810> of<00:05:25.050> the<00:05:25.199> edge<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:26.370> edge<00:05:26.400> screen<00:05:26.759> is

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
terms of the edge the edge screen is

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.360 
terms of the edge the edge screen is
more<00:05:27.150> prominent<00:05:27.719> on<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.930> north<00:05:28.319> edge<00:05:28.560> and<00:05:28.860> has

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
more prominent on the north edge and has

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.969 
more prominent on the north edge and has
a<00:05:29.669> couple<00:05:30.089> of<00:05:30.150> tricks<00:05:30.449> to<00:05:30.719> its<00:05:31.349> edge<00:05:31.560> screen

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
a couple of tricks to its edge screen

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.570 
a couple of tricks to its edge screen
but<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:33.000> screen<00:05:33.300> ends<00:05:33.770> rather<00:05:34.770> too<00:05:35.099> soon<00:05:35.370> on

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
but the screen ends rather too soon on

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.499 
but the screen ends rather too soon on
the<00:05:36.319> galaxy<00:05:37.319> s6<00:05:37.620> actually<00:05:38.580> you<00:05:38.669> can<00:05:38.819> take<00:05:39.449> a

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
the galaxy s6 actually you can take a

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.629 
the galaxy s6 actually you can take a
look<00:05:39.810> at<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.229> difference<00:05:40.589> here<00:05:40.680> the<00:05:41.339> screen

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
look at the difference here the screen

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.029 
look at the difference here the screen
does<00:05:42.000> and<00:05:42.270> a<00:05:42.599> little<00:05:43.020> bit<00:05:43.139> sooner

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
does and a little bit sooner

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.790 
does and a little bit sooner
you<00:05:44.129> have<00:05:44.310> a<00:05:44.339> little<00:05:44.669> bit<00:05:44.789> of<00:05:44.909> a<00:05:44.969> bezel<00:05:45.710> even<00:05:46.710> on

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
you have a little bit of a bezel even on

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.010 
you have a little bit of a bezel even on
the<00:05:46.889> note<00:05:47.520> edge<00:05:47.759> but<00:05:48.060> still<00:05:48.089> you<00:05:48.509> can<00:05:48.659> see<00:05:48.810> that

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
the note edge but still you can see that

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.980 
the note edge but still you can see that
it<00:05:49.169> extends<00:05:49.620> a<00:05:49.770> little<00:05:49.830> bit<00:05:50.219> more<00:05:50.449> so<00:05:51.449> there<00:05:51.870> is

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
it extends a little bit more so there is

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.769 
it extends a little bit more so there is
no<00:05:52.139> edge<00:05:52.379> screen<00:05:52.710> on<00:05:53.009> the<00:05:53.460> s6<00:05:53.969> edge<00:05:54.360> but<00:05:54.659> it

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
no edge screen on the s6 edge but it

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:57.980 
no edge screen on the s6 edge but it
does<00:05:55.020> have<00:05:55.319> its<00:05:55.949> features<00:05:56.629> so<00:05:57.629> we'll<00:05:57.779> take<00:05:57.930> a

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
does have its features so we'll take a

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.019 
does have its features so we'll take a
look<00:05:58.139> at<00:05:58.289> those<00:05:58.650> in<00:05:58.979> a<00:05:59.189> separate<00:05:59.490> video<00:05:59.699> but

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:00.029 
look at those in a separate video but

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:02.329 
look at those in a separate video but
let's<00:06:00.689> quickly<00:06:01.110> walk<00:06:01.259> through<00:06:01.469> the<00:06:01.979> software

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:02.339 
let's quickly walk through the software

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:04.820 
let's quickly walk through the software

are brilliant the PPI is mind-blowing
and<00:06:10.620> how<00:06:11.129> much<00:06:11.310> ever<00:06:11.490> you<00:06:11.729> zoom<00:06:12.120> in<00:06:12.300> that<00:06:12.930> text

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
and how much ever you zoom in that text

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.230 
and how much ever you zoom in that text
looks<00:06:13.589> extremely<00:06:14.550> sharp

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
looks extremely sharp

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.110 
looks extremely sharp
that's<00:06:15.539> something<00:06:16.039> unrivaled<00:06:17.039> I<00:06:17.279> guess<00:06:17.460> it's

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
that's something unrivaled I guess it's

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.749 
that's something unrivaled I guess it's
too<00:06:18.659> high<00:06:18.900> when<00:06:19.889> you<00:06:19.979> think<00:06:20.159> about<00:06:20.370> it<00:06:20.490> the

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 
too high when you think about it the

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.700 
too high when you think about it the
pixel<00:06:21.180> density<00:06:21.300> it's<00:06:21.689> not<00:06:21.900> really<00:06:22.229> needed<00:06:22.379> but

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
pixel density it's not really needed but

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.879 
pixel density it's not really needed but
it<00:06:23.219> does<00:06:23.490> feel<00:06:23.849> like<00:06:23.879> paper<00:06:24.599> and<00:06:24.889> obviously

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 
it does feel like paper and obviously

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.629 
it does feel like paper and obviously
the<00:06:26.099> edge<00:06:26.250> screen<00:06:26.580> here<00:06:26.939> nicely<00:06:27.719> blends<00:06:28.709> I

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
the edge screen here nicely blends I

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.200 
the edge screen here nicely blends I
mean<00:06:30.360> then<00:06:30.630> when<00:06:30.899> you<00:06:31.050> swipe<00:06:31.349> between<00:06:31.949> the

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
mean then when you swipe between the

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.900 
mean then when you swipe between the
screams<00:06:32.630> it<00:06:32.870> feels<00:06:33.199> like<00:06:33.530> it<00:06:33.740> goes<00:06:34.220> you<00:06:34.789> know

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
screams it feels like it goes you know

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.320 
screams it feels like it goes you know
behind<00:06:35.810> because<00:06:36.199> of<00:06:36.410> the<00:06:36.470> edge<00:06:36.560> screen<00:06:37.330> the

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
behind because of the edge screen the

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.600 
behind because of the edge screen the
curve<00:06:38.570> the<00:06:39.229> curve<00:06:39.259> makes<00:06:39.830> it<00:06:40.039> look<00:06:40.220> like<00:06:40.430> that

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
curve the curve makes it look like that

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.040 
curve the curve makes it look like that
and<00:06:40.910> that's<00:06:41.330> pretty<00:06:41.509> cool

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
and that's pretty cool

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.980 
and that's pretty cool
and<00:06:42.410> there's<00:06:42.740> also<00:06:42.949> the<00:06:43.370> ability<00:06:43.850> to<00:06:44.570> swipe

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
and there's also the ability to swipe

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.980 
and there's also the ability to swipe
from<00:06:45.259> the<00:06:45.380> left<00:06:45.500> in<00:06:46.340> many<00:06:46.759> apps<00:06:47.090> including<00:06:47.900> a
