kind of having all these strings ringing

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.330 
kind of having all these strings ringing
out<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.410> it<00:04:53.470> sounds<00:04:53.740> nice<00:04:53.919> to<00:04:54.069> have<00:04:54.190> them

ringing<00:04:54.610> out<00:04:54.759> is<00:04:55.240> when<00:04:55.449> you<00:04:55.509> do<00:04:55.600> that<00:04:55.780> pull<00:04:56.020> off

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
ringing out is when you do that pull off

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.469 
ringing out is when you do that pull off
is<00:04:56.500> do<00:04:57.430> it<00:04:57.520> a<00:04:57.580> little<00:04:57.729> bit<00:04:57.819> different<00:04:58.210> than<00:04:58.330> how

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
is do it a little bit different than how

I<00:04:58.509> normally<00:04:58.660> teach<00:04:59.289> you<00:04:59.440> normally<00:04:59.740> teach<00:04:59.949> you

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
I normally teach you normally teach you

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.730 
I normally teach you normally teach you
to<00:05:00.250> you<00:05:01.150> know<00:05:01.210> to<00:05:01.360> pull<00:05:01.539> straight<00:05:01.840> back<00:05:02.050> well

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
to you know to pull straight back well

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.320 
to you know to pull straight back well
because<00:05:03.039> this<00:05:03.220> 4th<00:05:03.520> strings<00:05:03.849> ringing<00:05:04.210> out

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
because this 4th strings ringing out

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.450 
because this 4th strings ringing out
we're<00:05:05.139> going<00:05:05.259> to<00:05:05.319> have<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.470> pull<00:05:05.680> off<00:05:05.889> a<00:05:06.130> kind

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
we're going to have to pull off a kind

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.029 
we're going to have to pull off a kind
of<00:05:06.520> a<00:05:06.580> 45<00:05:07.060> degree<00:05:07.240> angle<00:05:07.449> there<00:05:07.990> on<00:05:08.319> your<00:05:08.800> third

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
of a 45 degree angle there on your third

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.820 
of a 45 degree angle there on your third
string<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:09.759> that<00:05:09.789> we<00:05:10.389> don't<00:05:10.539> hit<00:05:11.229> that<00:05:11.259> fourth

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
string so that we don't hit that fourth

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.180 
string so that we don't hit that fourth
string<00:05:12.099> and<00:05:12.310> mute<00:05:12.729> it<00:05:12.849> out

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.170 

it's<00:05:16.970> kind<00:05:17.090> of<00:05:17.180> like<00:05:17.240> that

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.510 

so<00:05:20.810> that's<00:05:20.960> all<00:05:21.110> over<00:05:21.590> that<00:05:21.710> G<00:05:21.919> minor<00:05:22.160> chord

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
so that's all over that G minor chord

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.850 
so that's all over that G minor chord
now<00:05:22.759> when<00:05:22.910> we<00:05:23.000> move<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.360> measure<00:05:24.169> three<00:05:24.590> there

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
now when we move to measure three there

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.320 
now when we move to measure three there
we<00:05:25.039> go<00:05:25.130> to<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.280> C<00:05:25.580> minor<00:05:25.820> chord<00:05:26.120> and<00:05:26.180> we're

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
we go to a C minor chord and we're

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330 
we go to a C minor chord and we're
getting<00:05:26.389> a<00:05:26.539> C<00:05:26.780> minor<00:05:27.020> chord<00:05:27.380> kind<00:05:27.979> of<00:05:28.070> a<00:05:28.130> weird

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
getting a C minor chord kind of a weird

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
getting a C minor chord kind of a weird

those two together now you're just going

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.740 
those two together now you're just going
arpeggiate<00:06:06.349> that<00:06:06.590> fit<00:06:07.520> string<00:06:07.910> fourth<00:06:08.389> string

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
arpeggiate that fit string fourth string

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:16.290 
arpeggiate that fit string fourth string
third<00:06:09.349> first<00:06:10.360> fifth<00:06:11.360> fourth<00:06:11.960> third<00:06:12.160> and<00:06:13.160> first

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.920 

so<00:06:17.050> in<00:06:17.530> time<00:06:18.340> it<00:06:18.639> goes<00:06:18.819> 1<00:06:19.210> 2<00:06:19.259> &amp;<00:06:20.259> 3<00:06:20.409> n

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
so in time it goes 1 2 &amp; 3 n

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.870 
so in time it goes 1 2 &amp; 3 n
rhythmically<00:06:22.830> that's<00:06:23.100> how<00:06:23.220> it<00:06:23.280> sounds<00:06:23.610> one

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.460 
rhythmically that's how it sounds one
two<00:06:24.479> and<00:06:24.840> three<00:06:25.910> so<00:06:26.910> up<00:06:27.330> to<00:06:27.539> that<00:06:27.660> point<00:06:27.720> one

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
two and three so up to that point one

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:36.850 
two and three so up to that point one
two<00:06:29.130> three<00:06:29.910> one<00:06:30.150> two

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.550 

okay<00:06:37.550> and<00:06:38.120> then<00:06:38.240> from<00:06:38.449> there<00:06:38.509> we<00:06:38.990> go<00:06:39.139> to<00:06:39.199> an<00:06:39.349> E

so<00:06:58.710> if<00:06:58.770> we<00:06:58.860> put<00:06:59.040> C<00:06:59.280> minor<00:06:59.550> going<00:06:59.880> into<00:07:00.060> that<00:07:00.180> E

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
so if we put C minor going into that E

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.770 
so if we put C minor going into that E
