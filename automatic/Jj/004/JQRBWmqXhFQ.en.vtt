today<00:00:02.070> we're<00:00:02.250> going<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.400> be<00:00:02.550> talking<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:03.060> little

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:03.150 
today we're going to be talking a little

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:20.750 
today we're going to be talking a little
bit<00:00:03.300> about<00:00:03.540> charging<00:00:04.110> batteries<00:00:18.980> so<00:00:19.980> instead

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
bit about charging batteries so instead

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.460 
bit about charging batteries so instead
of<00:00:20.820> going<00:00:21.000> down<00:00:21.269> to<00:00:21.300> our<00:00:21.539> lab<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.050> asking<00:00:22.380> of

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
of going down to our lab and asking of

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.290 
of going down to our lab and asking of
what<00:00:22.680> they<00:00:22.859> use<00:00:23.100> for<00:00:23.130> charging<00:00:23.849> batteries

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
what they use for charging batteries

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.109 
what they use for charging batteries
hold<00:00:25.289> up<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.560> couple<00:00:25.830> buddies<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.310> said<00:00:26.550> go

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
hold up a couple buddies and said go

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.490 
hold up a couple buddies and said go
through<00:00:27.330> your<00:00:27.420> garage<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.019> bring<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:28.470> you

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
through your garage and bring what you

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.970 
through your garage and bring what you
got<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.609> I've<00:00:29.789> got<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> pretty<00:00:30.300> wide<00:00:31.289> selection

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
got so I've got a pretty wide selection

batteries<00:00:44.130> what<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> make<00:00:45.510> sure<00:00:45.540> of

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
batteries what you want to make sure of

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.110 
batteries what you want to make sure of
is<00:00:46.080> that<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.590> your<00:00:46.800> battery<00:00:47.190> ever<00:00:47.430> gets

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
is that if your battery ever gets

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.000 
is that if your battery ever gets
discharged<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.260> get<00:00:49.650> to<00:00:49.830> it<00:00:49.980> quickly

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
discharged that you get to it quickly

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.120 
discharged that you get to it quickly
and<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:51.270> recharge<00:00:51.810> it<00:00:52.080> quickly<00:00:52.350> as<00:00:52.770> if<00:00:52.980> you

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
and then recharge it quickly as if you

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.660 
and then recharge it quickly as if you
leave<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.790> discharge<00:00:54.300> state<00:00:55.670> sulfation

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670

sets<00:00:57.150> into<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.510> battery<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.110> what<00:00:58.650> that<00:00:58.830> is<00:00:59.040> is

sets into a battery and what that is is

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.670 
sets into a battery and what that is is
the<00:00:59.460> electrolyte<00:00:59.880> actually<00:01:00.680> crystallizes

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the electrolyte actually crystallizes

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.540 
the electrolyte actually crystallizes
and<00:01:02.690> forms<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.409> crystals<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.949> make<00:01:05.190> it<00:01:05.340> very

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
and forms the crystals that make it very

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.010 
and forms the crystals that make it very
difficult<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.180> your<00:01:06.360> battery<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.870> be

difficult for your battery to be

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.740 
difficult for your battery to be
recharged<00:01:07.650> you've<00:01:08.220> ever<00:01:08.370> noticed<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.910> your

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
recharged you've ever noticed that your

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.660 
recharged you've ever noticed that your
battery<00:01:10.080> seems<00:01:10.410> to<00:01:10.650> work<00:01:10.830> well<00:01:10.860> after<00:01:11.520> it's

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
battery seems to work well after it's

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.000 
battery seems to work well after it's
charged<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.300> after<00:01:12.660> you<00:01:13.050> know<00:01:13.170> even<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> short

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
charged but after you know even a short

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.640 
charged but after you know even a short
period<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.490> time<00:01:14.550> a<00:01:14.760> day<00:01:15.120> or<00:01:15.360> two<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.260> battery

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
period of time a day or two the battery

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.490 
period of time a day or two the battery
discharges<00:01:17.220> at<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> fast<00:01:17.820> rate<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.290> be

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
discharges at a fast rate that can be

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.600 
discharges at a fast rate that can be
caused<00:01:19.740> by<00:01:20.010> sulfation<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.060> almost<00:01:21.840> any

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
caused by sulfation so almost any

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.090 
caused by sulfation so almost any
battery<00:01:23.610> charger<00:01:24.180> works<00:01:24.750> well<00:01:25.380> some<00:01:25.890> work

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
battery charger works well some work

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.380 
battery charger works well some work
better<00:01:26.340> than<00:01:26.550> others<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:26.880> certain

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
better than others for certain

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.950 
better than others for certain
technologies<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.800> people<00:01:29.670> ask<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.300> lot<00:01:30.390> way<00:01:30.840> on

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
technologies so people ask a lot way on

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.940 
technologies so people ask a lot way on
what<00:01:31.230> brand<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.800> charge<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.520> buy<00:01:33.950> what

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
what brand of charge or do I buy what

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.250 
what brand of charge or do I buy what
what's<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> right<00:01:36.120> charger<00:01:36.480> for<00:01:36.900> certain

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
what's the right charger for certain

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.610 
what's the right charger for certain
technologies<00:01:38.150> we<00:01:39.150> typically<00:01:39.630> recommend<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.350> 10

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
technologies we typically recommend a 10

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.310 
technologies we typically recommend a 10
amp<00:01:40.800> charger<00:01:41.190> or<00:01:41.630> something<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.870> range

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
amp charger or something in that range

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.090 
amp charger or something in that range
AT&amp;AMP<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:45.000> 15<00:01:45.450> amps<00:01:45.900> that's<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.260> good<00:01:46.500> charge

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
AT&amp;AMP to 15 amps that's a good charge

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.330 
AT&amp;AMP to 15 amps that's a good charge
rate<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:47.880> most<00:01:48.120> batteries<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:49.340> reason

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
rate for most batteries and the reason

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.680 
rate for most batteries and the reason
why<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.580> choose<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.210> because<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.479> can

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
why we choose that is because you can

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.180 
why we choose that is because you can
hook<00:01:51.870> up<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.110> charger<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> completely

hook up a charger to a completely
discharged<00:01:53.790> battery<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.510> it<00:01:54.900> will<00:01:55.020> charge

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
discharged battery and it will charge

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.050 
discharged battery and it will charge
