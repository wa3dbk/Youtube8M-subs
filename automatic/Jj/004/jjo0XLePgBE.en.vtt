00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
apparently this isn't the only place

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.940 
apparently this isn't the only place
where<00:03:34.070> you<00:03:34.370> can<00:03:35.030> do<00:03:35.240> this<00:03:35.510> since<00:03:36.440> this<00:03:36.680> place

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
where you can do this since this place

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.770 
where you can do this since this place
this<00:03:37.490> one<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:38.000> mainly<00:03:38.300> for<00:03:38.600> lies

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
this one is mainly for lies

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.630 
this one is mainly for lies
interrogation<00:03:39.530> sensors<00:03:39.980> it's<00:03:40.220> safe<00:03:40.430> up<00:03:40.580> there

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
interrogation sensors it's safe up there

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.240 
interrogation sensors it's safe up there
so<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.840> was<00:03:41.990> good<00:03:42.140> for<00:03:42.200> interrogation<00:03:42.980> but<00:03:43.130> the

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
so it was good for interrogation but the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.699 
so it was good for interrogation but the
other<00:03:43.459> one<00:03:43.790> was<00:03:44.060> really<00:03:44.300> good<00:03:44.450> for<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.410> red

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
other one was really good for the red

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.010 
other one was really good for the red

patched<00:04:01.520> up<00:04:02.050> now<00:04:03.050> that<00:04:03.110> we<00:04:03.320> are<00:04:03.590> finished<00:04:03.770> with

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
patched up now that we are finished with

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.430 
patched up now that we are finished with
the<00:04:04.280> weird<00:04:04.730> glitches<00:04:05.330> it's<00:04:06.080> time<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.290> show

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
the weird glitches it's time to show

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.170 
the weird glitches it's time to show
glitches<00:04:06.860> that<00:04:06.890> players<00:04:07.280> run<00:04:07.550> into<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:07.880> lot

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
glitches that players run into a lot

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.930 
glitches that players run into a lot
likely<00:04:08.570> again<00:04:09.230> because<00:04:09.709> of<00:04:09.980> crappy<00:04:10.550> internet

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
likely again because of crappy internet

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.820 
likely again because of crappy internet
connection<00:04:11.360> but<00:04:11.690> not<00:04:11.840> all<00:04:12.080> of<00:04:12.140> these<00:04:12.560> glitches

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
connection but not all of these glitches

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.860 
connection but not all of these glitches
are<00:04:13.100> from<00:04:13.280> players<00:04:13.550> with<00:04:13.790> crappy<00:04:14.330> fast<00:04:14.600> food

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
are from players with crappy fast food

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.250 
are from players with crappy fast food

Wi-Fi or phone line connection most of

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.979 
Wi-Fi or phone line connection most of
it<00:04:18.470> is<00:04:18.890> from<00:04:19.250> your<00:04:19.430> ps3<00:04:19.790> which<00:04:20.419> I'll<00:04:20.600> explain

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
it is from your ps3 which I'll explain

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.900 
it is from your ps3 which I'll explain
later<00:04:21.250> some<00:04:22.250> of<00:04:22.340> these<00:04:22.430> glitches<00:04:22.790> were

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
later some of these glitches were

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.930 
later some of these glitches were
actually<00:04:23.270> caused<00:04:23.600> by<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:24.340> 1.06<00:04:25.340> update

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
actually caused by the 1.06 update

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.760 
actually caused by the 1.06 update
because<00:04:26.510> I've<00:04:26.630> never<00:04:26.810> seen<00:04:27.229> these<00:04:27.560> glitches

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
because I've never seen these glitches

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.340 
because I've never seen these glitches
before<00:04:28.250> hopefully<00:04:28.880> some<00:04:29.479> staff<00:04:29.750> member<00:04:30.110> from

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
before hopefully some staff member from

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.560 
before hopefully some staff member from
Naughty<00:04:30.650> Dog<00:04:30.919> could<00:04:31.280> patch<00:04:31.580> these<00:04:31.910> up<00:04:32.180> for<00:04:32.419> the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
Naughty Dog could patch these up for the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.940 
Naughty Dog could patch these up for the
upcoming<00:04:32.780> grounded<00:04:33.560> updates<00:04:35.740> alright<00:04:36.740> guys

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
upcoming grounded updates alright guys

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.100 
upcoming grounded updates alright guys
I'm<00:04:37.190> gonna<00:04:37.280> give<00:04:37.520> you<00:04:37.640> my<00:04:37.970> reason<00:04:38.390> why<00:04:38.540> this

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
I'm gonna give you my reason why this

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.050 
I'm gonna give you my reason why this
Invisible<00:04:39.919> Man<00:04:39.950> but<00:04:40.400> it<00:04:40.610> keeps<00:04:40.790> happening

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
Invisible Man but it keeps happening

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.600 
Invisible Man but it keeps happening
because<00:04:41.630> of<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.080> internet<00:04:42.620> connection<00:04:42.950> now<00:04:43.280> I

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
because of the internet connection now I

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.210 
because of the internet connection now I
know<00:04:43.940> I<00:04:44.330> may<00:04:44.660> not<00:04:44.840> be<00:04:44.990> right<00:04:45.229> because<00:04:45.500> noise<00:04:46.130> is

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
know I may not be right because noise is

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.100 
know I may not be right because noise is
most<00:04:46.550> likely<00:04:46.850> gonna<00:04:47.030> respond<00:04:47.419> this<00:04:47.600> and<00:04:47.900> say

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
most likely gonna respond this and say

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.490 
most likely gonna respond this and say
something<00:04:48.500> completely<00:04:49.370> off<00:04:49.400> what<00:04:50.390> I<00:04:50.419> said<00:04:50.840> so

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
something completely off what I said so

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.500 
something completely off what I said so
here<00:04:52.100> goes

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
here goes

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.880 
here goes
internet<00:04:53.510> connection<00:04:53.900> didn't<00:04:54.260> properly

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
internet connection didn't properly

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.550 
internet connection didn't properly
connect<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:55.729> the<00:04:55.850> server<00:04:56.150> making<00:04:56.450> you<00:04:56.750> see

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
connect to the server making you see

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.710 
connect to the server making you see
invisible<00:04:57.890> players<00:04:58.340> and<00:04:58.820> invisible

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
invisible players and invisible

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.320 
invisible players and invisible
opponents<00:05:00.290> so<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.919> guess<00:05:01.880> that's<00:05:02.120> what

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
opponents so I guess that's what

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.870 
opponents so I guess that's what
happened<00:05:02.780> in<00:05:02.960> my<00:05:03.350> reasoning<00:05:03.680> because<00:05:04.610> there's

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
happened in my reasoning because there's

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.330 
happened in my reasoning because there's
no<00:05:05.060> other<00:05:05.479> way<00:05:05.990> this<00:05:06.200> happened<00:05:06.620> because<00:05:06.919> this

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
no other way this happened because this

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.490 
no other way this happened because this
never<00:05:07.610> happened<00:05:08.000> in<00:05:08.090> day<00:05:08.330> one<00:05:08.660> of<00:05:08.960> the

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
never happened in day one of the

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.709 
never happened in day one of the
multiplayer<00:05:09.979> it's<00:05:10.460> never<00:05:10.640> happening<00:05:10.970> 1.05

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:12.719 
multiplayer it's never happening 1.05

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:16.159 
multiplayer it's never happening 1.05
and<00:05:12.809> start<00:05:13.319> happening<00:05:13.679> 1.06<00:05:14.569> not<00:05:15.569> only<00:05:15.989> that

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
and start happening 1.06 not only that

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.949 
and start happening 1.06 not only that
it<00:05:16.319> happens<00:05:16.619> in<00:05:16.739> the<00:05:16.860> DLC<00:05:17.339> search<00:05:18.149> lobby<00:05:18.629> it

also happens in interrogations and just
regular<00:05:22.979> fine<00:05:23.579> matches<00:05:24.089> so<00:05:25.339> something<00:05:26.339> that

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:26.489 
regular fine matches so something that

00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:28.339 
regular fine matches so something that
