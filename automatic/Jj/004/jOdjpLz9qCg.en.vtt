00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
finding quite a bit of detail in there

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.490 
finding quite a bit of detail in there
which<00:00:57.399> I'm<00:00:57.550> quite<00:00:57.730> impressed<00:00:57.850> with<00:00:58.649> and<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
which I'm quite impressed with and the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.889 
which I'm quite impressed with and the
image<00:01:02.829> originally<00:01:03.460> started<00:01:03.850> as<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.629> time

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
image originally started as a time

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.010 
image originally started as a time
drawing<00:01:05.170> where<00:01:05.530> I<00:01:05.740> would<00:01:06.009> record<00:01:06.280> myself

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
drawing where I would record myself

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.420 
drawing where I would record myself
drawing<00:01:08.020> with<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.470> timer<00:01:08.680> next<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.130> me<00:01:09.250> and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
drawing with the timer next to me and

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.499 
drawing with the timer next to me and
that<00:01:10.360> give<00:01:10.570> myself<00:01:11.729> whatever<00:01:12.729> time<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.119> thought

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
that give myself whatever time I thought

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.590 
that give myself whatever time I thought
I<00:01:13.690> needed<00:01:13.899> to<00:01:14.350> do<00:01:14.470> it<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.850> sort<00:01:16.119> of<00:01:16.180> it

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
I needed to do it and that sort of it

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.300 
I needed to do it and that sort of it

not for me is kind of a tip to improve
yourself<00:01:22.450> for<00:01:22.810> drawing<00:01:23.020> because<00:01:23.259> it<00:01:23.380> does

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
yourself for drawing because it does

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.330 
yourself for drawing because it does
really<00:01:23.770> help<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.939> you<00:01:25.090> draw<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:27.159> bad

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
really help if you draw a really bad

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.600 
really help if you draw a really bad
picture<00:01:27.759> in<00:01:28.210> five<00:01:28.780> minutes<00:01:29.170> then<00:01:30.159> you<00:01:30.310> try<00:01:30.549> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
picture in five minutes then you try the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.410 
picture in five minutes then you try the
same<00:01:30.729> thing<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.450> like<00:01:32.259> one<00:01:32.619> minute<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
same thing and like one minute you

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.350 
same thing and like one minute you
notice<00:01:34.780> how<00:01:35.490> little<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.790> get<00:01:36.970> done<00:01:37.119> in<00:01:37.210> one

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
notice how little you get done in one

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.210 
notice how little you get done in one
minute<00:01:37.509> and<00:01:37.659> it<00:01:37.810> pushes<00:01:38.020> you<00:01:38.229> so<00:01:38.259> far<00:01:38.710> so

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
minute and it pushes you so far so

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.280 
minute and it pushes you so far so
people<00:01:39.520> back<00:01:39.759> to<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.119> five<00:01:40.299> minutes<00:01:40.659> you<00:01:41.140> get

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
people back to the five minutes you get

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.690 
people back to the five minutes you get
so<00:01:41.470> much<00:01:41.650> more<00:01:41.799> done<00:01:41.860> because<00:01:42.189> you're<00:01:42.369> working

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
so much more done because you're working

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.190 
so much more done because you're working
it<00:01:42.820> seems<00:01:43.090> squeaky<00:01:43.450> did<00:01:43.630> for<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.930> one<00:01:44.049> minute

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
it seems squeaky did for the one minute

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.010 
it seems squeaky did for the one minute

run and you can completely see a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.770 
run and you can completely see a
complete<00:01:47.350> contrast<00:01:47.770> in<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.189> that's<00:01:48.780> one

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
complete contrast in it and that's one

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
tip I can give you and this week I've

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.480 
tip I can give you and this week I've
had<00:01:52.840> my<00:01:53.079> prelim<00:01:53.290> saw<00:01:53.649> it's<00:01:53.950> been<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.100> bit<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.340> a

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
had my prelim saw it's been a bit of a

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.399 
had my prelim saw it's been a bit of a
struggle<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.850> get<00:01:55.600> any<00:01:55.780> picture<00:01:56.020> done<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:56.320> I

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
struggle to get any picture done so I

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.960 
struggle to get any picture done so I
thought<00:01:56.619> over<00:01:56.829> trying<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.399> this<00:01:57.549> as<00:01:57.759> quickly

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
thought over trying to this as quickly

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:58.639 
thought over trying to this as quickly
as<00:01:58.149> I<00:01:58.240> could

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
as I could

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.380 
as I could
that<00:01:59.649> was<00:01:59.740> basically<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.579> reasoning<00:02:01.270> behind

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
that was basically the reasoning behind

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.450 
that was basically the reasoning behind
the<00:02:01.810> time<00:02:01.990> drawing<00:02:02.259> idea<00:02:02.619> yeah<00:02:04.770> okay<00:02:05.770> like

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
the time drawing idea yeah okay like

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.910 
the time drawing idea yeah okay like
films<00:02:06.969> weren't<00:02:07.119> fine<00:02:07.440> apart<00:02:08.440> from<00:02:08.590> one<00:02:08.769> of<00:02:08.860> my

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
films weren't fine apart from one of my

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.310 
films weren't fine apart from one of my
subjects<00:02:09.369> but<00:02:09.579> I<00:02:09.640> wasn't<00:02:09.970> expected<00:02:10.450> seeing<00:02:10.750> as

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
subjects but I wasn't expected seeing as

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.770 
subjects but I wasn't expected seeing as
my<00:02:11.530> teacher<00:02:11.739> is<00:02:12.250> off<00:02:13.000> for<00:02:13.810> like<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.079> month<00:02:14.230> and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
my teacher is off for like a month and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.539 
my teacher is off for like a month and
we<00:02:16.780> were<00:02:16.930> expected<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.650> get<00:02:18.100> on<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.430> do<00:02:18.519> our

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
we were expected to get on and do our

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.569 
we were expected to get on and do our
work<00:02:18.790> by<00:02:19.390> ourselves<00:02:19.510> for<00:02:20.049> any<00:02:20.799> cover<00:02:21.070> which<00:02:21.549> is

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
work by ourselves for any cover which is

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.950 
work by ourselves for any cover which is
never<00:02:21.970> going<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> happen
