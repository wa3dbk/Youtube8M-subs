environment<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.570> things<00:00:42.780> we

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
environment is is one of the things we

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.690 
environment is is one of the things we
do<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.440> look<00:00:43.920> at<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.160> from<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.370> lifecycle

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
do we look at it from a lifecycle

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.580 
do we look at it from a lifecycle
approach<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.690> pick<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> right

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
approach you have to pick the right

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.410 
approach you have to pick the right
materials<00:00:47.070> from<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.309> start<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.850> example<00:00:48.270> we

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
materials from the start for example we

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.180 
materials from the start for example we
use<00:00:48.600> post-consumer<00:00:49.170> content<00:00:49.500> which<00:00:50.010> is

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
use post-consumer content which is

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.549 
use post-consumer content which is
recycled<00:00:51.030> water<00:00:51.149> bottles<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.410> design

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
recycled water bottles we have to design

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.979 
recycled water bottles we have to design
energy<00:00:53.190> efficiency<00:00:53.789> practices<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.719> power

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
energy efficiency practices and power

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.080 
energy efficiency practices and power
management<00:00:55.410> attributes<00:00:56.399> into<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> system<00:00:57.059> so

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
management attributes into the system so

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.549 
management attributes into the system so
they're<00:00:57.390> efficient<00:00:57.809> during<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
they're efficient during the use of the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.290 
they're efficient during the use of the
product<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.129> then<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.879> sure<00:01:00.059> that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
product and then we have to be sure that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.319 
product and then we have to be sure that
the<00:01:00.390> product<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.930> able<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.559> recycled<00:01:02.329> so

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the product is able to be recycled so

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.729 
the product is able to be recycled so
the<00:01:03.420> product<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.840> actually<00:01:03.989> evaluate<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the product is actually evaluate to a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.020 
the product is actually evaluate to a
standard<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.220> looks<00:01:05.489> at<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> whole<00:01:05.850> life

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
standard that looks at the whole life

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.270 
standard that looks at the whole life
cycle<00:01:06.060> impact<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> product<00:01:07.650> itself<00:01:07.950> so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
cycle impact of the product itself so

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.710 
cycle impact of the product itself so
we'll<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.580> will<00:01:08.700> look<00:01:08.880> at<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> materials<00:01:09.659> that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
we'll it will look at the materials that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.510 
we'll it will look at the materials that
are<00:01:09.869> used<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> sourcing<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> development

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
are used in the sourcing the development

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.920 
are used in the sourcing the development
of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> product<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.450> would<00:01:12.570> look<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
of the product it would look at the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.450 
of the product it would look at the
performance<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.590> product<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.220> things

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
performance of the product so things

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.130 
performance of the product so things
like<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> energy<00:01:15.299> efficiency<00:01:15.689> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
like the energy efficiency and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.870 
like the energy efficiency and
requirements<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> needs<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.220> meeting

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
requirements that it needs to be meeting

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.850 
requirements that it needs to be meeting
such<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.240> Energy<00:01:18.570> Star<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:19.049> others<00:01:19.350> globally

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
such as Energy Star or others globally

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.859 
such as Energy Star or others globally
and<00:01:20.220> there's<00:01:20.610> also<00:01:20.790> things<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.180> disassembly

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
and there's also things like disassembly

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.330 
and there's also things like disassembly
so<00:01:22.020> how<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.229> recycle<00:01:22.590> these<00:01:22.830> products<00:01:23.280> so

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
so how do we recycle these products so

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.560 
so how do we recycle these products so
they<00:01:23.430> don't<00:01:23.610> go<00:01:23.729> into<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.090> waste<00:01:24.270> stream<00:01:24.540> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
they don't go into the waste stream and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.749 
they don't go into the waste stream and
then<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:24.990> get<00:01:25.110> put<00:01:25.290> into<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.619> landfill<00:01:26.009> we

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
then just get put into it landfill we

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.280 
then just get put into it landfill we
independently<00:01:27.509> from<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.960> third-party

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
independently from a third-party

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.050 
independently from a third-party
perspective<00:01:28.560> verify<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.670> these<00:01:29.820> criteria

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
perspective verify that these criteria
