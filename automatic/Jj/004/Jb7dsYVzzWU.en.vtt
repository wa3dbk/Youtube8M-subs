00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.869
 Hello everyone I'm last and today I'm going 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.320
 to teach accelerate the speed of 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:17.330
 games and greatly reduce the good 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.310
 Well, first of all it would be to go to the 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.440
 play stories find who else you have a 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.360
 very well-known application and the truth is 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.880
 that suits us to optimize it 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.920
 you have the system we would give you to open the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.680
 download is completely free to a 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.780
 from your best points we hope a little 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.690
 that opens perfect once opened 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.690
 we would give junk files and let's go 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.640
 to go going and we are going to go one 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.409
 for one to optimize here 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.210
 we would give once it is loaded 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.940
 optimize now I will not wait for everything 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.219
 but as you can see here I have two with 40 are 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.659
 very much in 2.86 gigas that I can 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.949
 release we would give to clean the garbage 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.659
 right now I'm not going to do it because 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.979
 I would have to watch to see that I 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.260
 erase that I do not recommend it 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.760
 very much antivirus we would also have 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.739
 although we are not going to focus on that 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.829
 aspect and then optimizer today has already 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.659
 entered device optimizer 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.120
 as you have seen here optimizer of 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.120
 perfect device here we would give it 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.870
 As you can see, all those megas will be 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.060
 releasable and here we give this 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.520
 tab that would appear to us as 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.440
 games here we would choose our games 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.910
 for example I have these installed and 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.280
 we would give you to create a folder of 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.280
 games to optimize it up to 30% 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.560
 as he puts here by simply doing this 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.390
 and erasing all the garbage here as well 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.370
 I'll repeat you trash files again 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.620
 optimizer or device and accelerate 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.480
 very much in your system with this 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.310
 application is being tab by 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.450
 tab and it's the truth is that very 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.280
 intuitive so I'm not going to focus 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.010
 more in this application the second 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.600
 application would be cider that is the one 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.970
 keep going let's look for the play this the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.150
 First, although it is for payment and I will leave it to you 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.680
 in the description of the video you can 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.040
 turn to second applications like 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.780
 is fit and from here it's like that 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.400
 we would open and go to the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.350
 description of the video we download it and 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.330
 we install it in our in our 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.790
 mobile will ask us to root as 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.040
 you have seen if you are not light I do not know to what 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.870
 you wait you can click here simply 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.480
 to see a video where you can be 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.769
 light in the easiest way is totally 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.650
 new and we just had to 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.959
 download a 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.420
 for our mobile and click on 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.829
 rootear so easy and assured and without 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.019
 no kind of risk for all 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.269
 devices if you have not seen the video 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.890
 I repeat that you click here and without any 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.720
 kinds of problems are enjoyed in less 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.459
 one minute once being root 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.769
 we would continue with this tutorial 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.470
 we would give up here so this is 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.709
 to reduce it to the and here we would give to 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.140
 start the automatic on wood and extend to 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.640
 youtube and we would give these three 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.829
 options and here we could put 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.659
 online modalities I'm going to put the 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.849
 nor aggressive models since neither 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.769
 I need to play all day but in 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.810
 modern ones would reduce quite a lot and if you see 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.909
 that still has the simply 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.090
 perfect aggressive I'll leave it on 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.530
 moderate and the third recommendation does not 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.840
 I 'm going to show you in this video but 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.430
 so as not to lengthen it as much as you already have 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.620
 seen clean master to optimize 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.959
 very much your system if it is for 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.879
 reduce the lab and finally also os 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.889
 I would recommend this little eyelash you see 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.310
 here that I made another video for it 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.380
 What is it 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.670
 to do an overclock is to say 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.580
 increase the speed of your 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.170
 teacher if you do not know how to do it I've 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.840
 made another video just click 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.580
 here and you can see or go to the link of the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.739
 description of the video where you will find 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.209
 a link to my other video of how to do 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.340
 this like increasing the speed of 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.260
 processor and how to overclock for 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.970
 make our phone go to all 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.170
 the rod for the games to go 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.819
 much faster 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.580
 well, so far the video has been 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.980
 simple fast and effective and if it has 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.170
 liked and wishes access the games 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.150
 I assure you that it has been so do not hesitate

 in to like and subscribe to 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.410
 work with android to have to be

 much more until another

 yes 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.739
