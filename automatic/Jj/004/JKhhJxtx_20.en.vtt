00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:05.420 

okay<00:00:04.589> now<00:00:04.740> we're<00:00:04.830> going<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.009> have<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.130> look<00:00:05.310> at

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
okay now we're going to have a look at

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.140 
okay now we're going to have a look at
the<00:00:05.640> Canon<00:00:06.089> 40d<00:00:07.610> the<00:00:08.610> 40-day<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.510> typical<00:00:10.230> of

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
the Canon 40d the 40-day is typical of

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.959 
the Canon 40d the 40-day is typical of
larger<00:00:12.150> Canon<00:00:12.540> bodies<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.650> have<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.190> control

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
larger Canon bodies that have to control

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.040 
larger Canon bodies that have to control
dials<00:00:15.680> so<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.150> similar<00:00:18.150> camera<00:00:18.449> layout<00:00:18.840> to

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
dials so it's a similar camera layout to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.859 
dials so it's a similar camera layout to
the<00:00:19.080> Nikon<00:00:19.920> d90<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:21.060> saw<00:00:21.210> earlier

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
the Nikon d90 that we saw earlier

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.830 
the Nikon d90 that we saw earlier
so<00:00:22.800> here<00:00:22.980> are<00:00:23.160> two<00:00:23.189> dowsers<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.119> up<00:00:24.269> here<00:00:24.539> and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
so here are two dowsers one up here and

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.870 
so here are two dowsers one up here and
one<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.590> back<00:00:27.859> now<00:00:28.859> with<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.220> 40d<00:00:29.760> in

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
one on the back now with the 40d in

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.730 
one on the back now with the 40d in
similar<00:00:30.300> cameras<00:00:30.779> again<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.470> quite<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
similar cameras again we have quite a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.709 
similar cameras again we have quite a
lot<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.070> buttons<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.730> see<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.210> camera<00:00:33.570> body

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
lot of buttons I see on the camera body

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.130 
lot of buttons I see on the camera body
so<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.410> change<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:35.820> settings<00:00:36.270> easily

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
so we can change the settings easily

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.720 
so we can change the settings easily
without<00:00:37.380> having<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:37.800> into<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.160> menu<00:00:40.730> so

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
without having to go into the menu so

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.000 
without having to go into the menu so
the<00:00:42.629> way<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.750> Canon<00:00:43.290> has<00:00:43.530> laid<00:00:43.800> their

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the way that Canon has laid their

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.229 
the way that Canon has laid their
buttons<00:00:44.370> out<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:45.030> quite<00:00:45.300> interesting<00:00:45.899> they<00:00:46.440> as

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
buttons out is quite interesting they as

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.959 
buttons out is quite interesting they as
you<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.510> see<00:00:48.719> we've<00:00:48.930> got<00:00:49.309> three<00:00:50.309> main<00:00:50.550> buttons

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
you can see we've got three main buttons

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
you can see we've got three main buttons
along<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.270> top<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.910> each<00:00:53.910> button<00:00:54.480> has<00:00:54.510> two

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
along the top and each button has two

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.840 
along the top and each button has two
functions<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.949> if<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.219> look<00:00:56.340> at<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> button<00:00:56.760> on

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
functions so if we look at the button on

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.119 
functions so if we look at the button on
the<00:00:56.940> right<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.300> does<00:00:57.449> both<00:00:57.660> ISO<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.620> flash

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the right it does both ISO and flash

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.510 
the right it does both ISO and flash
compensation<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:01.020> next<00:01:01.289> one<00:01:01.500> does<00:01:01.770> autofocus

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
compensation the next one does autofocus

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.240 
compensation the next one does autofocus
and<00:01:02.789> drive<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.840> last<00:01:04.049> one<00:01:04.290> does<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
and drive and the last one does the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.880 
and drive and the last one does the
light<00:01:05.460> meter<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.880> white<00:01:06.180> balance<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:07.799> way

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
light meter and white balance the way

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.500 
light meter and white balance the way
that<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.130> works<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.670> press<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.210> button

so let's have a look at what each one

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.660 
so let's have a look at what each one
might<00:01:56.549> see<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:57.799> flash<00:01:58.799> compensation<00:01:59.460> we'll

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
might see do flash compensation we'll

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.240 
might see do flash compensation we'll
discuss<00:02:00.000> when<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.180> look<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:00.899> flash<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
discuss when we look at flash in the

our<00:02:30.200> autofocus<00:02:31.200> mode<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:31.829> on<00:02:31.950> canons<00:02:32.540> they

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
our autofocus mode so on canons they

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.910

icons one shot is for subjects that
don't<00:02:39.900> move<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.940> it's<00:02:42.090> very<00:02:42.209> similar<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.599> Nikon

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019

if your subject is moving then choose AI
servo<00:03:22.919> mode<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.840> drive<00:03:28.049> buttons<00:03:28.410> are

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
servo mode so the drive buttons are

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.170

saying<00:03:28.799> can<00:03:29.099> button<00:03:29.639> I'm<00:03:29.760> going<00:03:29.849> to<00:03:29.940> press

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
saying can button I'm going to press

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.879 
saying can button I'm going to press
that<00:03:30.450> now<00:03:31.139> we're<00:03:31.260> going<00:03:31.349> to<00:03:31.440> use<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.709> rear

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
that now we're going to use the rear

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.140 
that now we're going to use the rear
dial<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.660> we<00:03:33.660> can<00:03:33.810> change<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.709> frame<00:03:34.980> rate<00:03:35.150> so

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
dial and we can change the frame rate so

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.979 
dial and we can change the frame rate so
it's<00:03:36.269> going<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.450> go<00:03:36.599> back<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.900> beginning

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
it's going to go back to the beginning

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.360 
it's going to go back to the beginning
so<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.859> single<00:03:38.190> rectangle<00:03:38.819> is<00:03:39.049> a<00:03:40.370> one-shot

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
so the single rectangle is a one-shot

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.610 
so the single rectangle is a one-shot
mode<00:03:41.970> if<00:03:42.359> I<00:03:42.480> have<00:03:42.569> to<00:03:42.660> press<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.079> button<00:03:43.109> down

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
mode if I have to press the button down

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.580 
mode if I have to press the button down
I<00:03:43.859> can<00:03:44.790> only<00:03:44.970> take<00:03:45.239> one<00:03:45.540> picture<00:03:48.349> go<00:03:49.349> to<00:03:49.410> the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
I can only take one picture go to the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.170 
I can only take one picture go to the
drive<00:03:49.829> button<00:03:50.040> again<00:03:50.340> move<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.730> rear<00:03:50.910> dowel

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
drive button again move the rear dowel

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.539 
drive button again move the rear dowel
now<00:03:52.049> we're<00:03:52.199> in<00:03:52.319> high-speed<00:03:52.590> continuous<00:03:53.250> mode

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
now we're in high-speed continuous mode

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.960 
now we're in high-speed continuous mode
here<00:03:56.549> let<00:03:56.669> me<00:03:56.699> take<00:03:56.849> up<00:03:57.139> orders<00:03:58.139> shots<00:04:00.530> and

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
here let me take up orders shots and

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.509 
here let me take up orders shots and
then<00:04:02.970> we<00:04:03.090> have<00:04:03.290> low<00:04:04.290> speed<00:04:04.650> continuous<00:04:05.250> mode

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
then we have low speed continuous mode

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.670 
then we have low speed continuous mode
so<00:04:06.389> we<00:04:06.480> get<00:04:06.629> continuous<00:04:07.109> shots<00:04:07.349> but<00:04:07.500> at<00:04:07.650> a

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
so we get continuous shots but at a

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.339 
so we get continuous shots but at a
lower<00:04:07.919> speed<00:04:08.160> than<00:04:08.629> high<00:04:09.629> speed<00:04:10.019> that<00:04:10.139> we<00:04:10.199> just

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
lower speed than high speed that we just

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:17.150 
lower speed than high speed that we just
saw<00:04:10.590> now<00:04:13.519> we<00:04:14.519> have<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.879> self<00:04:15.120> timer<00:04:16.160> self

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
saw now we have the self timer self

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.710 
saw now we have the self timer self
timer<00:04:17.400> at<00:04:17.579> two<00:04:17.760> seconds<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.539> back<00:04:19.289> to

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
timer at two seconds and back to

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.890 
timer at two seconds and back to
the<00:04:21.610> single<00:04:22.610> frame<00:04:22.880> mode<00:04:25.630> so<00:04:26.630> that's<00:04:26.750> the

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
the single frame mode so that's the

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.020 
the single frame mode so that's the
middle<00:04:27.080> bottom<00:04:27.410> is<00:04:27.500> changes<00:04:28.010> auto<00:04:28.280> focus<00:04:28.820> and

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
middle bottom is changes auto focus and

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.940 
middle bottom is changes auto focus and
drive<00:04:29.350> so<00:04:30.350> now<00:04:30.470> let's<00:04:30.590> have<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.740> look<00:04:30.860> at

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
drive so now let's have a look at

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
drive so now let's have a look at
changing<00:04:31.340> white<00:04:31.550> balance<00:04:32.000> on<00:04:32.690> this<00:04:32.870> canon<00:04:33.230> 40d

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
changing white balance on this canon 40d

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.800 
changing white balance on this canon 40d
so<00:04:34.970> we'll<00:04:35.060> have<00:04:35.210> pressed<00:04:35.480> the<00:04:35.540> shutter<00:04:35.570> button

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
so we'll have pressed the shutter button

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.590 
so we'll have pressed the shutter button
again<00:04:36.320> wait<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:36.770> camera<00:04:37.070> up<00:04:37.240> press<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.270> white

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
again wait the camera up press the white

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.700 
again wait the camera up press the white
barns<00:04:38.960> button<00:04:39.290> here<00:04:39.650> and<00:04:40.270> then<00:04:41.320> I'll<00:04:42.320> move<00:04:42.530> the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
barns button here and then I'll move the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.400 
barns button here and then I'll move the
back<00:04:42.920> dial<00:04:43.540> so<00:04:44.540> we<00:04:44.600> started<00:04:44.960> off<00:04:45.050> an<00:04:45.200> automatic

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
back dial so we started off an automatic

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.590 
back dial so we started off an automatic
white<00:04:45.980> balance<00:04:46.010> AWB<00:04:46.970> then<00:04:47.840> we<00:04:47.930> have<00:04:48.080> daylight

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
white balance AWB then we have daylight

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.680 
white balance AWB then we have daylight
shady<00:04:51.610> cloudy<00:04:52.610> or<00:04:52.850> overcast<00:04:54.400> tungsten

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.250 
shady cloudy or overcast tungsten
fluorescent<00:04:57.340> flash<00:04:58.810> then<00:04:59.810> we<00:04:59.930> have<00:05:00.110> the

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
fluorescent flash then we have the

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.500 
fluorescent flash then we have the
ability<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.590> record<00:05:01.550> a<00:05:01.640> preset<00:05:02.180> and<00:05:02.480> then

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
ability to record a preset and then

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.950 
ability to record a preset and then
family<00:05:03.470> we<00:05:03.710> can<00:05:03.830> put<00:05:04.010> in<00:05:04.130> a<00:05:04.190> Kelvin<00:05:04.640> value<00:05:04.960> then

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
family we can put in a Kelvin value then

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.680 
family we can put in a Kelvin value then
back<00:05:06.230> to<00:05:06.410> automatic<00:05:07.090> so<00:05:08.090> it's<00:05:08.240> changing<00:05:08.600> the

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
back to automatic so it's changing the

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.080 
back to automatic so it's changing the
white<00:05:08.840> balance<00:05:12.550> okay<00:05:13.550> let's<00:05:13.730> have<00:05:13.820> a<00:05:13.910> look<00:05:13.940> now

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
white balance okay let's have a look now

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.570 
white balance okay let's have a look now
at<00:05:14.270> how<00:05:15.140> we<00:05:15.200> change<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:15.860> aperture<00:05:16.340> and<00:05:16.520> the

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
at how we change the aperture and the

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.730 
at how we change the aperture and the
shutter<00:05:16.670> speed<00:05:17.230> remembering<00:05:18.230> different

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
shutter speed remembering different

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.790 
shutter speed remembering different
modes<00:05:19.870> so<00:05:20.870> we're<00:05:21.020> currently<00:05:21.140> in<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.470> program

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800

weight the camera up again and you can

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.530 
weight the camera up again and you can
see<00:05:39.890> that<00:05:40.070> we've<00:05:40.160> got<00:05:40.190> a<00:05:40.669> change<00:05:41.630> of<00:05:41.900> exposure

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
see that we've got a change of exposure

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.300 
see that we've got a change of exposure
now<00:05:44.540> if<00:05:44.750> you<00:05:44.930> turn<00:05:45.380> the<00:05:45.590> dial<00:05:45.740> on<00:05:45.890> the<00:05:45.980> back<00:05:46.130> and

nothing's happening what may have

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.720 
nothing's happening what may have
happened<00:05:47.570> is<00:05:48.140> that<00:05:48.590> you've<00:05:48.890> put<00:05:49.160> the<00:05:49.430> switch

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
happened is that you've put the switch

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.170 
happened is that you've put the switch
in<00:05:50.000> the<00:05:50.060> middle<00:05:50.419> position<00:05:50.890> on<00:05:52.000> most<00:05:53.000> of<00:05:53.090> the

shutter<00:06:26.330> priority<00:06:26.710> then<00:06:27.710> the<00:06:28.070> front<00:06:28.340> dial

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
shutter priority then the front dial

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.490 
shutter priority then the front dial
will<00:06:29.450> again<00:06:30.370> change<00:06:31.370> the<00:06:31.580> shutter<00:06:32.300> speed

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
will again change the shutter speed

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.800 
will again change the shutter speed
and<00:06:33.590> the<00:06:33.860> back<00:06:34.100> dial<00:06:34.550> does<00:06:35.270> the<00:06:35.420> exposure

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
and the back dial does the exposure

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.970 
and the back dial does the exposure
compensation<00:06:38.080> so<00:06:39.080> the<00:06:39.200> back<00:06:39.380> dial<00:06:39.620> always

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
does exposure compensation in this case

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.470 
does exposure compensation in this case
you<00:06:44.900> can<00:06:45.020> see<00:06:45.290> now<00:06:46.280> the<00:06:46.340> aperture<00:06:46.850> f/4<00:06:47.300> is

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
you can see now the aperture f/4 is

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.100 
you can see now the aperture f/4 is
flashing

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
flashing

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.860

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.540 
if the lowest aperture of the lens is
flashing<00:06:51.380> that<00:06:51.530> means<00:06:51.590> that<00:06:52.250> there's<00:06:52.400> not

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
flashing that means that there's not

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.070 
flashing that means that there's not
enough<00:06:52.880> light<00:06:53.120> to<00:06:53.480> give<00:06:53.660> you<00:06:53.750> the<00:06:53.870> shutter

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
enough light to give you the shutter

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.110 
enough light to give you the shutter
speed<00:06:54.290> in<00:06:54.710> this<00:06:55.100> case<00:06:55.340> of<00:06:55.490> a<00:06:55.550> four<00:06:55.790> hundredths
