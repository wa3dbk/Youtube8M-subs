00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.589
 the summer has arrived and with the arrival 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.230
 of summer we love to do 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.870
 many salads because they go very well with 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.130
 this time of good heat and for 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.310
 our salads I will be 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.170
 teaching to make a vinaigrette today 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.870
 tamarind and I have here all the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.370
 ingredients I'm using pulp from 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.450
 tamarind of the one that comes to make 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.090
 refreshment that I already have practically everything 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.030
 but I tell myself so let's start 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.360
 I am changing or I am changing the 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.950
 vinegar practically for tamarind 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.710
 that if I'm going to be a bit of vinegar 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.989
 but almost everything I 'm using is the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.329
 tamarind pulp that I have here a 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.469
 quarter cup 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.469
 of tamarind pulp 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.129
 if I'm going to be adding 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.750
 half a teaspoon of vinegar this 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.750
 vinegar that I have is red wine 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.070
 and teaspoon 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.070
 ah 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.160
 a quarter teaspoon 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.160
 d 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.960
 mustard until I have it is serious with that 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.960
 the time 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.439
 great teacher not 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.750
 the one liked at home is going to be our 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:30.250
 emulsified agent that is going to 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.540
 help these ingredients to be 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.260
 join all 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.000
 and once we have this 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.090
 we're just going to start adding 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.580
 our olive oil oil this 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.010
 olive oil is an olive oil what 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.009
 they call what is called ignite be that 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.250
 is bound is not being mixed is not 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.950
 so pure pure and therefore not a 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.530
 Virgin olive oil in this recipe does not 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.970
 it's going to look good that I have three here 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.950
 quarters cup 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.100
 usually the vinaigrettes are a part 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.269
 of vinegar and three parts of oil per 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.610
 I have a quarter cup of tamarind 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.060
 and three quarters of a cup of oil and now 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.840
 let's little by little go adding 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.840
 our oil 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.939
 to modify 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.530
 after a few minutes beating and then 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.350
 of having added all the oil look 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.380
 the consistency that this vinaigrette has 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.420
 be well we believe and you are and have 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.800
 justified very well everything has been mixed 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.130
 well the oil with the tamarind and the 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.740
 vinegar and the last thing missing for 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.860
 this recipe is a little bit of pepper 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.860
 milled 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.100
 and herbs you can perfume with 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.569
 the grass of your preference may have 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.120
 the fresh thyme 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.310
 the grass of your cool preference I 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.340
 I'm using dry grass here these are 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.109
 Italian herbs an Italian mix and 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.109
 just a little bit a little 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.850
 we mix again 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.049
 hello we have our vinaigrette 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.900
 always be in vinaigrette made in 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.540
 I'm going to recommend that you use a 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.599
 little of the same lettuce or legume that 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.629
 they will use to make the salad for 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.579
 Trying your vinaigrette is better than using 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.890
 a metal spoon 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.379
 the metal is going to be that the vinaigrette knows 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.110
 over powerful and they will not give you a 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:02.690
 Dear 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.690
 Well, how is the vinaigrette going to be? 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.340
 in this case a little bit of lettuce and 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.090
 have a correct estimate of how 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.090
 the vinaigrette is left
