00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:12.599
 hello friends today we are going to make a bow 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.519
 indian home and for that we're going to 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.060
 need the following materials ones 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.830
 pliers a pair of scissors a saw 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.369
 hemp that I bought in a Chinese for 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.939
 90 cents of euros very cheap a 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.250
 stove or survival stove a 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.850
 tin of canned good only 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.230
 we are going to need what is the lid and 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.930
 sprays in this case black 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.360
 optional to paint the good arch and the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.510
 pvc tube 50 centimeters long and 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.489
 16 millimeters in diameter the first thing that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.440
 we have to do is double what is the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.450
 tube applying heat without reaching 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.780
 burn it just apply heat 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.820
 we will double it and nothing until 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.210
 let's get the desired shape 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.110
 well now we have to narrow what 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.280
 are the ends of the arch the same 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.800
 we heat and with the pliers we make 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.830
 a little pressure and how hot 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.400
 we will go chafando 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.190
 what in it to cool it 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.380
 will keep the good way you have to 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.740
 to stay more or less like I left it 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.610
 I 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.710
 well let's mark where we are going to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.090
 cut this will be to hook the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.570
 rope hemp thread 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.930
 well we put there 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.780
 some marquitas and with the mountain 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.560
 we have to cut let's say two cuts 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.110
 which are wedge and the other side for what 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.540
 we make a cut and the other with a 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.930
 different angle to leave it in wedge 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.060
 how the image looks 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.890
 well now let's paint this is 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.230
 optional I painted it because good the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.680
 I did not like pvc color so I did not like it 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.450
 nothing we give a little bit and really 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.720
 right away it's because the arch is 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.600
 teeny good while it dries we can 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.020
 go cutting what is the lid of the can 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.910
 of canned that good we're just going to 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.910
 need what is like a band-aid 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.150
 more or less than a centimeter wide 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.019
 and nothing more or less like that 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.970
 Now let's do the way to do 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.400
 the guide since what is the lid of 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.090
 Preserving is minimal or less than the guide 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.090
 of the arrow 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.940
 well there we have the guide made and now 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.440
 We will place it in its final place 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.600
 For this we will help by putting a 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.260
 little insulation tape to fix it 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.260
 tentatively 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.500
 and now comes say a little the 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.739
 long complication to give you a 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.870
 touch well then without a touch 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:03:00.060
 authentic you have to do this this one 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.569
 knot we can say that apart from being 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.150
 decorative will serve us to fix what 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.760
 is the arrow guide 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.610
 well here I can explain the link that 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.129
 I leave you to another video and there you will see step to 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.670
 step how to do it put in the video 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:21.329
 appears a little bit quick and good 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:25.760
 no not seen is not appreciated well good 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:28.680
 we put in there the end the end 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.359
 little ring is the one we have left and only 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.330
 will exist really does not have much 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.820
 secret but good 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.450
 you better watch the video and if you do not have 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:42.020
 problem as you see stretches and once 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.000
 stretched because it is completely tied 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.100
 that is not going to ever leave everyone 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.680
 ways if you want to insure yourself more then 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.040
 you can put a little bit of glue 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.860
 instant type loctite bone for 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.690
 make sure that he is not going to let go 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.690
 we cut the ends 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.150
 flush and then nothing on this side would be 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.850
 done and we just have to repeat 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.390
 the same process on the other good side 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.420
 we have it good here and has been 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.390
 totally fixed is a knot that good not 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.970
 is going to ever release 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.549
 Now let's do what the rope is 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.730
 that propels the arrow nothing we make a 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.970
 knot that you can also see in the link 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:28.630
 up here is a very simple knot that 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.820
 good will help us to hook both 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.330
 ends we will use the same knot 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.790
 well we squeeze well so that we do not know 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.430
 release 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.050
 and hooked on what are the furrows 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.009
 that we have previously done with 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:47.490
 saw at the ends we bring 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.800
 the hemp thread is on the other side 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:55.059
 we take the measure and good with the 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.770
 scissors we cut and we take out the 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:05:00.309
 thread since we already have to do the 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.669
 knot we have to take the measure a 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:04.660
 little bit smaller than what is the 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.390
 groove 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.190
 Well, there we are going to make the knot that 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.440
 the knot will still subtract a little more 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.440
 of rope but no problem because 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.570
 this is going to give us what is tension the 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.270
 tension neither a lot nor a little but good 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.150
 has to be tense because if not then 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.240
 the arrow is not going to go off 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.740
 how it should be good 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.090
 we think the bow we put the rope and 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.770
 it would be and we can see that it has been 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.770
 tense tense very very well 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.660
 the time has come to prepare our 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.150
 arrows let's use a skewer of the 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.150
 Chinese very very cheap too and they are from 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.820
 35 centimeters long are the most 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.930
 long I have but good are easy 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.600
 to get 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.419
 let's do it the same way a groove 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.060
 there in wedge so that the thread is 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.759
 hook and it is not easier to 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.530
 hold what is the arrow with with the 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.360
 thread let's go 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.639
 well there it looks more or less like it has 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.320
 than to be nothing like this with all the 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.570
 arrows taking the bow and arrows 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:14.300
 prepared we are going to do a practice of 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:17.509
 good shot imitating the motel 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.699
 I have placed the potato above 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:24.050
 the head to mickey mouse had not 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:26.060
 apples but let's save the life of 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.909
 mickey since they're going to go all the 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.900
 arrows to the potato so I hope 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.900
 luck video 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.160
 I shit 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:10.990
 well here we have how he created the 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.990
 seÃ±orito mickey mouse 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.530
 with our bow 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.870
 well here you see the arch that apart from 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.770
 to be fully functional is perfect 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.139
 for decoration 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.660
 a good mates greeting and if he has 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:28.919
