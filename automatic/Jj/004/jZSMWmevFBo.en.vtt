00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.290 
hey I'm Bob but I like to make stuff

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.419 
hey I'm Bob but I like to make stuff
today<00:00:01.709> I'm<00:00:01.829> going<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:01.979> show<00:00:02.070> you<00:00:02.129> how<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.250> make

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
today I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:12.049 
today I'm going to show you how to make
a<00:00:02.460> copy<00:00:02.790> of<00:00:03.149> your<00:00:03.330> favorite<00:00:03.720> toy<00:00:03.870> I<00:00:11.059> started

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
a copy of your favorite toy I started

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.580 
a copy of your favorite toy I started
with<00:00:12.150> some<00:00:12.300> corrugated<00:00:12.630> plastic<00:00:12.990> for<00:00:13.469> this

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
with some corrugated plastic for this

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.230 
with some corrugated plastic for this
but<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.860> could<00:00:14.009> also<00:00:14.130> use<00:00:14.250> foam<00:00:14.700> core<00:00:14.969> I

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
but you could also use foam core I

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.330 
but you could also use foam core I
measured<00:00:16.199> out<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.350> rough<00:00:16.619> size<00:00:16.800> for<00:00:17.010> my<00:00:17.130> figure

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
measured out a rough size for my figure

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.950 
measured out a rough size for my figure
and<00:00:17.490> then<00:00:17.820> added<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.180> half<00:00:18.390> an<00:00:18.570> inch<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.840> each

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
and then added a half an inch to each

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.710 
and then added a half an inch to each
side<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.590> using<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.580> width<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.060> made<00:00:21.449> four

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
side of it using that width I made four

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.200 
side of it using that width I made four
sections<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.320> same<00:00:22.529> size<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:23.789> height<00:00:24.000> here

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
sections the same size the height here

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.400 
sections the same size the height here
doesn't<00:00:24.480> really<00:00:24.600> matter<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.900> just<00:00:25.199> have<00:00:25.289> to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
doesn't really matter you just have to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.599 
doesn't really matter you just have to
make<00:00:25.529> sure<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.010> quite<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> bit<00:00:26.310> taller

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
make sure that it's quite a bit taller

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.189 
make sure that it's quite a bit taller
than<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> actual<00:00:27.300> item<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.810> you're<00:00:27.930> trying

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
than the actual item that you're trying

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.009 
than the actual item that you're trying
to<00:00:28.320> mold<00:00:28.910> then<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.000> use<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.359> same<00:00:30.510> piece<00:00:30.750> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
to mold then I use that same piece to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.510 
to mold then I use that same piece to
trace<00:00:31.199> out<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> square<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.949> use<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.340> bottom

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
trace out a square to use for the bottom

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.799 
trace out a square to use for the bottom
I<00:00:33.440> hot-glued<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.770> my<00:00:34.920> figurehead<00:00:35.520> first<00:00:35.880> this

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
I hot-glued on my figurehead first this

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.910 
I hot-glued on my figurehead first this
is<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> point<00:00:37.320> where<00:00:37.440> you're<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> pour

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
is the point where you're going to pour

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.950 
is the point where you're going to pour
resin<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.550> later<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.390> right<00:00:39.540> now<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
resin in later but right now it's on the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.110 
resin in later but right now it's on the
bottom<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.620> used<00:00:41.040> some<00:00:41.160> hot<00:00:41.340> glue<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.579> also

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
bottom I used some hot glue to also

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.299 
bottom I used some hot glue to also
attach<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.690> pieces<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.140> make<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.290> box<00:00:43.590> this

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
attach the pieces to make a box this

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.680 
attach the pieces to make a box this
doesn't<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.910> pretty<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.539> do

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
doesn't have to be pretty but you do

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.610 
doesn't have to be pretty but you do
want<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.870> make<00:00:45.989> sure<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.440> get

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
want to make sure that you get

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.180 
want to make sure that you get
everything<00:00:46.980> sealed<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:47.640> as<00:00:47.850> well<00:00:48.000> as<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.210> can

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.619 

now<00:00:53.190> you're<00:00:53.340> ready<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> pour<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.879> mold<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.360> got

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
now you're ready to pour the mold I got

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.110 
now you're ready to pour the mold I got
this<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.960> move<00:00:55.140> 30<00:00:55.379> from<00:00:55.710> Inventables<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
this you move 30 from Inventables and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.849 
this you move 30 from Inventables and
it's<00:00:57.270> really<00:00:57.539> easy<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.930> use<00:00:58.050> because<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.770> a

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it's really easy to use because it's a

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.369 
it's really easy to use because it's a
one-to-one<00:00:59.280> mixture<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.079> long<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.289> you

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
one-to-one mixture so as long as you

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.900 
one-to-one mixture so as long as you
have<00:01:01.530> equal<00:01:01.890> parts<00:01:02.219> between<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.730> two

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
have equal parts between the two

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.140 
have equal parts between the two
different<00:01:03.270> cans<00:01:03.480> you're<00:01:04.110> good<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.970> put<00:01:05.970> them<00:01:06.060> in

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
different cans you're good I put them in

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.550 
different cans you're good I put them in
clear<00:01:06.360> cups<00:01:06.600> next<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.049> each<00:01:07.140> other<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.470> it

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
clear cups next to each other so it

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.960 
clear cups next to each other so it
didn't<00:01:07.770> actually<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.250> measure<00:01:08.520> them<00:01:08.760> I

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
didn't actually have to measure them I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.340 
didn't actually have to measure them I
could<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.360> visually<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.290> were

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
could just visually see that they were

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.320 
could just visually see that they were
the<00:01:10.500> same<00:01:10.680> amount<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.280> then<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.850> poured<00:01:12.150> those

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the same amount and then I poured those

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.760 
the same amount and then I poured those
into<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> larger<00:01:13.200> bucket<00:01:13.580> mix<00:01:14.580> them<00:01:14.729> up<00:01:15.770> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
into a larger bucket mix them up the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.230 
into a larger bucket mix them up the
mixing<00:01:17.100> process<00:01:17.250> takes<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.939> little<00:01:18.060> while

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
mixing process takes a little while

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.700 
mixing process takes a little while
because<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.780> want<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.990> make<00:01:19.200> sure<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
because you want to make sure that you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.380 
because you want to make sure that you
get<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.070> much<00:01:20.220> out<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.640> cups<00:01:20.880> into<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
get as much out of the cups into the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.480 
get as much out of the cups into the
bucket<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:23.040> then<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.280> want<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
bucket as you can but then you want to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.950 
bucket as you can but then you want to
make<00:01:23.610> sure<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.970> get<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.180> mixed<00:01:24.450> really

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
make sure that you get it mixed really

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.480 
make sure that you get it mixed really
really<00:01:25.200> well<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.650> want<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.950> scrape<00:01:26.159> off<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
really well you want to scrape off the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.999 
really well you want to scrape off the
sides<00:01:26.759> scrape<00:01:27.540> off<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> bottom<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.380> spend

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
sides scrape off the bottom and spend

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.980 
sides scrape off the bottom and spend
some<00:01:29.220> time<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.670> get<00:01:29.790> rid<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.060> all<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.570> swirls

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
some time to get rid of all the swirls

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.719 
some time to get rid of all the swirls
in<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> color<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.770> want<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> uniform

had<00:01:34.950> access<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.520> vacuum<00:01:35.939> chamber<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.509> would

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
had access to a vacuum chamber you would

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.149 
had access to a vacuum chamber you would
want<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.869> pull<00:01:37.020> all<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.380> air<00:01:37.530> bubbles<00:01:37.860> out<00:01:38.100> of

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
want to pull all the air bubbles out of

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
want to pull all the air bubbles out of
the<00:01:38.340> silicone<00:01:38.700> before<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.060> poured<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.689> I

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
the silicone before you poured it but I

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.080 
the silicone before you poured it but I
don't<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.170> one<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.310> instead<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.670> tried<00:01:41.970> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
don't have one so instead I tried to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.670 
don't have one so instead I tried to
stretch<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.869> poured<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.530> get

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
stretch it out as I poured it in to get

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.260 
stretch it out as I poured it in to get
rid<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.860> some<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.250> air<00:01:44.369> bubbles<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.180> was

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
rid of some of the air bubbles as it was

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.120 
rid of some of the air bubbles as it was
thinned<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:46.320> worked<00:01:46.560> pretty<00:01:46.799> well<00:01:47.070> but

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
thinned out this worked pretty well but

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.740 
thinned out this worked pretty well but
obviously<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.119> see<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.450> there's<00:01:48.600> still

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
obviously you can see that there's still

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.440 
obviously you can see that there's still
some<00:01:48.930> bubbles<00:01:49.229> down<00:01:49.380> there<00:01:50.090> after<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.119> was<00:01:51.299> all

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
some bubbles down there after it was all

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.240 
some bubbles down there after it was all
cured<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:52.079> tore<00:01:52.320> away<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.680> outside<00:01:52.799> of

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
cured I just tore away the outside of

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.850 
cured I just tore away the outside of
the<00:01:53.310> mold<00:01:53.750> this<00:01:54.750> happens<00:01:55.079> really<00:01:55.290> easily<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the mold this happens really easily and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.050 
the mold this happens really easily and
then<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:55.979> end<00:01:56.189> up<00:01:56.250> with<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.430> nice<00:01:56.549> block<00:01:56.880> of

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
then you end up with a nice block of

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.240 
then you end up with a nice block of
silicone<00:01:57.450> then<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.259> used<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.560> blade<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:59.040> cut<00:01:59.189> a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
silicone then I used a blade to cut a

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.370 
silicone then I used a blade to cut a
serpentine<00:01:59.820> pattern<00:02:00.090> down<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.810> sides<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.229> it

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
serpentine pattern down to sides of it

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.139 
serpentine pattern down to sides of it
this<00:02:01.860> blade<00:02:02.070> worked<00:02:02.340> alright<00:02:02.640> but<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.909> think<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
this blade worked alright but I think a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.819 
this blade worked alright but I think a
long<00:02:03.299> skinny<00:02:03.659> one<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> scalpel<00:02:04.649> would

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
long skinny one like a scalpel would

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:05.990 
long skinny one like a scalpel would
work<00:02:05.009> even<00:02:05.280> better

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
work even better

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.890 
work even better
you<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.300> make<00:02:06.390> sure<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:06.780> don't

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
you want to make sure that you don't

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.570 
you want to make sure that you don't
tear<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.410> silicon<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.980> want<00:02:08.100> to<00:02:08.190> cut<00:02:08.430> it<00:02:08.550> so

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
tear the silicon you want to cut it so

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.280 
tear the silicon you want to cut it so
that<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:08.940> goes<00:02:09.060> back<00:02:09.270> together<00:02:09.660> nicely<00:02:09.960> when

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
that it goes back together nicely when

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.100 
that it goes back together nicely when
you<00:02:10.380> go<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.530> make<00:02:10.710> your<00:02:10.740> cast<00:02:11.100> I<00:02:11.780> took<00:02:12.780> my<00:02:12.930> time

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
you go to make your cast I took my time

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.080 
you go to make your cast I took my time
to<00:02:13.410> cut<00:02:13.620> around<00:02:13.770> all<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.160> details<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.820> any<00:02:14.940> of

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
to cut around all the details and any of

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.790 
to cut around all the details and any of
the<00:02:15.180> undercuts<00:02:15.690> like<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.020> armpits<00:02:16.470> or<00:02:16.710> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
the undercuts like the armpits or the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.400 
the undercuts like the armpits or the
hands<00:02:17.220> once<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.090> got<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.360> all<00:02:18.450> loose<00:02:18.660> enough<00:02:18.990> the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
hands once I got it all loose enough the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.880 
hands once I got it all loose enough the
figure<00:02:19.680> popped<00:02:19.920> right<00:02:20.160> out<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:22.530> was<00:02:22.650> really

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
figure popped right out it was really

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.260 
figure popped right out it was really
cool<00:02:23.040> looking<00:02:23.340> at<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.580> inside<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.060> mold

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
cool looking at the inside of the mold

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.270 
cool looking at the inside of the mold
because<00:02:24.570> all<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.990> details<00:02:25.380> every<00:02:25.950> single

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
because all the details every single

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.880 
because all the details every single
little<00:02:26.400> thing<00:02:26.490> was<00:02:26.910> there<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.710> back

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
little thing was there and it back

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.400 
little thing was there and it back
together<00:02:29.070> really<00:02:29.490> nicely<00:02:30.020> sprayed<00:02:31.020> some<00:02:31.200> mold

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
together really nicely sprayed some mold

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.140 
together really nicely sprayed some mold
release<00:02:31.740> on<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> inside<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.580> mold<00:02:32.790> tried

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
release on the inside of the mold tried

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.520 
release on the inside of the mold tried
to<00:02:33.240> cover<00:02:33.390> all<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.720> surfaces<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
to cover all the surfaces so that the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.620 
to cover all the surfaces so that the
cast<00:02:34.830> item<00:02:35.220> will<00:02:35.340> come<00:02:35.490> out<00:02:35.610> easier<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.240> taped

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
cast item will come out easier I taped

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.180 
cast item will come out easier I taped
up<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.840> mold<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.230> keep<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.590> closed<00:02:37.860> for<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
up the mold to keep it closed for the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.890 
up the mold to keep it closed for the
next<00:02:38.459> step<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.790> use<00:02:38.970> pieces<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.480> wood<00:02:39.690> to

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
next step and use pieces of wood to

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.840 
next step and use pieces of wood to
distribute<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> stress<00:02:40.740> from<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.100> tape<00:02:41.280> you

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
distribute the stress from the tape you

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.160 
distribute the stress from the tape you
don't<00:02:42.000> want<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.300> squish<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.810> mold<00:02:43.020> you

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
don't want it to squish the mold you

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.050 
don't want it to squish the mold you
just<00:02:43.320> want<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.590> hold<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.950> closed<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.940> make

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
just want it to hold it closed to make

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.590 
just want it to hold it closed to make
the<00:02:45.209> cast

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
the cast

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.480 
the cast
I<00:02:45.660> used<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.050> urethane<00:02:46.560> resin<00:02:46.800> it's<00:02:47.160> also<00:02:47.340> a

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
I used a urethane resin it's also a

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.840 
I used a urethane resin it's also a
one-to-one<00:02:47.910> mixture<00:02:48.390> just<00:02:48.660> like<00:02:48.900> them<00:02:49.080> all<00:02:49.260> I

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
one-to-one mixture just like them all I

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.220 
one-to-one mixture just like them all I
did<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:50.940> equally<00:02:51.330> in<00:02:51.420> two<00:02:51.540> clear<00:02:51.780> cups<00:02:51.990> and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
did it equally in two clear cups and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.960 
did it equally in two clear cups and
then<00:02:52.350> poured<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.620> together<00:02:52.920> making<00:02:53.430> sure<00:02:53.610> to

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
then poured it together making sure to

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.449 
then poured it together making sure to
mix<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.390> really<00:02:54.690> really<00:02:55.110> well<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:56.220> then<00:02:56.370> I

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
mix it really really well but then I

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.100 
mix it really really well but then I
just<00:02:56.490> poured<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.000> into<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.330> mold<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.840> really

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
just poured it into the mold it really

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.540 
just poured it into the mold it really
doesn't<00:02:58.410> take<00:02:58.440> very<00:02:58.590> much<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.340> want<00:02:59.490> to

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
doesn't take very much and you want to

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.010 
doesn't take very much and you want to
make<00:02:59.670> sure<00:02:59.820> that<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.150> spin<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.720> mold<00:03:00.900> around

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
make sure that you spin the mold around

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.810 
make sure that you spin the mold around
to<00:03:01.470> get<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.770> in<00:03:01.890> all<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.280> little<00:03:02.490> nooks<00:03:02.670> and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
to get it in all the little nooks and

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.180 
to get it in all the little nooks and
crannies<00:03:03.240> that<00:03:03.480> helps<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.530> air<00:03:04.650> bubbles<00:03:05.040> to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
crannies that helps the air bubbles to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.620 
crannies that helps the air bubbles to
get<00:03:05.340> pushed<00:03:05.580> up<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:05.910> top<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.540> they

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
get pushed up to the top so that they

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.180 
get pushed up to the top so that they
end<00:03:06.660> up<00:03:06.870> popping<00:03:07.110> out<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.620> opening<00:03:08.010> at<00:03:08.130> the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
end up popping out of the opening at the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.340 
end up popping out of the opening at the
top<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.580> mold<00:03:08.760> when<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.870> happens<00:03:10.200> you'll

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
top of the mold when that happens you'll

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.930 
top of the mold when that happens you'll
need<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.560> add<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.739> little<00:03:11.040> bit<00:03:11.250> more<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.760> fill

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
need to add a little bit more to fill

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.440 
need to add a little bit more to fill
the<00:03:12.030> gap<00:03:12.180> now<00:03:16.580> once<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.670> cured<00:03:18.120> which<00:03:18.269> took

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
the gap now once that cured which took

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.120 
the gap now once that cured which took
quite<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.840> while<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.650> really<00:03:19.860> just<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.100> matter

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
quite a while it's really just a matter

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.830 
quite a while it's really just a matter
of<00:03:20.370> popping<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:20.940> out<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.239> mold<00:03:21.390> just<00:03:21.720> like

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
of popping it out of the mold just like

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:33.020 
of popping it out of the mold just like
the<00:03:21.959> original<00:03:22.290> figure<00:03:31.640> there's<00:03:32.640> problems

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
the original figure there's problems

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.640 
the original figure there's problems
here<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.330> there<00:03:33.480> but<00:03:33.660> overall<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.350> work<00:03:34.500> it

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
here and there but overall you work it

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.680 
here and there but overall you work it
really<00:03:34.799> well<00:03:35.070> now<00:03:35.700> I've<00:03:35.850> ever<00:03:36.030> done<00:03:36.269> any<00:03:36.420> mold

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
really well now I've ever done any mold

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.449 
really well now I've ever done any mold
making<00:03:36.930> so<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.200> learned<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.590> whole<00:03:37.620> lot<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.220> doing

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
making so I learned a whole lot in doing

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.100 
making so I learned a whole lot in doing
research<00:03:38.760> for<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:39.030> project<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.690> learned<00:03:39.810> that

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
research for this project I learned that

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.420 
research for this project I learned that
there's<00:03:40.290> tons<00:03:40.530> of<00:03:40.650> different<00:03:40.739> materials<00:03:41.310> that

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
there's tons of different materials that

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.920 
there's tons of different materials that
you<00:03:41.549> can<00:03:41.670> use<00:03:41.820> both<00:03:42.030> for<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.269> mold<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.720> for

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
you can use both for the mold and for

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.509 
you can use both for the mold and for
the<00:03:42.989> cast<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.560> each<00:03:43.709> one<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:43.950> those<00:03:44.010> materials

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
the cast and each one of those materials

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.430 
the cast and each one of those materials
has<00:03:44.670> different<00:03:45.000> properties<00:03:45.120> curing<00:03:45.900> time<00:03:46.080> D

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
has different properties curing time D

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.920 
has different properties curing time D
mold<00:03:46.680> time<00:03:47.010> hardness<00:03:47.700> softness<00:03:48.450> there's<00:03:48.720> all

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
mold time hardness softness there's all

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.150 
mold time hardness softness there's all
sorts<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.350> different<00:03:49.620> things<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.980> you

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
sorts of different things that you

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.590 
sorts of different things that you
really<00:03:50.430> need<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.670> research<00:03:51.060> depending<00:03:51.480> on

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
really need to research depending on

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.240 
really need to research depending on
what<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.900> want<00:03:52.049> to<00:03:52.140> use<00:03:52.290> your<00:03:52.440> final<00:03:52.739> cast<00:03:52.950> for

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
what you want to use your final cast for

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.009 
what you want to use your final cast for
and<00:03:53.489> how<00:03:53.670> often<00:03:53.970> you're<00:03:54.510> going<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.690> use<00:03:54.810> your

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
and how often you're going to use your

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.720 
and how often you're going to use your
mold<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.500> if<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.709> had<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.890> vacuum<00:03:56.280> chamber<00:03:56.459> you

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
mold and if you had a vacuum chamber you

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.250 
mold and if you had a vacuum chamber you
could<00:03:56.910> get<00:03:57.030> rid<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.209> all<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.630> air<00:03:57.750> bubbles<00:03:57.780> in

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
could get rid of all the air bubbles in

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.690 
could get rid of all the air bubbles in
both<00:03:58.440> of<00:03:58.590> these<00:03:58.709> materials<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.459> would<00:03:59.580> make

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
both of these materials that would make

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.610 
both of these materials that would make
your<00:03:59.820> molds<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.299> lot<00:04:00.450> tighter<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:01.019> more<00:04:01.200> exact

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
your molds a lot tighter and more exact

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.930 
your molds a lot tighter and more exact
on<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.890> inside<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:02.610> would<00:04:02.700> make<00:04:02.820> your

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
on the inside and it would make your

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.060 
on the inside and it would make your
casts<00:04:03.360> in<00:04:03.450> this<00:04:03.690> case<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:04.140> lot<00:04:04.290> clearer<00:04:04.739> because

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
casts in this case a lot clearer because

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.740 
casts in this case a lot clearer because
all<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.340> this<00:04:05.610> frosting<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.239> actually<00:04:06.540> tiny

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
all of this frosting is actually tiny

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.150 
all of this frosting is actually tiny
little<00:04:06.930> bubbles<00:04:07.200> and<00:04:07.500> like<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.739> said<00:04:07.950> there's<00:04:08.100> a

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
little bubbles and like I said there's a

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.650 
little bubbles and like I said there's a
ton<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.430> different<00:04:08.610> materials<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.239> could<00:04:09.420> use

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
ton of different materials you could use

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.960 
ton of different materials you could use
for<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.049> cast<00:04:10.260> itself<00:04:10.739> this<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.310> resin<00:04:11.790> but

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
for the cast itself this is a resin but

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.089 
for the cast itself this is a resin but
you<00:04:12.090> could<00:04:12.209> use<00:04:12.360> wax<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.989> could<00:04:13.140> use<00:04:13.320> anything

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
you could use wax you could use anything

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.530 
you could use wax you could use anything
and<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.400> can<00:04:14.550> colorize<00:04:14.970> it<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.270> make<00:04:15.420> it

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
and you can colorize it to make it

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.089 
and you can colorize it to make it
whatever<00:04:15.750> color<00:04:15.990> you<00:04:16.169> want<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.620> can<00:04:16.770> even<00:04:16.890> use

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
whatever color you want you can even use

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.710 
whatever color you want you can even use
silicone<00:04:17.549> similar<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.299> stuff<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.630> you

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
silicone similar to the stuff that you

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.470 
silicone similar to the stuff that you
use<00:04:18.870> for<00:04:19.020> the<00:04:19.140> mole

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
use for the mole

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.670 
use for the mole
and<00:04:19.600> you<00:04:19.720> would<00:04:19.840> end<00:04:19.990> up<00:04:20.080> with<00:04:20.170> a<00:04:20.320> stretchy

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
and you would end up with a stretchy

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.320 
and you would end up with a stretchy
action<00:04:21.130> figure<00:04:21.370> which<00:04:21.700> would<00:04:21.850> be<00:04:21.970> pretty<00:04:22.090> cool

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
action figure which would be pretty cool

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.880 
action figure which would be pretty cool
so<00:04:22.690> not<00:04:22.840> only<00:04:22.960> could<00:04:23.230> you<00:04:23.290> copy<00:04:23.590> something

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
so not only could you copy something

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.530 
so not only could you copy something
that<00:04:24.130> you<00:04:24.250> buy<00:04:24.460> but<00:04:24.760> if<00:04:24.880> you<00:04:24.970> made<00:04:25.210> something

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
that you buy but if you made something
