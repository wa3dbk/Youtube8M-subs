00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:09.599
 well now let's talk about the 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.120
 driver problem over there 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.950
 computers that one by formatting the no 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.920
 he knows how to make them come back to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.050
 they came from factories good as we see 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.759
 I'm here with a computer I like 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.990
 the government the valve as you 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.490
 want to say the toaster and so on 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.960
 this consultant sometimes bring about 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:35.010
 mistakes that as you can tell 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.410
 drivers were written to manufacture the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.710
 the first ones who will be in the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.719
 computers when normally and good 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.120
 that you can say this is because 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.690
 when you format the computer the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.469
 computer comes 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.079
 comes genuine has a cure when formatting 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.289
 Remove all drivers from the 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.329
 computer can work the same or more 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.489
 fast installing other drivers but to 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.920
 sometimes people who say that better with 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.890
 another one and see that I had the computer as 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.380
 first came first that and 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.860
 good as we can see navigate the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.240
 web I found a weird file and about 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.070
 this 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.070
 about what brings many 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.260
 finally ignoring the child playing 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.290
 carts we talk about the drivers lame 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.360
 duck as we see here are the drivers 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.580
 of this and here are those of the keys and 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.140
 I talked about a past and good video 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.140
 this is the driver balboa note 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.650
 I'm not going to say where I got it but good 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.200
 this is the driver of what we need 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.030
 to integrate what came from the factory 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.930
 of the computer meduca 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.979
 then then decompress the only thing that 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.560
 I'm going to tell you what you have to do is 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.840
 remove and install and it will appear 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.970
 some messages that say they want 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.549
 trust that it may be that the 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.319
 Kings pirates are not interested because 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.360
 Sometimes we want to have everything from fabri to 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.280
 times also to install what's that 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.540
 talk about the past video about I think that 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.069
 was the zenith screen brightness 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.760
 have the drivers all the drivers 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.630
 executed in a harsh way in your 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.630
 native driver 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.090
 as we see I want to make this short video 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.540
 If I'm going to do this, you should resign and 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.760
 not only this what is going to be done 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.739
 to run 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.959
 to correct the errors that 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.310
 they have on their computer and good those 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.989
 are the drivers that are good 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.310
 computer and what are most ideal 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.310
 for this type of computer 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.680
 Y 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.060
 while iberia now that I charge 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.409
 program these are all drivers and 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.120
 devices that will be installed in your 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.829
 computation received can see them and see 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.870
 everything that will install until 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.060
 reach 100 because this will take 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.680
 maybe about half an hour or 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.989
 depending on the pc so depending 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.959
 this computer always takes between 20 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.480
 30 minutes as we see then you 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.430
 they only start restoration on 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.870
 install all the native drivers as 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.049
 came to the computer during 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.019
 then after finishing this which 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.760
 I will not do then they will have 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.200
 it happens only to restart to I think that 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.670
 twice because the first time 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.330
 restart reboots to install all 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.700
 the drivers the second time it restarts 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.800
 what you try to uninstall what is the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.360
 hard drive driver so that after 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.390
 from you can install the applications 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.910
 as the rapid storage technologies that 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.520
 is to accelerate the use of your hard drive 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.120
 and what the screen indicators 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.950
 so that they install well 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.799
 exact only with a computer from 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.469
 government and well I hope it has been 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.999
 help like this in this video because 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.980
 is going to be going up in all the 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.749
 platform of all the pages that 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.219
 have that is all the millions of 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:08.989
 pages that I have written in the 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:08.989
 internet chao chao see you
