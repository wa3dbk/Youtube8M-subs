that's fine but the Jews understood that
the<00:03:48.510> Prophet<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.020> an<00:03:49.140> Israelite<00:03:49.790> therefore<00:03:50.790> if

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
the Prophet is an Israelite therefore if

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.730 
the Prophet is an Israelite therefore if
they're<00:03:51.120> right<00:03:51.300> Muhammad<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:51.930> wrong<00:03:52.140> so<00:03:52.560> would

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
they're right Muhammad is wrong so would

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.590 
they're right Muhammad is wrong so would
you<00:03:52.770> agree<00:03:52.890> with<00:03:53.220> me<00:03:53.520> that<00:03:53.550> in<00:03:53.820> principle<00:03:54.060> the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
you agree with me that in principle the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.170 
you agree with me that in principle the
Jews<00:03:54.810> were<00:03:54.840> mistaken<00:03:55.710> and<00:03:55.880> thinking<00:03:56.880> that<00:03:57.030> the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
Jews were mistaken and thinking that the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.700 
Jews were mistaken and thinking that the
Prophet<00:03:57.600> was<00:03:57.750> an<00:03:57.900> Israelite<00:03:59.660> yeah<00:04:00.660> if<00:04:01.290> that's

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
Prophet was an Israelite yeah if that's

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.410 
Prophet was an Israelite yeah if that's
what<00:04:01.890> they're<00:04:02.070> thinking<00:04:02.340> then<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.120> could

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
what they're thinking then it could

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.110 
what they're thinking then it could
happen<00:04:03.630> ok<00:04:04.080> so<00:04:04.140> it's<00:04:04.350> possibly<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:05.120> excellent

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
happen ok so it's possibly the excellent

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.750 
happen ok so it's possibly the excellent
it's<00:04:06.840> possible<00:04:07.170> they're<00:04:07.710> wrong<00:04:07.950> but<00:04:08.520> then<00:04:08.670> you

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
it's possible they're wrong but then you

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.730 
it's possible they're wrong but then you
have<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:08.940> be<00:04:09.030> consistent<00:04:09.500> since<00:04:10.500> it's

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
have to be consistent since it's

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.800 
have to be consistent since it's
possible<00:04:11.340> they<00:04:11.520> were<00:04:11.580> wrong<00:04:11.820> concerning<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
possible they were wrong concerning the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.320 
possible they were wrong concerning the
ethnicity<00:04:13.800> of<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:14.070> Prophet<00:04:14.459> then<00:04:15.090> by<00:04:15.270> the

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
ethnicity of the Prophet then by the

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.539 
ethnicity of the Prophet then by the
same<00:04:15.720> token<00:04:16.020> you<00:04:16.410> have<00:04:16.770> to<00:04:16.950> admit<00:04:17.370> it's

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
same token you have to admit it's

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.370 
same token you have to admit it's
possible<00:04:18.420> that<00:04:18.600> they<00:04:18.780> were<00:04:18.840> wrong<00:04:19.109> in

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
possible that they were wrong in

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.229 
possible that they were wrong in
thinking<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:20.220> Prophet<00:04:20.670> is<00:04:20.820> someone

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
thinking the Prophet is someone

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.719 
thinking the Prophet is someone
different<00:04:21.690> from<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.020> Christ<00:04:22.290> once<00:04:23.280> you<00:04:23.520> open

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
different from the Christ once you open

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.550 
different from the Christ once you open
the<00:04:24.000> door<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.720> possibility<00:04:24.990> they<00:04:25.500> were

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
the door to the possibility they were

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.140 
the door to the possibility they were
mistaken<00:04:26.130> concerning<00:04:26.610> his

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
mistaken concerning his

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.510 
mistaken concerning his
city<00:04:27.449> you<00:04:28.080> have<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.380> be<00:04:28.500> consistent<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.310> then

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
city you have to be consistent and then

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.909 
city you have to be consistent and then
see<00:04:29.790> whether<00:04:30.479> they<00:04:30.810> were<00:04:30.870> wrong<00:04:31.199> in<00:04:31.500> thinking

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
see whether they were wrong in thinking

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.800 
see whether they were wrong in thinking
the<00:04:32.370> Prophet<00:04:32.880> was<00:04:33.030> different<00:04:33.540> from<00:04:33.630> the

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
the Prophet was different from the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.409 
the Prophet was different from the

proof that the Jews were wrong in

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.450 
proof that the Jews were wrong in
thinking<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.410> Prophet<00:04:55.889> was<00:04:56.100> someone

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
thinking the Prophet was someone

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.340 
thinking the Prophet was someone

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
right the Prophet was an Israelite

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.240 
right the Prophet was an Israelite
because<00:05:00.449> Jesus<00:05:00.810> says<00:05:01.050> he<00:05:01.500> is<00:05:01.590> that<00:05:01.770> prophet

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
because Jesus says he is that prophet

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.550 
because Jesus says he is that prophet
and<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.940> Moses<00:05:03.300> wrote<00:05:03.449> about<00:05:03.660> him<00:05:03.900> so<00:05:04.380> did
