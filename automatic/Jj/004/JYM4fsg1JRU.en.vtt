00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:01.540
 Various 

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.540
 Still I am 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:12.449
 Elevator 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.439
 In addition, I make use of such putts and just push madeinthailand 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.279
 It is attached attached Aristo 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.269
 left 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.449
 Established 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.089
 It is an elevator 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.839
 Eliza 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.569
 Change the opening angle 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.569
 The 16th 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.780
 Ohno 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.980
 End 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.990
 Open the standard and close the foot a little from the city 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.070
 When the stopper is pulled out at an interview 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.720
 The remaining one will be expanded 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.180
 1958 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.970
 To here but Shirakawa Yasu 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.500
 I'm happy 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.110
 Let's not open the battle and defense 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.610
 Shiojiri City has risen once it gets up and pulls out the top 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.610
 Courage and 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.230
 This is 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.360
 I like it 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.360
 In trial whether you understand 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.440
 Because I'm a five-handed desk 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.780
 Ohira 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.810
 I will go here 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.810
 Divided into three stages 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.080
 This is open 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.540
 But 30th place 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.780
 Made too 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.870
 So far 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.780
 This 2 hits 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.780
 Third stage 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.170
 This is amazing 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.580
 By the way let's compare the configuration once and buy the software 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.120
 Let's do it 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.470
 Play a game 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.280
 i 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.010
 Incense 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.220
 This year's 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.260
 I want something new 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.530
 It was constant 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.240
 Four 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.299
 You should be able to get behind this 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.489
 I do not have a center pole 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.609
 This elevator 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.389
 It seems to be collecting in the future 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.369
 Classic 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.369
 I think Kosugi is a low mountain 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:23.289
 Correct and thorough 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.289
 on TV 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.119
 It is this pet 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.449
 The statement is 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:38.289
 Won without a mark 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.289
 action. 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.489
 I can not raise this without 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.079
 It is stated that you accept this and accept the request 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.659
 In this way no mixing 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:59.509
 This point 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.509
 I also say that my heart turned my mouth 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.159
 I understand you 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.109
 Say Guangzhou 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.599
 I got this agreement 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.059
 I feel like learning how to use 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:16.989
 I reached out in the next mountain 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.919
 Yay, Fukuda if you give priority to using thick pipes 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.919
 Let's put out from the thicker one with less Mr. 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.419
 It is basic change 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.479
 3 goals in the building 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:32.479
 When the elevator is plugged in from below 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.399
 Capacity 8 people 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:36.319
 Such an update 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.319
 Articles and pleasure 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.349
 Dormitory 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.059
 s550 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:46.459
 North 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.750
 Come here 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.259
 I have removed this spot 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:53.939
 This way assault and expect from Takasawa 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.809
 I was on my side for 7 days 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:00.639
 It's because Uzaki can do a stop. 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.039
 Source 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:05.889
 ... 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.889
 course 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.419
 It was the future, but it was spreading afterward 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.389
 It is said that we put camera in this time and take Matsushita 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.529
 It will come again on the same day 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.609
 If you make this shorter 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.609
 Explain 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.300
 It's about being great here 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.729
 Using Nishitani 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.729
 LOL It can be used for digital copying and sessions 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:36.069
 I wonder if there is such a thing 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.110
 I can't make it again 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.110
 Sports land sugo 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.949
 It was soothing 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.499
 End 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:55.499
 Each was 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.650
 by the way 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.479
 Bother 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:03.999
 2008 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:05.559
 Also quick shoe 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:08.559
 I have left my nursery school so far 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.300
 Same 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:30.740
 In this 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.740
 We are giving notice from now 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.879
 I'm tired 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.029
 This is an executive 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:42.069
 fanfun. 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:43.789
 Became a leader 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.669
 Fukuda bread became 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.669
 Because this was interrupted 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:52.849
 But you know 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.119
 It was more than I was worried about mounting on Matsui wall
