send<00:00:40.950> me<00:00:41.010> automatic<00:00:41.430> right<00:00:41.840> well<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
send me automatic right well I have a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.860 
send me automatic right well I have a
lock<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.489> my<00:00:44.579> mouse<00:00:45.030> scroll<00:00:45.390> wheel<00:00:45.450> which

allows me to scroll rapidly without any

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.770 
allows me to scroll rapidly without any
problem<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.219> creates<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.789> glitchy<00:00:51.449> look

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
problem so it creates this glitchy look

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840 
problem so it creates this glitchy look
because<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.920> assumes<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.340> I'm<00:00:53.460> switching

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850

you see how is a pump-action it has to

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.920 
you see how is a pump-action it has to
pump<00:02:42.070> in<00:02:42.280> between<00:02:42.580> each<00:02:42.730> shot<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:46.030> does<00:02:46.750> not

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
pump in between each shot it does not

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.300 
pump in between each shot it does not
work<00:02:49.140> because<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.410> has<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.650> pump<00:02:50.830> in<00:02:51.010> between

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
work because it has to pump in between

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.030 
work because it has to pump in between
each<00:02:51.459> shot<00:02:51.790> rather<00:02:52.780> than<00:02:53.049> instantly<00:02:53.590> firing

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
each shot rather than instantly firing

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.620 
each shot rather than instantly firing
again<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:55.320> switches<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:56.470> another<00:02:56.590> weapon<00:02:57.630> the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
again it switches to another weapon the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.110 
again it switches to another weapon the
pump<00:02:58.870> action<00:02:59.049> does<00:02:59.440> not<00:02:59.470> work<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.940> bolt

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
pump action does not work the bolt

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.060 
pump action does not work the bolt
action<00:03:01.360> does<00:03:01.720> not<00:03:01.750> work<00:03:02.080> because<00:03:02.320> of<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.799> same

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
action does not work because of the same

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.039 
action does not work because of the same
reason<00:03:03.519> so<00:03:06.390> semi-automatic<00:03:07.390> shotguns<00:03:07.810> work

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
reason so semi-automatic shotguns work

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.930 
reason so semi-automatic shotguns work
semi-automatic<00:03:08.769> handguns<00:03:09.190> work<00:03:09.430> burst<00:03:09.700> fire

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
semi-automatic handguns work burst fire

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.420 
semi-automatic handguns work burst fire
handguns<00:03:10.390> work<00:03:10.630> and

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.270 

that<00:03:14.030> would<00:03:14.180> be<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.540> regular<00:03:14.720> sniper<00:03:15.230> fire<00:03:15.829> it

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
that would be the regular sniper fire it

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.250 
that would be the regular sniper fire it
is<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.579> semi-automatic<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:20.510> now<00:03:20.959> it<00:03:21.079> is<00:03:21.170> a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
is a semi-automatic and now it is a

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.149 
is a semi-automatic and now it is a
fully<00:03:21.500> automatic<00:03:23.920> also<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.340> five-seven

fully automatic also the five-seven

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:33.429 
fully automatic also the five-seven
semi-automatic<00:03:28.159> pistol<00:03:31.959> fully<00:03:32.959> automatic
