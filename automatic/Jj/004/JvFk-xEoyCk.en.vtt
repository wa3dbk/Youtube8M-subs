dam and starts going up and up and up

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.689 
dam and starts going up and up and up
now<00:00:57.930> spills<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.739> gets<00:00:58.890> under<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> carpet

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
now spills and gets under the carpet

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.820 
now spills and gets under the carpet

and<00:01:13.470> clogging<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.950> drain<00:01:14.150> you<00:01:15.150> clean<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
and clogging the drain you clean the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.440 
and clogging the drain you clean the
drain<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.320> case<00:01:17.030> there's<00:01:18.030> not<00:01:18.210> any

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
drain but in this case there's not any

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.360 
drain but in this case there's not any
working<00:01:18.840> room<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> drain<00:01:19.530> hose<00:01:19.800> down<00:01:20.100> here

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
working room on the drain hose down here

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.069 
working room on the drain hose down here
so<00:01:20.579> we'll<00:01:20.729> Jack<00:01:20.969> the<00:01:21.149> car<00:01:21.329> up<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.719> air<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
so we'll Jack the car up in the air and

so we'll Jack the car up in the air and
get<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> from<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> bottom<00:01:22.920> side<00:01:23.159> now<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.909> many

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
get it from the bottom side now in many

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.179 
get it from the bottom side now in many
cars<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.570> do<00:01:24.719> have<00:01:24.899> to<00:01:25.020> jack<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> access

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
cars you do have to jack it up to access

the drain hose but I just checked on the
silicon<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.950> lot<00:01:29.130> easier<00:01:29.540> cuz<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> drain

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
silicon it's a lot easier cuz the drain

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.050 
silicon it's a lot easier cuz the drain
