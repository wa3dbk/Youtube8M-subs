 ok racks him and me it's karim 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.710
 it's the burial I live bordeaux 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.170
 because we already knew about 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.820
 most here 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.369
 on the manufacturer groups found 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.599
 lately will have bussy one size of in 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.189
 2014 you saw how you died 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.230
 revolutionizes but it's an experience 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.930
 very very good experience and 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.270
 I was a little stressed for the battle he 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.160
 there is a big preparation before before the 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.870
 battle but I got hurt at the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.520
 ankle actually I have a small sprain 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.760
 and so it's a bit complicated 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.579
 nothing so 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.899
 here it was very very good experience 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.550
 the quotation marks yeah I loved 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.909
 frankly i loved it i really like 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.909
 of stress 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.760
 you did an ad that made you 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.480
 really know what is the limit 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.800
 drop is limited 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.770
 we try bonuses is free but 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.880
 when we were not free there is good 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.650
 so much the better they are 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.330
 dancers they forget to say before 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.520
 you were part of batteries for 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.320
 shelter them delivers or no no I have 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.230
 not currently not in a year 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.810
 let's take advantage of 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.850
 to batteries first 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.740
 legs 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.799
 little on tape in fact we have a small 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.890
 project buckled a thibaut place a small 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.909
 knew 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.979
 a small group with the best 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.780
 Bordeaux dancers even in biting 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.210
 two interims comfortable support with 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.130
 cary for marc month it's the dream 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.490
 team who will speak on the balcony of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.420
 it will come out 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.770
 after we're doing it cleanly 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.039
 it's to show that in bordeaux there is 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.850
 new blood and how do you know 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.100
 put together all generations 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.109
 confounded that put you the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.350
 Huge potential in Bordeaux 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.980
 which is not exploited enough that is not 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.100
 enhancement and 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.740
 after unfortunately them 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.959
 finally there are people trying to 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.790
 to do that how do you say to go back up the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.530
 level but 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.689
 not his motives and I honestly 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.540
 I 'm happy because motivated I saw some 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.049
 people I'm ambitious who in the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.390
 cathedral 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.650
 I want to go do things 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.050
 and I think it's my turn 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.240
 now from 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.220
 things in hand and that's lemons 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.200
 of intelligent it is good luck and I 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.650
 said so is a little said bingo level 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.850
 of dance 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.530
 does it have a name no 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.190
 honestly I'm not there yet 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.800
 dance 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.810
 this advanced mix will be like riding 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.760
 classical dance is breakdance maybe 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.720
 that later as I passed nine buck 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.850
 he invented downright hassan years 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.620
 the for intel standing and he gave a 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.480
 name squarely at this task reminds me 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.620
 more exactly the name but maybe 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.540
 only later when I really have 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.350
 exploit the thing thoroughly and that's 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.810
 maybe from normand 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.670
 does this dance style and its a330 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.020
 and is it today when you go 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.190
 foreign people do not recognize as 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.290
 we do that 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.140
 but the one that I 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.970
 know like that after I got a little 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.620
 informed and to have exploited the thing 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.410
 even in the middle of the break I have a little 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.360
 the only one to have done so that's for sure 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.900
 whether we are 5 are a lot of 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.870
 sailing opportunities to 2 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.970
 as long as I believe 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.890
 original creative and what delivered that 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.180
 you particularly like 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.070
 yes there who can influence or the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.300
 acts and who you like in France 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.980
 honestly the first time that me 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.440
 love it's cloud cloud 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.790
 after I had the chance to start from 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.860
 an agency with 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.599
 original as alaric actually it's the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.420
 rim group has too much one and keeps them 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.579
 scores from within by a grand prize the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.990
 wine neither giovanni etc and cemac secularity 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.190
 hyper far 2004 yeah in these tests 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.770
 a long time ago but it was really very 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.290
 very far from it it will go forward and after 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.080
 no dear patrician that this dough 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.180
 who made me after that I'm playing 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.450
 honestly I'm inspired more of the 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.320
 classical dance of nature things 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.100
 to advance one's own mastery what 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.600
 today what you have ambition 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.770
 that there is an event that you would like 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:26.100
 do to really show tabata his 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.840
 originality of everything i want for 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.000
 the moment it remains six months it remains the 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.920
 mission one 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.200
 because it's you because we shoot 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.760
 but this battle that will do everything 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.560
 to know in the eyes of all this is the 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.000
 embroidery me the first understands nothing 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.040
 currently and I do not see others 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.040
 after there are beauties as he 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.670
 I always have these raids will leave 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.080
 that my goal 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.730
 after that you're fine because you discuss 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.190
 have a little word for the end to hold 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.390
 a souk and look for the new 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.900
 generation in fact I see I see 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.660
 a lot of us 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.729
 little flat who is starting to train a 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.460
 started just tell them to take a 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.610
 first time and not rushing to 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.490
 find his style all the time 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.750
 here is to find his personality drawing 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.910
 and why and why do you dance in 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.120
 it's not good to go 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.889
 heat mavs danced to do the 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.169
 beautiful and that's really finding why 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.850
 you do that and for what purpose your goal 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.560
 me when I started to donges had 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.130
 a goal in mind and I'm still going and 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.430
 that's it and it's really found the bottom 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.870
 of you is fine thank you 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.870
 because when you have worse
