00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
bottle cup and i guess i gave the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.109 
bottle cup and i guess i gave the
impression<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:24.199> the<00:00:25.460> bottle<00:00:26.460> cup<00:00:26.670> part<00:00:27.000> of

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
guess it gave the impression that it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.290 
guess it gave the impression that it
doesn't<00:00:35.070> work<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.550> any<00:00:36.110> alcohol<00:00:37.110> stoves<00:00:37.559> I

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
doesn't work with any alcohol stoves I

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.930 
doesn't work with any alcohol stoves I
guess<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.420> kind<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.809> showed<00:00:40.309> my<00:00:41.309> prejudice

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
guess I kind of showed my prejudice

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.619 
guess I kind of showed my prejudice
towards<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.600> Trangia<00:00:43.789> that<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.000> pot<00:00:45.239> stands

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
towards the Trangia that the pot stands

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.310 
towards the Trangia that the pot stands
for<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.020> won't<00:00:46.980> hold<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:48.050> they<00:00:49.050> made

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
for that won't hold it because they made

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.410 
for that won't hold it because they made
the<00:00:49.350> bow<00:00:49.739> at<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> bottom<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.940> little

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the bow at the bottom of this a little

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.240 
the bow at the bottom of this a little
bit<00:00:51.600> smaller<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.920> would<00:00:53.039> fit

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
bit smaller that it so that it would fit

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.450 
bit smaller that it so that it would fit
into<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.550> cup<00:00:53.879> holder<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.449> car<00:00:55.370> instead<00:00:56.370> of

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
into a cup holder in the car instead of

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.450 
into a cup holder in the car instead of
keeping<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.879> as<00:00:57.000> wide<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.500> at<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.829> top

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
keeping it as wide as it is at the top

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.179 
keeping it as wide as it is at the top

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
that's a good idea but kind of a waste

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.210 
that's a good idea but kind of a waste
what<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.530> do<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.890> put<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:01.650> other<00:03:02.120> top<00:03:03.120> on

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
what you can do is put the other top on

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.960 
what you can do is put the other top on
this<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.400> four<00:03:05.610> mugs<00:03:06.530> put<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.709> on<00:03:07.860> like<00:03:08.040> that

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.710 

insert<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.150> fire<00:03:12.390> sticks<00:03:13.549> in<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:15.150> holes<00:03:15.420> on

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
insert the fire sticks in the holes on

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.589 
insert the fire sticks in the holes on
the<00:03:15.750> side<00:03:20.150> like<00:03:21.150> so

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
the side like so

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.910 
the side like so
and<00:03:23.159> then<00:03:24.159> the<00:03:24.340> cup<00:03:25.290> can<00:03:26.290> go<00:03:26.469> in<00:03:26.620> just<00:03:26.799> like

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920
