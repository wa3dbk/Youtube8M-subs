00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
going to show here how I got these

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.490 
going to show here how I got these
so<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:41.149> tough<00:00:41.360> little<00:00:41.540> ship<00:00:41.840> requires<00:00:42.290> that

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
so the tough little ship requires that

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.790 
so the tough little ship requires that
you<00:00:42.620> have<00:00:42.969> you<00:00:43.969> get<00:00:44.210> your<00:00:44.690> ship<00:00:45.079> health<00:00:45.410> down

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
you have you get your ship health down

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.169 
you have you get your ship health down
until<00:00:46.429> only<00:00:46.670> one<00:00:46.879> HP<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:47.989> then<00:00:48.469> go<00:00:49.429> and<00:00:49.730> repair

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
until only one HP and then go and repair

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:54.389 
until only one HP and then go and repair
it<00:00:50.269> all<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.570> way<00:00:50.690> back<00:00:50.899> up<00:00:50.929> to<00:00:51.679> the<00:00:51.769> maximum<00:00:52.539> so

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
it all the way back up to the maximum so

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.279 
it all the way back up to the maximum so
this<00:00:55.399> could<00:00:55.670> just<00:00:55.819> come<00:00:56.059> out<00:00:56.210> by<00:00:56.390> chance<00:00:56.719> you

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
this could just come out by chance you

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.590 
this could just come out by chance you
could<00:00:57.499> just<00:00:57.739> just<00:00:58.730> save<00:00:58.969> yourself<00:00:59.359> in<00:00:59.539> the

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
could just just save yourself in the

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.689 
could just just save yourself in the
right<00:00:59.780> moment<00:01:00.019> destroy<00:01:00.679> the<00:01:00.800> ship<00:01:00.859> and<00:01:01.249> get<00:01:01.550> to

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
right moment destroy the ship and get to

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.790 
right moment destroy the ship and get to
a<00:01:01.730> store<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:02.210> repair<00:01:02.479> yourself<00:01:02.839> or<00:01:03.379> you<00:01:03.739> can

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
a store and repair yourself or you can

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.570 
a store and repair yourself or you can
just<00:01:04.070> plan<00:01:04.309> it<00:01:04.339> like<00:01:04.640> I<00:01:04.790> did<00:01:05.680> but<00:01:06.680> it's

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
just plan it like I did but it's

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.480 
just plan it like I did but it's
important<00:01:08.000> that<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.150> choose<00:01:08.510> your<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:10.280> ship

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
important that you choose your the ship

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.550 
important that you choose your the ship
that's<00:01:10.820> going<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.090> get<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:11.390> down<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.840> that<00:01:12.050> low

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
that's going to get you down to that low

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.280 
that's going to get you down to that low
HP<00:01:13.510> is<00:01:14.510> not<00:01:14.870> too<00:01:15.049> powerful<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:16.310> don't<00:01:17.110> it's<00:01:18.110> a

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
HP is not too powerful you don't it's a

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.179 
HP is not too powerful you don't it's a
really<00:01:18.969> the<00:01:19.969> uncontrollable<00:01:20.600> damage<00:01:21.229> because

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
really the uncontrollable damage because

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.819 
really the uncontrollable damage because
you<00:01:22.340> want<00:01:22.520> to<00:01:22.579> be<00:01:22.729> precise<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:23.780> get<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:24.649> down

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
you want to be precise and get it down

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.179 
you want to be precise and get it down
to<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.130> exact<00:01:25.549> one<00:01:25.880> HP<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:27.740> timing<00:01:28.130> is

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
to the exact one HP the timing is

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.719 
to the exact one HP the timing is
important<00:01:28.700> otherwise<00:01:30.310> that<00:01:31.310> whole<00:01:31.520> place

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
important otherwise that whole place

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:39.520 
important otherwise that whole place
would<00:01:32.119> have<00:01:32.240> been<00:01:32.390> for<00:01:32.990> nothing<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:37.960> as<00:01:38.960> you

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
would have been for nothing so as you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.130 
would have been for nothing so as you
can<00:01:39.619> see<00:01:39.829> here<00:01:40.070> I<00:01:40.189> got<00:01:40.700> him<00:01:40.729> down<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.180> three

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
can see here I got him down to three

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.349 
can see here I got him down to three
health<00:01:42.439> and<00:01:44.710> you'll<00:01:45.710> see<00:01:45.890> that<00:01:46.039> I<00:01:46.240> taught<00:01:47.240> him

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
health and you'll see that I taught him

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.029 
health and you'll see that I taught him
perfectly<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.899> get<00:01:48.079> him<00:01:48.229> down<00:01:48.409> to<00:01:48.619> one<00:01:48.770> health

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
perfectly to get him down to one health

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.960 
perfectly to get him down to one health

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.180 

such<00:01:54.970> as<00:01:55.120> repair<00:01:55.540> any<00:01:56.170> systems<00:01:56.710> that<00:01:56.980> get

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
such as repair any systems that get

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.690 
such as repair any systems that get
damaged<00:01:57.900> though<00:01:58.900> obviously<00:01:59.560> will<00:01:59.770> especially

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
damaged though obviously will especially

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:20.120 
damaged though obviously will especially
life<00:02:01.090> support<00:02:01.510> you<00:02:01.600> know<00:02:01.720> what<00:02:01.870> that<00:02:02.050> failing

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.970 

and<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:22.750> important<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.470> choose<00:02:23.740> a

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
and it's important that you choose a

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.780 
and it's important that you choose a
beacon<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.790> has<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.530> as<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.770> kind<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.250> enemy

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
beacon that has a as this kind of enemy

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.350 
beacon that has a as this kind of enemy
near<00:02:28.540> store<00:02:28.959> beacon<00:02:29.650> because<00:02:30.160> otherwise<00:02:30.940> you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
near store beacon because otherwise you

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.890 
near store beacon because otherwise you
could<00:02:31.540> go<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.700> beacon<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.209> was<00:02:34.480> far<00:02:34.780> away

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
could go to a beacon that was far away

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.199 
could go to a beacon that was far away
from<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.350> store<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.920> there's<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:36.940> good<00:02:37.150> chance

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
from the store and there's a good chance

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.570 
from the store and there's a good chance
that<00:02:37.540> on<00:02:37.870> your<00:02:38.140> way<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.320> that<00:02:38.560> store<00:02:38.890> or<00:02:39.310> then

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
that on your way to that store or then

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.510 
that on your way to that store or then
you<00:02:39.700> get<00:02:39.880> encounter<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.540> young<00:02:41.130> another<00:02:42.130> enemy

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
you get encounter a young another enemy

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.690 
you get encounter a young another enemy
and<00:02:42.730> they<00:02:42.820> could<00:02:42.970> destroy<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.360> very<00:02:43.690> easily

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
and they could destroy you very easily

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.840 
and they could destroy you very easily
so<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:46.060> paused<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.690> right<00:02:46.840> then<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.670> already<00:02:48.670> had

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
so I paused it right then I already had

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
so I paused it right then I already had
my<00:02:48.880> laser<00:02:50.130> charged<00:02:51.130> up<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.730> just<00:02:52.239> discharged

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
my laser charged up and just discharged

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.759 
my laser charged up and just discharged
it<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.470> they<00:02:53.950> gone<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.930> course<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.560> see

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
it and they gone and of course you see

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.680 
it and they gone and of course you see
they're<00:02:56.980> very<00:02:57.220> close<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:57.940> store

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
they're very close to a store

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:08.210 
they're very close to a store
I<00:03:00.420> jumped<00:03:01.420> there<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:02.220> fix<00:03:03.220> all<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.750> there<00:03:05.140> we<00:03:05.230> go

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.530 

so<00:03:09.220> this<00:03:09.610> is<00:03:09.820> for<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.239> full<00:03:10.750> arsenal<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:13.209> it

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
so this is for the full arsenal and it

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.930 
so this is for the full arsenal and it
requires<00:03:13.870> they<00:03:14.080> have<00:03:14.320> all<00:03:14.670> systems<00:03:15.670> on<00:03:15.820> the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
requires they have all systems on the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.229 
requires they have all systems on the
control<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:17.410> you<00:03:17.470> can<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.580> that's<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.970> drone

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
control that you can so that's the drone

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.190 
control that you can so that's the drone
control<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:21.190> crew<00:03:21.430> teleporter<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.570> the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
control the crew teleporter and the

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.789 
control the crew teleporter and the
cloaking<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:24.610> about<00:03:25.600> you<00:03:26.230> have<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.500> get<00:03:26.650> those

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
cloaking so about you have to get those

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.759 
cloaking so about you have to get those
from<00:03:27.070> stores<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:29.080> really<00:03:29.260> requires<00:03:29.620> that

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
from stores and it really requires that

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.270 
from stores and it really requires that
you<00:03:29.860> be<00:03:29.920> smart<00:03:30.250> with<00:03:30.459> your<00:03:30.549> scrap<00:03:30.880> so<00:03:31.600> not

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
you be smart with your scrap so not

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
buying any very expensive items and and

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.070 
buying any very expensive items and and
also<00:03:38.799> like<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:39.400> should<00:03:39.670> be<00:03:39.850> on<00:03:39.880> very<00:03:40.630> smart
