tease their piccola slope so you have to

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.760 
tease their piccola slope so you have to
keep<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:16.050> in<00:03:16.200> mind<00:03:16.380> oh<00:03:17.510> my<00:03:18.510> wall<00:03:18.750> it's<00:03:19.740> a

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
there I can't hit him though because

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.010 
there I can't hit him though because
they're<00:03:23.910> behind<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.209> stupid<00:03:24.540> head<00:03:24.660> leave<00:03:24.900> up

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
they're behind the stupid head leave up

around<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.440> airfield<00:03:28.890> lights<00:03:29.700> let<00:03:29.910> me<00:03:30.000> finish

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
around the airfield lights let me finish

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.420 
around the airfield lights let me finish
off<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.600> Archon<00:03:30.990> even<00:03:31.170> hinting<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.310> is

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
off the Archon even hinting and it is

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.250 
off the Archon even hinting and it is
too<00:03:32.610> risky<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:33.030> think<00:03:33.120> I'm<00:03:33.630> going<00:03:33.810> all<00:03:34.020> the<00:03:34.140> way

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
too risky I think I'm going all the way

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.910 
too risky I think I'm going all the way
around<00:03:34.320> because<00:03:35.330> yeah<00:03:36.330> just<00:03:36.630> just<00:03:36.930> hold<00:03:37.680> on

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
around because yeah just just hold on

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.670 
around because yeah just just hold on
huh<00:03:38.430> think<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.540> can<00:03:39.720> do<00:03:39.840> that<00:03:39.870> because<00:03:40.290> the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
huh think I can do that because the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.190 
huh think I can do that because the
middle<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:41.130> in<00:03:41.340> our<00:03:41.459> hands<00:03:41.810> I'll<00:03:42.810> just<00:03:43.020> solve

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
middle is in our hands I'll just solve

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.630 
middle is in our hands I'll just solve
how<00:03:43.380> we<00:03:43.440> get<00:03:43.680> into<00:03:43.830> this<00:03:43.920> thing<00:03:44.130> again<00:03:44.370> by<00:03:44.580> the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
how we get into this thing again by the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.370 
how we get into this thing again by the
way<00:03:44.700> how<00:03:45.030> do<00:03:45.090> we<00:03:45.180> get<00:03:45.270> into<00:03:45.540> like<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.840> five-man

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
way how do we get into like a five-man

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.949 
way how do we get into like a five-man
