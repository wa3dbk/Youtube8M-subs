00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
of that they're going to be doing a lot

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.799 
of that they're going to be doing a lot
of<00:00:35.640> damage<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.180> because<00:00:36.390> they<00:00:36.570> begin

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
of damage just because they begin

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.869 
of damage just because they begin
spawning<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.500> there<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:38.190> becomes<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.610> spawn

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
spawning in there it becomes a spawn

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.340 
spawning in there it becomes a spawn
point<00:00:39.180> as<00:00:39.329> soon<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.629> they<00:00:39.719> get<00:00:39.840> somebody<00:00:40.200> in

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
point as soon as they get somebody in

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.260 
point as soon as they get somebody in
there<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:41.879> got<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.120> watch<00:00:42.210> that

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
there so you really got to watch that

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.040 
there so you really got to watch that
one<00:00:42.629> bunker<00:00:43.399> fortunately<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.750> mostly<00:00:45.750> open

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
one bunker fortunately it is mostly open

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.319 
one bunker fortunately it is mostly open
on<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.770> its<00:00:47.070> top<00:00:47.280> see<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.120> hit<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.300> with

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
on it on its top see if you hit it with

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.880 
on it on its top see if you hit it with
a<00:00:48.450> mortar<00:00:48.780> strike<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.230> missile<00:00:49.500> strike<00:00:49.739> or

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
a mortar strike or missile strike or

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.100 
a mortar strike or missile strike or
some<00:00:50.039> sort<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.340> offensive<00:00:51.239> support<00:00:51.570> action

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
some sort of offensive support action

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.840 
some sort of offensive support action
you'll<00:00:52.379> probably<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.860> couple<00:00:53.129> kills<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
you'll probably get a couple kills and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.270 
you'll probably get a couple kills and
stop<00:00:54.059> them<00:00:54.239> from<00:00:54.270> spawning<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.989> there<00:00:55.280> and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
stop them from spawning in there and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.790 
stop them from spawning in there and
here<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.670> failed<00:00:57.210> take<00:00:57.570> out<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.930> last<00:00:58.140> guy<00:00:58.469> and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
first part of this i recommend doing

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.830 
first part of this i recommend doing
that<00:01:06.330> before<00:01:06.600> continuing<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.470> one

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
that before continuing with this one

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.270 
that before continuing with this one
just<00:01:09.840> because<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.260> won't<00:01:10.409> know<00:01:11.010> what

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
just because you won't know what

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.870 
just because you won't know what
happened<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> first<00:01:12.000> part<00:01:13.460> but<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.760> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
happened in the first part but if you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.280 
happened in the first part but if you
already<00:01:14.970> saw<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> part<00:01:15.540> continue<00:01:16.080> watching

already saw that part continue watching

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.020 
already saw that part continue watching
because<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.220> game<00:01:17.400> played<00:01:17.610> gets<00:01:17.790> pretty

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
because the game played gets pretty

which I felt was was hateful or hurtful
I<00:04:01.109> wouldn't<00:04:01.829> I<00:04:02.010> wouldn't<00:04:02.040> want<00:04:02.489> that<00:04:02.579> to

let's<00:04:11.100> get<00:04:11.190> back<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.549> gameplay<00:04:11.730> right

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
let's get back to the gameplay right

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.000 
let's get back to the gameplay right
that<00:04:12.600> right<00:04:12.750> there<00:04:12.930> was<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.170> fourth<00:04:13.799> point

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
that right there was the fourth point

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.940 
that right there was the fourth point
it's<00:04:14.340> another<00:04:15.239> roadblock<00:04:15.540> armed<00:04:16.079> with<00:04:16.350> c4<00:04:17.150> and

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
it's another roadblock armed with c4 and

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.860 
it's another roadblock armed with c4 and
it<00:04:19.950> this<00:04:20.640> point<00:04:20.760> usually<00:04:21.209> turns<00:04:21.570> into<00:04:21.780> a

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
it this point usually turns into a

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.260 
it this point usually turns into a
pretty<00:04:22.140> nice<00:04:22.320> little<00:04:22.650> stand<00:04:22.919> off<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.490> boat

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
pretty nice little stand off the boat

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.460 
pretty nice little stand off the boat
the<00:04:24.390> defending<00:04:24.810> team

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
the defending team

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.810 
the defending team
the<00:04:25.560> attacking<00:04:25.800> team<00:04:25.950> have<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.280> lot<00:04:26.550> of<00:04:26.580> cover

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
the attacking team have a lot of cover

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.460 
the attacking team have a lot of cover
and<00:04:27.260> a<00:04:28.820> lot<00:04:29.820> of<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:30.330> lot<00:04:30.690> of<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:30.930> field<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.290> play

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
and a lot of a lot of the field to play

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.800 
and a lot of a lot of the field to play
with<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:31.920> they<00:04:32.700> can<00:04:32.820> get<00:04:32.910> pretty<00:04:33.120> wild<00:04:33.360> with

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
with and they can get pretty wild with

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.050 
with and they can get pretty wild with
support<00:04:34.170> actions<00:04:34.560> in<00:04:35.160> this<00:04:35.520> portion<00:04:35.790> of<00:04:36.000> the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
support actions in this portion of the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.840 
support actions in this portion of the
map<00:04:36.240> just<00:04:37.250> because<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.430> attacking<00:04:38.700> team

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
map just because the attacking team

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.060 
map just because the attacking team
usually<00:04:39.120> stands<00:04:39.720> on<00:04:39.870> outside<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:40.890> outer

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
usually stands on outside of the outer

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.430 
usually stands on outside of the outer
wall<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:42.140> defending<00:04:43.140> team<00:04:43.260> usually

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
wall and the defending team usually

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.420 
wall and the defending team usually
stands<00:04:43.860> right<00:04:44.250> inside<00:04:44.760> of<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.290> so<00:04:46.290> if<00:04:47.250> you<00:04:47.340> have

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
stands right inside of it so if you have

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.100 
stands right inside of it so if you have
a<00:04:47.490> support<00:04:47.730> action<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.210> can<00:04:48.390> get<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:48.930> lot<00:04:49.080> of

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
a support action you can get a lot of

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.280 
a support action you can get a lot of
kills<00:04:50.030> so<00:04:51.030> they<00:04:51.210> took<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.540> fourth<00:04:51.780> point<00:04:52.020> and

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
kills so they took the fourth point and

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.510 
kills so they took the fourth point and
now<00:04:52.590> we're<00:04:52.800> at<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:53.010> fifth<00:04:53.220> point<00:04:54.290> which<00:04:55.290> is

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
now we're at the fifth point which is

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.800 
now we're at the fifth point which is
they<00:04:56.520> have<00:04:56.670> to<00:04:56.790> get<00:04:56.880> into<00:04:57.120> this<00:04:57.240> building<00:04:57.660> and

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
they have to get into this building and

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.590 
they have to get into this building and
get<00:04:57.930> on<00:04:58.020> to<00:04:58.170> the<00:04:58.230> second<00:04:58.560> floor<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.600> detonate

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
get on to the second floor and detonate

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.600 
get on to the second floor and detonate
a<00:05:00.960> charge<00:05:01.800> on<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.700> an<00:05:03.390> anti<00:05:03.780> air<00:05:03.960> gun<00:05:04.200> and<00:05:04.610> once

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
a charge on a an anti air gun and once

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.130 
a charge on a an anti air gun and once
they<00:05:05.760> do<00:05:05.820> that<00:05:06.090> then<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.420> match<00:05:06.570> is<00:05:06.750> over<00:05:06.870> and

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
they do that then the match is over and

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.660 
they do that then the match is over and
they<00:05:07.260> win<00:05:09.860> but<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:10.950> thing<00:05:11.070> about<00:05:11.100> this<00:05:11.400> point

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
they win but the thing about this point

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.760 
they win but the thing about this point
is<00:05:11.910> that<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.390> the<00:05:12.420> fifth<00:05:12.900> point<00:05:13.080> is<00:05:13.350> right

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
is that the the fifth point is right

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.130 
is that the the fifth point is right
outside<00:05:14.100> like<00:05:14.700> immediately<00:05:15.210> outside<00:05:15.510> of<00:05:15.930> the

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
outside like immediately outside of the

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.700 
outside like immediately outside of the
defending<00:05:16.650> team<00:05:16.800> spawn<00:05:17.190> so<00:05:17.930> if<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.440> attacking

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
defending team spawn so if the attacking

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.650 
defending team spawn so if the attacking
team<00:05:19.860> is<00:05:20.100> good<00:05:20.310> and<00:05:20.490> you're<00:05:21.090> on<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.300> defending

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
team is good and you're on the defending

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.630 
team is good and you're on the defending
team<00:05:21.780> you<00:05:22.320> might<00:05:22.530> get<00:05:22.680> spawn<00:05:22.950> trapped<00:05:23.310> pretty

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
team you might get spawn trapped pretty

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.850 
team you might get spawn trapped pretty
hard<00:05:23.850> so<00:05:24.660> it's<00:05:25.020> important<00:05:25.380> to<00:05:25.470> know<00:05:25.650> that

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
hard so it's important to know that

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.470 
hard so it's important to know that
there<00:05:26.010> are<00:05:26.040> some<00:05:26.400> spots<00:05:26.640> like<00:05:26.970> this<00:05:27.120> one<00:05:27.330> right

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
there are some spots like this one right

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.500 
there are some spots like this one right
here<00:05:27.540> where<00:05:28.169> you<00:05:28.410> can<00:05:28.910> kind<00:05:29.910> of<00:05:30.060> hold<00:05:30.180> them<00:05:30.360> off

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
here where you can kind of hold them off

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.760 
here where you can kind of hold them off
and<00:05:31.760> prevent<00:05:32.760> them<00:05:32.880> from<00:05:32.940> being<00:05:33.660> able<00:05:33.960> to<00:05:34.050> take

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
and prevent them from being able to take

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.990 
and prevent them from being able to take
that<00:05:34.800> point<00:05:35.160> because<00:05:35.310> you<00:05:35.520> can<00:05:35.669> actually<00:05:35.700> see

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
that point because you can actually see

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.770 
that point because you can actually see
that<00:05:36.990> final<00:05:37.440> point<00:05:37.680> from<00:05:37.860> here<00:05:38.100> and<00:05:38.280> and<00:05:38.780> shoot

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
that final point from here and and shoot

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.350 
that final point from here and and shoot
people<00:05:40.020> who<00:05:40.290> are<00:05:40.620> trying<00:05:40.650> to<00:05:41.070> arm<00:05:41.190> it<00:05:41.370> so

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
people who are trying to arm it so

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.930 
people who are trying to arm it so
that's<00:05:42.540> useful<00:05:43.490> something<00:05:44.490> I<00:05:44.580> don't<00:05:44.850> like

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
that's useful something I don't like

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.090 
that's useful something I don't like
about<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:45.630> beta<00:05:45.810> so<00:05:46.050> far<00:05:46.260> especially<00:05:46.650> this

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
about the beta so far especially this

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.680 
about the beta so far especially this
mode<00:05:47.340> is<00:05:47.550> that<00:05:47.850> certain<00:05:48.780> parts<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.380> level<00:05:49.650> are

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
mode is that certain parts the level are

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.360 
mode is that certain parts the level are
have<00:05:51.690> invisible<00:05:52.020> barriers<00:05:52.650> which<00:05:52.890> you<00:05:53.070> can't

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
have invisible barriers which you can't

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.120 
have invisible barriers which you can't
get<00:05:53.850> past<00:05:54.140> right<00:05:55.140> here<00:05:55.350> I<00:05:55.380> should<00:05:55.530> be<00:05:55.890> able<00:05:55.979> to

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
get past right here I should be able to

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.290 
get past right here I should be able to
get<00:05:56.250> on<00:05:56.340> top<00:05:56.490> of<00:05:56.550> this<00:05:56.669> building<00:05:56.940> because

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
get on top of this building because

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.730 
get on top of this building because
there's<00:05:57.630> a<00:05:57.690> building<00:05:58.080> just<00:05:58.380> down<00:05:58.470> the<00:05:58.710> way

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
there's a building just down the way

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.490 
there's a building just down the way
which<00:05:59.450> you<00:06:00.450> can<00:06:00.570> actually<00:06:00.870> get<00:06:00.960> on<00:06:01.080> top<00:06:01.290> of

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
which you can actually get on top of

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.620 
which you can actually get on top of
which<00:06:02.070> has<00:06:02.310> basically<00:06:02.760> the<00:06:03.000> same<00:06:03.180> layout<00:06:03.479> as

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
which has basically the same layout as

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.170 
which has basically the same layout as
this<00:06:03.930> one<00:06:04.140> but<00:06:04.430> for<00:06:05.430> some<00:06:05.640> reason<00:06:06.060> you<00:06:06.150> can't

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
this one but for some reason you can't

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.630 
this one but for some reason you can't
get<00:06:06.570> on<00:06:07.010> immediately<00:06:08.010> on<00:06:08.220> top<00:06:08.430> of<00:06:08.580> that

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
get on immediately on top of that

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.190 
get on immediately on top of that
building<00:06:09.470> so<00:06:10.470> I<00:06:10.830> i<00:06:11.690> know<00:06:12.690> that's<00:06:12.960> a<00:06:13.020> game

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
building so I i know that's a game

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.050 
building so I i know that's a game
design<00:06:13.500> decision<00:06:13.950> on<00:06:14.100> the<00:06:14.190> part<00:06:14.220> of<00:06:14.430> dice<00:06:14.640> but

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
design decision on the part of dice but

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.550 
design decision on the part of dice but
I<00:06:15.270> hope<00:06:15.450> that<00:06:15.600> they<00:06:15.750> change<00:06:16.020> that<00:06:16.260> just

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
I hope that they change that just

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.000 
I hope that they change that just
because<00:06:16.860> I<00:06:18.020> don't<00:06:19.020> know<00:06:19.200> I<00:06:19.229> just<00:06:19.410> feel<00:06:19.890> like

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
because I don't know I just feel like

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.680 
because I don't know I just feel like
it's<00:06:20.250> such<00:06:20.370> an<00:06:20.520> artificial<00:06:21.030> barrier<00:06:21.360> to<00:06:21.540> put

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
it's such an artificial barrier to put

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.280 
it's such an artificial barrier to put
in<00:06:21.780> the<00:06:21.870> game<00:06:22.610> but<00:06:23.610> yeah<00:06:23.760> anyway<00:06:24.180> we<00:06:24.540> depleted

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
in the game but yeah anyway we depleted

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.380 
in the game but yeah anyway we depleted
the<00:06:25.470> enemy<00:06:25.710> teams<00:06:25.890> tickets<00:06:26.280> and<00:06:26.490> as<00:06:27.180> a<00:06:27.210> result

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
the enemy teams tickets and as a result

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.900 
the enemy teams tickets and as a result
we<00:06:27.750> won<00:06:28.050> so<00:06:28.620> you<00:06:28.680> get<00:06:28.830> this<00:06:28.950> slice<00:06:29.220> nice<00:06:29.700> little

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
we won so you get this slice nice little

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.770 
we won so you get this slice nice little
cinema<00:06:30.500> very<00:06:31.500> cinematic<00:06:32.599> where<00:06:33.599> the
