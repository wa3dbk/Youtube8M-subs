00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
that the system has not hung up and it

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.620 
that the system has not hung up and it
seems<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.880> work<00:00:27.150> pretty<00:00:27.480> goddamn<00:00:27.960> fine<00:00:28.199> so

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
seems to work pretty goddamn fine so

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.040 
seems to work pretty goddamn fine so
it's<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.810> bit<00:00:30.840> hot<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.099> cpu<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:34.579> yeah<00:00:36.050> that

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it's a bit hot on the cpu but yeah that

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.420 
it's a bit hot on the cpu but yeah that
will<00:00:37.649> work<00:00:37.730> fine<00:00:39.200> it<00:00:40.200> doesn't<00:00:40.260> go<00:00:40.680> over<00:00:41.040> 80

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
will work fine it doesn't go over 80

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.479 
will work fine it doesn't go over 80
degrees<00:00:43.640> although<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.940> rises<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.200> don't<00:00:46.920> know

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
degrees although it rises I don't know

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.180 
degrees although it rises I don't know
how<00:00:47.820> far<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.450> will<00:00:48.600> rise<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:51.649> am<00:00:52.649> fairly

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
how far it will rise but I am fairly

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.260 
how far it will rise but I am fairly

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
this cooler over here it is stock one

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.420 
this cooler over here it is stock one
that<00:01:00.870> came<00:01:01.050> out<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:02.930> 31<00:01:03.930> also<00:01:04.760> but<00:01:05.760> stop

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430

installed today opening this case isn't
the<00:01:21.659> easiest<00:01:21.900> thing<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.340> hand<00:01:26.180> so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180

the<00:01:31.670> graphics<00:01:32.660> card<00:01:33.020> seems<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.530> be<00:01:33.680> fooled<00:01:34.220> and

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
the graphics card seems to be fooled and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.770 
the graphics card seems to be fooled and
happy<00:01:35.560> now<00:01:36.560> here<00:01:36.890> we<00:01:37.010> got<00:01:37.160> a<00:01:37.190> fan<00:01:37.460> blowing<00:01:37.780> cool

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
air and I will try to make a wire for

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.560 
air and I will try to make a wire for
that<00:01:43.250> over<00:01:44.150> here<00:01:44.740> also<00:01:45.740> i<00:01:45.770> will<00:01:46.310> talk<00:01:46.670> away<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
that over here also i will talk away the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.780 
that over here also i will talk away the
power<00:01:48.080> cable<00:01:48.680> behind<00:01:49.160> of<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.700> cpu<00:01:50.120> cooler<00:01:51.790> so

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
power cable behind of the cpu cooler so

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.020 
power cable behind of the cpu cooler so
i<00:01:52.850> will<00:01:53.000> have<00:01:53.300> this<00:01:53.540> i'm<00:01:53.870> going<00:01:53.900> slowly<00:01:54.560> and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
i will have this i'm going slowly and

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.440 
i will have this i'm going slowly and
deposed<00:01:56.030> by<00:01:56.360> sucking<00:01:56.780> out<00:01:56.900> of<00:01:57.140> there<00:01:58.450> this

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
deposed by sucking out of there this

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.320 
deposed by sucking out of there this
will<00:02:00.050> dramatically<00:02:00.740> decrease<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.030> sound

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
will dramatically decrease the sound

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.490 
will dramatically decrease the sound
level<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.960> this<00:02:03.140> computer<00:02:04.869> it<00:02:05.869> made<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:06.170> huge

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
level of this computer it made a huge

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.210 
level of this computer it made a huge
difference<00:02:09.910> The<00:02:10.910> Sun<00:02:11.150> has<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:12.110> 4-pin<00:02:13.010> connector

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
difference The Sun has a 4-pin connector

the zelmans before I had one before it
was<00:02:21.560> crap<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.220> hope<00:02:22.640> this<00:02:22.910> cooler<00:02:23.330> is<00:02:23.450> better

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
was crap I hope this cooler is better

Waterstone<00:03:09.320> here<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:09.980> ODIs<00:03:10.640> does<00:03:10.880> not<00:03:11.120> seem

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
Waterstone here and ODIs does not seem

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.170 
Waterstone here and ODIs does not seem
to<00:03:11.540> affect<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.930> temperature<00:03:12.380> too<00:03:12.830> much<00:03:13.180> it

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
to affect the temperature too much it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.930 
to affect the temperature too much it
has<00:03:14.390> actually<00:03:15.260> gone<00:03:15.500> down<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:15.950> degree<00:03:16.459> when<00:03:16.910> I

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
has actually gone down a degree when I

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.570 
has actually gone down a degree when I
open<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.480> case<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:19.310> GPU<00:03:19.790> is<00:03:19.820> 51<00:03:20.570> degrees

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
open the case and the GPU is 51 degrees

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.170 
open the case and the GPU is 51 degrees
that<00:03:22.580> can<00:03:22.790> do<00:03:22.910> all<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.600> way<00:03:23.750> up<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.370> 71<00:03:25.370> my

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
that can do all the way up to 71 my

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.580 
that can do all the way up to 71 my
things<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:29.360> test<00:03:29.630> seems<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.080> be<00:03:30.170> taking

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
things and the test seems to be taking

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.410 
things and the test seems to be taking
along<00:03:30.890> pretty<00:03:31.730> well<00:03:31.880> I'm<00:03:32.120> fine<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:32.720> yeah<00:03:34.420> this

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
along pretty well I'm fine so yeah this

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.539 
along pretty well I'm fine so yeah this
is<00:03:35.630> pretty<00:03:35.840> good<00:03:36.410> for<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.830> trash<00:03:37.190> picked

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
is pretty good for a trash picked

video when I asked about this so here I
will<00:04:21.799> get<00:04:22.370> a<00:04:22.660> ide<00:04:23.660> cable<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.530> is<00:04:24.560> round<00:04:25.220> and

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
will get a ide cable that is round and

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.000 
will get a ide cable that is round and
probably<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.110> moody<00:04:27.500> see<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.740> ramp<00:04:27.980> up<00:04:28.190> a<00:04:28.370> notch
