 seconds to coda takeoff 99 people 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:38.690
 one of them died on the ground and

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.360

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:51.169
 of course a lot of images 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.330
 of a lot of fire now live here we 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.690

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.699
 in front of the house where the airplane fell fell 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.009
 here in the wreckage is an image 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.110
 impressive 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.120
 the wreckage 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.100
 the aeronautical experts are already 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.190
 making the first inspections to 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.500
 try to find out the causes of the accident 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.660
 the first version was that the airplane 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.720
 would have fallen due to lack of fuel 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.580
 this version was overthrown because both 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.820
 here in the house how much the street was 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.650
 found a lot of fuel is a 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.090
 really impressive image of 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.130
 according to aeronautics 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.620
 in an hour and a half or so 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:34.700
 these debris must be removed 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:37.580
 It will certainly be a very difficult night. 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.880
 for all the residents of this street Ana
