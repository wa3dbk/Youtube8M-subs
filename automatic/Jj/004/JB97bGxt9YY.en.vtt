 from rehearse guitar fight and song 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.810

 then faster and then at a normal pace 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.480
 We recommend starting the song as follows. 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.689
 first take a chord g 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:03:02.020
 setting the key and then start 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:03:04.390
