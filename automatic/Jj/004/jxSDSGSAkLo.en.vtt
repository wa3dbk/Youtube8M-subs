00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.370
 mansarÃ© miss was good I hope 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.020
 that you will do in any case me I 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.670
 lai to comment on this new video 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.050
 so we find ourselves once again on 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.150
 call of duty kid so I take 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.040
 naked company hi to you that's him 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.330
 authorizes the commands to tune me that 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.260
 I'm very happy I hope you have the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.460
 form 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.840
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.100
 little tutorial I really hope he'll help you 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.480
 will be useful in any case I think so 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.029
 because frankly there is a lot of trouble 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.470
 both of them so that's a tutorial so 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.119
 simple it dates a tutorial for points 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.320
 squats I'll let you speak the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.750
 crate to introduce a little bit the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.040
 video ok so already for all those who 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.450
 not know what it is necessarily ben 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.980
 the squats points which is all to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.090
 understandable since this is the game 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.100
 has not been released since 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.480
 long actually squats points 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.980
 it's just sort of 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.300
 points that you're going to accumulate finally from 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.469
 anyway it's his scissors that's going 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.300
 explain it a little bit later 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.379
 but in May in short the points 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.840
 of squad in fact it's just fine 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.420
 serve you to unlock for example a 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.010
 accessory a weapon an asset to anyone 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.770
 what time as long as you have the sum 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.879
 of escwa points required for that 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.559
 you want to unlock ie 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.090
 for example if there is an asset that you 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.980
 interested and only unlock it 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.199
 level told that your level 10 and 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.970
 that it is required simply with 5 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.040
 squad points if you have precisely 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.540
 a balance of 5 squats points you 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.340
 can simply use these 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.020
 five points to unlock the cough or 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.340
 for example I do not know a weapon etc 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.930
 so I think you followed me 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.790
 after my season, I give you the floor 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.470
 simply for the rest so for 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.330
 the method is quite simple enough 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.860
 simply go to the play menu 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.860
 line of call of duty kids you go 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.150
 in the operation box and in this 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.770
 hourly box just full of small 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.420
 challenges that will be proposed to you for 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.650
 earn xp so it will be very 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.600
 important for the squad points 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.009
 is also at the level of the challenges 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.409
 that the way you go them 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.759
 realize you will have a number of 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.530
 squad points or in there it's 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.729
 really what you are looking for 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.470
 in a way and so that's so 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.930
 it's nice enough we can take the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.490
 first challenge is to destroy 20 good-byes 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.680
 series of enemy eliminations in 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.970
 using invisible has therefore yielded challenges 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.530
 which are relatively simple 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.119
 so when you get it to 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.240
 give you 500 xp as we can 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.060
 see on the screen so 500 xp that will do 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.380
 a little extra for a high level admits 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.969
 be aware that at each level not this 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.700
 game you will have a little bonus at the level 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.409
 squad wounds and you will also have 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.750
 finally suffered if the mission will be successful 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.770
 you will have a number of points 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.660
 more squad so it's really 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.000
 everything for you will have 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.200
 an ease to pass your levels you 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.280
 will also have a facility for your 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.480
 classes you will have more choices 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.890
 economic you will have more points 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.390
 squad and so here is so nac and throw 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.680
 the relay of speech if you like this 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.960
 something to say for the end of the video 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.510
 ok so me just for a little bit 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.100
 complement what scissors said 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.650
 in fact as you can see me 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.210
 precisely its screen we have five challenges to 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.220
 me nobody dropped on the page I have five 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.590
 challenges and once you're done 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.060
 precisely the five challenges to continue 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.010
 to gain points and this quad or so 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.450
 of the xp you have the option square or 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.460
 so the x box button I remember 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.020
 no more is there on the screen you 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.370
 confirmed poster buying news 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.500
 operations ie you're going 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.630
 spend 1 point squats for 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.850
 just to regain full for 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.230

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.610

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.320

 of squad other challenges all 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.890
