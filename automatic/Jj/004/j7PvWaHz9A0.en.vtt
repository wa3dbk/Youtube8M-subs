00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:10.370
 say something say hello and 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:15.080
 I don’t give Pasha even I am ill 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:19.470
 crash this movie about laryngitis 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.359
 which can grow into croup I want 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.490
 take it off and tell him about what 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:30.240
 how do we treat a child with laryngitis 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.760
 what is it and how is it dangerous here 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.690
 laryngitis is when inflamed in a child 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.899
 larynx mucous larynx here and here 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.559
 goes to the club if 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:51.590
 a lot of mucus accumulates here and 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:54.660
 no matter how much it swells 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.570
 inflamed by vocal cords 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.500
 larynx here and then about almost 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.590
 is lost 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.409
 child's voice and may suffocate 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.150
 and even this happens often at night 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.610
 when the bond accumulates stagnates 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.040
 like because the baby lies here they are 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.409
 moves does not fail practical and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.930
 so in fact it is very dangerous 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.979
 the disease is a viral infection which 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.250
 affects the larynx here and in this disease 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.200
 of course if you are not sure better with 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.240
 child to be in the hospital especially if 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.670
 small so baby it's without 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.900
 here are the questions 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.240
 either under very tight control by doctors 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:42.149
 here we are here sonny 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.369
 five years ago when there was another such 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.430
 we had a child about a year 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.899
 three here we coped at home in both 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.340
 cases, although we were offered to go to 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.100
 hospital, we know that I think all the same 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.229
 better than hospitals and looked through 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.340
 We knew certain videos on this subject. 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.069
 how to behave correctly so the test 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.740
 with this viral infection high 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.470
 temperature under 40 approximately there but 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.269
 basically 39 5 so that's what we 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:15.720
 but we do it first of all 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:19.049
 we are well ventilate the room to 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.360
 the air was moist cool and clean 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.930
 then the child breathes easier and 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.940
 but it helps him to carry laryngitis 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.280
 here secondly for the night we confuse him 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.940
 very well that is, we dress him in 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.340
 cotton clothes slope for Pajamas we put on 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.140
 three blanket but before that and its very 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.450
 understood very well that is a lot 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.090
 fluid so that he was what he was 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.700
 sweat here and due to this sbera and 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.859
 straying itself temperature in 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.320
 time 3 we touch his forehead we measure 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:55.880
 temperatuk here if necessary 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.220
 if the temperature rises above and 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.700
 you need to beat and faster too 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.310
 trying to do without drugs and 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.190
 we make herbal tea for which he drinks 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.580
 here is especially on the night my reservoir here 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.050
 recipe for herbal tea from which the collection is made 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.070
 herbs in my other video you can 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.320
 look here about it and so here we are 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.440
 we bring down the temperature of the child very 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.270
 high if very very high but 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.040
 Then of course we use Nurofen 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.500
 there is this if that's growing and all 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.030
 but so far we managed to shoot her down 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.490
 By this method, the temperature market is about 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.320
 rests and well that is for the morning 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.590
 almost no temperature or very 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.030
 small but we force a lot 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.500
 drink but how do we force our children 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.030
 make it not necessary but 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.320
 after all, that is, we insist that 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.270
 the baby drank a lot 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.790
 this is very important not to be 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.960
 dehydration and so on like prefect 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.580
 as prevention, we give it glucose 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.250
 ampoule once a day i ship at high 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.880
 temperature in order not to appear 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.830
 acetone 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.420
 and not to go with him to the hospital 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.800
 because of this acetone is also procedural 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.080
 tell me in a separate video there 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.020
 desire to see what it is this 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.010
 It is also a very dangerous thing in the disease's 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.110
 make a man from a headache 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.640
 which are from the uterus a little bit Hypericum and 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.890
 you can throw a daisy 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.470
 here he drinks it when he wants practically 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:23.320
 all day he drinks this tea help 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.320
 very much with a headache here and 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.510
 the most dangerous period this night of course 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.780
 because the fluid stagnates rather 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.820
 phlegm and of course and wheezing baby and 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.180
 scary 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.890
 hear these wheezing here are struggling with 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.980
 wanting to get up and do something quickly 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.900
 Anything I understand what to do here 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.420
 practically nothing is possible 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.520
 the only moment is also suddenly you 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.360
 ill with laryngitis and which 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.000
 grow into a circle in the night 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.460
 the baby will start choking here and the ambulance 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.900
 there is still going a but it’s like the last 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.540
 case here we had such moments 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.440
 who were with whooping cough 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.210
 Here we just took the child right in the winter 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.980
 buying a woo in a blanket and carrying it out 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.010
 opened the door wide open and so 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:18.130
 way saved so to speak from choking 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.560
 the child is very strong 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.140
 effective image method helps 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.770
 But if suddenly you happen such 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:29.370
 the situation is of course necessary 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.800
 quickly here you open the door wide and 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.080
 baby can breathe fresh and cool 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.640
 the air is certainly better not to allow 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.400
 This situation let the child very 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.980
 drinks a lot and even to thin the sputum 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.530
 and you can also use the recipe which 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.530
 I put soda in other videos and 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.920
 milk you can watch it here 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.720
 also view again well so here we are 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.450
 we are treated for laryngitis baby sluggish 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.040
 when the temperature and now but when 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.460
 the temperature drops 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.110
 then more or less here he moves draws u 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.790
 we jumps jumping we still him 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.840
 stop so that he does not spend extra 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:11.410
 energy here a little bit you sit like 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.090
 this is now falling asleep and only shocked 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.150
 I planted it myself to sleep right away 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.980
 lie down and here it is that baby 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.450
 zinger is an indicator that it is not 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.000
 bacterial infection is viral 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.850
 infection so we calmly shorter we 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.950
 did not go in this case here because 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.880
 we already know we have four babies we already 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.220
 know the action plan here 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.500
 again apply for the same we are not 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.150
 see meaning in this case two nights 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.070
 here we have passed more or less normally 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.680
 although 1 night was the hardest child 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.830
 was delirious and the temperatures churned him 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.670
 too and nurofen first night 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.000
 that there was a very high fever 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:52.800
 Now get along with herbs here shoot down 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.070
 Temperament do not hurt your wisdom 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.380
 treating children because you always want 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.720
 stay home now don't get in the hospital 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:04.100
 we sometimes better get into the hospital than 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.810
 stay home therefore wisdom you when 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:10.320
 stay at home when you need to contact 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:13.400
 for the ambulance here do not be ill let 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.400
 your kids don't get sick
