00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.669
 country 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.650
 More than a few days 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.189
 an hour ago that your comrades are in the niche he pushes public during 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.629
 that you secure access to cover stocks I'm sorry but that 

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:33.950
 I think capital you know that I try not to get angry 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.320
 will initiate forever we manage to repel the ball and we are still 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.340
 in life tomorrow I stick you between the parties the master of art to do in 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.100
 kind of not having systematically we do not see each time you 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.100
 behave like a potato 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.650

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.060

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.370
 balligand afp 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.250
 but it's completely crazy 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.240
 many came to open the skull and that's how we expected them to 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.690
 less than there the goal 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.289
 from your brains to live 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:07.859
 we do not rest arms after krombach is always wrong 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.650
 if your site wants to be 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.310
 dionne so even if the odd jobs as a result 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.050
 what will pass I find sublime otherwise there is still tomorrow 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.030
 go a good little series of media getting in the way of 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.490
 pickets out of the question that I assure you Russia was stunned 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.799
 there is no question a chamber music rout many beaches of 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.550
 big parries 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.550
 outsider 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.730
 present time at parties are proposed by the party 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.030
 they will be at least two other European countries 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.190
 two or three times 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.930
 at least two countries 3 no thanks bravo precision alex where both monuments 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.460
 in Europe around 2% 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.960
 I find it extremely awkward for you to take it on this tour I 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.170
 remind you that these statements are your command 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.530
 and it's a little bit of their time among other things provoking jarrah I 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.900
 never wanted the commander of the acquirers months it's you who me 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.880
 given the ok that 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.090
 but I'm telling you 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.280
 because on our side 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.180
 to order what you say ordered from the lagoon earth to the microphone 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.280
 I think that deep down and that we will feel 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.810
 I comment on the months buyers 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.380
 by this troop of 2000 to start slowly breaking nuts 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.439
 good 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.010
 we're trying to retreat he obviously has to attack at 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.469
 he still claimed christine dead 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.469
 but to make it come but we do not have what it really took place 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:35.990
 said m 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.619
 he said he had terrible fear 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:39.849
 but you do not care about me 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.849
 a fight in front of the camera is signed on the cake 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:03.039
