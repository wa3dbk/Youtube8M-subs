00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
charged me a holding fee of probably

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.229 
charged me a holding fee of probably
what<00:02:08.459> would<00:02:08.580> equate<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.819> about<00:02:09.060> another

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
what would equate to about another

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.210 
what would equate to about another
fifteen<00:02:09.660> dollars<00:02:09.959> something<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.379> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
fifteen dollars something like that and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.650 
fifteen dollars something like that and
so<00:02:11.459> by<00:02:11.610> now<00:02:11.790> with<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> postage<00:02:12.480> cost

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
so by now with the postage cost

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.520 
so by now with the postage cost
everything<00:02:12.930> else

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
everything else

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.780 
everything else
this<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.070> something<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.490> quite<00:02:14.700> an

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
this is something is a quite an

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.490 
this is something is a quite an

expensive you know it sort of loses its
is<00:02:20.070> investment<00:02:20.700> value<00:02:21.390> after<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:21.930> because

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
is investment value after this because

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.180 
is investment value after this because
it's<00:02:22.290> gonna<00:02:22.380> take<00:02:22.470> quite<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.860> while<00:02:22.950> of

it's gonna take quite a while of

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.590 
it's gonna take quite a while of
appreciation<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.030> make<00:02:24.210> up<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> money

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
appreciation just to make up the money

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.760 
appreciation just to make up the money

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
actually go into my collection in a bit

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.699 
actually go into my collection in a bit
more<00:02:36.330> detail<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.990> think<00:02:37.110> on<00:02:37.350> another<00:02:37.560> video

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
more detail I think on another video

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.850 
more detail I think on another video
right<00:02:38.670> now<00:02:38.820> is<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.150> kind<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.360> keen<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.860> to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
right now is just kind of keen to to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.600 
right now is just kind of keen to to
speak<00:02:41.100> about<00:02:41.280> some<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.520> my<00:02:41.550> experiences

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
speak about some of my experiences

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.240 
speak about some of my experiences
because<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.510> think<00:02:42.570> people<00:02:42.990> can<00:02:43.290> can<00:02:43.920> fall<00:02:44.130> into

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
because I think people can can fall into

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.080 
because I think people can can fall into
these<00:02:44.400> traps<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:45.930> very<00:02:46.080> easy<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:47.090> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
these traps and it's very easy to the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.250 
these traps and it's very easy to the
very<00:02:48.300> last<00:02:48.540> thing<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:48.959> was<00:02:49.020> gonna<00:02:49.170> mention

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
very last thing I was gonna mention

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.210 
very last thing I was gonna mention
actually<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.780> really<00:02:52.410> really<00:02:52.709> really

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
actually is a really really really

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.280 
actually is a really really really
seemingly<00:02:53.880> obvious<00:02:54.060> point<00:02:54.570> but<00:02:54.690> one<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.230> I

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
seemingly obvious point but one that I

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.260 
seemingly obvious point but one that I
overlooked<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.920> lot<00:02:57.350> for<00:02:58.350> quite<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.920> while<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.910> if

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
overlooked a lot for quite a while is if

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.479 
overlooked a lot for quite a while is if

though I know in my head the difference

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.310 
though I know in my head the difference
I<00:03:16.709> would<00:03:17.100> still<00:03:17.400> look<00:03:17.760> at<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:21.140> still<00:03:22.140> wouldn't

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
I would still look at I still wouldn't

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.979

work<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.530> out<00:03:22.590> properly<00:03:22.799> so<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.130> would<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:23.700> would

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
work it out properly so I would I would

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.289 
work it out properly so I would I would
you<00:03:24.989> know<00:03:25.049> be<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.380> be<00:03:25.620> paying<00:03:25.890> I'd<00:03:26.880> be<00:03:27.030> spending

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
you know be a be paying I'd be spending

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.890 
you know be a be paying I'd be spending
pounds<00:03:27.930> like<00:03:28.230> they<00:03:28.500> were<00:03:28.620> dollars<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.850> end<00:03:30.780> up

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
pounds like they were dollars and end up

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.770 
pounds like they were dollars and end up
paying<00:03:30.930> just<00:03:31.530> completely<00:03:31.920> over<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.280> odds<00:03:32.400> I

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
paying just completely over the odds I

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.880 
paying just completely over the odds I
don't<00:03:33.780> think<00:03:33.900> I'd<00:03:34.200> probably<00:03:34.350> need<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.739> say

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
don't think I'd probably need to say

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.259 
don't think I'd probably need to say
anything<00:03:35.070> any<00:03:35.370> more<00:03:35.519> than<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:35.820> but<00:03:36.060> it's

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
anything any more than that but it's

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.470 
anything any more than that but it's
surprisingly<00:03:36.900> easy<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.230> do<00:03:38.120> you'll<00:03:39.120> be<00:03:39.239> saying

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
surprisingly easy to do you'll be saying

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.259 
surprisingly easy to do you'll be saying
you<00:03:39.630> know<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:39.750> was<00:03:39.959> worth<00:03:40.170> 130<00:03:40.920> pounds<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:41.820> so

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
you know I was worth 130 pounds so so

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.509 
you know I was worth 130 pounds so so
I'll<00:03:42.570> be<00:03:42.930> paying<00:03:43.320> this<00:03:43.560> let<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.829> other<00:03:43.950> any

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
I'll be paying this let the other any

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.650 
I'll be paying this let the other any
look<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.760> thing<00:03:44.880> was<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.060> one<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.360> worth

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
look the thing was that one is worth

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.660 
look the thing was that one is worth
$130<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:46.709> look<00:03:46.860> at<00:03:46.980> what<00:03:47.070> you<00:03:47.130> paid<00:03:47.400> and

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
$130 and you look at what you paid and

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.789 
$130 and you look at what you paid and
you<00:03:47.760> paid<00:03:47.970> probably<00:03:48.930> more<00:03:49.350> than<00:03:49.500> what<00:03:49.650> it's

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
you paid probably more than what it's

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.100 
you paid probably more than what it's
worth<00:03:49.829> it's<00:03:50.790> pretty<00:03:51.030> stupid<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.570> do<00:03:51.690> but<00:03:51.840> it's

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
worth it's pretty stupid to do but it's

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.430 
worth it's pretty stupid to do but it's
actually<00:03:52.620> also<00:03:52.829> quite<00:03:53.220> surprisingly<00:03:53.579> easy<00:03:53.760> so

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
actually also quite surprisingly easy so

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.300 
actually also quite surprisingly easy so
anyway<00:03:55.440> guys<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.650> think<00:03:55.709> i'ma<00:03:55.950> leave<00:03:56.070> it<00:03:56.190> for
