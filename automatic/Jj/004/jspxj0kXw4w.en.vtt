perhaps don't get a good lunch and we do

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.240 
perhaps don't get a good lunch and we do
teach<00:01:50.550> nutrition<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.390> children<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:51.990> well

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
we teach Navajo culture and language the

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.630 
we teach Navajo culture and language the
reason<00:02:00.720> why<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.409> teaching<00:02:01.920> them<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.460> they

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
reason why we teaching them so they

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.880 
reason why we teaching them so they
won't<00:02:02.790> forget<00:02:03.000> their<00:02:03.390> language<00:02:03.870> they<00:02:04.500> need<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
won't forget their language they need to

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.790 
won't forget their language they need to
talk<00:02:05.159> Navajo<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.060> they<00:02:06.750> need<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.170> know<00:02:07.590> their

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
talk Navajo and they need to know their

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.350 
talk Navajo and they need to know their
culture

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.960 

and<00:02:12.380> hopefully<00:02:13.380> by<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.890> time<00:02:14.250> they<00:02:14.460> get<00:02:14.700> out

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
and hopefully by the time they get out

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.600 
and hopefully by the time they get out
of<00:02:15.120> 6th<00:02:15.570> grade<00:02:15.810> don't<00:02:16.380> have<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.740> strong<00:02:17.220> inner

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
of 6th grade don't have a strong inner

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.120 
of 6th grade don't have a strong inner
strength<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:19.050> think<00:02:19.350> that's<00:02:19.590> what<00:02:19.890> all

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
strength and I think that's what all

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.710 
strength and I think that's what all
school<00:02:20.580> are<00:02:20.850> trying<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.330> build

when the mission was founded in 1954
they<00:02:27.320> started<00:02:28.010> out<00:02:28.160> with<00:02:28.520> one<00:02:29.090> building<00:02:29.510> and

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
they started out with one building and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.170 
they started out with one building and
that<00:02:30.560> was<00:02:30.620> pretty<00:02:31.190> much<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.700> Health<00:02:31.940> Care

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
that was pretty much a Health Care

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.320 
that was pretty much a Health Care
Center<00:02:32.920> some<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.070> main<00:02:34.370> health<00:02:34.760> issues

that we need to grow obviously along

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.740 
that we need to grow obviously along
with<00:05:08.950> that<00:05:09.220> challenge<00:05:09.790> comes<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.360> challenge

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
with that challenge comes the challenge

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.520 
with that challenge comes the challenge
of<00:05:10.870> fundraising<00:05:12.600> financially<00:05:13.600> we<00:05:13.960> do<00:05:14.200> face<00:05:14.500> a

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
of fundraising financially we do face a

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.900 
of fundraising financially we do face a
lot<00:05:14.980> of<00:05:15.040> challenges<00:05:16.620> for<00:05:17.620> one<00:05:17.860> thing<00:05:18.190> the
