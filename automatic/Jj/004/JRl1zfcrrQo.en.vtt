they were actually kind of specialized
in<00:00:32.550> niche<00:00:32.700> markets<00:00:33.210> like<00:00:33.510> vegetables<00:00:34.399> we<00:00:35.399> see

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
in niche markets like vegetables we see

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.830 
in niche markets like vegetables we see
a<00:00:35.550> lot<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.880> them<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.059> California<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
a lot of them in California in the

a lot of them in California in the
vegetable<00:00:37.230> market<00:00:38.149> then<00:00:39.149> they<00:00:39.239> expand<00:00:39.510> into

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
vegetable market then they expand into

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.330

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
interest in real corn to the US so they

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.020 
interest in real corn to the US so they
expanded<00:00:44.070> out<00:00:44.190> usually<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.760> know<00:00:44.820> if<00:00:44.910> it's

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
expanded out usually you know if it's

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.400 
expanded out usually you know if it's
something<00:00:45.239> new<00:00:45.600> they<00:00:45.870> are<00:00:45.989> usually<00:00:46.140> the

something new they are usually the
forefront<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.870> that's<00:00:49.110> why<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> lot<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
forefront of it and that's why a lot of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.860 
forefront of it and that's why a lot of
guys<00:00:49.739> went<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> them<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.489> canola<00:00:50.850> planting<00:00:51.360> we

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
guys went to them for canola planting we

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.330 
guys went to them for canola planting we
saw<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> lot<00:00:52.170> guys<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.440> southern<00:00:52.739> Alberta<00:00:52.860> start

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
saw a lot guys in southern Alberta start

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.279 
saw a lot guys in southern Alberta start
with<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.579> canola<00:00:54.050> we're<00:00:55.050> seeing<00:00:55.230> that

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
with it in canola we're seeing that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.529 
with it in canola we're seeing that

we<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.750> units<00:00:58.109> running<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.379> Oklahoma<00:00:58.829> and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
we have units running in Oklahoma and

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.160 
we have units running in Oklahoma and
one<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> things<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.660> allowed<00:01:00.840> Montes

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
one of the things that allowed Montes

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.450 
one of the things that allowed Montes
time<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.410> jump<00:01:01.710> into<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.980> market<00:01:02.309> fairly

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
time to jump into that market fairly

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.670 
time to jump into that market fairly
quickly<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.210> their<00:01:03.750> experience<00:01:03.960> with<00:01:04.409> small

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
quickly is their experience with small

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.620 
quickly is their experience with small
seeds<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.189> vegetables<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.210> we're<00:01:06.420> doing<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
seeds like vegetables so we're doing a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.870 
seeds like vegetables so we're doing a
lot<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.869> carrots<00:01:07.350> your<00:01:07.740> cabbage<00:01:08.340> raddish

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
lot of carrots your cabbage raddish

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.120 
lot of carrots your cabbage raddish
those<00:01:09.060> sort<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> things<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.560> really<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
those sort of things so really going to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
those sort of things so really going to
canola<00:01:11.430> wasn't<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.060> difficult<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.540> them

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
canola wasn't that difficult for them

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.480 
canola wasn't that difficult for them
and<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.960> think<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.439> nicest<00:01:14.189> parts

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and I think one of the nicest parts

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.340 
and I think one of the nicest parts
about<00:01:14.729> working<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.240> mono<00:01:15.479> SEM<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.900> they<00:01:16.020> try

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
about working with mono SEM is they try

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.800 
about working with mono SEM is they try
to<00:01:16.409> make<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.159> much<00:01:17.340> stuff<00:01:17.610> available<00:01:17.909> directly

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
to make as much stuff available directly

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.490 
to make as much stuff available directly
from<00:01:19.049> them<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:20.130> possible<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> when<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.110> look<00:01:22.320> at

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
from them as possible so when we look at

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.410 
from them as possible so when we look at
the<00:01:22.680> plates<00:01:22.979> guys<00:01:23.700> don't<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.210> drill

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the plates guys don't have to drill

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.270 
the plates guys don't have to drill
their<00:01:24.570> own<00:01:24.659> place<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.560> basically<00:01:25.950> get<00:01:26.130> them

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
their own place we basically get them

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.920 
their own place we basically get them
off<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> shelf<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.030> don't<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.750> right

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
off the shelf if we don't have the right

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.969 
off the shelf if we don't have the right
plate<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.470> already

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
plate for you already

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.780 
plate for you already
tell<00:01:29.549> us<00:01:29.700> what<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> want<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.450> we'll<00:01:31.049> make<00:01:31.320> it

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
tell us what you want and we'll make it

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.219 
tell us what you want and we'll make it
other<00:01:32.790> little<00:01:33.090> things<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.479> secondary<00:01:33.960> air

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
other little things like a secondary air

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.590 
other little things like a secondary air
system<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> first<00:01:35.909> ones<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> introduce

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
system we're the first ones to introduce

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.850 
system we're the first ones to introduce
that<00:01:36.780> from<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.920> an<00:01:38.250> OEM<00:01:38.450> basis<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.290> instead<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
that from as an OEM basis so instead of

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.310 
that from as an OEM basis so instead of
having<00:01:41.070> we've<00:01:42.000> had<00:01:42.119> cases<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.659> canola<00:01:42.990> seed

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
having we've had cases with canola seed

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.289 
having we've had cases with canola seed
treatment<00:01:43.710> flaking<00:01:43.920> off<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.460> that's<00:01:45.030> causing

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
treatment flaking off and that's causing

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.280 
treatment flaking off and that's causing
issues<00:01:45.930> with<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.680> holes<00:01:46.860> plugging<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:49.110> they

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
issues with the holes plugging so they

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.690 
issues with the holes plugging so they
took<00:01:49.470> technology<00:01:49.649> from<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> vegetable

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
took technology from the vegetable

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.859 
took technology from the vegetable
platters<00:01:51.030> where<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.299> were<00:01:51.390> having<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.720> same

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
platters where we were having the same

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.899 
platters where we were having the same
issue<00:01:52.079> with<00:01:52.170> seed<00:01:52.470> treatments<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.640> put

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
issue with seed treatments and we put

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.649 
issue with seed treatments and we put
that<00:01:53.939> onto<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:55.229> ng+<00:01:55.799> meter<00:01:56.460> that's<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.600> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
that onto the ng+ meter that's going to

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.020 
that onto the ng+ meter that's going to
allow<00:01:57.840> us<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.049> actually<00:01:58.140> blow<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.549> holes<00:01:59.790> out

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
allow us to actually blow the holes out

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.030 
allow us to actually blow the holes out
as<00:02:00.299> we<00:02:00.780> operate<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.380> customer<00:02:01.710> doesn't<00:02:01.950> have

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
as we operate so customer doesn't have

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.499 
as we operate so customer doesn't have
to<00:02:02.159> stop<00:02:02.369> after<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.790> many<00:02:02.880> revolutions<00:02:03.689> and

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
to stop after so many revolutions and

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.779 
to stop after so many revolutions and
turn<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.259> meters<00:02:05.530> over<00:02:05.829> and<00:02:06.070> clean<00:02:06.520> them<00:02:06.700> out

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
turn the meters over and clean them out

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.969 
turn the meters over and clean them out
this<00:02:07.509> will<00:02:07.719> happen<00:02:07.869> as<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.440> drive<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:08.890> it's

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
this will happen as you drive and it's

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:09.990 
this will happen as you drive and it's
been<00:02:09.099> working<00:02:09.399> very<00:02:09.429> good<00:02:09.580> we've<00:02:09.819> actually

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
been working very good we've actually

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.210 
been working very good we've actually
had<00:02:10.209> chances<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.660> operate<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.739> in<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.980> field

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
had chances to operate it in the field

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.160 
had chances to operate it in the field
down<00:02:12.340> Oklahoma<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:13.000> last<00:02:13.300> fall<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.780> it

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
down Oklahoma this last fall and it

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.729 
down Oklahoma this last fall and it
worked<00:02:14.349> really<00:02:14.590> well<00:02:15.870> what's<00:02:16.870> nice<00:02:17.500> with<00:02:17.530> that

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
worked really well what's nice with that

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.440 
worked really well what's nice with that
system<00:02:18.129> too<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:18.459> actually<00:02:18.610> do<00:02:18.849> have<00:02:19.030> an<00:02:19.209> air

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
system too is we actually do have an air

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.300 
system too is we actually do have an air
cleaner<00:02:19.660> system<00:02:20.200> built<00:02:20.379> into<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.739> too<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.250> you

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
cleaner system built into it too so you

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.470 
cleaner system built into it too so you
don't<00:02:21.370> have<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.700> worry<00:02:21.849> about<00:02:21.970> blowing<00:02:22.209> in

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
don't have to worry about blowing in

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.870 
don't have to worry about blowing in
large<00:02:22.720> amounts<00:02:23.110> of<00:02:23.230> residue<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:24.519> air<00:02:24.640> will<00:02:24.790> be

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
large amounts of residue the air will be

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.059 
large amounts of residue the air will be
cleaned<00:02:25.180> blows<00:02:26.019> out<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.230> holes<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.890> just

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
cleaned blows out the holes and you just

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.030 
cleaned blows out the holes and you just
keep<00:02:27.250> running<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.959> this<00:02:29.470> would<00:02:29.680> be<00:02:29.800> where<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
keep running so this would be where the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.830 
keep running so this would be where the
seed<00:02:30.489> feeds<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:31.000> through<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.360> hopper<00:02:31.510> into

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
seed feeds in through the hopper into

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.960 
seed feeds in through the hopper into
this<00:02:32.019> carrying<00:02:32.380> piece<00:02:32.620> here<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.549> seed<00:02:33.819> is

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
this carrying piece here the seed is

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.150 
this carrying piece here the seed is
picked<00:02:34.180> up<00:02:34.330> down<00:02:34.540> around<00:02:34.599> this<00:02:34.959> area<00:02:35.200> comes

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
picked up down around this area comes

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.259 
picked up down around this area comes
around<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.610> we<00:02:36.700> actually<00:02:36.819> have<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.060> brass

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
around and we actually have a brass

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.640 
around and we actually have a brass
simulator<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:37.959> I'll<00:02:38.019> show<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.260> on<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.500> other

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
simulator and I'll show you on the other

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.229 
simulator and I'll show you on the other
unit<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.340> look<00:02:39.459> at<00:02:39.580> how<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.760> simulator

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
unit you can look at how the simulator

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.910 
unit you can look at how the simulator
works<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:40.660> it's<00:02:40.750> essentially<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.470> brass<00:02:41.680> piece

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
works but it's essentially a brass piece

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.009 
works but it's essentially a brass piece
that's<00:02:42.130> kind<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.459> serrated<00:02:42.790> teeth<00:02:43.090> on<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.510> that

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
that's kind of serrated teeth on it that

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.650 
that's kind of serrated teeth on it that
knocks<00:02:44.380> off<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.709> excess<00:02:45.280> seed<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.569> we

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
knocks off the excess seed so that we

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.270 
knocks off the excess seed so that we
have<00:02:46.810> only<00:02:46.930> one<00:02:47.079> seed<00:02:47.560> per<00:02:47.590> hole<00:02:47.950> instead<00:02:48.220> of

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
have only one seed per hole instead of

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.490 
have only one seed per hole instead of
two<00:02:48.459> or<00:02:48.640> three<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.630> seed<00:02:49.870> then<00:02:50.019> comes<00:02:50.260> around

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
two or three the seed then comes around

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.930 
two or three the seed then comes around
with<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.680> vacuum<00:02:51.069> sucking<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.519> to<00:02:51.610> get<00:02:51.760> first

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
with the vacuum sucking you to get first

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.789 
with the vacuum sucking you to get first
against<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.329> plate<00:02:52.569> now<00:02:53.260> as<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.500> comes<00:02:53.650> around

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
against the plate now as it comes around

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.860 
against the plate now as it comes around
here<00:02:54.280> on<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.610> back<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:55.060> plate<00:02:55.299> we<00:02:55.420> actually

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
here on the back the plate we actually

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.440 
here on the back the plate we actually
reduce<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.769> vacuum<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.730> then<00:02:57.940> eventually

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
reduce the vacuum and then eventually

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.930 
reduce the vacuum and then eventually
eliminate<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.290> vacuum<00:02:59.650> at<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.430> same<00:03:00.610> time<00:03:00.819> we

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
eliminate the vacuum at the same time we

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.180 
eliminate the vacuum at the same time we
have<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.209> brass<00:03:01.480> ejector<00:03:02.079> block<00:03:02.349> so<00:03:03.010> the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
have this brass ejector block so the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.500 
have this brass ejector block so the
seat<00:03:03.370> comes<00:03:03.610> along<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.239> have<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.480> set

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
seat comes along and I have it set

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.720 
seat comes along and I have it set
basically<00:03:05.049> that<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.349> comes<00:03:05.560> along<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.519> is

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
basically that it comes along and is

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.069 
basically that it comes along and is
held<00:03:06.940> against<00:03:07.209> plate<00:03:07.360> until<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.630> touches<00:03:07.840> the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
held against plate until it touches the

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.750 
held against plate until it touches the
ejector<00:03:08.440> block<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:08.889> ejector<00:03:09.100> block<00:03:09.400> taps

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
ejector block and the ejector block taps

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.990 
ejector block and the ejector block taps
it<00:03:09.910> off<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.180> plate<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.250> is<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.489> inside

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
it off the plate and this is the inside

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.610 
it off the plate and this is the inside
so<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.269> can<00:03:13.389> see<00:03:13.540> here<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.870> brass<00:03:14.079> simulator

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
so you can see here the brass simulator

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.500 
so you can see here the brass simulator
that<00:03:14.680> we<00:03:14.799> spoke<00:03:15.069> about<00:03:15.340> this<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:16.180> adjustable

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
that we spoke about this is adjustable

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.030 
that we spoke about this is adjustable
you'll<00:03:17.049> set<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.319> move<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.680> up<00:03:17.829> or<00:03:17.980> down

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
you'll set it move it up or down

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.770 
you'll set it move it up or down
depending<00:03:18.370> on<00:03:18.760> how<00:03:18.850> aggressively<00:03:19.359> you<00:03:19.450> want

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
depending on how aggressively you want

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.650 
depending on how aggressively you want
to<00:03:19.870> tap<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.260> seat<00:03:20.470> we<00:03:21.430> can<00:03:21.459> actually<00:03:21.970> with<00:03:22.420> our

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
to tap the seat we can actually with our

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.330 
to tap the seat we can actually with our
adjustment<00:03:23.260> we're<00:03:23.380> not<00:03:23.530> only<00:03:23.769> adjusting<00:03:24.220> the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
adjustment we're not only adjusting the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.650 
adjustment we're not only adjusting the
cingulate<00:03:24.760> ER<00:03:24.819> but<00:03:24.970> we<00:03:25.090> adjust<00:03:25.359> some<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.600> the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
cingulate ER but we adjust some of the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.900 
cingulate ER but we adjust some of the
vacuum<00:03:26.109> as<00:03:26.170> well<00:03:26.380> so<00:03:27.040> if<00:03:27.280> we're<00:03:27.489> picking<00:03:27.819> up

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
vacuum as well so if we're picking up

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.420 
vacuum as well so if we're picking up
too<00:03:28.299> many<00:03:28.450> seeds<00:03:28.840> not<00:03:29.200> only<00:03:29.470> will<00:03:29.620> we<00:03:29.650> move<00:03:30.250> the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
too many seeds not only will we move the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.460 
too many seeds not only will we move the
cingulate<00:03:30.790> er<00:03:30.850> down<00:03:31.120> we'll<00:03:31.840> release<00:03:32.139> some<00:03:32.440> of

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
cingulate er down we'll release some of

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.569 
cingulate er down we'll release some of
the<00:03:32.560> back<00:03:32.709> and<00:03:32.950> kind<00:03:33.069> of<00:03:33.100> fine-tune<00:03:33.459> the

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
the back and kind of fine-tune the

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.059 
the back and kind of fine-tune the
vacuum<00:03:33.940> right<00:03:34.060> here<00:03:34.329> at<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.540> meter<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.920> then

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
vacuum right here at the meter so then

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.370 
vacuum right here at the meter so then
the<00:03:36.190> seat<00:03:36.370> again<00:03:36.639> comes<00:03:36.910> around<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.510> on<00:03:37.810> our

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
the seat again comes around and on our

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.349 
the seat again comes around and on our
cover<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.859> our<00:03:39.280> brass<00:03:39.549> ejector<00:03:40.060> that<00:03:40.150> wouldn't

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
cover is our brass ejector that wouldn't

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.629 
cover is our brass ejector that wouldn't
tap<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.840> seat<00:03:41.049> off<00:03:41.200> about<00:03:41.410> here<00:03:41.680> see<00:03:42.400> drops

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
tap the seat off about here see drops

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.150 
tap the seat off about here see drops
down<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.030> C<00:03:43.239> tube<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:43.720> into<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:43.959> ground<00:03:44.170> so

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
down the C tube and into the ground so

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.500 
down the C tube and into the ground so
you<00:03:45.639> know<00:03:45.700> when<00:03:45.819> we<00:03:45.910> talk<00:03:46.090> about<00:03:46.120> the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
you know when we talk about the

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.849 
you know when we talk about the
difference<00:03:46.780> between<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:47.019> planter<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.470> an<00:03:47.709> air

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
difference between a planter and an air

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.129 
difference between a planter and an air
drill<00:03:48.130> with<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.150> planter<00:03:49.599> we're<00:03:49.780> worried<00:03:50.079> about

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
drill with a planter we're worried about

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.080 
drill with a planter we're worried about
what<00:03:50.440> happens<00:03:50.859> to<00:03:50.889> the<00:03:50.980> seed<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.459> this<00:03:51.730> drop

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
what happens to the seed and this drop

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.780 
what happens to the seed and this drop
here<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:52.870> we're<00:03:53.680> talking<00:03:53.799> you<00:03:53.980> know<00:03:54.040> 18<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.519> 20

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
here so we're talking you know 18 to 20

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.030 
here so we're talking you know 18 to 20
inch<00:03:54.940> drop<00:03:55.299> as<00:03:55.599> opposed<00:03:56.109> to<00:03:56.170> 200<00:03:56.620> feet<00:03:56.739> of<00:03:56.889> hose

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
inch drop as opposed to 200 feet of hose

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.129 
inch drop as opposed to 200 feet of hose
that<00:03:57.069> you<00:03:57.430> see<00:03:57.579> on<00:03:57.670> an<00:03:57.760> air<00:03:57.910> drill<00:03:58.180> so<00:03:59.019> there's

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
that you see on an air drill so there's

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.780 
that you see on an air drill so there's
very<00:03:59.319> little<00:03:59.470> area<00:03:59.799> for<00:03:59.829> their<00:04:00.069> BC<00:04:00.400> damage

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
very little area for their BC damage

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.199 
very little area for their BC damage
done<00:04:01.349> not<00:04:02.349> as<00:04:02.440> much<00:04:02.590> area<00:04:02.799> for<00:04:03.099> seed<00:04:03.819> to<00:04:03.970> bounce

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
done not as much area for seed to bounce

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.530 
done not as much area for seed to bounce
and<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.530> gather<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.940> you<00:04:07.030> know<00:04:07.209> you<00:04:07.299> want<00:04:07.480> to

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
and and gather so you know you want to

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.580 
and and gather so you know you want to
make<00:04:07.630> sure<00:04:07.660> that<00:04:07.810> when<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.019> singulate<00:04:08.470> the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
make sure that when you singulate the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.309 
make sure that when you singulate the
seed<00:04:08.799> here<00:04:09.130> it<00:04:09.280> stays<00:04:09.910> spaced<00:04:10.750> as<00:04:10.989> it<00:04:11.200> goes

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
seed here it stays spaced as it goes

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.199 
seed here it stays spaced as it goes
down<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.709> tube<00:04:11.919> and<00:04:12.190> there<00:04:12.879> are<00:04:12.970> several

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
down the tube and there are several

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.580 
down the tube and there are several
different<00:04:13.510> options<00:04:13.599> of<00:04:13.959> different<00:04:14.019> tubes<00:04:14.409> out

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
different options of different tubes out

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.379 
different options of different tubes out
there<00:04:14.799> that<00:04:14.950> will<00:04:15.069> allow<00:04:15.099> you<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.579> keep

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
there that will allow you to keep

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.710 
there that will allow you to keep
see<00:04:17.079> from<00:04:17.289> bouncing<00:04:17.650> as<00:04:17.799> well<00:04:17.949> I<00:04:18.849> think<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.479> big

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
see from bouncing as well I think a big

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.089 
see from bouncing as well I think a big
thing<00:04:19.959> with<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.199> planter<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:20.590> lot<00:04:20.829> of<00:04:20.949> guys

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
thing with the planter a lot of guys

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:25.379 
thing with the planter a lot of guys
miss<00:04:21.729> on<00:04:21.970> is<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.569> depth<00:04:22.780> control<00:04:24.180> it's<00:04:25.180> not

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
miss on is the depth control it's not

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.939 
miss on is the depth control it's not
touched<00:04:25.659> on<00:04:25.840> I<00:04:25.900> think<00:04:26.020> and<00:04:26.199> not<00:04:26.680> by<00:04:26.889> the

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
touched on I think and not by the

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.290 
touched on I think and not by the
planter<00:04:27.370> companies<00:04:27.699> because<00:04:27.969> they're<00:04:28.090> used

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
planter companies because they're used

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.270 
planter companies because they're used
to<00:04:28.389> it<00:04:28.539> years<00:04:29.259> ago<00:04:29.500> everybody<00:04:29.740> essentially

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
to it years ago everybody essentially

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.589 
to it years ago everybody essentially
came<00:04:30.430> up<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.669> same<00:04:30.849> sort<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.120> system<00:04:31.449> for

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
came up the same sort of system for

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.600 
came up the same sort of system for
depth<00:04:31.780> control<00:04:32.199> so<00:04:32.889> in<00:04:32.979> order<00:04:33.099> to<00:04:33.219> sell<00:04:33.460> their

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
depth control so in order to sell their

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.550 
depth control so in order to sell their
planter<00:04:33.969> they<00:04:34.120> focused<00:04:34.479> on<00:04:34.569> singulate<00:04:35.139> inand

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
planter they focused on singulate inand

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.080 
planter they focused on singulate inand
who<00:04:35.650> had<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.889> best<00:04:36.009> singulated<00:04:36.490> system<00:04:36.939> and

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
who had the best singulated system and

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.550 
who had the best singulated system and
although<00:04:37.569> we<00:04:37.810> do<00:04:37.990> have<00:04:38.229> some<00:04:38.439> pretty

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
although we do have some pretty

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.200 
although we do have some pretty
significant<00:04:39.129> savings<00:04:39.520> by<00:04:39.639> going<00:04:39.849> to<00:04:39.939> a<00:04:39.969> CEO

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
significant savings by going to a CEO

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.439 
significant savings by going to a CEO
singulated<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:41.050> seed<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:42.460> yield<00:04:42.849> benefit

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
singulated a seed the yield benefit

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.020 
singulated a seed the yield benefit
comes<00:04:44.169> out<00:04:44.349> of<00:04:44.469> the<00:04:44.530> depth<00:04:44.740> control<00:04:45.189> because

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
comes out of the depth control because

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.959 
comes out of the depth control because
we<00:04:46.060> essentially<00:04:46.479> we<00:04:46.780> dial<00:04:47.080> in<00:04:47.319> our<00:04:47.439> depth<00:04:47.680> here

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:47.969 
we essentially we dial in our depth here

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.550 
we essentially we dial in our depth here
with<00:04:48.969> this<00:04:49.090> knob<00:04:49.300> back<00:04:49.509> here<00:04:49.780> so<00:04:50.409> we<00:04:50.440> have

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
with this knob back here so we have

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.499 
with this knob back here so we have
infinitely<00:04:51.069> adjustable<00:04:51.159> depth<00:04:51.759> control<00:04:51.969> here

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
infinitely adjustable depth control here

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.080 
infinitely adjustable depth control here
okay<00:04:53.229> we<00:04:53.740> set<00:04:53.949> this<00:04:54.099> 3/4<00:04:54.520> of<00:04:54.550> an<00:04:54.669> inch<00:04:54.699> deep<00:04:54.909> we

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
okay we set this 3/4 of an inch deep we

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.110 
okay we set this 3/4 of an inch deep we
actually<00:04:55.449> have<00:04:55.620> 3/4<00:04:56.620> inch<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:57.580> double<00:04:57.940> disc

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
actually have 3/4 inch the double disc

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.510 
actually have 3/4 inch the double disc
opener<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.750> opens<00:04:59.229> the<00:04:59.409> trench<00:04:59.740> we<00:05:00.069> have<00:05:00.310> this

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
opener it opens the trench we have this

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.600 
opener it opens the trench we have this
cast<00:05:00.849> point<00:05:01.330> here<00:05:01.780> that<00:05:01.930> will<00:05:02.500> actually<00:05:02.710> open

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
cast point here that will actually open

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.339 
cast point here that will actually open
up<00:05:03.729> and<00:05:03.940> firm<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.509> bottom<00:05:04.870> of<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.020> trench<00:05:05.229> and

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
up and firm the bottom of the trench and

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.860 
up and firm the bottom of the trench and
make<00:05:05.500> a<00:05:05.530> perfect<00:05:05.949> V<00:05:06.270> then<00:05:07.270> we<00:05:07.360> drop<00:05:07.599> the<00:05:07.690> seed

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
make a perfect V then we drop the seed

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.010 
make a perfect V then we drop the seed
into<00:05:08.199> that<00:05:08.349> so<00:05:09.310> yup<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.789> ideal<00:05:10.150> seed

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
into that so yup the ideal seed

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.129 
into that so yup the ideal seed
placement<00:05:11.650> here<00:05:12.279> not<00:05:12.819> only<00:05:12.879> for<00:05:13.150> depth<00:05:13.389> but

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
placement here not only for depth but

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.749

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
and maintain a consistent depth when you

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.499 
and maintain a consistent depth when you
look<00:05:51.159> at<00:05:51.250> crops<00:05:51.490> like<00:05:51.669> corn<00:05:51.849> a<00:05:52.029> quarter<00:05:52.389> inch

look at crops like corn a quarter inch
of<00:05:52.599> depth<00:05:52.810> variance<00:05:53.169> will<00:05:53.289> affect<00:05:53.529> your

of depth variance will affect your

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.019 
of depth variance will affect your
yellow<00:05:53.830> a<00:05:53.919> lot<00:05:54.069> more<00:05:54.250> than<00:05:54.400> singulate<00:05:54.789> and

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:55.029 
yellow a lot more than singulate and

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:56.519 
yellow a lot more than singulate and
well<00:05:55.150> and<00:05:55.599> I<00:05:55.690> really<00:05:56.020> think<00:05:56.169> we're<00:05:56.349> going<00:05:56.469> to

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:56.529 
well and I really think we're going to

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:58.519 
well and I really think we're going to
see<00:05:56.650> the<00:05:56.770> same<00:05:56.919> sort<00:05:57.159> of<00:05:57.190> thing<00:05:57.310> with<00:05:57.430> canola

00:05:58.519 --> 00:05:58.529 
see the same sort of thing with canola

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:01.409 
see the same sort of thing with canola
so<00:05:59.529> with<00:05:59.830> the<00:05:59.949> two<00:06:00.129> depth<00:06:00.400> wheels<00:06:00.729> we<00:06:01.300> have

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
so with the two depth wheels we have

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:02.909 
so with the two depth wheels we have
this<00:06:01.539> one<00:06:01.750> taken<00:06:02.110> off<00:06:02.259> right<00:06:02.500> now<00:06:02.650> with<00:06:02.710> the

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
this one taken off right now with the

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.920 
this one taken off right now with the
two<00:06:03.099> depth<00:06:03.339> wheel<00:06:03.580> and<00:06:03.909> they<00:06:04.360> actually<00:06:04.629> walk

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
two depth wheel and they actually walk

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.469 
two depth wheel and they actually walk
like<00:06:05.169> a<00:06:05.289> walking<00:06:05.740> tandem<00:06:06.219> so<00:06:07.000> that<00:06:07.150> helps

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
like a walking tandem so that helps

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:08.909 
like a walking tandem so that helps
maintain<00:06:07.599> a<00:06:07.779> consistent<00:06:08.139> depth<00:06:08.529> even<00:06:08.740> in

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
maintain a consistent depth even in

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.159 
maintain a consistent depth even in
rough<00:06:09.039> four<00:06:09.250> grounds<00:06:09.669> it<00:06:10.509> supports<00:06:11.080> the
