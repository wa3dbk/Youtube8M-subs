00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:07.569
 hello everybody on this question should be 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.250
 People have to know, I'm just going to put 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:14.290
 which way I do not really like to put 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:18.760
 waters of killer talking but it's easy 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:23.070
 to conclude when the interest is simple 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:27.250
 the form the jury obtained through the capital 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.580
 multiplied by the rate is explained by 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.580
 time remembering the rate 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.540
 I like to always put in number 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.540
 decimal 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:49.870
 that is, if it is 7.5 percent and 7 percent 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:01:00.040
 in constant practice we know that the 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:01:04.360
 corresponding number 0.05 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.830
 now I want to know what the capital is * 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.830
 this rate we have 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:23.140
 forgiveness 0 75 times the time I have the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:28.330
 time is not 90 because it is in itself 30 in 30 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:34.479
 days in studying three periods then what 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:36.840
 will give me that interest that the question is 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.840
 Speaking 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.960
 from here you have several ways to 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.570
 solve this question and I will try 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:50.280
 simplify or make them more 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.280
 so capital inflation that it is looking for 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:59.340
 I'm going to turn this infraction is 75 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.340
 thousandths 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.319
 remembering that each one does the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.279
 have more affinity I believe that by 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.360
 here we do not take the risk and the 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:17.650
 divisions 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.570
 is with decimal numbers 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.630
 just remembering that to transform enough 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.490
 see how many houses they have after the friend goes 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.760
 be the amount of zeros determined 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.460
 here it had three can only be for a thousand 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.400
 and now I will isolate in capital or isolate 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:42.940
 the capital letter or 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:45.580
 capital will be 28,125 which is the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:52.780
 my name on the other side the thousand that is 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:54.670
 dividing passes by multiplying it already 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:02.530
 Let's stay 3 75 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:05.050
 I know you 're 225 and how are you? 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:10.840
 multiplying whether it will pass 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.930
 dividing from the other side and now enough 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.840
 cut 20 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.989
 this division here 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:30.700
 we cut 20 stays until we get one 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:37.209
 will be 125 times division 10/1 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:42.690
 This gives us then 1,250 we will find 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:48.900
 our alternative letter if in 1240 and 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.900
 1260 this is it, people are next
