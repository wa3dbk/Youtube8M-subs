stand<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.070> front<00:00:17.190> now<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.970> application<00:00:18.570> is

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
stand in front now this application is

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.929 
stand in front now this application is
available<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.289> apps<00:00:19.439> were<00:00:19.590> 499<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:20.730> i<00:00:20.760> was

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
available in the apps were 499 so i was

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.790 
available in the apps were 499 so i was
debating<00:00:21.090> whether<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.630> get<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.020> or<00:00:22.170> not<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.769> i

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
debating whether to get it or not so i

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.830 
debating whether to get it or not so i
just<00:00:23.010> got<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.250> because<00:00:23.400> i<00:00:23.670> love<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.180> guys<00:00:24.449> so

yeah so props me on that I guess so
let's<00:00:28.109> launch<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.310> know<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
let's launch it just you know this the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.999 
let's launch it just you know this the
first<00:00:30.000> time<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.300> I'm<00:00:30.539> doing<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.929> test<00:00:31.320> so

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
first time that I'm doing this test so

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.979 
first time that I'm doing this test so
what<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.669> see<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:32.940> pretty<00:00:33.300> much<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.719> saw

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
what you see is pretty much what I saw

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.930 
what you see is pretty much what I saw
for<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> first<00:00:34.290> time<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.250> let's<00:00:35.460> launch<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
for the first time so let's launch the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.270 
for the first time so let's launch the
application<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.960> let's<00:00:37.920> go<00:00:38.219> to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
application up and let's go to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.130 
application up and let's go to
performance<00:00:39.090> test<00:00:39.329> battery<00:00:39.780> tells<00:00:39.989> will

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
performance test battery tells will

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.440 
performance test battery tells will
probably<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.649> another<00:00:40.920> video<00:00:41.190> if<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.270> want

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
probably be in another video if you want

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.000 
probably be in another video if you want
to<00:00:42.510> see<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.870> then<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.140> course<00:00:43.410> let<00:00:43.680> me<00:00:43.800> know

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
to see that then of course let me know

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.040 
to see that then of course let me know
if<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.850> important<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:45.510> this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
if it's really that important but this

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.229 
if it's really that important but this
moment<00:00:46.469> mostly<00:00:47.129> testing<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.670> performance<00:00:48.149> of

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
moment mostly testing the performance of

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.090 
moment mostly testing the performance of
the<00:00:48.390> battery<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.960> considered<00:00:49.559> performance

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the battery is considered performance

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.119 
the battery is considered performance
let's<00:00:50.879> go<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> Egypt<00:00:51.780> HD<00:00:52.199> which<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
let's go to Egypt HD which is the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.650 
let's go to Egypt HD which is the
regular<00:00:53.280> test<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.930> let's<00:00:55.170> start<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.660> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
regular test so let's start and it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.209 
regular test so let's start and it
increases<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.289> brightness<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.190> uh

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
increases the brightness here so uh

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.510 
increases the brightness here so uh
that's<00:00:59.910> not<00:01:00.180> me<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:01.109> how<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.129> test

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
that's not me it's just how the test

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.070 
that's not me it's just how the test
works<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.329> flip<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.600> over<00:01:03.750> here

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
works see if we can flip it over here

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.700 
works see if we can flip it over here
and<00:01:04.489> no<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.670> can't<00:01:06.030> flip<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> over<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
and no we can't flip it over so it's a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.649 
and no we can't flip it over so it's a
loading<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> normal<00:01:09.060> game<00:01:09.420> and

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
loading so just like a normal game and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.539 
loading so just like a normal game and
now<00:01:10.650> here's<00:01:10.950> what<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.130> looks<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:13.549> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
now here's what it looks like so the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.730 
now here's what it looks like so the
graphics<00:01:15.030> overall<00:01:15.450> look<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.320> nice<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
graphics overall look really nice it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.249 
graphics overall look really nice it
looks<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.360> something<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.570> an<00:01:18.900> unreal

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
looks like something that an unreal

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.990 
looks like something that an unreal
engine<00:01:19.619> would<00:01:19.770> use<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.759> see

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
engine would use but as you can see

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.539 
engine would use but as you can see
there<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> little<00:01:21.659> bit<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.840> lag<00:01:22.049> here<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.400> as

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
there is a little bit of lag here but as

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.130 
there is a little bit of lag here but as
you<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.790> see<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.180> not<00:01:24.360> really<00:01:24.659> optimized

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
you can see it's not really optimized

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
you can see it's not really optimized
for<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.470> fifth<00:01:25.650> generation<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.729> an

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
for the fifth generation it's just an

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.230 
for the fifth generation it's just an
overall<00:01:27.180> broad<00:01:27.720> test<00:01:28.189> so<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.460> test<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:30.030> be

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
overall broad test so this test can be

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.109 
overall broad test so this test can be
on<00:01:30.450> other<00:01:30.659> devices<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.590> well<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.610> let's<00:01:32.909> get

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
on other devices as well so let's get

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.130 
on other devices as well so let's get
more<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.990> close-up<00:01:34.470> here<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.070> guys<00:01:35.130> and

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
more of a close-up here for you guys and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.840 
more of a close-up here for you guys and
let's<00:01:37.140> actually<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:37.920> how<00:01:38.130> well<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> graphics

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
let's actually see how well the graphics

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.359 
let's actually see how well the graphics
are<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.329> looks<00:01:39.420> really<00:01:39.689> nice<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.100> par<00:01:41.340> with

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
are it looks really nice up to par with

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.490 
are it looks really nice up to par with
games<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.030> infinity<00:01:42.630> blade<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:43.110> something

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
games like infinity blade or something

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.350 
games like infinity blade or something
of<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.649> standard<00:01:44.159> let's<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.210> can

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
of that standard let's see if we can

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.810 
of that standard let's see if we can
stabilize<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.710> yeah<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.640> pretty

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
stabilize it here so yeah this is pretty

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
stabilize it here so yeah this is pretty
much<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.720> go<00:01:51.930> through<00:01:51.960> count<00:01:52.590> how

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
much going to just go through count how

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.710 
much going to just go through count how
many<00:01:52.799> frames<00:01:53.159> per<00:01:53.430> second<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:53.939> average<00:01:54.420> this

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
many frames per second on average this

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.770 
many frames per second on average this
can<00:01:54.960> handle<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:57.090> graphic<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.570> we're<00:01:57.719> all

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
can handle and the graphic so we're all

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.330 
can handle and the graphic so we're all
really<00:01:58.020> nice<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.469> course<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.979> little<00:01:59.009> bit

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
really nice of course it's a little bit

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.520 
really nice of course it's a little bit
jerky<00:01:59.640> as<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.450> fifth<00:02:00.630> generation<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.229> not<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
jerky as the fifth generation is not the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.389 
jerky as the fifth generation is not the
most<00:02:01.829> powerful<00:02:02.310> device<00:02:02.790> out<00:02:02.969> there<00:02:03.469> so<00:02:04.469> yeah

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
most powerful device out there so yeah

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.969 
most powerful device out there so yeah
it's<00:02:05.610> pretty<00:02:05.790> much<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.320> loading<00:02:07.320> pretty

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
it's pretty much just loading pretty

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.070 
it's pretty much just loading pretty
laggy<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.640> guess<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.209> some<00:02:09.479> points<00:02:09.899> other

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
laggy I guess and some points other

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.110 
laggy I guess and some points other
points<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.560> looks<00:02:10.770> just<00:02:11.129> fine<00:02:11.340> as<00:02:11.610> right<00:02:11.970> now

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
points it looks just fine as right now

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.730 
points it looks just fine as right now
it's<00:02:12.270> panic

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
it's panic

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.370 
it's panic
so<00:02:12.920> looks<00:02:13.640> pretty<00:02:13.880> nice<00:02:14.060> now<00:02:14.360> but<00:02:14.870> then<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.260> got

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
so looks pretty nice now but then it got

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.580 
so looks pretty nice now but then it got
jerky<00:02:15.860> again<00:02:16.630> so<00:02:17.630> yeah<00:02:17.900> this<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.200> going<00:02:18.410> to

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
jerky again so yeah this is going to

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.020 
jerky again so yeah this is going to
take<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.790> while<00:02:20.110> perhaps<00:02:21.110> even<00:02:21.320> out<00:02:21.740> five<00:02:22.100> more

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
take a while perhaps even out five more

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.380 
take a while perhaps even out five more
minutes<00:02:24.400> because<00:02:25.400> it's<00:02:25.550> just<00:02:25.610> testing<00:02:26.180> some

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
minutes because it's just testing some

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.250 
minutes because it's just testing some
things<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.720> now<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.840> can<00:02:26.960> see<00:02:27.080> like<00:02:27.230> a

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
things and now you can see like a

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.570 
things and now you can see like a
battlefield<00:02:27.590> or<00:02:28.100> something<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:31.280> graphics

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
battlefield or something the graphics

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.370 
battlefield or something the graphics
look<00:02:31.790> pretty<00:02:32.030> nice<00:02:32.240> if<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.840> don't<00:02:33.020> know<00:02:33.140> it

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
look pretty nice if you don't know it

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.940 
look pretty nice if you don't know it
looks<00:02:33.560> up<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:34.010> par<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.840> maybe<00:02:35.840> it's<00:02:36.290> better

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
looks up to par of maybe it's better

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.160 
looks up to par of maybe it's better
than<00:02:37.190> ps2<00:02:38.140> what<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.170> ps2<00:02:39.620> can<00:02:39.800> handle<00:02:40.130> morva

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
than ps2 what a ps2 can handle morva

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.690 
than ps2 what a ps2 can handle morva
it's<00:02:42.170> safe<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.620> say<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.100> looks<00:02:43.280> more<00:02:43.490> like

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
it's safe to say that it looks more like

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.330 
it's safe to say that it looks more like
ps3<00:02:44.030> graphics<00:02:44.750> even<00:02:45.020> though<00:02:45.140> not<00:02:45.410> up<00:02:45.620> just<00:02:45.830> up

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
ps3 graphics even though not up just up

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.500 
ps3 graphics even though not up just up
to<00:02:46.400> par<00:02:46.820> with<00:02:46.850> ps3<00:02:47.300> it<00:02:47.960> looks<00:02:48.110> pretty<00:02:48.260> close<00:02:49.510> so

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
to par with ps3 it looks pretty close so

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.570 
to par with ps3 it looks pretty close so
yeah<00:02:50.810> um<00:02:53.860> sort<00:02:54.860> of<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.070> lighting<00:02:55.400> isn't

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
yeah um sort of the lighting isn't

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.310 
yeah um sort of the lighting isn't
perfect<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.150> just<00:02:56.360> wasn't<00:02:56.540> expecting<00:02:56.720> the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
perfect I just wasn't expecting the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.040 
perfect I just wasn't expecting the
brightness<00:02:57.770> to<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:59.000> know<00:02:59.120> increase<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.020> I

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
brightness to you know increase so I

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.930 
brightness to you know increase so I
just<00:03:00.410> wanted<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.920> be<00:03:01.040> fair<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:01.670> that's<00:03:01.850> the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
just wanted it to be fair so that's the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.310 
just wanted it to be fair so that's the
first<00:03:02.180> time<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.510> you're<00:03:02.780> watching<00:03:03.170> this

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
first time that you're watching this

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.670 
first time that you're watching this
because<00:03:03.530> yeah<00:03:04.310> I'm<00:03:04.610> right<00:03:04.970> there<00:03:05.270> so<00:03:06.260> it's<00:03:06.560> a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
because yeah I'm right there so it's a

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.900 
because yeah I'm right there so it's a
loading<00:03:07.040> now<00:03:07.070> don't<00:03:07.520> know<00:03:07.610> what<00:03:07.700> it's<00:03:07.790> going

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
loading now don't know what it's going

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.980 
loading now don't know what it's going
to<00:03:07.970> load<00:03:08.120> up<00:03:08.270> next<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:10.610> let's<00:03:10.970> see<00:03:11.210> what<00:03:11.420> other

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
to load up next so let's see what other

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.320 
to load up next so let's see what other
things<00:03:12.560> in<00:03:12.800> store<00:03:13.070> so<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.880> reason<00:03:14.030> I'm<00:03:14.300> not

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
things in store so the reason I'm not

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.930 
things in store so the reason I'm not
restarting<00:03:14.990> this<00:03:15.110> video<00:03:15.440> or<00:03:15.800> trying<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:16.790> make

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
restarting this video or trying to make

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.490 
restarting this video or trying to make
the<00:03:17.060> lighting<00:03:17.420> just<00:03:17.450> right<00:03:18.080> it's<00:03:18.230> because

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
the lighting just right it's because

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.590 
the lighting just right it's because
it's<00:03:18.680> my<00:03:18.800> first<00:03:19.100> time<00:03:19.220> loading<00:03:19.580> it<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.000> of

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
it's my first time loading it and of

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.970 
it's my first time loading it and of
course<00:03:20.630> as<00:03:21.020> they<00:03:21.110> just<00:03:21.320> mentioned<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:21.770> just

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
course as they just mentioned I just

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.210 
course as they just mentioned I just
wanted<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.400> be<00:03:22.520> fair<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:24.740> looks<00:03:24.920> like<00:03:25.010> it's

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
wanted to be fair so it looks like it's

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.670 
wanted to be fair so it looks like it's
just<00:03:25.280> counting<00:03:25.850> some<00:03:26.060> dots<00:03:26.420> or<00:03:26.780> some<00:03:27.050> patterns

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
just counting some dots or some patterns

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.030 
just counting some dots or some patterns
right<00:03:28.370> here<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.870> let's<00:03:30.290> just<00:03:30.440> wait<00:03:30.710> for<00:03:30.890> this

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
right here and let's just wait for this

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.310 
right here and let's just wait for this
I<00:03:31.340> don't<00:03:31.970> know<00:03:32.060> what<00:03:32.450> significance<00:03:32.690> this<00:03:33.140> has

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
I don't know what significance this has

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.590 
I don't know what significance this has
maybe<00:03:33.620> it's<00:03:33.860> just<00:03:33.970> calculating<00:03:34.970> its<00:03:35.120> results

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
maybe it's just calculating its results

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.350 
maybe it's just calculating its results
or<00:03:35.690> something<00:03:36.460> so<00:03:37.460> I<00:03:37.490> don't<00:03:37.760> think<00:03:37.910> this<00:03:38.090> test

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
or something so I don't think this test

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.410 
or something so I don't think this test
is<00:03:38.450> going<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.810> take<00:03:38.990> as<00:03:39.110> long<00:03:39.320> as<00:03:39.500> I<00:03:39.560> thought<00:03:39.800> so

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
is going to take as long as I thought so

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.910 
is going to take as long as I thought so
it<00:03:41.420> still<00:03:41.750> took<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:41.990> good<00:03:42.260> two<00:03:42.470> minutes<00:03:42.590> or

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
it still took a good two minutes or

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.010 
it still took a good two minutes or
something<00:03:43.070> I<00:03:43.430> think<00:03:43.820> this<00:03:44.390> is<00:03:44.450> still<00:03:44.810> part<00:03:44.930> of

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
something I think this is still part of

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.840 
something I think this is still part of
the<00:03:45.110> test<00:03:45.350> so<00:03:46.030> yeah<00:03:48.340> 499<00:03:49.340> for<00:03:49.490> this

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
the test so yeah 499 for this

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.850 
the test so yeah 499 for this
application<00:03:50.030> i<00:03:50.570> mean<00:03:51.080> it<00:03:51.200> pretty<00:03:51.440> much<00:03:51.620> saw

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
application i mean it pretty much saw

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.090 
application i mean it pretty much saw
what's<00:03:52.280> going<00:03:52.610> on<00:03:52.930> albeit<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:54.110> few<00:03:54.440> other<00:03:54.590> tests

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
what's going on albeit a few other tests

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.550 
what's going on albeit a few other tests
that<00:03:55.160> are<00:03:55.280> in<00:03:55.730> this<00:03:55.970> application<00:03:56.210> but<00:03:56.930> there's

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
that are in this application but there's

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.320 
that are in this application but there's
nothing<00:03:57.830> really<00:03:57.980> more<00:03:58.250> this<00:03:58.490> pretty<00:03:58.940> much<00:03:59.120> as

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
nothing really more this pretty much as

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.950 
nothing really more this pretty much as
far<00:03:59.360> as<00:03:59.780> performance<00:04:00.290> Tesco's<00:04:01.190> so<00:04:01.720> five<00:04:02.720> bucks

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
far as performance Tesco's so five bucks

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:14.080 
far as performance Tesco's so five bucks
wasted<00:04:03.440> i<00:04:03.650> think<00:04:04.190> so

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.060 

hopefully<00:04:14.989> this<00:04:15.200> doesn't<00:04:15.410> go<00:04:15.590> on<00:04:15.739> for<00:04:15.950> any

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
hopefully this doesn't go on for any

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.430 
hopefully this doesn't go on for any
longer<00:04:16.340> it's<00:04:16.820> just<00:04:17.000> uncut<00:04:17.449> of<00:04:17.630> course<00:04:17.870> editing

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
longer it's just uncut of course editing

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.520 
longer it's just uncut of course editing
this<00:04:18.590> out<00:04:18.829> would<00:04:19.040> make<00:04:19.220> any<00:04:19.400> sense<00:04:20.199> of<00:04:21.199> course

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
this out would make any sense of course

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.500 
this out would make any sense of course
it<00:04:21.739> would<00:04:21.859> make<00:04:22.100> viewing<00:04:22.820> pleasure<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.210> little

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
it would make viewing pleasure a little

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.110 
it would make viewing pleasure a little
bit<00:04:23.630> more<00:04:23.840> adequate<00:04:24.830> but<00:04:25.070> oh<00:04:25.870> well<00:04:27.729> so<00:04:28.729> gaming

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
bit more adequate but oh well so gaming

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.820 
bit more adequate but oh well so gaming

week<00:04:36.350> perhaps<00:04:36.560> depending<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:37.639> mean<00:04:37.880> I<00:04:38.060> don't

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
week perhaps depending I mean I don't

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.790 
week perhaps depending I mean I don't
know<00:04:38.660> if<00:04:38.690> I<00:04:38.840> have<00:04:38.930> a<00:04:38.990> schedule<00:04:39.380> for<00:04:39.410> what's<00:04:39.680> on

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
know if I have a schedule for what's on

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.580 
know if I have a schedule for what's on
my<00:04:39.889> ipod<00:04:39.979> touch<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:41.270> depends<00:04:41.810> if<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:42.440> could

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
my ipod touch it depends if you could

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.810 
my ipod touch it depends if you could
pretty<00:04:42.740> much<00:04:42.830> comment<00:04:43.160> what<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.460> want<00:04:43.729> to

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
pretty much comment what you want to

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.760 
pretty much comment what you want to
schedule<00:04:44.030> be<00:04:44.419> not<00:04:44.870> every<00:04:45.169> day<00:04:45.199> though<00:04:45.380> because

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
schedule be not every day though because

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.040 
schedule be not every day though because
I<00:04:45.889> won't<00:04:46.190> be<00:04:46.310> able<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.520> make<00:04:46.639> it<00:04:46.700> every<00:04:46.940> day

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
I won't be able to make it every day

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.200 
I won't be able to make it every day
perhaps<00:04:48.050> like<00:04:48.260> every<00:04:48.650> 3-4<00:04:49.310> days<00:04:49.520> but<00:04:50.000> then<00:04:50.180> I

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
perhaps like every 3-4 days but then I

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.510 
perhaps like every 3-4 days but then I
wouldn't<00:04:50.600> really<00:04:50.720> have<00:04:50.930> much<00:04:51.169> changed<00:04:51.770> as<00:04:51.979> the

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
wouldn't really have much changed as the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.310 
wouldn't really have much changed as the
days<00:04:52.700> progress<00:04:52.880> every<00:04:53.600> three<00:04:53.840> or<00:04:53.870> four<00:04:53.990> days

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
days progress every three or four days

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.290 
days progress every three or four days
so<00:04:54.680> maybe<00:04:54.950> want<00:04:55.250> to<00:04:55.310> see<00:04:55.460> every<00:04:55.700> week<00:04:55.940> or<00:04:56.120> two

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
so maybe want to see every week or two

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.510 
so maybe want to see every week or two
weeks<00:04:56.479> depending<00:04:57.080> is<00:04:57.590> usually<00:04:58.070> every<00:04:58.340> two

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
weeks depending is usually every two

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.219 
weeks depending is usually every two
weeks<00:04:58.729> I<00:04:59.000> would<00:04:59.180> have<00:04:59.330> changed<00:04:59.600> my<00:04:59.780> layout<00:05:00.200> a

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
weeks I would have changed my layout a

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.659 
weeks I would have changed my layout a
little<00:05:00.560> bit<00:05:00.710> so<00:05:00.919> it<00:05:01.100> would<00:05:01.220> make<00:05:01.430> more<00:05:01.610> sense

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
little bit so it would make more sense

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.690 
little bit so it would make more sense
to<00:05:02.330> or<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:02.960> would<00:05:03.110> make<00:05:03.290> more<00:05:03.530> sense<00:05:03.590> to<00:05:04.130> make

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
to or it would make more sense to make

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.170 
to or it would make more sense to make
my<00:05:04.880> videos<00:05:05.150> then<00:05:06.370> okay<00:05:07.370> so<00:05:07.430> this<00:05:07.760> pretty<00:05:08.060> much

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
my videos then okay so this pretty much

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.570 
my videos then okay so this pretty much
is<00:05:08.419> counting<00:05:08.900> everything<00:05:09.080> okay<00:05:09.740> finally

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
is counting everything okay finally

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.770 
is counting everything okay finally
results<00:05:11.270> so<00:05:11.780> here's<00:05:12.500> what<00:05:12.680> it<00:05:12.770> says<00:05:13.510> so<00:05:14.510> it

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
results so here's what it says so it

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.529 
results so here's what it says so it
played<00:05:15.050> for<00:05:15.350> an<00:05:15.440> average<00:05:15.889> of<00:05:16.010> 19<00:05:16.580> frames<00:05:17.150> per

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
played for an average of 19 frames per

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.260 
played for an average of 19 frames per
second<00:05:18.250> off-screen<00:05:19.250> it<00:05:19.520> played<00:05:19.789> for<00:05:19.970> 12

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
second off-screen it played for 12

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.779 
second off-screen it played for 12
frames<00:05:20.510> per<00:05:20.840> second<00:05:21.280> which<00:05:22.280> I<00:05:22.490> don't<00:05:22.550> know

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
frames per second which I don't know

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.940 
frames per second which I don't know
what<00:05:23.090> all<00:05:23.240> scream<00:05:23.570> means<00:05:23.750> but<00:05:23.960> this<00:05:24.139> is<00:05:24.410> the

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
what all scream means but this is the

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.270 
what all scream means but this is the
final<00:05:25.370> uh<00:05:25.630> you<00:05:26.630> know<00:05:26.750> results<00:05:27.200> so<00:05:27.470> it<00:05:27.650> played

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
final uh you know results so it played

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.240 
final uh you know results so it played
that<00:05:28.610> which<00:05:29.030> is<00:05:29.270> supposed<00:05:30.200> to<00:05:30.289> be<00:05:30.380> like<00:05:30.440> really

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
that which is supposed to be like really

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.490 
that which is supposed to be like really
really<00:05:31.580> powerful<00:05:31.910> and<00:05:32.330> it<00:05:32.479> played<00:05:32.720> it<00:05:32.870> at<00:05:32.990> 19

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
really powerful and it played it at 19

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.640 
really powerful and it played it at 19
frames<00:05:33.860> per<00:05:34.130> second<00:05:34.780> that's<00:05:35.780> pretty<00:05:36.289> much<00:05:36.440> the

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
frames per second that's pretty much the

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.940 
frames per second that's pretty much the
same<00:05:37.280> it's<00:05:37.669> on<00:05:38.030> par<00:05:38.330> with<00:05:38.599> the<00:05:38.750> ipad<00:05:39.380> mini<00:05:39.710> and

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
same it's on par with the ipad mini and

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.469 
same it's on par with the ipad mini and
it's<00:05:40.550> on<00:05:40.729> par<00:05:41.090> with<00:05:41.419> the<00:05:41.870> iphone<00:05:42.500> 4s<00:05:42.950> as<00:05:43.160> well

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
it's on par with the iphone 4s as well

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.089 
it's on par with the iphone 4s as well
so<00:05:44.479> yeah<00:05:44.840> that's<00:05:45.050> it<00:05:45.349> pretty<00:05:45.620> much<00:05:45.860> matches
