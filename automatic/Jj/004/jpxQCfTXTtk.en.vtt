00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:31.039
 type of seconds it will be shown before

 everyone saw that cool 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:38.040
 hi friends and I want this video 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.260
 begin to delve into the theory of how a 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.020
 You can still catch on the foam 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.629
 because no theory yet you can not 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.360
 improve your results more is you 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.420
 there will be accidents all the same than 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.260
 regular regular fishing large 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.719
 fish 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.710
 here are most fishermen fishing by 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.940
 old stereotype and he accordingly 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.579
 small fish 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.710
 but if you get there table cheeks 200 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.400
 300 grams then this is for never considered 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.290
 a big event we need to understand that 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.990
 absence to ask such a question how much 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.830
 fish live to industrial size 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.320
 wing counts up to 2 kilograms average 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.590
 grows up and most mercy street 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.380
 so here it is necessary to understand that from 400-500 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.740
 thousand eggs live to the sexual 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.220
 maturity and postponing mean and circle by 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.630
 new only whole summer units also 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.299
 we manage to identify this big fish on 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.659
 our death is to understand it 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:47.399
 let's start with such an organ in fish to the lateral 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.380
 lines what it is but each 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.119
 fish if you carefully consider 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.450
 then you see this means striped and he 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.520
 seen if you look pretty good 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.680
 what is this this sixth sense so 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.469
 called fish 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.310
 which allows you to navigate in 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.780
 surrounding space than say so 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.360
 This is a device that 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.590
 catch the vibrations of the water it is very 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.190
 important because here's to big fish 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.680
 went to our gear she should here 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.480
 these vibrations catch what vibrations 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.810
 fluctuations 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.650
 the production of small fish around 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.010
 feeders 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.150
 begin vanity small fish and when we 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.620
 in the opposite of the purse nps allow 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.260
 begins initially fit 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.410
 Of course small fish to begins here these 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.500
 movements of small fish she there you roll 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.510
 why it is impossible to cut 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.340
 besides some such twitchings 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.430
 that's exactly why you have to wait 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.550
 the big fish the following videos we will 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.090
 consider all other nuances of everything 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.090
 good luck
