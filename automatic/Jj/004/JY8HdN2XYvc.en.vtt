he's going to continue to do this

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.090 
he's going to continue to do this
because<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.660> his<00:01:03.809> mind<00:01:04.110> he<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.260> playing<00:01:04.680> stress

of the ball does not move out of its
start<00:01:12.990> position<00:01:13.530> or<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:13.950> go<00:01:14.280> ball<00:01:14.640> around

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
start position or you can go ball around

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.870 
start position or you can go ball around
the<00:01:15.360> hands<00:01:15.840> where<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> hands<00:01:16.710> don't<00:01:16.950> move<00:01:17.189> but

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the hands where the hands don't move but

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.499 
the hands where the hands don't move but
the<00:01:18.030> balls<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.630> center<00:01:19.880> moves<00:01:20.880> six<00:01:21.180> eight<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the balls the center moves six eight and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.289 
the balls the center moves six eight and
eight<00:01:21.600> inches<00:01:21.840> right<00:01:22.320> right<00:01:23.159> now<00:01:23.490> your

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
eight inches right right now your

was<00:01:56.719> non-existent<00:01:57.719> your<00:01:58.680> tendency<00:01:59.189> was<00:01:59.310> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
was non-existent your tendency was to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.600 
was non-existent your tendency was to
slam<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.969> way<00:02:00.149> over<00:02:00.180> here<00:02:00.810> now<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.189> moved

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
slam it way over here now you just moved

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.910 
slam it way over here now you just moved
it<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> little<00:02:03.240> bit<00:02:03.509> right<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.409> did<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.799> in

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it a little bit right of you did so in

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.850 
it a little bit right of you did so in
two<00:02:05.070> ways<00:02:05.250> one<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:06.570> move<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.170> ball<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.619> little

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
two ways one you move the ball a little

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.199 
two ways one you move the ball a little
and<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:09.119> stepped<00:02:09.539> away<00:02:10.039> from<00:02:11.039> your<00:02:11.280> walk<00:02:11.879> path

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
and you stepped away from your walk path

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.820 
and you stepped away from your walk path
and<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.050> I'm<00:02:13.170> not

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
and so I'm not

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.190 
and so I'm not
directing<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> walk<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> straight<00:02:14.820> line

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
directing you to walk a straight line

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.170 
directing you to walk a straight line
okay<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.800> would<00:02:17.100> like<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.430> teach<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.000> a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
okay but I would like to teach you on a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.780 
okay but I would like to teach you on a
straight<00:02:18.570> line<00:02:18.710> so<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:20.100> grasp<00:02:20.430> what

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
straight line so that you can grasp what

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.970 
straight line so that you can grasp what
I'm<00:02:20.910> trying<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.330> get<00:02:21.510> at<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.900> then<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.800> can

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
I'm trying to get at and then you can

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.150 
I'm trying to get at and then you can
start<00:02:23.340> instead<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.330> your<00:02:25.230> feet<00:02:25.530> are<00:02:25.680> pointing

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
start instead of your feet are pointing

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.240 
start instead of your feet are pointing
straight<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:26.790> you're<00:02:27.000> Criss<00:02:27.330> crossing<00:02:28.020> I

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
straight but you're Criss crossing I

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.160 
straight but you're Criss crossing I
want<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.490> be<00:02:29.610> able<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.150> turn<00:02:30.420> your<00:02:30.450> feet<00:02:30.990> as

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
want you to be able to turn your feet as

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.600 
want you to be able to turn your feet as
to<00:02:31.500> walk<00:02:31.770> straight<00:02:33.080> lateral<00:02:34.130> exactly<00:02:35.130> so

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
to walk straight lateral exactly so

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.490 
to walk straight lateral exactly so
therefore<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.150> migrate<00:02:36.420> left<00:02:36.930> or<00:02:37.200> right

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
therefore you can migrate left or right

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.400 
therefore you can migrate left or right
but<00:02:38.010> you're<00:02:38.130> doing<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.690> in<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.900> direction<00:02:40.200> of

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
but you're doing so in the direction of

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.590 
but you're doing so in the direction of
your<00:02:40.530> feet<00:02:40.740> are<00:02:40.890> pointing<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.430> not<00:02:42.090> by

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
your feet are pointing and not by

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.590 
your feet are pointing and not by
crossing<00:02:43.110> one<00:02:43.620> another<00:02:43.920> now<00:02:44.670> ultimately<00:02:45.150> in

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
crossing one another now ultimately in

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.230 
crossing one another now ultimately in
Bowen<00:02:45.990> we<00:02:46.260> want<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.590> walk<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.830> tightrope<00:02:47.220> when<00:02:48.210> I

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
Bowen we want to walk a tightrope when I

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.240 
Bowen we want to walk a tightrope when I
say<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.570> type<00:02:48.870> role<00:02:49.110> that's<00:02:49.290> one<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:49.740> front<00:02:50.130> of

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
say a type role that's one in front of

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.420 
say a type role that's one in front of
the<00:02:50.340> other<00:02:50.520> not<00:02:50.880> one<00:02:51.590> left<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.310> other

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
the other not one left of the other

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.910 
the other not one left of the other
which<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.060> what<00:02:54.240> your<00:02:54.450> second<00:02:54.900> step<00:02:55.110> does<00:02:55.410> you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
which is what your second step does you

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.080 
which is what your second step does you
know<00:02:56.010> sometimes<00:02:56.459> I'm<00:02:56.640> walking<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.060> straight

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
know sometimes I'm walking a straight

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.710 
know sometimes I'm walking a straight
line<00:02:57.570> but<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.290> might<00:02:58.620> be<00:02:58.970> opened<00:02:59.970> up<00:03:00.120> walking

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
line but I might be opened up walking

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.770 
line but I might be opened up walking
that<00:03:01.110> straight<00:03:01.440> line<00:03:01.650> as<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.880> open<00:03:03.030> my<00:03:03.330> waist

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
that straight line as to open my waist

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.170 
that straight line as to open my waist
up<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.380> lot<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.070> times<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.430> may<00:03:05.640> walk<00:03:05.790> straight

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
up a lot of times I may walk straight

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.510 
up a lot of times I may walk straight
line<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.540> there<00:03:06.780> pivot<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.680> then<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:08.130> straight

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
line to there pivot and then a straight

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.480 
line to there pivot and then a straight
line<00:03:08.730> out<00:03:09.030> toward<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.870> tenpin<00:03:10.190> well<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.340> that

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
line out toward the tenpin well in that

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.670 
line out toward the tenpin well in that
case<00:03:11.550> I'm<00:03:11.910> walking<00:03:12.330> straight<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.870> then

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
case I'm walking straight and then

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.160 
case I'm walking straight and then
pivoting<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.970> going<00:03:15.270> this<00:03:15.420> way<00:03:15.630> it's

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
pivoting and going this way it's

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.590 
pivoting and going this way it's
infinite<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:17.580> we're<00:03:17.790> going<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.000> teach<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.239> the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
infinite so we're going to teach you the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.470 
infinite so we're going to teach you the
square<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.470> square<00:03:19.650> first<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.300> then<00:03:21.450> you

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
square to square first so that then you

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.840 
square to square first so that then you
can<00:03:21.570> add<00:03:21.930> versions<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.940> okay<00:03:24.570> go<00:03:24.930> for<00:03:25.140> it

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
can add versions to that okay go for it

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.979 
can add versions to that okay go for it
I'm<00:03:26.850> going<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.030> give<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.300> little<00:03:27.630> bit<00:03:27.870> of

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
I'm going to give you a little bit of

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.910 
I'm going to give you a little bit of
help<00:03:29.900> remember<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:30.959> told<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.260> when<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.680> crease

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
help remember I told you when you crease

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.620 
help remember I told you when you crease
the<00:03:32.040> paper<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.550> have<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.880> crease<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.360> the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
the paper you have to crease it the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.020 
the paper you have to crease it the
other<00:03:33.780> way<00:03:33.959> your<00:03:34.739> second<00:03:35.190> step<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.580> want<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:35.910> to

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
other way your second step I want you to

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.840 
other way your second step I want you to
try<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.560> step<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.070> right<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:38.610> you're<00:03:38.730> going

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
try to step to the right so you're going

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.140 
try to step to the right so you're going
to<00:03:38.880> go<00:03:39.000> one<00:03:39.560> two<00:03:40.560> you're<00:03:41.550> going<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.730> try<00:03:42.120> to

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
to go one two you're going to try to

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.000 
to go one two you're going to try to
step<00:03:42.570> right<00:03:42.890> okay

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
step right okay

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.729 
step right okay
and<00:03:44.180> secondly<00:03:45.180> I'm<00:03:45.480> going<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:45.989> put<00:03:46.170> my<00:03:46.320> finger

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
and secondly I'm going to put my finger

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.190 
and secondly I'm going to put my finger
on<00:03:46.769> your<00:03:47.040> ball<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.610> I'm<00:03:47.730> going<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.200> restrict

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
on your ball and I'm going to restrict

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:57.150 
on your ball and I'm going to restrict
its<00:03:50.030> tendency<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.209> move<00:03:51.420> toward<00:03:51.900> me<00:03:52.170> okay

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.290 

all<00:03:57.760> right<00:03:57.850> much<00:03:58.240> better<00:03:58.510> like<00:03:59.020> it<00:03:59.850> like<00:04:00.850> that

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
believe I've ever been see this it's too

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.850 
believe I've ever been see this it's too
much<00:04:06.310> motion<00:04:06.670> with<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.390> it<00:04:08.170> balls<00:04:08.350> too<00:04:08.590> close

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
much motion with and it balls too close

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.550 
much motion with and it balls too close
to<00:04:09.100> you<00:04:09.250> you<00:04:09.880> figure<00:04:10.240> if<00:04:10.450> my<00:04:10.480> objective<00:04:11.410> is<00:04:11.530> to

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
to you you figure if my objective is to

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.740 
to you you figure if my objective is to
get<00:04:11.860> fully<00:04:12.250> extended<00:04:12.940> out<00:04:13.090> in<00:04:13.210> front<00:04:13.450> of<00:04:13.600> me

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
get fully extended out in front of me

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.490 
get fully extended out in front of me
look<00:04:14.350> at<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.890> motion<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:16.209> that<00:04:16.450> takes<00:04:16.780> it

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
look at the motion that that takes it

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.130 
look at the motion that that takes it
means<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.520> have<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.910> go<00:04:19.090> slower<00:04:19.420> with<00:04:19.690> my<00:04:19.870> feet

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
means I have to go slower with my feet

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.080 
means I have to go slower with my feet
so<00:04:20.320> that<00:04:20.350> my<00:04:20.590> arms<00:04:20.920> have<00:04:21.070> time<00:04:21.459> to<00:04:21.790> do<00:04:21.940> it

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
so that my arms have time to do it

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.240 
so that my arms have time to do it
without<00:04:22.480> muscle<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.110> it<00:04:23.230> that's<00:04:23.740> why<00:04:23.950> you<00:04:24.010> hear

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
without muscle in it that's why you hear

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.770 
without muscle in it that's why you hear
people<00:04:24.370> go<00:04:24.640> I<00:04:24.670> got<00:04:24.910> to<00:04:24.940> go<00:04:25.090> slow<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.360> got<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.690> go
