00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
week and I'm going to tell you this is

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.390 
week and I'm going to tell you this is
really<00:00:28.199> really<00:00:28.440> nice<00:00:28.619> three<00:00:28.860> by<00:00:29.010> three<00:00:29.250> and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
really really nice three by three and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.040 
really really nice three by three and
this<00:00:29.640> year<00:00:29.820> 3<00:00:30.119> by<00:00:30.240> 3<00:00:30.300> i've<00:00:30.539> been<00:00:30.690> using<00:00:30.840> this

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
this year 3 by 3 i've been using this

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.479 
this year 3 by 3 i've been using this
whole<00:00:31.260> week<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.680> the<00:00:31.800> reason<00:00:32.160> for<00:00:32.190> that<00:00:32.369> is

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
whole week and the reason for that is

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.880 
whole week and the reason for that is
because<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:33.180> redundancy<00:00:33.660> where<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.320> Q<00:00:34.559> stands

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
because I redundancy where this Q stands

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.590 
because I redundancy where this Q stands
with<00:00:35.129> all<00:00:35.309> my<00:00:35.430> three<00:00:35.489> by<00:00:35.879> three<00:00:36.150> because<00:00:36.480> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
with all my three by three because it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.970 
with all my three by three because it
performs<00:00:36.960> slightly<00:00:37.440> different<00:00:37.800> than<00:00:37.830> my

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
performs slightly different than my

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.830 
performs slightly different than my
other<00:00:38.010> three<00:00:38.370> by<00:00:38.489> threes<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.090> yeah<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.660> just

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
other three by threes and yeah it's just

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.270 
other three by threes and yeah it's just
a<00:00:39.900> different<00:00:40.140> type<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.379> cube<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.949> all<00:00:41.070> my<00:00:41.160> other

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
a different type of cube to all my other

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.130 
a different type of cube to all my other
three<00:00:41.460> by<00:00:41.580> threes<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.239> I've<00:00:42.330> loop<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.809> tension

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
three by threes so I've loop and tension

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.229 
three by threes so I've loop and tension
this<00:00:43.290> cube<00:00:43.530> as<00:00:43.680> always<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.430> now<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.699> my<00:00:45.000> full

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
this cube as always and now to my full

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.299 
this cube as always and now to my full
review<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.019> performance<00:00:46.470> wise<00:00:46.680> at<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:46.920> Q

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
review so the performance wise at this Q

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.969 
review so the performance wise at this Q
is<00:00:47.610> really<00:00:48.420> regret<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.050> said<00:00:49.260> before<00:00:49.290> so<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:49.979 
is really regret as I said before so the

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:52.060 
is really regret as I said before so the
feel<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.519> cube<00:00:50.850> was<00:00:51.089> kind<00:00:51.330> of<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
feel of this cube was kind of like the

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.770 
feel of this cube was kind of like the
functional<00:00:53.070> envision<00:00:53.519> to<00:00:53.699> mix<00:00:54.239> along<00:00:54.540> with

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
functional envision to mix along with

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.560 
functional envision to mix along with
some<00:00:54.989> smooth<00:00:55.589> butteriness<00:00:56.159> into<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.909> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
some smooth butteriness into it and you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.270 
some smooth butteriness into it and you
guys<00:00:57.690> know<00:00:57.960> how<00:00:58.110> like<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.470> functional<00:00:59.159> vision

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
guys know how like the functional vision

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.460 
guys know how like the functional vision
too<00:00:59.610> and<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.299> no<00:01:00.420> surprise<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:01.110> to<00:01:01.260> why<00:01:01.440> i

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
too and it's no surprise as to why i

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.259 
too and it's no surprise as to why i
like<00:01:01.830> this<00:01:01.979> cube<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.640> when<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.909> solve<00:01:03.150> the

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
like this cube so when you solve the

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.939 
like this cube so when you solve the
skewer<00:01:03.600> play<00:01:03.839> around<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.320> do<00:01:04.500> some<00:01:04.680> songs

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
skewer play around with it do some songs

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.280 
skewer play around with it do some songs
on<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.430> some<00:01:05.580> turns<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.630> may<00:01:06.869> sound

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
on it and some turns on it it may sound

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.840 
on it and some turns on it it may sound
kind<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.650> crispy<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.700> really

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
kind of crispy but it's not really

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.960 
kind of crispy but it's not really
crispy<00:01:09.360> at<00:01:09.479> all<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:10.890> let<00:01:11.040> me<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.250> some<00:01:11.460> turn<00:01:11.729> so

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
crispy at all so let me do some turn so

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:27.069 
crispy at all so let me do some turn so
you<00:01:12.030> guys<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.360> how<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.600> skipper<00:01:12.960> forms

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.240 

so<00:01:28.079> as<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.200> saw<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> performance<00:01:29.070> wise

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
so as you saw the performance wise

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.010 
so as you saw the performance wise
everything<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> turning<00:01:30.509> everything<00:01:30.780> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
everything the turning everything is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.719 
everything the turning everything is
just<00:01:31.170> really<00:01:31.560> really<00:01:31.710> nice<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.399> it's<00:01:32.609> what

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
just really really nice and it's what

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.380 
just really really nice and it's what
corner<00:01:33.000> cutting<00:01:33.210> goes<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:34.490> just<00:01:35.490> standard<00:01:35.909> 45

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
corner cutting goes I just standard 45

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.999 
corner cutting goes I just standard 45
just<00:01:36.659> like<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.049> other<00:01:37.289> three<00:01:37.469> way<00:01:37.649> threes

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
just like all the other three way threes

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.499 
just like all the other three way threes
right<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:38.399> in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> market<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.179> that's<00:01:39.390> what

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
right now in the market so that's what

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
right now in the market so that's what
lockups<00:01:39.869> go<00:01:40.109> this<00:01:40.890> cube<00:01:41.159> had<00:01:41.399> a<00:01:41.429> bit<00:01:41.609> of

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
lockups go this cube had a bit of

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.639 
lockups go this cube had a bit of
catching<00:01:41.939> us<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.539> in<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.749> first<00:01:43.350> three

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
catching us to it in the first three

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.739 
catching us to it in the first three
days<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.219> I<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.609> started<00:01:44.729> breaking<00:01:45.270> this

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:45.749 
days so I just started breaking this

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:47.419 
days so I just started breaking this
Cuban<00:01:46.109> for<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.439> whole<00:01:46.619> week<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.249> if

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
Cuban for this whole week just to see if
