00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.919
 hello everyone is el goleador welcome 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.860
 on ultimate and fifa trading then 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.410
 I hope everyone is doing well 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.090
 me it's going quietly so we get 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.239
 found today for a new 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.610
 list on the mls this time we 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.649
 let's go to the united states side in order to 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.790
 to be able to do some credit and 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.720
 make resale purchase 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.870
 so as a reminder all these players are 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.420
 mainly to buy in auctions the 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.000
 it's very rare that you will find them 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.590
 the price you I is indicated 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.690
 immediate purchase it can happen 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.750
 obviously but not all the time 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.430
 the case then as you could see this 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.829
 are once again the basic players 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.100
 the biggest players are not 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.540
 lace wine or two washes 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.270
 central defenders end both 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.740
 best central defenders of the mls 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.510
 while you can see in the background 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.650
 this is my next presenting 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.260
 this team presentation 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.620
 it's an unbeatable bronze then 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.680
 let's go to the listings at the euro but we 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.950
 have the keeper dan kennedy du chivas has 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.170
 bought between 500 and 1500 credit where we 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.290
 have a shot dj need u and galaxies to 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.460
 buy at 1500 max to sell between 3000 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.799
 and 6000 according to the tactics then we 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.520
 have fernandes dallas bought between 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.210
 thousand bought maxam he 2500 for the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.780
 sale 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.670
 we then have spring sanders 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.880
 finally I do not know how it says 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.189
 here's 2000 between 3500 and 6500 it's a 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.070
 of the best goalkeepers and there we have 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.439
 rimando bought a max mile and at 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.049
 sell between 2500 and 4000 always 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.750
 according to central defense tactics 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:12.129
 we pierce new york 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.540
 buy a mac 500 credits then we 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:19.769
 have glued a central defender 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:23.790
 from sporting i think sporting kc 500 max 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.980
 in purchase then we have some garza 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.040
 that I think I have already presented to you 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.980
 buy at max 500 credits this is a 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.379
 player who works pretty well 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.000
 he liked also praises to buy a mac 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:40.370
 under hoisting you can sell them 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.519
 between 1500 and 3000 according to tactics 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.409
 so john from fc dallas bought at max 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.439
 is without him I usually find you 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.780
 quite often at 500 a shame media whose 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.379
 tried from time to time the same for 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.840
 gonzalez 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.000
 I often find 500 to buy 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.439
 immediate good me I put you 700 for 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.930
 leave them a small margin 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:03.629
 extra so we used a 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.970
 midfielder of sporting bought 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:09.569
 between 300 and 500 to sell between 1200 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.139
 and 2000 2006 for the 82 then we have 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.930
 kerman bought at 300-400 credit 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:18.419
 maximum to sell between 1200 and 1500 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.970
 it's a good average going us 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:24.449
 have screw dynamo houston bought 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.690
 at 500 maximum this is all for the 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:30.780
 backgrounds then on the left side of 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.500
 sanders I think that's what neither bought 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.590
 at 1000 maximum auction then we 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.799
 helped or philadelphia or 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:45.090
 philadelphia in French and hence where to 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:47.069
 buy at maximum 300 then we have 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.519
 castillo de dallas again for 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.790
 the right side bought at 1000 maximum at 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.790
 resell between two and three thousand then 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.889
 on the side of scorers we have that wings 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.689

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:07.650
 2000 and 3000 dynamo houston players 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:10.400
 so we have saborio of rials 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.650
 sautelet than buy at max 500 credits 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.060
