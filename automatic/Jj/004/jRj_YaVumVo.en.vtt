00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.699
 loose guys here pepsi 9700 and gives you 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.520
 welcome to my new video 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.400
 have you ever heard of certain 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.220
 your friends acquaintances maybe that 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.320
 consider some video games for 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.309
 children here is precisely why they are 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.970
 designed for such a credit for 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.960
 young snobbano gamers 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.390
 quilts to say that a greeting 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.969
 as should not waste time and 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.430
 now to do these crap and them 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:59.500
 they only play serious jackies like call of 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:02.230
 duty is the pattern in the opposition that they are 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.140
 instead play boys this small 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.330
 video instead I wanted to talk about this 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.270
 first because it is a real that 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.200
 unfortunately for a long time already about 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:18.150
 of the playstation and how can I say 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.880
 plagues where the world of video games 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.310
 the players who know that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.650
 certain titles being studied 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.690
 ready figs of praise for young people 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.090
 have great potential behind 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.130
 their 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.719
 in fact boys have always been 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.820
 of the opinion that to evaluate a 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:37.659
 video game does not usually take into account 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.420
 only for the age of the age for which it is 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.609
 advised indeed I must say that I 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.340
 like many games than courses 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:48.869
 roofs wounded a friend of 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.600
 from 3 years upwards and for example at 7 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.229
 years up also for example live osaka 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.179
 of sly is already asterix obelix xxl I don't know 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.840
 if against a never played however really 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.950
 a nice game 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.770
 I must say that if we girls plan 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.910
 plan these little video games we'll see 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.030
 which are made with greater care 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.010
 respect 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.069
 been made with titles as is more 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.470
 affected that every year is always me 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.319
 from the ground we also say the last one 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.880
 chapter happened little because the cure 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.360
 with which it was made by Gianni 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.920
 very high black 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.870
 assassin's creed iii certain nest that 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.140
 made with great care but with 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.010
 even harder with some little ones 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.680
 specimens would have succeeded second 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.860
 the second is kept safe 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.580
 chapter that I always consider there 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:49.220
 in fact I think it is the cure with 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.780
 where a video game is developed that 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.519
 guarantees the beauty of a video game 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.980
 in fact, besides taking into account the gameplay 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:02.489
 of the plot in the characterization of the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.590
 characters of longevity and if so 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.440
 the following is news in that 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.629
 he goes on to discuss a chapter I 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.629
 I also consider a lot 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.450
 for this guys I ask to grow of 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.240
 become more mature and disregard 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.120
 fight 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.280
 so at the form here can try one 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.680
 time play those little games like 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.200
 the real the series of readings they have 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.840
 made their lego harry pay TV 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.770
 potter the lord's recent one 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.370
 good that you are seeing 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:44.630
 the gameplay even for an exclusive 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.180
 vico released epic mikey and I don't know what they are 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.830
 still successful however the is available 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.310
 demo of pique mikey 2 for ps3 xbox 360 e 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.050
 also for him 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.170
 and indeed 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.560
 the aja 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:04.520
 in short, asterix ratchet clank are many 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.470
 beautiful games designed for children who 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.830
 divide players into each one a product 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.670
 which however hide great potential 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.380
 I wonder maybe say you do n't talk 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.100
 if you do n't have them very far and only 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.750
 in the moment less names you found them 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.320
 I heard him speak 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.040
 are the municipalities 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.889
 I would say if I really liked them 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.949
 so guys me 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:34.680
 protected what it means maybe maybe not 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.139
 we understand that unfortunately in these 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.749
 last periods tend to think that the 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.939
 video games that are meant 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:44.580
 mainly for an audience of 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:46.729
 young players are snubbed 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.449
