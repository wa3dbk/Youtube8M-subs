00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 here precisely from era I am well also because 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.700
 I found a group of guys who got me 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.069
 they tried very positively 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.200
 and they helped me get into this 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.240
 group and then also for the proximity to 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.219
 house that gives me a lot appoints a hand 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.130
 since in any case they are a quarter of an hour 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.750
 from home and maybe I can hurry up 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.730
 problems also in a very different way 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.539
 from how he used to do in Florence from 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.510
 just feel I see that you have a nuisance to 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.949
 thigh what happened and how are you 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.150
 no no nothing a hit i got one 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.040
 namento I hit the ice 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.620
 prevention but I'm fine I feel the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.630
 Notification mind that you as you are with 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.760
 through the schemes of Indians and 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.800
 it seems to me that the first two are 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.809
 go one extraordinarily well 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.640
 victory with houses or interior too 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.260
 if enough sought in the last one 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.879
 the second time however 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.219
 actually they are six points that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.520
 count and see you up there at the top 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.930
 yes I find myself saying that at the beginning 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.980
 there is a little effort because it is a way anyway 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.350
 new never found in florence for now with 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.910
 training and with lessons 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.549
 let's say the mister indians that anyway 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.790
 very attentive to these things we work 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.630
 on the details I can find myself 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.790
 very well 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.509
 no I have no problem with well anyway a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.090
 part those of s95 however I have a 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.979
 moment to take the larger measurements 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.479
 however , I am very happy about that 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.380
 team because he managed to anyway 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.020
 express what you do a 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.270
 training both at home and at home 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.950
 but that second 1 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.630
 let's say a little liar because we do 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.680
 I will put much more or less to win 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.380
 because we have created many more 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.759
 occasions so we are happy and am 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.240
 working well for the match 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.450
 Sunday 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.460
 here you go out next Sunday 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.009
 from ancona if I am not mistaken it is one 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.720
 trip quite difficult also because 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.930
 the ancon comes from a defeat of 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.549
 reggio emilia and so in short there is a bit 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.079
 then I imagine the anchor to fight 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.600
 probably the team also emblazoned 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.159
 and of category we will have to fight as 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.990
 I think all the guards in the league 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.260
 I don't think that in these in these 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.320
 precisely sampled there are 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.060
 so big differences there us 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.410
 however, as always we will commit to the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.880
 our strength according to me this of 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.040
 always succeed to stay on the piece of 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.960
 we will all fight together as a team 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.230
 this year we will still see how it commands 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.060
 last year the young age and the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.310
 grit precisely of young people have 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.720
 also characterized the events in 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.190
 positive that the pontedera 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.290
 it seems to me that this year the society goes 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.280
 still in this direction support and the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.560
 off to young people 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.690
 yes yes I heard before coming here 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.420
 I talked to the director is precisely the 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.730
 his project that was this to stay 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.920
 here to come here precisely to work 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.530
 with young people and to give youth and space 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.520
 this is verifying where on the field 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.220
 Florentine Florentine hopefully face 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.260
 It was good because it was much anyway 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.880
 I have grown fond of it has become a home 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.760
 for me it's like a family 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.830
 so I hope it looks good I wanted to 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.830
 ask you something if inside it 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.230
 locker room you fear some clubs in fact 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.280
 always in your group, obviously 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.580
 pro and what is in your opinion the one to do 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.410
 more attention for the final rush 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.760
 we try to wind the matches and 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.060
 see how it goes 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.769
 we aim high as we seek to 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.090
 don't stay down that is, we are one 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.690
 team and demonstrate on the piece all the 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.880
 days there are the teams that are anyway 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.530
 the pisa has more to fear 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.959
 surely as shown by the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.150
 field to some last defense however i 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.580
 names are the ones that make a difference on 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.590
 on paper and fixed and lasko on those of 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.180
 more would be ready for Sunday if the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.860
 mister will want it 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.930
 I will always be ready I will always give the 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.310
 maximum and we'll see mister will decide though 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.310
 I would try to answer this
