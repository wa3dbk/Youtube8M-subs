the<00:00:25.820> spot<00:00:26.150> really<00:00:26.540> is<00:00:26.660> an<00:00:26.900> evolution<00:00:27.500> of<00:00:27.560> the

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
the spot really is an evolution of the

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.490 
the spot really is an evolution of the
Vulcan<00:00:28.210> and<00:00:29.210> as<00:00:29.360> our<00:00:29.510> Vogons<00:00:29.869> get<00:00:29.990> better<00:00:30.260> and

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
Vulcan and as our Vogons get better and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.650 
Vulcan and as our Vogons get better and
better<00:00:30.590> we<00:00:31.220> want<00:00:31.460> often<00:00:31.820> find<00:00:32.060> we<00:00:32.270> start<00:00:32.540> to

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
better we want often find we start to

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.180 
better we want often find we start to
get<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.900> board<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.470> a<00:00:33.590> bit<00:00:33.800> of<00:00:33.830> a<00:00:33.950> stock

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
get the board to a bit of a stock

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.670 
get the board to a bit of a stock
rotation<00:00:34.840> so<00:00:35.840> embrace<00:00:36.140> it

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
rotation so embrace it

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.080 
rotation so embrace it
let's<00:00:37.130> go<00:00:37.340> for<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.610> spot<00:00:39.910> we're<00:00:40.910> going<00:00:41.030> to

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
let's go for the spot we're going to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.939 
let's go for the spot we're going to
prepare<00:00:41.239> in<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:41.780> very<00:00:42.140> similar<00:00:42.530> way<00:00:42.680> to<00:00:42.800> the

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
prepare in a very similar way to the

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.220 
prepare in a very similar way to the
Vulcan<00:00:43.570> we're<00:00:44.570> going<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.750> be<00:00:44.809> heading<00:00:45.050> across

Vulcan we're going to be heading across
the<00:00:45.350> wind<00:00:45.650> this<00:00:46.309> time<00:00:46.610> we<00:00:46.760> might<00:00:46.970> head<00:00:47.239> a

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
the wind this time we might head a

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.890 
the wind this time we might head a
little<00:00:47.960> bit<00:00:48.230> now<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.940> focus<00:00:50.449> is<00:00:50.570> slightly

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
little bit now the focus is slightly

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.530 
little bit now the focus is slightly
different<00:00:51.400> we<00:00:52.400> need<00:00:52.670> to<00:00:52.820> make<00:00:53.000> sure<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.360> rig

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
different we need to make sure the rig

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.500 
different we need to make sure the rig
is<00:00:53.690> very<00:00:54.050> very<00:00:54.470> shifted<00:00:55.010> in<00:00:55.129> to<00:00:55.820> give<00:00:56.090> us<00:00:56.239> time

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
is very very shifted in to give us time

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.139 
is very very shifted in to give us time
to<00:00:56.720> rotate<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:57.230> board<00:00:57.460> so<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:58.550> might<00:00:58.790> slide

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
to rotate the board so you might slide

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.209 
to rotate the board so you might slide
the<00:00:59.300> back<00:00:59.540> a<00:01:00.050> little<00:01:00.260> further<00:01:00.590> down<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.040> boom

we'll just make sure it's super sheeted
in<00:01:03.790> especially<00:01:04.790> if<00:01:05.270> we<00:01:05.600> head<00:01:05.780> off<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.140> wind

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
in especially if we head off the wind
