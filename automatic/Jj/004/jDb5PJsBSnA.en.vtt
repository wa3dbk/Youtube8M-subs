00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:05.959
 hi everyone i am luigi i am a doctor in sport physiology 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.810
 or 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.810
 talk to the daughter's heart conduction system 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:14.339
 which little 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.589
 in the heart it beats about 70 times a minute 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.959
 pushes me about 5 liters of blood all over my body 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.429
 cardiac activity is controlled by the autonomic nervous system 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.449
 that I had his duties 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.960
 depending on the physiological needs of the organism 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.530
 however 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.550
 heart cells love the ability to automatically generate pulse 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.470
 electric 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.859
 here is a comparison 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.760
 prev. anything 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.610
 this means that even if the nerves to say are selected for you 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.100
 the heart, however, able to beat the opponent 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.950
 if it is true that they speak little in loco says 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.950
 to make deleted 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.479
 the conduction system of the heart 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.840
 ensures that the electrical stimulus 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.420
 it is answered asynchronously 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.600
 It's your cardio turn 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.590
 hilti optimizer filling the heart 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.990
 for his some advice please 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.710
 because the raccoon 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.310
 polarization milk and bay polarization of the cell membrane 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.250
 causes contraction 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 for me I am in white cotton 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.550
 as he sees on the stars polito lesson on the head with fractions 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.389
 let's see the sequence of events a little more in detail 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.979
 in this chart I prepared 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:23.119
 the vertical axis shows the membrane potential expressed a thousand times 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.869
 while the horizontal axis 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:27.190
 show the time 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.329
 expressed in seconds 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.730
 yellow nails 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.190
 I represent payment for membrane potential 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:40.189
 the resting membrane potential help research - 70 of the beatings 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.489
 the bridge of ninth 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.769
 decolonization it changes from negative to positive 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.379
 these with tnt. oedipation actions 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.139
 quotation clauses for ds 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.749
 how to see on the left 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:01.479
 decolonization 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.909
 it leaps as the wave spreads throughout my basin 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.939
 starting from the outside world 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.069
 new timing 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.329
 wave defusion 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.119
 packaging bulls 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:19.919
 they are controlled by a group of named cardiac cells 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.799
 again with the breast 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.709
 eugenio the impulse 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.709
 or depolarization 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.849
 through the management system 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.609
 paraimpu on the banks but the others that are bought 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.369
 and then to add logo ventricular atrium 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.669
 which converts part of the 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.819
 and ventricles between you and the beam the hit list 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.269
 his 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.319
 entering right sideram 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.999
 and the pack of left 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.749
 how can I reach the little ones 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:57.759
 in the system the conditions really good on smaller ones 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.159
 called paul klee fibers 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.759
 through paypal libre 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:06.149
 during the conference the entire surface of the ventricles 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:08.099
 that you buy 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.339
 at the end of ventricular timing 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:12.290
 follows after 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.719
 myocardial nebulization 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.719
 which causes the relaxation of the heart 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.830
 all these 10 game events are made flying each heartbeat 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.740
 now let's see how on the left 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.060
 afterlife depolarization 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.430
 of the bell 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.999
 It's on the right 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.100
 how wrong 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.300
 spreads 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.789
 throughout the management system 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.789
 is the myocardium is suitable for it 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.729
 mechanically 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.259
 this is very important because 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.400
 paolo selleri the contractions 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.400
 he was holy of heart 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:09.529
 in conclusion 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.870
 the conduction system of the heart 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.060
 ensures that the electrical stimulus 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.849
 it spreads asynchronously and throughout my cardio 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.960
 which uses the filling of the heart 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.759
 the value for money the blood 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.759
 why catone 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.439
 thanks for your attention 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.490
 and if you want to contact me 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.990
 overlay 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.089
 you can see my address 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:42.430
 from the site 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.029
 weather verbania 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:47.279
 in my heart for more TV 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.939
 which you can also say under pressure 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:53.009
 omitted a child of anatomy and physiology 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.800
 both Italian and English 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.949
 and if you want. you can watch it 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.309
 thank you 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.939
