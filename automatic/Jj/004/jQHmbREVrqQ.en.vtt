00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
that I found this phone nearby actually

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.530 
that I found this phone nearby actually
but<00:05:16.690> a<00:05:17.010> public<00:05:18.010> eye<00:05:18.190> things<00:05:19.150> like<00:05:19.270> this<00:05:19.360> at

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
but a public eye things like this at

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.000 
but a public eye things like this at
they<00:05:19.630> get<00:05:19.780> from<00:05:19.930> creative<00:05:20.290> mode<00:05:20.470> because<00:05:20.950> I

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
they get from creative mode because I

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.410 
they get from creative mode because I
watch<00:05:21.130> them<00:05:21.250> so<00:05:21.430> much<00:05:21.580> easy<00:05:21.820> just<00:05:22.030> get<00:05:22.180> it<00:05:22.300> from

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
watch them so much easy just get it from

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.320 
watch them so much easy just get it from
creative<00:05:22.840> instead<00:05:23.080> of<00:05:23.230> trying<00:05:23.410> to<00:05:23.440> find<00:05:23.650> it<00:05:23.860> in

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
creative instead of trying to find it in

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.810 
creative instead of trying to find it in
normal<00:05:25.330> mode<00:05:25.630> because<00:05:26.170> it's<00:05:26.410> kind<00:05:26.620> of<00:05:26.680> hard<00:05:27.640> to

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
normal mode because it's kind of hard to

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.160 
normal mode because it's kind of hard to
get<00:05:28.000> things<00:05:28.270> like<00:05:28.390> that<00:05:28.510> I<00:05:28.540> guess<00:05:28.750> but<00:05:28.990> anyway

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
get things like that I guess but anyway

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.410 
get things like that I guess but anyway

probably gonna throw some its away
actually<00:05:38.590> probably<00:05:39.520> don't<00:05:39.670> need<00:05:39.790> it<00:05:39.970> so<00:05:40.000> trip

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
actually probably don't need it so trip

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.680 
actually probably don't need it so trip
that<00:05:40.900> way<00:05:41.080> trip<00:05:41.710> that<00:05:41.920> away<00:05:42.100> yeah<00:05:42.310> so<00:05:42.820> how'd

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
that way trip that away yeah so how'd

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.460 
that way trip that away yeah so how'd
they<00:05:43.810> have<00:05:44.050> in<00:05:44.110> there

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
they have in there

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
quartz I did get from free to mode

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.980 
quartz I did get from free to mode
bricks<00:05:48.310> I<00:05:48.520> did<00:05:48.730> fine<00:05:49.000> from<00:05:49.390> a<00:05:49.480> nearby<00:05:49.690> lake

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
just so much grinding look I'm braking

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.100 
just so much grinding look I'm braking
efficiency<00:05:53.770> self<00:05:54.370> touch<00:05:54.580> so<00:05:54.790> yeah<00:05:54.960> just<00:05:55.960> so

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
efficiency self touch so yeah just so

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.050

I'll show me in channels right now so we

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.940 
I'll show me in channels right now so we
