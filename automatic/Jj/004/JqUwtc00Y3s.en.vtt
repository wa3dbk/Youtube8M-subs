00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.630 
here a build number right here you got
sleeper<00:01:51.030> rom<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:52.049> there<00:01:52.290> EIT<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.460> know

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
you are on the sleep around otherwise

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.319 
you are on the sleep around otherwise
it's<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:58.140> really<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.490> seems<00:01:59.820> pretty<00:02:00.000> fast

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
it's just really it seems pretty fast

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.450 
it's just really it seems pretty fast

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
were changed nothing like that dialers

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.169 
were changed nothing like that dialers
still<00:02:07.920> stock<00:02:08.310> otherwise<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.599> does<00:02:09.780> have

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
still stock otherwise it does have

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.569 
still stock otherwise it does have
I<00:02:10.810> mean<00:02:11.200> it's<00:02:11.349> got<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.590> Voodoo<00:02:11.829> sound<00:02:12.159> if<00:02:12.459> you

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
I mean it's got the Voodoo sound if you

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.099 
I mean it's got the Voodoo sound if you
do<00:02:12.730> use<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.569> can<00:02:13.659> get<00:02:13.719> that<00:02:13.780> from<00:02:14.019> the

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.109 
do use that you can get that from the

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.509 
do use that you can get that from the
market<00:02:14.500> i'm<00:02:14.620> sure<00:02:14.799> you<00:02:14.920> included<00:02:15.400> it

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
market i'm sure you included it

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.459 
market i'm sure you included it
somewhere<00:02:15.969> in<00:02:16.060> here<00:02:16.269> let's<00:02:16.870> take<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.049> look<00:02:17.319> at

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
somewhere in here let's take a look at

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.280 
somewhere in here let's take a look at
voodoo<00:02:17.680> sounders<00:02:18.280> there<00:02:18.719> it's<00:02:19.719> not<00:02:19.900> but

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
voodoo sounders there it's not but

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.110 
voodoo sounders there it's not but
anyways<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.829> is<00:02:20.859> overclocked<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:21.549> one<00:02:21.909> point

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
anyways it is overclocked to one point

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.959 
anyways it is overclocked to one point
one<00:02:22.390> gigahertz<00:02:22.719> if<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.920> want<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.579> if<00:02:24.819> you

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
one gigahertz if you want to if you

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.399 
one gigahertz if you want to if you
don't<00:02:25.209> like<00:02:25.390> overclocking<00:02:26.019> just<00:02:26.170> go<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.319> the

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
don't like overclocking just go to the

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.199 
don't like overclocking just go to the
voltage<00:02:26.709> control<00:02:27.099> app<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.579> just<00:02:27.849> put<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.150> back

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
voltage control app and just put it back

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.110 
voltage control app and just put it back
to<00:02:28.389> one<00:02:28.540> gigahertz<00:02:28.870> otherwise<00:02:29.859> you<00:02:30.639> can<00:02:30.790> leave

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
to one gigahertz otherwise you can leave

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.000 
to one gigahertz otherwise you can leave
it<00:02:31.239> overclocked<00:02:31.689> anyways<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.650> does<00:02:32.769> have<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
it overclocked anyways it does have the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.520 
it overclocked anyways it does have the
hotspot<00:02:33.430> hack<00:02:33.609> so<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:33.879> can<00:02:34.000> use<00:02:34.209> hotspot<00:02:34.599> just

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
hotspot hack so you can use hotspot just

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.929 
hotspot hack so you can use hotspot just
the<00:02:35.680> need<00:02:35.859> of<00:02:35.889> a<00:02:36.010> hotspot<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.609> not<00:02:36.790> get

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
the need of a hotspot and not get

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.699 
the need of a hotspot and not get
charged<00:02:37.150> for<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.659> is<00:02:37.810> completely<00:02:38.290> free

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709

but let's see shutter sound just select
sound<00:03:11.739> three<00:03:12.129> he<00:03:12.760> actually<00:03:12.939> included<00:03:13.450> sound

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
sound three he actually included sound

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.899 
sound three he actually included sound
three<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.019> should<00:03:14.199> be<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.319> silent<00:03:14.739> sound<00:03:15.250> and

picture no noise and no noise when i

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.949 
picture no noise and no noise when i
took<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:26.709> either<00:03:26.919> so<00:03:27.459> there<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.180> have<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.389> nice

took it either so there you have it nice

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.339 
took it either so there you have it nice
nice<00:03:29.829> note<00:03:30.129> change<00:03:31.060> there<00:03:31.389> as<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:31.989> can<00:03:32.109> see<00:03:32.229> my

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
nice note change there as you can see my

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.679 
nice note change there as you can see my
volume<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.919> all<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.159> way<00:03:33.250> up<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.430> so<00:03:34.419> don't

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
volume is all the way up to so don't

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.089 
volume is all the way up to so don't
think<00:03:34.840> i<00:03:34.900> was<00:03:35.019> on<00:03:35.109> vibrate<00:03:35.319> but<00:03:35.560> either<00:03:35.829> way<00:03:36.069> it

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
think i was on vibrate but either way it

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.800 
think i was on vibrate but either way it
does<00:03:36.340> not<00:03:36.729> make<00:03:37.000> noise<00:03:37.030> as<00:03:37.449> long<00:03:37.599> as<00:03:37.720> you

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
change it to that sallim three so that's

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.939

thanks<00:03:45.879> to<00:03:46.120> sense<00:03:46.569> a<00:03:46.720> simple<00:03:47.139> for<00:03:47.379> including

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:48.009 
thanks to sense a simple for including

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.969 
thanks to sense a simple for including
that<00:03:48.220> for<00:03:48.519> us<00:03:48.549> otherwise<00:03:49.419> it's<00:03:49.720> ext4<00:03:50.229> base<00:03:50.680> so

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:50.979 
that for us otherwise it's ext4 base so

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.729 
that for us otherwise it's ext4 base so
should<00:03:51.280> be<00:03:51.370> faster<00:03:51.819> and<00:03:52.120> battery<00:03:52.780> life<00:03:53.439> should

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
should be faster and battery life should

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.249 
should be faster and battery life should
be<00:03:53.970> better<00:03:54.970> than<00:03:55.269> RFS<00:03:55.810> but<00:03:56.079> otherwise

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:56.259 
be better than RFS but otherwise

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:00.089 
be better than RFS but otherwise
journaling<00:03:56.829> is<00:03:57.159> on<00:03:57.989> other<00:03:58.989> so<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.889> should<00:04:00.069> be

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
journaling is on other so it should be

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.849 
journaling is on other so it should be
