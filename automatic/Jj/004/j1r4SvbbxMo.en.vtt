00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.440
 well again we are here after 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.120
 my previous video that you have already seen 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.760
 that we had already started a bit with 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.969
 valentine's atmosphere 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.230
 today I have not been able to put more hearts 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.509
 you will have thought this woman has been 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.509
 gone crazy, yes, but we can put 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:25.320
 more sane our heart on a plate 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:28.070
 that is super sweet is going to be a cake 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.070
 strawberries 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.199
 It was going to look beautiful and as always 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.350
 let's work a little bit do not touch me 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.629
 soletilla these are rather homemade no 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.230
 you buy a confectionery but you have them 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.890
 also in supermarkets this mold 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.890
 what has been achieved 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.510
 and it is unpleasant we are interested in our 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.390
 pie is not going to suffer and neither do we 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.970
 when disassembling it 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.079
 Well let's start I'll catch 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.759
 the sugar 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.290
 which, as you can see, is also full of 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.240
 hearts and hearts that we go wrong 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.090
 now people think they have san 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.370
 valentine is something that has promoted the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.190
 department stores but I clearly from 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.580
 the story of valentine the truth is 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.370
 that is gorgeous and the truth but 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.530
 now I always celebrate 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:32.790
 the poor valentine was a surgeon 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:38.010
 Roman who converted to Catholicism and 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.420
 He became a priest and then he lived 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.130
 in the time of the Romans in the year 270 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.860
 where was the emperor claudius 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.800
 second that he did not want young people to 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.980
 they will marry because they said that their 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.470
 value decreased when they went to war 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.320
 good and valentine of that time 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.720
 valentine to dry because it married all the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.970
 young people secretly until the 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.130
 emperor learned and the poor what 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.079
 executed 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.720
 and that's why they converted it into 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.300
 holy because he executed it on February 14 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.980
 which is when we celebrate our party 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.519
 of valentine do not tell me you have a 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.980
 lovely story good put now 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.020
 I honor everything and I also celebrate it because 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.450
 is that it costs us nothing to tell you 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.540
 so well I do not roll up and we're going to 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.830
 cook come let's take a little 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.650
 sugar 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.060
 to our water 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.790
 because I now had a trickle of big 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.470
 that depends on taste we try a 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.590
 little bit to give it a little aroma 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.280
 neither should we go over soaking 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.230
 our 18 of soletilla 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.230
 a little bit not too much 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.680
 you are putting in little bit 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:02.040
 you have to download it on all this type 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.130
 of biscuits are very soft here like this 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.540
 perfectly 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:12.560
 covered if you're not going to get it 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:16.450
 a heart-shaped cake we're going to 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.450
 put a layer of jam of Christ ' 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.750
 let's throw our whipped cream a 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.980
 layer of whipped cream are a 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.450
 mounted you know you have been 20 blake 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.950
 that maybe later we have to 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:39.120
 use more for the ornament or if not cream 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.140
 spray that I'll explain how and there 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.080
 to throw them you know 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.780
 sugar sugar vial is better when the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.319
 mountains because that does not want us the 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.890
 adequate sweetness then some 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.380
 rich and logical companies let's leave 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.410
 a few for the final decoration and 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.520
 the others we are putting cut 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:07.080
 well in plane on we make another capita 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.400
 on our cream 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.140
 what are you filling in like this 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.330
 so that it is tasty 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.180
 after doing this we go back to 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.980
 repeat the same operation biscuits 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.060
 soletilla 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:26.330
 cream strawberry jam and pieces of 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.980
 strawberry and in the end we end up with a layer 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.100
 of soletilla cupcakes that will be 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.230
 then the base where we will put our 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.020
 cake decoration 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.730
 I have finished your last layer and 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.129
 wrapped with the role of feel 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.499
 transparent our cake 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:47.189
 You can prepare this lack with 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:48.869
 Previously even two days 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:51.269
 It is a good fridge that resists good 

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:54.389
 and you can leave it ready that 

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:56.639
 solidify and it's great from 1 to 2 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.009
 days we are going to put it, you know that 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.139
 they all have nothing and strawberries can catch 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.059
 much flavor we close it because also 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.360
 can drop some Jew some 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:07.769
 have bathed the biscuits and while 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.369
 both while solidifying our 

00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:14.029
 I'm going to do the coverage of the 

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:16.259
 top part that you can throw strawberry 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:18.300
 normally but this balance is very 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.669
 rich and it costs nothing and they make five 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.910
 minutes that is done with the rest of the 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.880
 what's left of the jam 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.060
 three or four tablespoons of sugar and 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.520
 half juice of a lemon is put on the fire 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.430
 and let it cook until you see that 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.650
 expresses a little nothing that solidifies 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.480
 a little bit and then you have to 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.370
 let cool to incorporate it to 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.350
 your cake this is better than 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.440
 do when you are going to decorate 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.610
 your cake like 20 minutes before to 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.610
 do not throw it too hot 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.460
 we open 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.660
 let's go first a little bit the 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.660
 knife so that we do not stay 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.320
 our cup 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.900
 and now we're going to throw him out 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.130
 cooled 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.130
 our glasa 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.080
 is placing our strawberries 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:31.100
 adorned just at the moment of serving 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.100
 with 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.340
 a cream in spray 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:41.740
 you have your wonderful cake of san 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:44.130
