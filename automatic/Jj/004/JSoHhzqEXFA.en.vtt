color so this is done now what we have
to<00:02:09.379> do<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.830> we<00:02:10.220> need<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.489> use<00:02:10.519> statistics<00:02:10.910> I

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
to do is we need to use statistics I

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.020 
to do is we need to use statistics I
have<00:02:12.170> these<00:02:12.590> bamboo<00:02:13.129> sticks<00:02:13.430> with<00:02:13.610> me<00:02:13.790> which

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
have these bamboo sticks with me which

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.140 
have these bamboo sticks with me which
we<00:02:14.480> have<00:02:14.690> immersed<00:02:15.470> in<00:02:15.680> water<00:02:15.980> now<00:02:16.670> why<00:02:16.910> do<00:02:16.970> we

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
we have immersed in water now why do we

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.119 
we have immersed in water now why do we
have<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.480> do<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.319> thing<00:02:18.530> is<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.830> we<00:02:19.040> are

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
have to do that the thing is that we are

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.190 
have to do that the thing is that we are
going<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.310> be<00:02:19.400> skewering<00:02:19.819> chicken<00:02:20.330> capsicum

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
going to be skewering chicken capsicum

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.110 
going to be skewering chicken capsicum
tomato<00:02:21.799> and<00:02:21.950> onion<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.670> then<00:02:22.910> we're

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
tomato and onion to this and then we're

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.910 
tomato and onion to this and then we're
going<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.269> be<00:02:23.360> cooking<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.840> over<00:02:23.930> grill<00:02:24.349> so

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
going to be cooking it over grill so

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.920 
going to be cooking it over grill so
most<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.430> times<00:02:25.670> when<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.480> comes<00:02:26.780> in

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
most of the times when this comes in

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.990 
most of the times when this comes in
contact<00:02:27.200> with<00:02:27.560> heat<00:02:27.799> in<00:02:28.069> born<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.640> becomes

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
contact with heat in born that becomes

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.870 
contact with heat in born that becomes
absolutely<00:02:29.569> black<00:02:30.019> which<00:02:30.739> results<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:31.549> what

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
absolutely black which results in what

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.949 
absolutely black which results in what
the<00:02:32.510> chicken<00:02:32.900> or<00:02:33.079> the<00:02:33.250> vegetable<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.700> is

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
the chicken or the vegetable that is

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.259 
the chicken or the vegetable that is
skewer<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:36.380> also<00:02:36.680> tends<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.340> bone<00:02:37.640> which

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
skewer to this also tends to bone which

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.289 
skewer to this also tends to bone which
is<00:02:38.450> why<00:02:38.630> we<00:02:39.019> have<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.380> soak<00:02:39.739> this<00:02:39.980> in<00:02:40.040> water<00:02:40.489> so

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
is why we have to soak this in water so

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.150 
is why we have to soak this in water so
that<00:02:41.329> there<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.870> good<00:02:42.110> amount<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.500> moisture

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
that there is good amount of moisture

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.280 
that there is good amount of moisture
which<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.549> soaked<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.150> by<00:02:44.540> this<00:02:44.780> stick<00:02:45.079> and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
which is soaked in by this stick and

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.250 
which is soaked in by this stick and
when<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.190> cook<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.819> onto<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.239> grill<00:02:47.569> it<00:02:47.780> doesn't

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
when you cook it onto a grill it doesn't

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.770 
when you cook it onto a grill it doesn't
burn<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.340> that's<00:02:49.549> a<00:02:49.670> very<00:02:49.849> simple<00:02:50.269> reason<00:02:50.480> as

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
burn so that's a very simple reason as

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.830 
burn so that's a very simple reason as
far<00:02:51.349> as<00:02:51.530> possible<00:02:51.790> try<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.120> soak<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.510> in<00:02:53.630> water

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
far as possible try and soak it in water

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.210 
far as possible try and soak it in water
but<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.319> course<00:02:54.560> if<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.799> are<00:02:54.829> not<00:02:55.010> prepared

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
but of course if you are not prepared

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.789 
but of course if you are not prepared
and<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:56.209> just<00:02:56.420> have<00:02:56.599> to<00:02:56.690> make<00:02:56.900> this<00:02:57.079> you<00:02:57.560> don't

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
and you just have to make this you don't

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.550 
and you just have to make this you don't
have<00:02:57.920> much<00:02:58.129> time<00:02:58.400> then<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.209> can<00:02:59.560> obviously

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
have much time then you can obviously

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.770 
have much time then you can obviously
use<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:01.220> without<00:03:01.579> soaking<00:03:02.090> but<00:03:02.209> my<00:03:02.420> advice

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
use this without soaking but my advice

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.410 
use this without soaking but my advice
is<00:03:03.049> you<00:03:03.530> should<00:03:03.829> soak<00:03:04.130> this<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:04.400> good<00:03:04.760> ten<00:03:05.180> to

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
is you should soak this for good ten to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.870 
is you should soak this for good ten to
fifteen<00:03:05.840> minutes<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:06.410> let's<00:03:07.130> follow<00:03:07.700> a

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
fifteen minutes so let's follow a

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.629 
fifteen minutes so let's follow a
pattern<00:03:08.209> now<00:03:08.930> we<00:03:09.440> will<00:03:09.680> first<00:03:10.010> start<00:03:10.459> with

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
pattern now we will first start with

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.210 
pattern now we will first start with
onion<00:03:11.239> then<00:03:12.019> we'll<00:03:12.319> take<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.799> chicken

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
onion then we'll take the chicken

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.940 
onion then we'll take the chicken
chicken<00:03:13.730> as<00:03:13.880> far<00:03:14.120> as<00:03:14.239> possible<00:03:14.510> trial<00:03:15.170> fold

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
chicken as far as possible trial fold

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.069 
chicken as far as possible trial fold
and<00:03:16.370> spirit<00:03:17.000> lengthens<00:03:17.359> you<00:03:17.480> see<00:03:17.630> this<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:17.930> have

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
and spirit lengthens you see this I have

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.830 
and spirit lengthens you see this I have
folded<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.620> why<00:03:19.340> because<00:03:19.850> first<00:03:20.359> thing<00:03:20.720> is

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
folded it why because first thing is

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.569 
folded it why because first thing is
that<00:03:20.870> we<00:03:21.170> are<00:03:21.200> using<00:03:21.260> boneless<00:03:21.829> chicken<00:03:22.400> which

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
that we are using boneless chicken which

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.150 
that we are using boneless chicken which
is<00:03:22.730> from<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.299> breast<00:03:23.690> recipes<00:03:24.530> go<00:03:24.829> a<00:03:24.859> little

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
is from the breast recipes go a little

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.699 
is from the breast recipes go a little
dry<00:03:25.670> when<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:25.940> tend<00:03:26.329> to<00:03:26.420> overcook<00:03:27.139> it<00:03:27.349> but<00:03:27.560> we

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
dry when you tend to overcook it but we

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.920 
dry when you tend to overcook it but we
won't<00:03:27.920> be<00:03:27.980> able<00:03:28.099> cooking<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.609> but<00:03:29.120> if<00:03:29.329> you<00:03:29.450> fold

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
won't be able cooking it but if you fold

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.250 
won't be able cooking it but if you fold
it<00:03:30.139> like<00:03:30.319> this<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.739> cook<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.489> stays<00:03:32.239> even<00:03:32.959> more

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
it like this and cook it stays even more

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.490 
it like this and cook it stays even more
moist<00:03:33.769> so<00:03:34.700> we'll<00:03:34.910> fold<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.480> chicken<00:03:35.810> then<00:03:36.260> we

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
moist so we'll fold the chicken then we

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.650 
moist so we'll fold the chicken then we
will<00:03:36.620> take<00:03:37.040> one<00:03:37.370> piece<00:03:37.549> of<00:03:37.730> capsicum<00:03:38.209> then

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
will take one piece of capsicum then

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.620 
will take one piece of capsicum then
another<00:03:39.019> piece<00:03:39.290> of<00:03:39.349> chicken<00:03:39.970> then<00:03:40.970> we'll<00:03:41.299> take

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
another piece of chicken then we'll take

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.099 
another piece of chicken then we'll take
tomato<00:03:42.169> and<00:03:42.730> we'll<00:03:43.730> again<00:03:44.150> cover<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.599> with<00:03:44.930> one

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
tomato and we'll again cover it with one

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.920 
tomato and we'll again cover it with one
onion<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:46.130> see<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:46.459> looks<00:03:47.389> absolutely

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
onion you see this looks absolutely

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.490 
onion you see this looks absolutely
pretty<00:03:48.650> I<00:03:48.980> am<00:03:49.340> using<00:03:49.609> one<00:03:50.150> of<00:03:50.389> this<00:03:50.690> what<00:03:51.349> you

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
pretty I am using one of this what you

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.069 
pretty I am using one of this what you
can<00:03:51.650> do<00:03:51.829> is<00:03:52.010> same<00:03:52.819> pattern<00:03:53.359> follow<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.900> all

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
can do is same pattern follow it all

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.500 
can do is same pattern follow it all
over<00:03:54.500> your<00:03:54.709> so<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:55.459> will<00:03:55.609> have<00:03:55.760> like<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.000> double

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
over your so you will have like a double

this marinade
make<00:04:09.620> sure<00:04:10.069> you<00:04:10.849> also<00:04:11.180> apply<00:04:11.659> it<00:04:11.989> within<00:04:12.620> these

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
make sure you also apply it within these

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.930 
make sure you also apply it within these
gaps<00:04:13.760> like<00:04:14.720> you<00:04:14.900> see<00:04:15.140> her<00:04:15.379> these<00:04:16.070> gaps<00:04:16.400> also

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
gaps like you see her these gaps also

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.390 
gaps like you see her these gaps also
will<00:04:17.060> have<00:04:17.150> to<00:04:17.269> be<00:04:17.389> filled<00:04:17.810> in<00:04:18.049> well<00:04:18.380> with<00:04:19.220> the

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
will have to be filled in well with the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.960 
will have to be filled in well with the
marination<00:04:19.820> or<00:04:20.359> else<00:04:20.900> it<00:04:21.139> may<00:04:21.169> not<00:04:21.530> taste<00:04:21.970> very

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
marination or else it may not taste very

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.530 
marination or else it may not taste very
good

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
good

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.840 
good
because<00:04:24.260> marination<00:04:24.800> will<00:04:25.100> be<00:04:25.250> only<00:04:25.610> on<00:04:25.699> the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
because marination will be only on the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.409 
because marination will be only on the
top<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.380> nothing<00:04:27.380> in<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:28.160> gaps<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:29.210> that's

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
top and nothing in the gaps so that's

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.350 
top and nothing in the gaps so that's
very<00:04:29.690> important<00:04:30.320> so<00:04:30.560> I'm<00:04:31.310> using<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.820> grill<00:04:32.090> pan

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
very important so I'm using a grill pan

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.659 
very important so I'm using a grill pan
which<00:04:32.780> is<00:04:32.810> a<00:04:32.960> nonstick<00:04:33.440> grill<00:04:33.860> pan<00:04:34.160> I've<00:04:34.460> added

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
some pure ghee to this and we'll also

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.260 
some pure ghee to this and we'll also
add<00:04:38.180> some<00:04:38.540> oil<00:04:39.040> like<00:04:40.040> this<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:41.570> pan<00:04:41.840> is<00:04:42.080> ready

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
add some oil like this the pan is ready

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.710 
add some oil like this the pan is ready
even<00:04:44.270> these<00:04:44.780> kabobs<00:04:45.650> are<00:04:45.889> ready<00:04:46.330> we'll<00:04:47.330> place

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
even these kabobs are ready we'll place

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.879 
even these kabobs are ready we'll place
them<00:04:48.970> but<00:04:49.970> it<00:04:50.300> has<00:04:50.570> to<00:04:50.750> be<00:04:50.840> done<00:04:51.020> on<00:04:51.169> high<00:04:51.470> heat

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
them but it has to be done on high heat

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.689 
them but it has to be done on high heat
first<00:04:52.820> so<00:04:53.750> that<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.110> get<00:04:54.260> nice<00:04:54.590> good<00:04:55.130> dark

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
first so that you get nice good dark

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.810 
first so that you get nice good dark
marks<00:04:56.330> over<00:04:56.539> the<00:04:56.660> kebab<00:04:56.960> and<00:04:57.169> then<00:04:58.039> we'll<00:04:58.550> cook

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
marks over the kebab and then we'll cook

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.540 
marks over the kebab and then we'll cook
it<00:04:59.030> on<00:04:59.180> low<00:04:59.389> duty<00:05:00.169> if<00:05:00.560> you<00:05:00.710> feel<00:05:01.039> you<00:05:01.250> need<00:05:01.280> to

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
it on low duty if you feel you need to

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.790 
it on low duty if you feel you need to
add<00:05:01.669> some<00:05:01.940> more<00:05:01.970> ghee<00:05:02.240> you<00:05:03.199> could<00:05:03.380> do<00:05:03.530> that<00:05:03.880> now

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
add some more ghee you could do that now

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.240 
add some more ghee you could do that now
after<00:05:06.800> this<00:05:06.949> just<00:05:07.520> give<00:05:07.789> it<00:05:07.910> a<00:05:08.229> turn<00:05:09.229> you<00:05:10.100> see

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
after this just give it a turn you see

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.750 
after this just give it a turn you see
this<00:05:10.430> it's<00:05:10.940> getting<00:05:11.270> nice<00:05:11.630> color<00:05:12.590> this<00:05:13.400> won't

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
this it's getting nice color this won't

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.719 
this it's getting nice color this won't
take<00:05:14.000> very<00:05:14.030> long<00:05:14.330> to<00:05:14.690> cook<00:05:14.720> about<00:05:15.530> 10<00:05:16.490> minutes

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
take very long to cook about 10 minutes

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.810 
take very long to cook about 10 minutes
because<00:05:17.630> chicken<00:05:18.530> breast<00:05:18.800> cooks<00:05:19.250> very<00:05:19.460> fast

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
because chicken breast cooks very fast

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.629 
because chicken breast cooks very fast
and<00:05:20.330> rest<00:05:20.660> of<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:20.960> other<00:05:21.080> vegetables<00:05:21.770> even<00:05:22.520> if

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
and rest of the other vegetables even if

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.810 
and rest of the other vegetables even if
this<00:05:22.760> saves<00:05:23.210> slightly<00:05:24.020> cunty<00:05:24.289> it<00:05:24.740> tastes<00:05:25.520> good

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
this saves slightly cunty it tastes good

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.190 
this saves slightly cunty it tastes good
but<00:05:26.539> let's<00:05:26.780> see<00:05:27.050> what<00:05:27.440> do<00:05:27.560> we<00:05:27.680> do<00:05:27.860> now<00:05:29.200> it's

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
but let's see what do we do now it's

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.680 
but let's see what do we do now it's
very<00:05:30.500> simple<00:05:30.950> as<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:31.639> how<00:05:31.789> you<00:05:31.849> feel<00:05:32.360> each

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
very simple as and how you feel each

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.800 
very simple as and how you feel each
side<00:05:32.990> is<00:05:33.139> getting<00:05:33.320> coloured<00:05:33.889> just<00:05:34.880> turn<00:05:35.510> and

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
side is getting coloured just turn and

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.670 
side is getting coloured just turn and
cook<00:05:36.260> the<00:05:36.470> other<00:05:36.620> side<00:05:37.150> like<00:05:38.150> this<00:05:38.389> so<00:05:39.320> you<00:05:39.380> see

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
cook the other side like this so you see

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.670 
cook the other side like this so you see
this<00:05:39.889> it's<00:05:40.310> more<00:05:41.150> or<00:05:41.330> less<00:05:41.360> done<00:05:41.840> chicken<00:05:42.470> has

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
this it's more or less done chicken has

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.040 
this it's more or less done chicken has
cooked<00:05:42.830> but<00:05:43.490> if<00:05:43.610> you<00:05:43.699> think<00:05:43.940> you<00:05:44.150> need<00:05:44.300> it<00:05:44.479> even

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
cooked but if you think you need it even

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.230 
cooked but if you think you need it even
darker<00:05:45.289> you<00:05:45.800> could<00:05:46.039> just<00:05:46.340> grill<00:05:46.580> it<00:05:46.610> to<00:05:47.060> give

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
darker you could just grill it to give

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.629 
darker you could just grill it to give
it<00:05:47.360> even<00:05:47.539> more<00:05:47.720> grill<00:05:48.169> marks<00:05:48.560> but<00:05:48.889> sometimes

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
it even more grill marks but sometimes

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.550 
it even more grill marks but sometimes
what<00:05:49.910> happens<00:05:50.300> is<00:05:50.449> when<00:05:50.720> you<00:05:50.750> overcook<00:05:51.349> the

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
what happens is when you overcook the

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.219 
what happens is when you overcook the
chicken<00:05:51.669> it<00:05:52.669> goes<00:05:53.060> dry

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
chicken it goes dry

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.310 
chicken it goes dry
I<00:05:54.260> have<00:05:54.919> always<00:05:55.449> stressed<00:05:56.449> a<00:05:56.630> little<00:05:56.780> on<00:05:57.139> the

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
I have always stressed a little on the

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.740 
I have always stressed a little on the
chicken<00:05:57.680> going<00:05:57.949> dry<00:05:58.250> because<00:05:59.060> once<00:05:59.300> chicken

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
chicken going dry because once chicken

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.930 
chicken going dry because once chicken
goes<00:05:59.960> dry<00:06:00.289> it<00:06:00.500> doesn't<00:06:00.620> taste<00:06:00.979> good<00:06:01.310> so<00:06:01.880> you

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
goes dry it doesn't taste good so you

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.060 
goes dry it doesn't taste good so you
have<00:06:02.270> to<00:06:02.419> take<00:06:02.690> some<00:06:03.139> measures<00:06:03.590> you<00:06:03.830> have<00:06:03.949> to

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
have to take some measures you have to

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.659 
have to take some measures you have to
follow<00:06:04.340> some<00:06:04.900> processes<00:06:05.900> where<00:06:06.530> the<00:06:07.250> chicken

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
follow some processes where the chicken
