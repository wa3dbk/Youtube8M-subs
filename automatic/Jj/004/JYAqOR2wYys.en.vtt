meffert's speed megaminx with stickers
which<00:00:18.960> I'm<00:00:19.140> not<00:00:19.260> sure<00:00:19.470> if<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:19.939> see<00:00:20.939> that

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
which I'm not sure if you can see that

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.220 
which I'm not sure if you can see that
but<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.449> says<00:00:21.570> meffert's<00:00:22.020> challenge<00:00:22.910> anyway

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
but it says meffert's challenge anyway

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.359 
but it says meffert's challenge anyway
first<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.380> all<00:00:25.439> we're<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.949> do<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> size

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
first of all we're going to do a size

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.730 
first of all we're going to do a size
comparison<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.720> Diane<00:00:28.199> megaminx<00:00:28.560> is

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
comparison and the Diane megaminx is

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.620 
comparison and the Diane megaminx is
much<00:00:28.980> bigger<00:00:29.220> as<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.880> see<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:31.579> although

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
much bigger as you can see and although

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.639 
much bigger as you can see and although
the<00:00:33.630> Diane<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.079> much<00:00:34.260> bigger

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the Diane is much bigger

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.780 
the Diane is much bigger
you<00:00:35.250> meffert's<00:00:35.640> megaminx<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:37.489> actually<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> lot

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
you meffert's megaminx is actually a lot

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.600 
you meffert's megaminx is actually a lot
heavier<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.440> I'll<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.280> second

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
heavier and I'll get to that in a second

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:54.170 
heavier and I'll get to that in a second
let's<00:00:42.510> start<00:00:42.840> with<00:00:42.960> pieces<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:53.070> as<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:54.059> can

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
let's start with pieces so as you can

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.170 
let's start with pieces so as you can
see<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.960> die<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.320> pieces<00:00:55.710> very<00:00:56.370> similar<00:00:56.789> are

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
see you die in pieces very similar are

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.630 
see you die in pieces very similar are
very<00:00:57.420> similar<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.809> other<00:00:58.170> Diane<00:00:59.160> products

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
very similar to other Diane products

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.850 
very similar to other Diane products
like<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.520> Sanchi<00:01:03.769> and<00:01:05.630> now<00:01:06.630> comparison<00:01:07.260> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
like the Sanchi and now comparison to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.880 
like the Sanchi and now comparison to
the<00:01:08.700> meffert's<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.540> pieces<00:01:10.470> are<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> lot

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the meffert's the pieces are a lot

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.340 
the meffert's the pieces are a lot
longer<00:01:11.210> although<00:01:12.210> they<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:12.720> longer<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
longer although they are longer the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.390 
longer although they are longer the
meffert's<00:01:13.799> pieces<00:01:14.159> are<00:01:14.570> solid<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.400> Diane

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
meffert's pieces are solid the Diane

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.960 
meffert's pieces are solid the Diane
pieces<00:01:17.850> are<00:01:18.150> actually<00:01:18.930> hollow<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.759> can

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
pieces are actually hollow so if I can

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.270 
pieces are actually hollow so if I can
get<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.810> apart<00:01:22.170> there<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.920> go

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
get that apart there we go

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.080 
get that apart there we go
they<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:23.970> hollow<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.490> why<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
they are hollow so that is why the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.399 
they are hollow so that is why the
meffert's<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:31.049> lot<00:01:31.530> heavier<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:33.229> now<00:01:34.229> we'll

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
meffert's is a lot heavier so now we'll

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.870 
meffert's is a lot heavier so now we'll
go<00:01:34.530> into<00:01:35.299> mechanic<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.759> corner<00:01:38.759> edge

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
go into mechanic of it the corner edge

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.569 
go into mechanic of it the corner edge
piece<00:01:39.210> for<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> diantha<00:01:40.650> together<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.310> so

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
piece for the diantha together like so

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.450 
piece for the diantha together like so
and<00:01:42.049> there's<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.110> lot<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.470> overlap<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.159> prevent

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and there's a lot of overlap to prevent

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.389 
and there's a lot of overlap to prevent
popping<00:01:44.939> right<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.390> there<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.250> there<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.369> a

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
popping right in there and there is a

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.840 
popping right in there and there is a
space<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.390> middle<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:49.409> allow<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.399> less

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
space in the middle to allow for less

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.719 
space in the middle to allow for less
friction<00:01:51.180> when<00:01:51.540> moving<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:53.250> allow<00:01:53.490> for

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
friction when moving and to allow for

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.080 
friction when moving and to allow for
better<00:01:53.909> corner<00:01:54.360> cutting<00:01:55.670> now<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
better corner cutting now on to the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.569 
better corner cutting now on to the
meffert's

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
meffert's

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.490 
meffert's
there<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> small<00:02:00.450> Ridge<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.180> edge<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
there is a small Ridge on the edge and a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.680 
there is a small Ridge on the edge and a
ridge<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.490> corner<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.649> they<00:02:07.649> allow<00:02:07.920> for

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
ridge on the corner and they allow for

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.190 
ridge on the corner and they allow for
it<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:10.709> pop<00:02:10.950> out<00:02:11.160> too<00:02:11.610> too<00:02:11.910> easily

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
it to not pop out too too easily

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.960 
it to not pop out too too easily
although<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.920> feel<00:02:14.160> like<00:02:14.400> there<00:02:14.730> should<00:02:14.940> have

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
although I feel like there should have

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.250 
although I feel like there should have
been<00:02:15.090> more<00:02:16.220> elongated<00:02:17.220> pieces<00:02:17.610> as<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.810> Dian

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
been more elongated pieces as the Dian

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.630 
been more elongated pieces as the Dian
so<00:02:20.069> that<00:02:20.340> corner<00:02:20.790> cutting<00:02:21.060> would<00:02:21.209> be<00:02:21.360> possible

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
so that corner cutting would be possible

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.500 
so that corner cutting would be possible
the<00:02:23.810> corners<00:02:24.810> are<00:02:25.709> very<00:02:26.040> different<00:02:26.310> on<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
the corners are very different on the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.870 
the corners are very different on the
Dian<00:02:27.989> there<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.379> glowing<00:02:28.650> stalk<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
Dian there is a glowing stalk and on the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.410 
Dian there is a glowing stalk and on the
meffert's

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
meffert's

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.860 
meffert's
it's<00:02:30.810> short<00:02:31.170> with<00:02:31.410> little<00:02:31.800> ridges<00:02:32.630> now<00:02:33.630> let's

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
it's short with little ridges now let's

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.660 
it's short with little ridges now let's
put<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.140> back<00:02:34.380> together<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.010> get<00:02:35.400> on<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:35.640> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
put this back together and get on to the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:50.420 
put this back together and get on to the
turning<00:02:36.000> quality<00:02:47.480> this<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.690> very<00:02:49.400> tough<00:02:50.400> to

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
turning quality this is very tough to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:01.660 
turning quality this is very tough to
put<00:02:50.700> back<00:02:50.880> together<00:02:51.090> there<00:02:51.690> we<00:02:51.780> go<00:02:58.340> no<00:02:59.340> no<00:02:59.940> I

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
fully assembled we'll go over turning

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.010 
fully assembled we'll go over turning
efforts<00:03:49.340> turning<00:03:49.849> is<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.030> lot<00:03:50.360> crispier

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
efforts turning is a lot crispier

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.170

with<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.459> my<00:04:04.730> fingers<00:04:05.060> don't<00:04:05.300> slide<00:04:05.599> off

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
with it and my fingers don't slide off

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.380 
with it and my fingers don't slide off
and<00:04:07.330> there<00:04:08.330> is<00:04:08.480> one<00:04:09.110> problem<00:04:09.410> with<00:04:09.739> this<00:04:09.920> I<00:04:10.190> do

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
and there is one problem with this I do

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
and there is one problem with this I do
admit<00:04:11.390> to<00:04:11.450> over<00:04:12.670> lubricating<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:13.819> and

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
admit to over lubricating it and

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.190 
admit to over lubricating it and
although<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.860> that<00:04:16.459> is<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:16.910> case<00:04:17.120> it<00:04:17.930> still

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
although the that is the case it still

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.580 
although the that is the case it still
is<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.500> lot<00:04:19.269> quieter<00:04:20.269> than<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:20.810> meffert's

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
is a lot quieter than the meffert's

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.330 
is a lot quieter than the meffert's
and<00:04:21.820> I<00:04:22.820> do<00:04:23.030> enjoy<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.260> turning<00:04:24.560> quality<00:04:24.950> a<00:04:24.979> lot

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
and I do enjoy the turning quality a lot

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.810 
and I do enjoy the turning quality a lot

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
more it can corner cut as the meffert's

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.290 
more it can corner cut as the meffert's
can't<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:29.810> can<00:04:30.050> even<00:04:30.310> reverse<00:04:31.310> cut<00:04:31.639> a<00:04:31.669> tiny<00:04:32.030> bit

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
I recommend the Diane megaminx get the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.930 
I recommend the Diane megaminx get the
ridged<00:04:53.240> version<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:55.510> yeah<00:04:56.530> but<00:04:57.729> with<00:04:58.729> the

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
ridged version and yeah but with the

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.320 
ridged version and yeah but with the
finger<00:04:59.330> slipping<00:04:59.720> off<00:04:59.870> back<00:05:00.500> to<00:05:00.650> that<00:05:01.270> I'm<00:05:02.270> not

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
finger slipping off back to that I'm not

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.060 
finger slipping off back to that I'm not
sure<00:05:03.010> how<00:05:04.390> different<00:05:05.390> it<00:05:05.450> would<00:05:05.539> be<00:05:05.720> with<00:05:05.930> a

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
sure how different it would be with a

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.659 
sure how different it would be with a
tiled<00:05:07.070> megaminx<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:08.020> I<00:05:09.020> might<00:05:09.289> try<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.669> mf8

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
tiled megaminx and I might try the mf8

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.670 
tiled megaminx and I might try the mf8
megaminx<00:05:11.240> later<00:05:11.930> on<00:05:14.139> just<00:05:15.139> to<00:05:15.320> see<00:05:15.350> how<00:05:15.560> it

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
megaminx later on just to see how it

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.100 
megaminx later on just to see how it
works<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:16.270> I<00:05:18.820> cannot<00:05:19.820> tell<00:05:20.389> you<00:05:20.450> how<00:05:20.930> those

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
works and I cannot tell you how those

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.750 
works and I cannot tell you how those
would<00:05:21.380> come<00:05:21.590> these<00:05:21.979> would<00:05:22.190> compare<00:05:22.520> to<00:05:22.550> that

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
would come these would compare to that

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.120 
would come these would compare to that
yet<00:05:23.000> as<00:05:23.300> I<00:05:23.510> have<00:05:23.690> not<00:05:23.900> tried<00:05:24.169> one<00:05:24.229> yet<00:05:24.560> these

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
yet as I have not tried one yet these
