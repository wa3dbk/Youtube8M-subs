00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.170
 how are friends of those lips today 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.910
 happy month of love and the month 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.590
 friendship as I know many of you 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.809
 they still do not have a well-defined plan 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.610
 what are you going to do with your friends with 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.199
 his girlfriend or with her boyfriend because I'm going 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.449
 to give three options that can be 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.150
 turn into your perfect day plan 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.400
 Let's look 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.350
 first I will recommend a 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.900
 movie that although it has a context of 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.850
 saif and sutran is completely dramatic 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.480
 of course I mean black the 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.610
 ethnic 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.770
 never leave me this movie in the 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.630
 that come out that we open tenant and 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.550
 Andrew Garfield tells the story of 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.100
 three orphans who live in a boarding school 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.110
 although everything seems to be perfect this 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.300
 place hides a horrible secret to 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.399
 your future is an excellent option because 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.230
 It is not the typical romantic movie 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.120
 girls will enjoy it for romance and 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.450
 men by the context of science 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.450
 fiction 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.260
 for many and it is a tradition to see 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.729
 horror movies when they want 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.290
 to bind someone because I'm going to 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.700
 answer that I love this 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.979
 gender and that's why I'm going to recommend 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.570
 a horror movie I know that everyone 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.549
 they like this genre but I guarantee them 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.670
 that with this movie they will be able to 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:18.310
 hug azulito track michu geo 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.229
 'drag me to hell' is one of these 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.960
 tapes that are scary but actually 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.330
 they laugh but not because it is bad but 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.799
 because the absurd and exaggerated fell 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.659
 who does not like to laugh for a while 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.700
 while hitting one or the other jump 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.220
 fragmente urged tells the story of 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.140
 christine to whom a gypsy throws a 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.330
 curse for not wanting to help him in his 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.760
 financial situation and leave if you already 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.530
 tired drama and love movies 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.690
 but this little planet does not like to see 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.550
 niche that the diabolical doll better 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.320
 mind by this third recommendation that 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.220
 It is also perfect for you to see it with 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.220
