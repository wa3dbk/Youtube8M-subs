up<00:04:00.139> really<00:04:00.379> finely<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:01.239> learned<00:04:02.239> this<00:04:02.389> from<00:04:02.449> my

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
up really finely I learned this from my

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.020 
up really finely I learned this from my
friend<00:04:02.689> Deb<00:04:03.229> it<00:04:03.799> works<00:04:04.069> really<00:04:04.459> well<00:04:04.579> this<00:04:04.879> way

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
friend Deb it works really well this way

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.420 
friend Deb it works really well this way
this<00:04:05.959> takes<00:04:06.139> a<00:04:06.259> little<00:04:06.379> bit<00:04:06.530> longer<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:10.280> that's

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
this takes a little bit longer so that's

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.369
