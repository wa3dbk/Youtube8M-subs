all<00:00:12.340> right<00:00:12.430> this<00:00:12.790> is<00:00:12.940> a<00:00:12.969> pulley<00:00:13.330> clip<00:00:13.720> we<00:00:14.440> call

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 
all right this is a pulley clip we call

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.980 
all right this is a pulley clip we call
it<00:00:14.860> the<00:00:14.980> proper<00:00:15.400> pulley<00:00:15.670> clip<00:00:16.059> because<00:00:16.779> it

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
it the proper pulley clip because it

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.260 
it the proper pulley clip because it
doesn't<00:00:17.349> damage<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:17.920> line<00:00:18.160> like<00:00:18.880> a<00:00:18.910> lot<00:00:19.240> of

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
doesn't damage the line like a lot of

doesn't damage the line like a lot of
other<00:00:20.279> tips<00:00:21.279> on<00:00:21.609> the<00:00:21.730> market<00:00:22.150> a<00:00:22.330> lot<00:00:22.720> of

other tips on the market a lot of

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.570 
other tips on the market a lot of
anglers<00:00:23.350> use<00:00:24.119> instead<00:00:25.119> of<00:00:25.270> a<00:00:25.359> pretty<00:00:26.050> weak

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
anglers use instead of a pretty weak

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.029 
anglers use instead of a pretty weak
they<00:00:27.580> use<00:00:27.820> a<00:00:27.850> swivel<00:00:28.359> this<00:00:29.140> is<00:00:29.320> what<00:00:29.470> a<00:00:29.500> swivel

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
they use a swivel this is what a swivel

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.299 
they use a swivel this is what a swivel
do<00:00:30.640> to<00:00:30.880> your<00:00:31.029> line<00:00:31.500> because<00:00:32.500> of<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:32.769> seesaw<00:00:33.280> I

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
do to your line because of the seesaw I

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.759 
do to your line because of the seesaw I
came<00:00:33.790> through<00:00:33.970> the<00:00:34.210> swivel<00:00:34.769> completely

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
came through the swivel completely

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.680 
came through the swivel completely
damaged<00:00:36.129> that<00:00:36.280> makes<00:00:36.519> it<00:00:36.699> like<00:00:36.850> pigtails<00:00:37.449> and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
damaged that makes it like pigtails and

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.290 
damaged that makes it like pigtails and
horrible<00:00:38.550> alright<00:00:39.550> so<00:00:39.880> we've<00:00:40.059> eliminated

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
horrible alright so we've eliminated

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.479 
horrible alright so we've eliminated
that<00:00:40.750> problem<00:00:40.899> by<00:00:41.410> using<00:00:41.469> a<00:00:41.829> proper<00:00:42.100> pulley

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
that problem by using a proper pulley

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.209 
that problem by using a proper pulley
now<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.870> other<00:00:44.020> thing<00:00:44.320> is<00:00:44.530> this<00:00:44.739> is<00:00:44.920> most

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
now the other thing is this is most

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.500 
now the other thing is this is most
probably<00:00:45.969> the<00:00:46.120> most<00:00:46.809> popular<00:00:47.350> Greek<00:00:48.300> sold<00:00:49.300> in

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
they want to put them into the imp and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.020 
they want to put them into the imp and
all<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.570> pressure<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:23.259> this<00:01:24.030> constant

all the pressure of this constant

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.760 
all the pressure of this constant
pressure<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.630> on<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.290> IMP

now this the IMP won't stand that if

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.550 
now this the IMP won't stand that if
you're<00:01:30.250> going<00:01:30.400> to<00:01:30.490> use<00:01:30.700> big<00:01:31.270> heavy<00:01:31.659> hooks<00:01:32.049> big

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
you're going to use big heavy hooks big

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.640 
you're going to use big heavy hooks big
baits<00:01:32.920> you're<00:01:33.490> far<00:01:33.820> better<00:01:33.850> off<00:01:34.329> using<00:01:34.990> the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
baits you're far better off using the

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.260 
baits you're far better off using the
impact<00:01:36.100> shield<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.470> also<00:01:39.150> instead<00:01:40.150> of

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
impact shield and also instead of

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.030 
impact shield and also instead of
putting<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:40.600> hook<00:01:40.840> into<00:01:41.079> the<00:01:41.350> impact<00:01:41.650> shield

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
putting the hook into the impact shield

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.060 
putting the hook into the impact shield
put<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.030> loop<00:01:43.270> into<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.900> impact<00:01:44.259> shield<00:01:44.560> it

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
put the loop into the impact shield it

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.850 
put the loop into the impact shield it
works<00:01:45.340> exactly<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:46.030> same<00:01:46.150> and<00:01:46.750> it<00:01:47.350> doesn't

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
works exactly the same and it doesn't

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.990 
works exactly the same and it doesn't
detract<00:01:48.720> otherwise<00:01:49.920> use<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.220> impact<00:01:51.700> lead

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
detract otherwise use the impact lead

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.030 
detract otherwise use the impact lead
and<00:01:52.390> there<00:01:52.990> again<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.740> can<00:01:53.920> still<00:01:54.189> put<00:01:54.460> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
and there again you can still put the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.490 
and there again you can still put the
loop<00:01:57.040> into<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.820> impact<00:01:58.180> leg<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.780> this<00:01:59.259> will

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
loop into the impact leg and this will

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.910 
loop into the impact leg and this will
release<00:01:59.829> the<00:02:00.070> bay<00:02:00.250> exactly<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.090> same<00:02:01.920> each

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
release the bay exactly the same each

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.840 
release the bay exactly the same each
time<00:02:03.060> ok<00:02:04.060> so<00:02:04.899> this<00:02:05.049> is<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:06.340> is<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.640> rig

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
bottom and the trace length is longer

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.520 
bottom and the trace length is longer
than<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.050> body<00:02:48.290> length<00:02:48.710> of<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.400> read<00:02:50.530> it's

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
than the body length of the read it's

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.720 
than the body length of the read it's
much<00:02:51.830> longer

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
much longer

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.090 
much longer
it<00:02:53.060> still<00:02:53.330> works<00:02:53.510> exactly<00:02:53.960> the<00:02:54.320> same<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.830> still

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
it still works exactly the same it still

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.400 
it still works exactly the same it still
pulls<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.880> lid<00:02:56.060> out<00:02:56.090> if<00:02:56.540> that's<00:02:57.050> what<00:02:57.290> you

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
pulls the lid out if that's what you

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.500 
pulls the lid out if that's what you
require<00:02:59.110> but<00:03:00.110> all<00:03:00.320> a<00:03:00.350> constant<00:03:00.830> strain<00:03:01.670> is

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.340 
require but all a constant strain is
taken<00:03:02.959> away<00:03:03.050> from<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.530> M<00:03:03.940> because<00:03:04.940> it's<00:03:05.350> put

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
taken away from the M because it's put

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.630 
taken away from the M because it's put
into<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.680> clip<00:03:11.410> we<00:03:12.410> have<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.560> swivel<00:03:12.920> just

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
into the clip we have a swivel just

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.530 
into the clip we have a swivel just
above<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.930> hook<00:03:15.140> length<00:03:16.000> what's<00:03:17.000> rule<00:03:17.209> goes

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
above the hook length what's rule goes

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.900 
above the hook length what's rule goes
into<00:03:18.080> the<00:03:19.810> clip<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.080> it's<00:03:21.590> helped<00:03:21.980> tie<00:03:22.250> into

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
into the clip and it's helped tie into

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.259 
into the clip and it's helped tie into
either<00:03:23.450> into<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.230> impact<00:03:24.800> lead<00:03:25.040> or<00:03:25.550> into<00:03:26.090> the

either into the impact lead or into the
end<00:03:26.800> all<00:03:27.800> right<00:03:27.830> now<00:03:28.220> this<00:03:28.430> trace<00:03:28.910> length

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
end all right now this trace length

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.470 
end all right now this trace length
being<00:03:30.380> longer<00:03:31.810> there<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:32.930> no<00:03:33.140> strain<00:03:33.530> on<00:03:33.769> it

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
being longer there is no strain on it

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.410 
being longer there is no strain on it
like<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.630> strain<00:03:35.959> is<00:03:36.170> on<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.470> main<00:03:36.680> rip<00:03:37.010> body

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
like the strain is on the main rip body

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.270 
like the strain is on the main rip body
but<00:03:38.420> not<00:03:38.630> on<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.989> trace<00:03:39.260> leg<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.920> can<00:03:40.100> make

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
but not on the trace leg you can make

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.400 
but not on the trace leg you can make
this<00:03:40.489> trace<00:03:40.790> length<00:03:41.120> as<00:03:41.390> long<00:03:41.570> as<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:41.900> like

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
this trace length as long as you like

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.009 
this trace length as long as you like
it's<00:03:42.860> still<00:03:43.280> clipped<00:03:43.610> up<00:03:43.880> it's<00:03:44.300> still<00:03:44.570> tight

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
it's still clipped up it's still tight

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.880 
it's still clipped up it's still tight
and<00:03:45.980> once<00:03:46.510> this<00:03:47.510> release<00:03:50.170> your<00:03:51.170> hook<00:03:51.380> all<00:03:51.620> then

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
and once this release your hook all then

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.320 
and once this release your hook all then
come<00:03:52.130> off<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:54.320> clip<00:03:54.620> and<00:03:54.800> your<00:03:55.340> fader<00:03:55.730> fish<00:03:56.120> is

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
come off the clip and your fader fish is

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.780 
come off the clip and your fader fish is
normal
