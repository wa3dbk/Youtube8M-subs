00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.620
 great desire to guys I know use 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.389
 mister it is today we will see together with one 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.000
 of the most mysterious topics e 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.980
 hot are new mobile map of the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.170
 output a few days ago for call of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.650
 duty black ops 2 and we'll see together 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.900
 because the zombies sum of the dead have 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.210
 red eyes if they are asking 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.109
 a bit all since it was published 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.960
 the first trailer of this dlc in many 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.450
 they tried to give their explanation 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.910
 about it but I would start with one 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.730
 small premise how they think 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.890
 fans of this zombie mode 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.930
 have a different heart than the eyes in 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.360
 based on who is commanding them at that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.280
 precise moment that this heart can 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.960
 vary according to the event of 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.329
 history and action accomplished in the game 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.340
 then we know for sure that 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.590
 zombies have yellow eyes when there is 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.149
 the spirit of samantha govern them e 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.059
 even blue instead when there is spirit 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.880
 of rick tofu but can also have 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.040
 eyes off when these days don't 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.600
 they are checked by nobody for example if 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.869
 let's explode during the game 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.420
 a grenade and puts near the zombies 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.250
 to these if you make the case it will turn off the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.979
 light of their eyes and they will be 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.729
 momentarily the nobel because they are not 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.009
 governed by no one intends instead in 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.479
 so dead for the first time 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.759
 zombies have red eyes 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.280
 so there is a different entity a 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.189
 govern them over those that already exist 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.530
 we know and I think there are various 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.380
 clues in the game that can help us 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.960
 understand who it is exactly 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.220
 to the truth we have already known two 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.729
 characters with red eyes 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.290
 by loosening the hellish dogs there 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.170
 we also find in this map in 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.840
 extra large version and the driver of the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.090
 bus in transit our dearest 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.329
 ted that when hit 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.270
 repeatedly it gets angry and then canes 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.520
 couleur of members from blue to red 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.799
 however I would like to start by specifying that su 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.690
 new redhead we find ourselves fighting 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.510
 these needs with red eyes and 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.420
 on the island of Alcatraz which over time is 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.370
 also known as dead 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.220
 island of the devil island 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.799
 this because of the very strict rules 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.080
 that were imposed on prisoners on 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.910
 that prison and also to reactivate 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.940
 legends that hovered over this 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.980
 prison is something I think many of 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.970
 you will have noticed is that in the map there 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.319
 they are numerous references to the world 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.120
 of the underworld 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.640
 just think for example they have at home 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.299
 magic of weapons that has an appearance 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.090
 decidedly disturbing and infernal but 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.730
 Also new to the scholarly tome mentro 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.130
 criminal if you notice the color 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.489
 the dead robot's dominant is always 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.430
 red starting right from the poster 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.860
 Presentation of this game is all 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.010
 these things suggest that zombies 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.069
 in a dead way they are controlled at 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.780
 hell the devil we can find 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.560
 other hidden elements that do 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.870
 refer to this speech if you try 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.389
 for example to go into the staircase in 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.209
 where you can type that sequence 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.670
 of three numbers if you try to insert the 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.430
 number 115 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.920
 the machinery will start to go crazy 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.260
 they go a bit of numbers at random but before 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.980
 stop and display for some 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.889
 instant a precise number number 666 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.940
 which according to the bible corresponds to the 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.040
 number of the beast 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.250
 if instead we return to the machinery e 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.690
 let's try to raise number 9 35 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.450
 also this time the structure 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.190
 will begin to go crazy until it forms 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.260
 for a few moments but numerical sequence 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.030
 777 and according to it we also experience this 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.609
 number have a meaning and 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.859
 corresponds to the figure of god 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.120
 Also after you see the 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.389
 number 7 7 7 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.940
 a hidden song will also start 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:09.770
 composed of that unites to ruda 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.600
 entitled where are we go wine che 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.350
 translated into Italian means where 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.720
 we are going 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.880
 we therefore find a contrast between 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.350
 the underworld and the good e 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.420
 of course there is also a liking 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.709
 including two parallel worlds, namely the 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.080
 purgatory 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.100
 who is represented in the game by 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.020
 afterlife mode so it seems to me 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.750
 obvious that we find clear references to 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.390
 purgatory and hell and heaven 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.480
 they are key topics of the Bible but 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.740
 in addition to this book but this book 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.510
 sacred 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.700
 the greatest literary work on 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.670
 path of life after death is 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.820
 certainly the divine comedy of a 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:53.240
 certain Dante Alighieri in his work 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:57.260
 we find references to three heads 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:00.080
 hell the three lands the lion fairs 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.850
 the lynx and the wolf that the author in which 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.690
 will go giving his way to hell 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.440
 and in parallel also the new the dead 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.050
 they meet our path 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.870
 3 dresses the three dogs in newspapers 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.850
 gigantic said this guys 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.150
 anyway if you have other ideas or you have 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.430
 noticed other informal clues about this 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.900
 map a general writes quietly 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.060
 in the comments 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.420
 and before saying goodbye but I wanted to put 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.760
 in light two other references 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.190
 we are not aware of the world 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.500
 of the underworld can be found for 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.150
 the note in the zombie call mode 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.880
 of duty 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.650
 the first one I noticed is a poster that 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.010
 let's try it in the various rooms of kieber 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:46.850
 totem in which we find drawing of a 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.220
 hell this poster represented a 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.130
 work that was born on stage in that 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.340
 theater in which the legend was told 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.530
 of the faust, a scholar who even of 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.690
 get the absolute knowledge yes 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.900
 will convince you to make a pact with 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:06.080
 devil giving his own in return 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:10.760
 soul instead according to reference that I have 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:13.070
 found is that of gassman who in 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.700
 a few sentences during the game does 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:19.590
 reference something infernal 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:23.180
 let's run away is the devil himself 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:26.720
 fuck the demonic dogs right now 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:31.530
 because always and only tunnels 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.000
 I prefer to go through hell well 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.490
 guys that video canvases who is almost 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.630
 concluded I think I told you more or 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.880
 minus everything I think 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.100
 of these red eyes in short on 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.950
 zombie its alcatraz and various connections 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:47.400
 you possible anyway if you have others 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.650
 clues you want other neo theory a 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.810
 about this topic I invite 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.520
 as usual to leave a comment 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.590
 much desire for all the inches to 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:03.050
 Heaven please and see you at 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:06.050
 possible guys the fall of the giants 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.050
 dick 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:15.050
 one can win and in hell not 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.570
 ends here 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.570
 when you come back I'm there waiting for him
