00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
the recipe as it says we started out

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.680 
the recipe as it says we started out
with<00:00:55.830> some<00:00:56.130> chopped<00:00:57.170> potatoes<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:59.690> carrots

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
with some chopped potatoes and carrots

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.790 
with some chopped potatoes and carrots
and<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:00.990> we're<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.380> to<00:01:01.470> put<00:01:01.650> that

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and so we're just going to put that

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
and so we're just going to put that
right<00:01:02.010> into<00:01:02.190> our<00:01:02.370> water<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.970> we<00:01:03.120> already<00:01:03.360> got

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
right into our water and we already got

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.240 
right into our water and we already got
our<00:01:03.600> water<00:01:03.750> heating<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.470> waters<00:01:04.890> heating

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
our water heating up here waters heating

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.830 
our water heating up here waters heating
there's<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> potatoes<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.189> carrots<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
there's the potatoes and the carrots and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.960 
there's the potatoes and the carrots and
our<00:01:09.840> onions<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.370> idea<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.790> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
our onions and then the idea is that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.670 
our onions and then the idea is that
these<00:01:12.360> are<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.870> cook<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.470> takes

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
these are going to cook and it takes

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.100 
these are going to cook and it takes
about<00:01:13.970> depending<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.060> how<00:01:15.270> small<00:01:15.570> their<00:01:15.810> cut

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
about depending on how small their cut

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.500 
about depending on how small their cut
but<00:01:16.380> between<00:01:16.770> 10<00:01:17.190> and<00:01:17.220> 20<00:01:17.520> minutes<00:01:17.790> okay<00:01:18.240> you

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
but between 10 and 20 minutes okay you

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.290 
but between 10 and 20 minutes okay you
just<00:01:18.750> cover<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.440> let<00:01:19.770> them<00:01:20.040> cook<00:01:21.000> look

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
just cover it and let them cook look

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.450 
just cover it and let them cook look
that's<00:01:21.600> easy<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.290> yeah<00:01:22.440> and<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.430> we

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
that's easy a like yeah and then here we

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.820 
that's easy a like yeah and then here we
have<00:01:23.580> them<00:01:24.090> already<00:01:24.360> cooked<00:01:24.870> ok<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.650> is

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
have them already cooked ok this is

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.140 
have them already cooked ok this is
we're<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.070> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> blend<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:26.790> half<00:01:27.000> a

we're just going to blend up half a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.170 
we're just going to blend up half a
recipe<00:01:27.630> yes<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.700> would<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.880> half

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
why would you do that what's apparently

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.190 
why would you do that what's apparently
they<00:01:46.740> they<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.790> dirt<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.390> them<00:01:48.659> during<00:01:48.990> their

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
they they have dirt on them during their

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
harvesting and so it's that's what's

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.710 
harvesting and so it's that's what's
recommended<00:01:52.830> is<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.610> rinse<00:01:53.790> them<00:01:54.030> off<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.659> you

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
recommended is to rinse them off do you

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.480

the<00:02:04.890> thing<00:02:05.400> about<00:02:05.520> blending<00:02:06.150> is<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.450> you

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the thing about blending is that you

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.210 
the thing about blending is that you
really<00:02:06.930> want<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.260> to<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.560> creamy<00:02:07.830> smooth

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
