00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.140
 you know what I feel when I see this monique envy 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.559
 fierce envy because my monitor next to it does not even close up 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.540
 144 duke 27 inches and one millisecond while beautiful as Apollo 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:25.189
 asus rog swift you look at it well pure stealth beveled edges color is like 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:32.809
 On and generally looks gorgeous You can adjust the height at the corners 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:40.280
 you can even put the mount on the wall in portrait mode. 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.410
 100 is here under this cap in the foot there is a hole to skip 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.699
 through it all the wires the leg itself turns well and the snape is understandable 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.499
 Dealing with the monitor is connected by swift only through displayport 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:58.609
 there are no other ways to connect 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.559
 If you have a display port change, then look for an adapter if there is none 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.570
 connect will not work yet there is a usb 30 hub wire for power 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.610
 Of course, there is also nothing on this with connectors and ports. 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.700
 it is given a frame of 8 millimeters plus another black strip of millimeter 2 is obtained 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.210
 one centimeter but it's still cool especially if 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.259
 compare with other monitors menu is controlled by the joystick and the bottom is still 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.909
 four buttons exit game mode and turbo mode game mode allows 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.860
 put the sight in the center of the monitor, it can be either a cross or a circle 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.680
 different colors well for those games where there is no sight for you 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.570
 for example and even this mode allows you to set a timer for example for such 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.160
 games like dota killed roshana immediately set a timer he went to understand 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.820
 when he appears next time about the sight I do not know but the timer 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.590
 interesting thing the turbo button instantly changes ready for the monitor to the maximum 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.970
 I have this possible 120 hertz more they see they support the settings menu 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.240
 a little brightness contrast all these here 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.000
 Russian system settings there language and everything else and overclocking the matrix it 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.350
 maybe extreme normal or completely off i turn on extreme 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.180
 that is, with it moving objects will be without any loop at all here so time 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.459
 The response is 1 millisecond plus the overclocking of the matrix is ​​a cool 27-inch diagonal 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.840
 and the maximum resolution of 2560 by 1140 is a game monitor so it stands here 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.450
 tn matrix, respectively, the viewing angles here are not the maximum but even for 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.580
 tn matrices are a very good result here but with the transfer of color here everything is much 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.900
 better than with viewing angles here they are close to real not completely 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.489
 of course because mannick is still gaming and they are naturally brighter but 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.959
 Yet for the same reason, the margin of brightness here is such that in games even the most 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.880
 dark corners are highlighted perfectly and left you brightness by 80 percent and 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.680
 I had enough of this if you are used to full hd resolution 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.860
 this monica game transforms even the most ordinary 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.830
 dota which is by no means an indicator of beauty looks awesome small details 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.209
 clothes and the world are very clearly visible and in the aggregate it looks 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.850
 impressively playing Vx on this monica is not for you at 60 hertz ah you know how 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.320
 it is important when you are blinded for example for a split second 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.150
 faster and it is very important but in general in any action games they are all blurred and more 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.769
 smoothly but not all monik supports nvidia g-sync technology 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.150
 if in short it is very simple then this is all the same vertical synchronization only on 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.629
 The percent is not over narrow and fps does not sink but at the same 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.469
 time the picture does not twitch and there are no disruptions when you know one part 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.040
 the image shifts a bit and as if trying to catch up with the rest of the 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.680
 Well, here it is very clearly visible or here I think you understand something 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.140
 there is a picture of this technology that will be smooth, and there will be no such pieces 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.170
 just do not think that I am all on my laptop mobile video card 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.810
 Of course, I didn’t cite competitors to this monitor. 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.769
 No, with such characteristics there are no game monitors 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.780
 This is one of those things that I saw right away and I want to get embarrassed. 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.810
 only a small number of ports and the price of course but everything else 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.000
 super asus again did something that causes a wow effect and envy by 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.720
 relation to someone who has such a thing is on it all with you was an online store 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.060
 f and you are my name max subscribe to our YouTube channel and you will definitely 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.639
 participate in the competition and you play the mouse logger 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.990
 and maybe a mouse corsair; and maybe headphones corsair with a virtual middle 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.340
 By the way, sign up for sure how to make headphones wireless 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.530
