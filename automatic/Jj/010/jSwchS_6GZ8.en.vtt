00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.069
 Hello, welcome to a new video 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.190
 of professor let's make this video 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.070
 to see the types of numbers 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.250
 little super theoretic let's do 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.100
 all super fast and based on the pdf 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.070
 that sends you a game if you do not send the 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.630
 pdf or arrive at an email and send it 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.699
 send then we have the first 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.619
 types of numbers are the numbers 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.820
 that desist that they are designated 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.730
 one in capital letters and they are about 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.460
 and then there are the integers that is a 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.470
 zeta capital that are the natural and 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.100
 besides the negatives that is to say the minus 1 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.010
 - 2 - 3 and the 4 minus 5 at least three 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.920
 minus 70 that remain the numbers 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.220
 rationals that are denoted by the cv and 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.010
 here there are several fractions 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.940
 three means 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.350
 four thirds that 65 sixth this trance 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.210
 3 then there are the decimal numbers 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.729
 but not all but the exact decimal 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.100
 and then the pure newspaper and the 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:14.049
 mixed newspaper this mutation would be 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:19.659
 23 with a little hat there you see it, not this one 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:22.659
 It would be 7,35 by with a hat too 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:26.880
 could be the 4.31 with hat that is 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.229
 a pure newspaper or me that if the 3.4 73 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.500
 73 73 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.380
 etcetera et cetera etcetera well and then 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.490
 we have the irrational numbers 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.280
 important his tenth expression has 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.220
 infinite figures non-periodic figures 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.860
 example the pib the pib 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.280
 this is 14 etc. etcetera etcetera no 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.700
 yes and then for example following 5 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.220
 face of 5 would be 2 acting with 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.070
 calculator in more than average 23 60 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.790
 797 points suspension points 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.380
 suspensive is not that these have 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.590
 infinite and infinite decimals but 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.990
 distrustful you see it not and these six without 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.140
 period and the set of 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.050
 numbers and regional plus those that form 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.790
 the network hectares with us is very 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.040
 typical in mathematics draw the straight 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.530
 real, a line is drawn, because here it is not 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.880
 knows and then what the 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.330
 whole numbers is usually put by the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.780
 half 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.770
 I have to draw the 5 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:33.240
 1 2 3 4 5 for example provoke at least 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:37.440
 2 -1 and -2 that are fractions for now 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.290
 more or less and you've already understood I'm going 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.810
 erase let's see the sets all 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.330
 together and let's move on to another video that 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.540
 this is to understand everything if you have any 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.579
 difficulty 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.579
 let's see where it's going 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.220
 here we have a set to see that 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.310
 the natural numbers are these here 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.720
 I would think that if you feel it 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.340
 example here will also put in 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.050
 negative brains but less 1 1 2 2 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.510
 we see clearly that the numbers 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.790
 natural belong to within is a 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.500
 subset of the integers and 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.590
 here in cu we could put the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.590
 fractions three quarters minus 56 all 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.290
 the exact decimal numbers the 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.220
 pure newspapers 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.810
 and newspapers seen for example worth 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.350
 then outside of those who would be 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.890
 irrational what would be what is out 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:41.069
 of cu for example following 7 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.910
 the number of euler the number of what 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:47.280
 it opened and of 8 same is valid etcetera 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.650
 etcetera etcetera and the set of 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.129
 irrational and rational gives me 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.810
 and well, this is introductory 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.989
 because good is not important but good 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.010
 as in the agenda we give it so fast and 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.010
 we are already here
