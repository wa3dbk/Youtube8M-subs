00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.000 

perfect<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.020> shows<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.410> Lane<00:00:40.620> still

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
perfect and it shows that Lane still

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.530 
perfect and it shows that Lane still
doesn't<00:00:41.460> fully<00:00:41.610> understand<00:00:42.000> her<00:00:42.120> powers

because certain you know her father and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.920 
because certain you know her father and
Alice<00:00:47.210> still<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.710> even<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.129> other<00:00:50.219> kid<00:00:50.550> they

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
Alice still and even the other kid they

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.680 
Alice still and even the other kid they
still<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.530> very<00:00:53.070> vague<00:00:53.430> memories<00:00:53.850> which

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
still have very vague memories which

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.040 
still have very vague memories which
they<00:00:55.469> would<00:00:55.620> probably<00:00:55.860> attribute<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.460> deja<00:00:56.670> vu

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
they would probably attribute to deja vu

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.520 
they would probably attribute to deja vu
and<00:00:58.520> it's<00:00:59.520> funny<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.840> weird<00:01:01.020> way<00:01:01.109> because

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
and it's funny in a weird way because

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.860 
and it's funny in a weird way because
masami<00:01:01.920> everyone<00:01:02.910> seems<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.239> me<00:01:03.420> pretty<00:01:03.690> happy

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
except masami and I guess it was because

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.130 
except masami and I guess it was because
he<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> miserable<00:01:09.360> person<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.990> begin

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
with um so that happens and Lane becomes

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.230 
with um so that happens and Lane becomes
depressed<00:01:19.580> because<00:01:21.799> she<00:01:22.799> has<00:01:22.890> no<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.240> she's

there's<00:02:35.760> two<00:02:36.030> interpretations<00:02:36.629> to<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.879> i'ma

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
there's two interpretations to this i'ma

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.369 
there's two interpretations to this i'ma
say<00:02:39.120> my<00:02:39.420> interpretation<00:02:40.079> of<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.349> I<00:02:41.269> think<00:02:42.379> that

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
say my interpretation of it I think that

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.140 
say my interpretation of it I think that
her<00:02:43.500> father<00:02:43.829> was<00:02:44.400> just<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.939> fragment<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:47.150> her

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
her father was just a fragment of her

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.619 
her father was just a fragment of her
mind<00:02:48.889> just<00:02:49.889> to<00:02:50.069> accept<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.459> fact<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.790> she's

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
mind just to accept the fact that she's

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.119
