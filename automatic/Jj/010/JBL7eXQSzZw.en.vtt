00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 how to choose drywall repairs in the house 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.560
 unlikely to do without 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.360
 use of new material 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.660
 drywall roll off done faster and 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.950
 simpler and most importantly economically every 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.170
 can learn without problems 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.880
 operate drywall sheets and 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.050
 to embody with them any design 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.840
 fantasy 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.609
 and to choose the right drywall 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.869
 you just need to understand it 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.820
 the classification of what is drywall 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.380
 drywall is years of gypsum plastered with two 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.149
 sides of cardboard paper 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.430
 considered one of the most convenient 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.219
 building materials for repair and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.010
 construction work which drywall 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.950
 happens most often in repair is used 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.770
 only basic types of drywall sheets 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.460
 in the home repair yourself and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.700
 even more so 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.910
 they are even less different in size 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.879
 color and size specifications can 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.660
 be different most often width is 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.530
 120 or 122 centimeters our drywall 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.960
 and import respectively length 150 300 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.420
 centimeters slips and others 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.240
 dimensions with that every year in this 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.939
 plan makers have succeeded and starts 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.450
 tear down already formed 100 standards 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.159
 as the correct form sheets 120 by 300 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.030
 centimeters very hard 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.799
 transport on it all without a difference 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.290
 drywall perfectly cut with a knife and 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.130
 create the right size is not a problem 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.290
 more importantly its thickness this is one 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.290
 of the main classification parameters 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.150
 plasterboard thickness sheets 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.520
 drywall is divided into three types 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.799
 12 and a half nine and a half and 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.840
 six and a half millimeters most 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.579
 thin plasterboard sheets of 6 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.130
 half millimeter is used for 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.200
 creating on the ceiling arches they first 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.450
 light that is important for stepped 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.670
 ceilings second easily lend themselves 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.920
 deformations for forming curves 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.420
 surfaces 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.790
 likewise with a nine middle view 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.100
 half millimeter the so-called 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.259
 ceiling drywall it is also easy 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.840
 it bends under small corners and is easier 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.120
 classic thickness 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.580
 now the classic size is 12.5 mm 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.250
 meters such sheets are used as per 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.920
 the ceiling and the walls but on the ceiling 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.959
 works with sheets of thickness 12 5 already 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.750
 cannot form steps due to 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.360
 big weight so most often it 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.930
 take precisely for walls with these reasons 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.250
 sheets of 12.5 millimeters are often called 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.519
 walls plasterboard 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.200
 although this is not quite true except 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.810
 thickness grading 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.690
 drywall is divided by color which 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.609
 indicates the characteristics of the sheets most 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.790
 popular colors 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:51.609
 white-gray green red-pink and 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.879
 yellow white and gray can be called 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:57.129
 classic drywall wherever it is 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.370
 need to increase the performance of moisture and 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.620
 temperatures take exactly him him and the most 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.799
 the cheapest option that made it 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.290
 most popular green color 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.780
 indicates high moisture resistance 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.480
 so green plasterboard sheets 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.700
 appropriately used for kitchen walls 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.389
 bathroom and other rooms with 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.549
 high humidity red drywall 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.829
 stable to high temperatures 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.380
 such a refractory option 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.500
 used most often to create walls 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.180
 at the enterprises and in non-residential premises 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.310
 latest version yellow drywall 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.220
 created specifically for mounting on 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.769
 front of the room it is resistant to 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.980
 temperature lag is a great solution for 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.239
 finishing the external parts of the house 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.459
 classification of drywall sheets 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.709
 goes in the form of an edge with a longitudinal 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.049
 sides it can have a different shape with 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.810
 always always straight and not glued 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.430
 Edge-shaped cardboard drywall 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.099
 happens with the following conditional 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:05.530

 rectangular edge with glued edges 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.099
 This type of drywall is used in 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.090
 places where they come putty

 drywall can be embedded at the joints

 where do you want to install new walls 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.010
