crisp eyes
I<00:02:20.190> mean<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.180> was<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.660> was<00:02:21.720> ridiculous<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.069> they

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
I mean it was it was ridiculous so they

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.760 
I mean it was it was ridiculous so they
tone<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.940> down<00:02:23.970> that's<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.660> very<00:02:24.959> good<00:02:25.200> thing

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
tone that down that's a very good thing

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.949 
tone that down that's a very good thing
also<00:02:26.489> if<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.150> one<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.330> those<00:02:27.480> players<00:02:27.780> that

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
also if you one of those players that

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.770 
also if you one of those players that
like<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.470> play<00:02:28.709> off<00:02:29.040> ball<00:02:29.430> defense<00:02:30.000> they

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
like to play off ball defense they

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.620 
like to play off ball defense they
actually<00:02:31.230> enhance<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.160> AR<00:02:32.610> Cottrell<00:02:33.060> defense

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
actually enhance the AR Cottrell defense

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.839 
actually enhance the AR Cottrell defense
so<00:02:34.260> if<00:02:34.500> you're<00:02:34.650> playing<00:02:34.890> all<00:02:35.069> ball<00:02:35.370> defense

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
so if you're playing all ball defense

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.259 
so if you're playing all ball defense
the<00:02:36.209> ball<00:02:36.420> handler<00:02:37.310> cannot<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.580> blow<00:02:38.940> right

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
the ball handler cannot just blow right

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.660 
the ball handler cannot just blow right
by<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.840> now<00:02:40.220> so<00:02:41.220> that's<00:02:41.880> also<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.390> plus<00:02:43.400> now<00:02:44.400> I
