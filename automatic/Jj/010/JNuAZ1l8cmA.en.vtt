00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.670
 that beautiful love story between a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.830
 mermaid and a prince who tells us 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.540
 disney but there is something more sick and 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.880
 bizarre about this story which 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.010
 Disney was in charge of erasing it turns out that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.980
 the little mermaid lives in an underwater kingdom 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.260
 with his father the king of the sea his grandmother and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.630
 his five older sisters each 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.849
 born a year of difference 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.949
 little mermaid was the most beautiful of all her 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.320
 sisters and had the most beautiful voice in 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.780
 the whole kingdom she loved to sing 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.579
 and he did it very often ariel was a 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.290
 very curious young woman because she was 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.809
 prevented to explore and know the surface 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.239
 she longed to go out and get to know the sky 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.370
 blue and look at the birds fly too 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.340
 there was a kind of ritual it turns out that 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.200
 when a mermaid turns 16 she 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.090
 allows you to go up and look at the world of 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.640
 surface and when each of the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.260
 sisters are old enough 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.750
 they visit the surface one at a time each 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.390
 year when it's the little mermaid's turn 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.460
 it ventures to the surface I see a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.290
 ship with a handsome prince and he 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.960
 he falls madly in love with him from the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.540
 distance suddenly unleashes a 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.850
 and the little mermaid saves the prince from dying 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.119
 drowned in the sea then takes it to the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.920
 shore near the temple still unconscious 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.590
 she accompanies him until a young woman 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.110
 finds the prince never comes to see 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.060
 the little mermaid asks the little mermaid 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.640
 your grandmother if humans can live 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.470
 forever if they do not drown the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.509
 Grandma explains that humans have 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.180
 time much shorter life 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.740
 the 300 years that the sirens have but 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.720
 that when the sirens die it 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.820
 become meerschaum and stop 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.530
 exist while humans have 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.440
 an eternal soul that continues to exist 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.330
 in heaven the little mermaid longing for 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.310
 prince and to have an eternal soul that 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.320

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.690
 from the sea who sells him a potion that 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.759
 He gives legs in exchange for his voice since the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.490
 little mermaid had the most beautiful voice 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.590
 world the witch of the sea ​​warns you without 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.380
 However, once it becomes 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.360
 human will never be able to return to the sea to take 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.190
 the potion will make it feel as if a 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.259
 sword will pierce the entire body 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.970
 making her suffer the most ill pain 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.100
 of his whole life but when he 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.120
 will recover she would have two beautiful 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.040
 legs 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.830
 able to dance like no human has 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.440
 danced ever though constantly 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.750
 feel like you're walking on 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.400
 swords sharp enough to 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.200
 make her bleed making her life 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.530
 miserable and full of pain more 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.510
 disturbing will also only get a 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.000
 soul if the prince loves her and marries 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.400
 she because then a part of her 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.470
 soul will pass to the body of the witch but 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.599
 if the prince married another woman 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.569
 the little mermaid would die in the morning 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.980
 following despite the warnings the 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.410
 little mermaid drinks the potion and goes to 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.840
 meet the prince who attracts him 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.269
 her beauty and grace even though she 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.519
 be mute what he likes most is to see her 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.859
 dance and she dances for him despite the 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.989
 unbearable and immense pain that that 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.510
 cause she has to disguise before the 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.640
 prince when that ending up destroyed and 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.670
 almost immobilized by the immense pain 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.769
 the little mermaid came back together with the prince 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.470
 and he won his affection with his grace and his 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.000
 dances when the father of the prince 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.340
 orders him to marry the 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.230
 princess of the neighboring kingdom the prince will 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.450
 He tells the little mermaid not to do it because 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.050
 he does not love the princess and he can only 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.230
 to love 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.910
 from the temple who he thinks saved him 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.410
 secretly he was in love with the 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.660
 first young man who had seen the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.240
 waking up on the beach who he thought was his 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.130
 Saving this one turned out to be the princess 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.530
 of the neighboring kingdom with whom the kings 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.930
 they had agreed to marry him and the prince 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.360
 he celebrated his happy wedding accompanied by 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.460
 the whole court including the little mermaid 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.650
 that he had no voice to explain the truth 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.050
 When the prince and princess 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.580
 they marry the heart of the little mermaid 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.830
 a sharp and strong pain in the heart 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.740
 reason not only for his defeat but 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.570
 also a sign of tragic ending she 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.370
 think of all the things that 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.830
 resigned and all the pain and blood that 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.200
 she had to suffer and desperately thinking 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.210
 that death awaits her but before the 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.190
 dawn your sisters bring you a 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.020
 very sharp knife that the witch of 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.570
 Mar gave them in exchange for their long hair 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.580
 if the little mermaid kills the prince 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.650
 nailing the knife in the heart and 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.780
 letting his blood run down his feet 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.880
 will be a mermaid all his 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.640
 suffering and agony will end and may 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.280
 to live his mermaid life with his 300 years 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.500
 but the little mermaid was not able to kill 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.720
 the prince while he was sleeping in his bed 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.220
 with his wife she looked at the happy face 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.740
 of his beloved and the only thing he could do 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.110
 was to give him a very passionate kiss since 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.940
 I still loved him and when the sun comes up she 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.800
 walks towards the sea throws that the 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.480
 knife that his sisters gave him and 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.390
 with tears in his eyes gives one last 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.550
 look at the world that leaves your body 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.430
 turns into foam but instead of ceasing 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.620
 to exist feels the heat of the sun has 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.140
 become a spirit a daughter of 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.060
 air the other daughters of the air give the 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.160
 welcome and they explain to him that he became 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.860
 in one of them because he tried with all 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.720
 forces get her eternal soul 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.540
 You can win a soul by doing good 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.669
 actions for 300 years for each child 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.070
 good that you will find it would be subtracted 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.810
 year to all that time for every bad boy 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.840
 she would cry and every tear 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.790
 it would mean a month more then one day 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.530
 she would have a soul that 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.530
 I would live eternally in heaven 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.439
 all right
