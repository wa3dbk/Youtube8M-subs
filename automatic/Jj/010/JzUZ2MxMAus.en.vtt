00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hi everyone and welcome to 01net tv 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.799
 we are in London today for 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.950
 introduce you to a highly anticipated phone 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.440
 this is the new lg the g3 here it is 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.870
 so how to compare it against the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.250
 compete with galaxy s 5 and others 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.510
 high-end smartphones and especially that 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.590
 is there any more compared to the streams of 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:27.779
 kate was released last year 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:29.820
 the answer right now so here it is 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.769
 this lg g3 so much to tell you that we 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.480
 is a little disappointed here since in fact before 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.530
 same as the conference does start a 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.660
 little everywhere in the world and well everything 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.010
 the world knew everything about this g3 it has 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.260
 leaked on the web for a few days 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.270
 and well before the start of the conference 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.399
 on the very website of alger there was 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 all the technical specifications of 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.210
 this new smartphone so we are a little 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.500
 come for nothing here that says not everything to 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.600
 done since look we can still 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.230
 the way in the hands this g3 it's 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.270
 superb 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.340
 the design is very successful and what 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.760
 snap as soon as we see it and well that's 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.989
 its screen an ultra hd screen so that's 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.449
 quad hd 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.860
 these four times the resolution of the hd 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.590
 so if we go back a little bit in 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.189
 details in pixels per inch is enough 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.780
 monstrous 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.290
 to give you an order of magnitude 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.200
 on the galaxy s 5 we have exactly 4 132 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.320
 pixels per inch on the htc put 8 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.659
 we have 4,169 and of course this lg on has 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.630
 5 138 and it shows sincerely it's 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.890
 sees the screen and a definition 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.119
 amazing when we walk in the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.350
 menus when we look at the photos when 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.360
 we watch videos frankly 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.759
 see the difference is enough 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.189
 impressive one must also know that 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.350
 the camera can take pictures 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.630
 in 4k it's easy but mostly filmed 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.880
 in 4k it is practical that this 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.280
 smartphone is now a sd card 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.780
 we can add a sd card because 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.270
 that you can do a lot of videos 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.890
 quite long in full age and even in case 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.610
 of case the design of this lg is 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.619
 interesting 76 points 4% of the surface 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.460
 total of the phone is the screen what 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.469
 makes the screen virtually 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.969
 the whole phone surface and that 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.340
 it's really appreciable it was 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.710
 already a feat on the g2 is still 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.380
 a feat on the device side g3 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.750
 photo 3 megapixels so two novelties 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.979
 interesting 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.230
 autofocus which is very very very 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.990
 fast in fact that you use a 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.610
 laser feature look we did 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.190
 the little tries and it's true that 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.690
 it's very fast the focus and 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.700
 is done but almost 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.530
 instant whether on plans to 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.170
 to move away on the evidence that is 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.630
 very close side selphy small 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.150
 nice novelty so it's a gadget 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.800
 look when you approach the hand of the 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.600
 smartphone when we want to take one 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.190
 which in fact is the device the 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.959
 detects and you have three seconds to 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.640
 bring out your best smile 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.610
 that's what it gives it's rather 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.620
 funny side new software and 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.330
 well the knock code that we made you 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.560
 already discovering already at mobile world 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.390
 congress so what is it 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.880
 it's a system to unlock very 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.620
 easily his phone you tap to 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.180
 specific locations on the screen 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.100
 when it's off and your phone 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.220
 unlocks like magic 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.989
 lg but also well the package on 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.489
 all the security all your data on 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.230
 your smartphone will be encrypted 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.970
 so what if someone your flight 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.200
 your smartphone and plug it into 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.760
 his computer he will not be able 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.050
 recover your photos or all your 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.780
 documents everything is encrypted and 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.610
 confidential that's pretty good 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.680
 the good news is that lg has corrected 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.200
 the two major major flaws of the lg of 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.930
 the battery is removable a battery of 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.700
 3 million eur pair we'll see if that 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.220
 it gives autonomy when the lab 0 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.930
 is will receive it and then the other 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.700
 novelty too which is very nice 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.720
 it was really missing in the g2 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.940
 is there now you go 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.340
 able to put a micro sd and so 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.000
 increase the memory capacity of your 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.650
 smartphone 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.120
 I said it will be very practical if you 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.070
 want to make videos in 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.390
 4k 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.239
 the phone is very pretty and especially 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.070
 very light bravo alger on this point in 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.180
 but it's not waterproof it's true 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.130
 that the fashion of smartphones today 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.230
 high-end is either sony or 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.850
 samsung it's waterproofing and of course 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.579
 lg is better not to make it fall into 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.560
 the pool you may regret this 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.720
 lg g3 will exist in five colors there too 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.560
 aad I made an effort on the choice of 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.260
 available colors 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.170
 it will be available in white gold in 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.060
 black in red and blue finally a red 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.170
 burgundy and these are colors that 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.730
 are rather nice 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.170
 side accessories also a lot of 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.690
 news with an induction charger 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.070
 which will be available dips and then 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.450
 also look at its bluetooth headphones 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.580
 enough 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.130
 innovative then you put them around 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.500
 your neck and you can pull the 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.970
 little sons for after branch is 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.250
 squarely the atria in your 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.720
 ears that too to test to see at 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.580
 quality level of blood elsewhere lg a 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.740
 relied on the quality of sound and image 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.260
 on his smartphone a bit like the 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.790
 htc one m8 and especially for all that 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.210
 is sound taken when you make a 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.010
 video 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.250
 and obviously the sound quality 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.930
 will be better there again attested when 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.520
 the lab will have this phone 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.010
 so precisely when does it come out and 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.370
 well in July next its price 599 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.200
 euros for the version 16 gigabytes remains 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.560
 despite everything in smartphones top of 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.940
 range 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.760
 that's what we could say about 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.600
 this lg g3 on 01net tv and we end up 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.600
 very quickly thank you for following us
