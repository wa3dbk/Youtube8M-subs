00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.970
 it's beauty people 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.580
 today I will provide one more explanation 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.010
 with respect to the difference of 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.339
 good subwoofer 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.640
 in fact this video is more a 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.990
 response to the comments of a 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.939
 explanation itself 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.769
 the staff ask ah but I can 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:34.879
 mixing subwoofer and 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:38.030
 because some offers are called 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:43.309
 like subwoofers by certain stores 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:46.010
 finally what happens in the relation of the market 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:50.090
 automotive sound is the need to 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.550
 a fair that works much like climbing 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.579
 answer in the bass frequencies 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.890
 subwoofer and how to enjoy responding 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.140
 punching frequencies but dry 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.800
 the market for selenium appeared 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.070
 it was the teams that had ended and with 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.829
 relationship can be mixed up with offer 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.579
 good as I said earlier if 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:16.579
 you use a sub is alas a high 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:19.640
 speaker that employs the role of both 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:22.009
 as a subwoofer as is the case with the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.110
 selenium made for example you 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.630
 dispenses with the use of any other 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.290
 type of speaker other than a mid and 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.210
 It's high to give a cooler timbre. 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.719
 in the voice of the artist that this one will not 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.640
 will not provide a voice is more in the 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.290
 the drier beats and the 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.060
 long beats 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.420
 now if you have in the car for example 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.060
 a raised box can use the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.490
 offer can but in most cases you 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.329
 already have 69 will have a speaker of 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.250
 port that will perform this function of 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.020
 fill in the response frequency 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.539
 referring to voice 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.030
 then I can build a box with a 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.189
 on each side a climb and see 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.369
 Well, that's where it comes in that it's not 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.129
 because it usually offers 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.400
 work with him bring less than the 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.450
 of the hubs because we have 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.270
 a climb 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.900
 three hundred people take the child of 400 or 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:26.209
 of 300 and puts in a box type this box 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:29.629
 that this box here for 2 did it in case 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.989
 what will happen to the litter for the 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.530
 two left in this box will not stay 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.530
 cool 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.599
 precisely for this reason the climb 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.019
 needs a law brings a little higher 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.060
 so that you can reproduce the 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.069
 slightly lower frequencies and 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.140
 offer to beat that beat more 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.290
 dry a slightly smaller box 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.420
 then there arises the need for you're 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.840
 making a box for each one or 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.930
 would become unfeasible then instead 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.670
 of mixing in a small car that I 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.980
 I recommend using these high 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.540
 for example to be returned 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.670
 work as both offer and subwoofer 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.380
 tap pickup 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.120
 there it is at your discretion you can 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.450
 put a box just for kicks 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.489
 and a box just for fears use is the 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.609
 criterion of each one has no problem 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.549
 no mix I even brought you here 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.560
 provide an example for you here 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.319
 some other speakers in the celino case 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.440
 become that way because 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.299
 He works this way as he offers it. 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.720
 has the main characteristics that 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:43.250
 even the wide coil has the ability to 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.639
 tour and at the same time the 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.819
 rigid suspension and cones guaranteeing 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:52.250
 so the response of recognizing the good 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.410
 higher frequencies and also for 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.260
 selenium low frequencies 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.290
 making this here is the 2000 rms 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.650
 he has a double that allows a course 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.630
 even higher than the 1,100 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.910
 so for those who already know the tornado of 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.389
 1,100 already know that it works very well 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.849
 as fi and like climbing now become 4 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:15.859
 A thousand will work better still. 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.690
 only the question of power and you 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.630
 tour more and have a set 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.659
 Dual magnetic ok then hope 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.970
 this video that answers the doubts that 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:27.360
 have arisen as to whether or not 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.800
 mix 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.349
 and also with what you will balance the 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.419
 use of a fears inside the car 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.849
 so that it does not take up so much space 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.009
 as recommended using high 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.129
 speakers who work as much as 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:46.259
 offering personal touch subwoofer 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:48.780
 I hope this video is useful for 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.030
 If you liked the video, do not 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.159
 forget to sign up for our channel and 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.659
 will already comment on this video for 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.530
 that we can perfect our 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.599
 job 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.599
 Okay, and until the next time.
