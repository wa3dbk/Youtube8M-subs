2013 in this video we're gonna be going
over<00:00:04.470> how<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.710> use<00:00:05.160> machine<00:00:05.700> as<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.450> live

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
over how to use machine as a live

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.320 
over how to use machine as a live
effects<00:00:07.350> unit<00:00:07.710> first<00:00:08.670> thing<00:00:08.910> we<00:00:09.000> need<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.179> do

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
effects unit first thing we need to do

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.700 
effects unit first thing we need to do
is<00:00:09.480> make<00:00:09.660> sure<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.900> our<00:00:10.080> audio<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.440> MIDI

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
is make sure that our audio and MIDI

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.770 
is make sure that our audio and MIDI
settings<00:00:11.160> are<00:00:11.460> set<00:00:11.639> up<00:00:11.759> correctly<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.540> we're

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
settings are set up correctly so we're

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.780 
settings are set up correctly so we're
gonna<00:00:12.870> go<00:00:13.110> up<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.860> file<00:00:14.070> menu<00:00:14.219> then<00:00:14.549> we're

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
gonna go up to the file menu then we're

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.420 
gonna go up to the file menu then we're
gonna<00:00:14.910> go<00:00:15.059> down<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.509> audio<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.049> MIDI<00:00:16.170> settings

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
gonna go down to audio and MIDI settings

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.380 
gonna go down to audio and MIDI settings
so<00:00:17.430> now<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.609> we're<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.940> audio<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.270> MIDI

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
so now that we're in the audio in MIDI

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.640 
so now that we're in the audio in MIDI
settings<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.869> need<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.109> make<00:00:19.230> sure<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.439> we

and<00:01:25.590> today<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.430> are<00:01:26.610> going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.330> that

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and today we are going to do just that

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.350 
and today we are going to do just that
so<00:01:27.750> we're<00:01:28.409> gonna<00:01:28.500> go<00:01:28.740> ahead<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.009> first<00:01:29.579> select

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
so we're gonna go ahead and first select

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.690 
so we're gonna go ahead and first select
the<00:01:30.540> sound<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.140> want<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.770> assign<00:01:32.400> this

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the sound that we want to assign this

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.550 
the sound that we want to assign this
input<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.540> we're<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> go<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.200> sound

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
input to so we're going to go on sound

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
input to so we're going to go on sound
then<00:01:35.310> we're<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.640> hit<00:01:35.759> pad<00:01:36.030> 1<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
then we're going to hit pad 1 just to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.030 
then we're going to hit pad 1 just to
make<00:01:36.750> sure<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.200> sound<00:01:37.439> 1<00:01:37.619> selected

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
make sure that we have sound 1 selected

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.130 
make sure that we have sound 1 selected
then<00:01:38.700> we're<00:01:39.000> gonna<00:01:39.180> go<00:01:39.360> ahead<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.659> press

on module 1 first we're going to want to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.770 
on module 1 first we're going to want to
make<00:01:50.520> sure<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.880> our<00:01:51.000> type<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.479> set<00:01:51.630> to
