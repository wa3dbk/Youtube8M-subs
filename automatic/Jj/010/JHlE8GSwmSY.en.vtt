00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.070
 France's tank construction began during the First World War 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:15.229
 Neukirch see the Sikhs 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:16.570
 it was the first chancellor 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.320
 whose main weapon is housed in a completely rotatable turret 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.320
 was 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.150
 These traditions led French designers to develop the 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150
 Battle Tank Leclaire continues 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.750
 he was named after Marshal Philippe Le Claire 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.670
 1944 at the liberation of Paris the free French second 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.670
 Panzer Division led 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.250
 In 1990 the tank was presented to the public 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.910
 Hella Blair received a conventional trick goals 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.590
 However, an extraordinarily modern weapons and fire easily plant 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.190
 In the tower, a loader machine was installed to replace the Lada protect replaced 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.450
 the 120 millimeter smooth 4 cannon shoots the same ammo the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.450
 German Leopard and the American increased 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.920
 the extended or cannon 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.630
 generates a stronger estuarine area 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.630
 resulting in a greater range 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.350
 more on the tower is a 762 millimeter machine gun 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.350
 which is operated from the inside of the tank 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.680
 as well as a 12 grief 7 millimeters coaxial machine guns 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:25.829
 The fire escape system being plugged will not capture six counters at once 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.349
 and delivers pictures of all measuring points in real time 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.000
 by networking the systems 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 as each crew member access to the data 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.300
 the computer system that the expected Odinga the stakes in the group 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.300
 and allows each commander a data match 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.450
 So you do not just communicate by radio anymore 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.110
 but exchanges important information about digital data systems 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.899
 among themselves 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:02.900
 However, this networking is in the crews 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.900
 a high level of technical knowledge and can advance 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.559
 during a fight is the constant communication with others 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:13.949
 Armored vehicles of the unit guaranteed 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.969
 With this it is possible for the crews information about the exact position 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:22.319
 the fuel stood or the remaining ammunition of each vehicle 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.319
 to get the unit 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.950
 As new anti-tank weapons can be developed an armor 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:34.129
 be outdated in five years 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.379
 the gap he was therefore equipped with tanks around the modules the side 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.369
 and are mounted on the tower 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:44.599
 The modules are interchangeable for fast and innovative weapon systems 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.599
 to be able to react efficiently 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.919
 Next to this passive protection facility is the Le Claire with the so-called 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.429
 Gawlik systems equipped 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:59.539
 From the side of the goalie brought fog throwing pitch to can infrared 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:03.349
 distract chance later shells or smoke grenades are fired 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.609
 This system allows fog to throw litter Kopper and then back 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.609
 to draw 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.180
 one of the key differences between the leak closer and others 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.259
 comparable tanks is the elimination of Lada protect 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:27.819
 he load automaton reduces the crew to three persons 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.509
 Gallup Empty is the smallest of the Western main battle sponsor 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.509
 and weighs just 55 tons 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:13.639
 and Hans plays an important role in our strategies 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.259
 complains Cannes on the battlefield with every other tank record 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:26.549
 and is also able to respond appropriately to future threats b
