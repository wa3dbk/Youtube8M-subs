eyeshadow and it's also gonna complement
my<00:02:35.390> winged<00:02:35.660> liner<00:02:36.049> so<00:02:41.739> if<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:42.920> choose<00:02:43.129> to

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
my winged liner so if you choose to

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.979 
my winged liner so if you choose to
blend<00:02:43.549> this<00:02:43.730> through<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.120> little<00:02:44.390> bit<00:02:44.480> more<00:02:44.720> you

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
blend this through a little bit more you

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.360 
blend this through a little bit more you
know<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.170> can<00:02:45.379> go<00:02:45.470> right<00:02:45.680> ahead<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:45.950> do<00:02:46.160> that

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
know you can go right ahead and do that

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.309 
know you can go right ahead and do that
but<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:47.090> was<00:02:47.239> my<00:02:47.390> intention<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.989> have<00:02:48.110> these

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
but it was my intention to have these

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.559 
but it was my intention to have these
obvious<00:02:48.920> angles<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:49.760> you'll<00:02:50.120> see<00:02:50.299> how<00:02:50.420> it

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
obvious angles and you'll see how it

00:02:50.569 --> 00:03:09.540 
obvious angles and you'll see how it
comes<00:02:50.720> together<00:02:50.959> in<00:02:51.379> the<00:02:51.530> end

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.980 

so<00:03:10.550> I'm<00:03:10.640> adding<00:03:10.790> some<00:03:10.940> more<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.300> that<00:03:11.480> orange

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
so I'm adding some more of that orange

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.170
