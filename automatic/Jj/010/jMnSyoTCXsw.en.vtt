00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
stuff like that it took me a while like

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.290 
stuff like that it took me a while like
I<00:02:26.070> said<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.340> figure<00:02:26.550> out<00:02:26.670> what<00:02:26.760> was<00:02:26.880> going<00:02:26.970> on

I said to figure out what was going on

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.480 
I said to figure out what was going on
but<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:28.260> was<00:02:28.380> still<00:02:28.740> like<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.340> know
