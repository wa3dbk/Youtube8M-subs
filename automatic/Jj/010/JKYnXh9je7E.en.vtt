yo Elliot selectors question for my
buddy<00:00:12.059> Adam<00:00:12.269> he<00:00:12.540> wants<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.840> know<00:00:12.990> what<00:00:13.200> the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
buddy Adam he wants to know what the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.259 
buddy Adam he wants to know what the
difference<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.860> between<00:00:14.519> doing<00:00:15.000> a

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
difference is between doing a

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.150 
difference is between doing a
conventional<00:00:15.839> deadlift<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.859> sumo

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
conventional deadlift and a sumo

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.590 
conventional deadlift and a sumo
deadlift<00:00:17.609> right<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:17.850> mean<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.210> would<00:00:18.330> assume

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
deadlift right I mean you would assume

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.090 
deadlift right I mean you would assume
that<00:00:18.660> they're<00:00:18.960> both<00:00:19.109> deadlifts<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:19.980> they're

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
that they're both deadlifts so they're

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.670 
that they're both deadlifts so they're
probably<00:00:20.220> doing<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> same<00:00:20.850> thing<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.680> Adam

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
probably doing the same thing and Adam

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.920 
probably doing the same thing and Adam
situation<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.490> such<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.789> he<00:00:24.180> prefer<00:00:24.630> doing

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
situation is such that he prefer doing

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.750 
situation is such that he prefer doing
the<00:00:25.109> sumo<00:00:25.439> he<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.070> wants<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.310> make<00:00:26.460> sure<00:00:26.490> that

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
the sumo he just wants to make sure that

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.670 
the sumo he just wants to make sure that
he's<00:00:26.880> not<00:00:27.000> missing<00:00:27.390> out<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.570> anything<00:00:28.410> with

he's not missing out on anything with

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.550 
he's not missing out on anything with

little is it's placed a little bit in
front<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.949> your<00:00:56.070> basic<00:00:56.370> support<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.940> look<00:00:57.059> at

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
front of your basic support just look at

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.360 
front of your basic support just look at
where<00:00:57.329> my<00:00:57.510> how<00:00:58.230> my<00:00:58.350> body<00:00:58.590> lines<00:00:58.859> up<00:00:59.100> where<00:00:59.280> my

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.660 

right<00:01:14.240> it's<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> first<00:01:15.600> thing<00:01:16.100> when<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> open

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
right it's the first thing when I open

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.510 
right it's the first thing when I open
up<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.030> this

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
up like this

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.880 
up like this
watch<00:01:20.520> watch<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.600> bends<00:01:21.960> specifically<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.770> my

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
watch watch the bends specifically in my

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.999 
watch watch the bends specifically in my
hips<00:01:23.689> and<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.990> my<00:01:25.110> ankles<00:01:25.470> knees<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.740> mean

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
hips and in my ankles knees I mean

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.300 
hips and in my ankles knees I mean
really<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.729> mostly<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.150> knees<00:01:27.979> my<00:01:28.979> center

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
really it's mostly the knees my center

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.539 
really it's mostly the knees my center
of<00:01:29.340> gravity<00:01:29.460> now<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.390> over<00:01:31.350> my<00:01:31.770> heels<00:01:32.159> as

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
of gravity now is over my heels as

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.670 
of gravity now is over my heels as
opposed<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.390> my<00:01:33.930> separate<00:01:34.259> cetera

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
opposed to here my separate cetera

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.020 
opposed to here my separate cetera
vacuum<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.070> more<00:01:35.250> like<00:01:35.400> over<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> middle<00:01:35.939> of

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
vacuum is more like over the middle of

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.590 
vacuum is more like over the middle of
my<00:01:36.150> foot<00:01:37.009> here<00:01:38.009> Sarah<00:01:38.759> Graham<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.119> back<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.479> my

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
my foot here Sarah Graham is back in my

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.840 
my foot here Sarah Graham is back in my
heels<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.680> sit<00:01:40.920> back<00:01:41.100> look<00:01:41.340> how<00:01:41.700> much

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
heels so I can sit back look how much

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.889 
heels so I can sit back look how much
warm<00:01:42.060> up<00:01:42.210> right<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.420> am<00:01:42.630> here<00:01:42.930> look<00:01:44.420> I'm<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.750> much

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
warm up right I am here look I'm so much

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.950 
warm up right I am here look I'm so much
more<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> what<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.700> means<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.210> you're<00:01:48.810> not

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
more so what that means is you're not

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.100 
more so what that means is you're not
using<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.590> much<00:01:49.890> core<00:01:50.850> when<00:01:51.630> your<00:01:51.780> center<00:01:52.049> of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
using as much core when your center of

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.539 
using as much core when your center of
gravity<00:01:52.170> goes<00:01:52.590> over<00:01:52.829> your<00:01:52.920> base<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.189> support

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
gravity goes over your base to support

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.690 
gravity goes over your base to support
this<00:01:54.210> part<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.750> your<00:01:54.840> body<00:01:55.110> has<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.579> cinch<00:01:56.579> down

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
this part of your body has to cinch down

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.270 
this part of your body has to cinch down
and<00:01:57.119> tighten<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.780> much<00:01:58.049> more<00:01:58.320> otherwise

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
and tighten up that much more otherwise

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.399 
and tighten up that much more otherwise
you<00:01:59.549> will<00:01:59.640> break<00:01:59.880> form<00:02:00.270> when<00:02:00.750> you're<00:02:00.899> here

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
you will break form when you're here

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.990 
you will break form when you're here
because<00:02:02.009> you're<00:02:02.340> upright

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
because you're upright

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.740 
because you're upright
not<00:02:03.180> as<00:02:03.330> much<00:02:03.570> stress<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.790> Weaver<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.510> lot

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
not as much stress the Weaver is a lot

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.969 
not as much stress the Weaver is a lot
sure<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.310> hope<00:02:08.700> right<00:02:08.940> boom<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.259> don't<00:02:10.860> have

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
sure so I hope right boom I don't have

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.490 
sure so I hope right boom I don't have
to<00:02:11.130> use<00:02:11.280> as<00:02:11.460> much<00:02:11.640> cord<00:02:12.180> as<00:02:12.720> much<00:02:12.930> abdominal

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
to use as much cord as much abdominal

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.170

out of the way you get that legs out of
the<00:03:04.560> way<00:03:04.709> by<00:03:04.890> opening<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.430> up<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:06.330> can

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
the way by opening it up and you can

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.229 
the way by opening it up and you can
still<00:03:07.049> if<00:03:07.440> you're<00:03:08.160> meticulous<00:03:08.880> about<00:03:08.970> how<00:03:09.180> you

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
still if you're meticulous about how you

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.000 
still if you're meticulous about how you
coach<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.690> athlete<00:03:10.049> or<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.530> include<00:03:10.830> yourself

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
coach the athlete or I include yourself

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.840 
coach the athlete or I include yourself
you<00:03:11.580> can<00:03:11.730> still<00:03:12.000> ask<00:03:12.209> them<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:13.280> bend<00:03:14.280> forward

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
you can still ask them to bend forward

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.940 
you can still ask them to bend forward
leave<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.480> on<00:03:15.510> boom<00:03:17.900> bend<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.019> knees<00:03:19.200> to

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
leave it on boom bend the knees to

leave it on boom bend the knees to
forward

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.160 

so<00:03:28.490> they're<00:03:28.640> doing<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.150> two<00:03:29.720> very<00:03:29.930> different

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
so they're doing to two very different

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.170 
so they're doing to two very different
things<00:03:30.350> that<00:03:30.740> this<00:03:30.860> is<00:03:30.920> more<00:03:31.220> of<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.430> squat<00:03:31.940> with
