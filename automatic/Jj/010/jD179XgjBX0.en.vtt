00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
all over it now when I'm using two

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.850 
all over it now when I'm using two
different<00:01:15.390> colors<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.810> ink<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> same

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
different colors of ink in the same

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.850 
different colors of ink in the same
color<00:01:17.100> family<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.900> generally<00:01:18.900> tend<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.830> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
color family I generally tend to like to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.039 
color family I generally tend to like to
use<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.400> lightest<00:01:20.729> color<00:01:20.909> first<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.509> then<00:01:21.750> go

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
use the lightest color first and then go

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.960 
use the lightest color first and then go
to<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.259> darkest<00:01:22.650> color<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.430> way<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
to the darkest color that way it's a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
to the darkest color that way it's a
little<00:01:24.180> bit<00:01:24.270> easier<00:01:24.530> if<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.650> don't<00:01:25.830> want<00:01:25.950> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
little bit easier if you don't want to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.190 
little bit easier if you don't want to
have<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.310> clean<00:01:26.490> right<00:01:27.090> away<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.509> between<00:01:27.930> is

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
have to clean right away in between is

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.870 
have to clean right away in between is
just<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.530> little<00:01:28.770> bit<00:01:28.860> better<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.220> use<00:01:29.369> lighter

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
just a little bit better to use lighter

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.300 
just a little bit better to use lighter
color<00:01:30.150> first<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:30.750> dark<00:01:30.930> color<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.890> here

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
color first and then dark color so here

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.469 
color first and then dark color so here
what<00:01:32.549> I'm<00:01:32.640> going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.180> I'm<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.420> to

just<00:02:32.380> going<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.910> go<00:02:33.910> ahead<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.480> overlap<00:02:35.790> like

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
just going to go ahead and overlap like

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
just going to go ahead and overlap like
so<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.670> now<00:02:39.820> your<00:02:40.030> image<00:02:40.270> is<00:02:40.510> going<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.690> look

just like this and from here if you want
to<00:02:45.790> make<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.090> line<00:02:46.300> just<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.690> little<00:02:46.989> bit<00:02:47.110> more

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
to make the line just a little bit more

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.620 
to make the line just a little bit more
defined<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:48.010> it's<00:02:48.160> easier<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.640> see<00:02:48.880> go<00:02:49.600> ahead

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
defined so it's easier to see go ahead
