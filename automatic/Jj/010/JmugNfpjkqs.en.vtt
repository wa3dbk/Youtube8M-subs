00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.810

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.550
 immortal rooney on her main chip 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.620
 fleeting battle where all the attention 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.210
 concentrated on bohivki send 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.859
 courier to the base here is not necessary 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.779
 it is allowed to be purchased right on 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.880
 advanced yes and apply skills in that 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.990
 you can often wait enough 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.390
 small cooldown 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.090
 and we are promised a 7 by 7 card for 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.550
 lovers of epic battles in the update 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.219
 fighting brotherhood online decks will appear 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.410
 between server battles and the first in the battle 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.510
 will enter the world twilight of the gods and the lord 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.820
 Astra is true at first developers 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.180
 plan to open only two witch cards 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.250
 yar 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.440
 and a wild farm but if everything goes according to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.690
 location plan will be more and fight 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.579
 let it be from all server representatives and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.350
 tests won't come soon 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.489
 dark below which will be the mission of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.530
 sword fighting 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.539
 similar episode console morning too 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.760
 appeared before and greatly liked 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.070
 the players so the pandas decided once again 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.989
 please all lovers of blades except 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.149
 in addition to the plot lines dil se we will see 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.949
 strike and more recently developers 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.720
 simplified this kind of activity so 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.260
 you can go it alone and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.510
 three 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.040
 Lost ark online will still be 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.170
 full mr pg 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.450
 they are analogous to diablo 3 will not do here 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.369
 no raids and big boss bosses 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.290
 groups of characters and even in locations you 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.600
 You will meet with other players and 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.360
 the main thing in lost ark online is expected pvp 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.340
 format 1 on 1 and 3 on 3 so this 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.770
 definitely not a diablo clone 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.960
 The authors decided that what cards to 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.820
 game paid somehow unfairly because 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.619
 this some can not meet 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.509
 each other because of the difference of versions 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.040
 therefore, new locations will be immediately 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.259
 put in free access 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.670
 But paid affairs still appear 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.829
 however, they are only waiting for us 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.810
 cosmetic items like images 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.000
 characters at the start in civilization 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.920
 online there will be only 4 nations but then 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.810
 developers will increase their number 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.890
 I wonder what's on the tests 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.140
 popular were 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.460
 Egyptians either because of the appearance of either 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.619
 for the love of building 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.750
 but it was easiest at first to live 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.060
 to the Aztecs because they decided to put them on 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.100
 individual continent well and move on to fly 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.810
 new news on kickstarter appeared 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.090
 unusual bloods device by 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.069
 it must cooperate with the gamepad and 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.880
 suck the blood out of a person when he 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.010
 getting hurt 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.990
 in the game itself is not all the blood behind this 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.940
 the pager will follow to release 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.040
 blood sport free authors 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.490
 don't plan on doing one yet 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.830
 sample 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.780
 and if they collect 250 thousand 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.600
 Canadian dollars appliance will be ready 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.920
 by the exit battlefield hardline 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.470
 Bohemia interactive posted on its 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.420
 site free version of mini taisy this 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.450
 two-dimensional analogue daisy where we too 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.470
 have to fight for survival 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.880
 post apocalyptic world true play 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.490
 in mini yes iz can only be alone 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.830
 multiplayer is not here but the creator of daisy 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.500
 Dean Hall has already recommended a novelty to everyone 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.900
 and each one is simply admired 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.210
 steam tightened rules for projects 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.340
 choosing an early access scheme now 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.840
 you can only upload normal builds 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.640
 games which development will be 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.860
 continue so technically and 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.540
 demos with the more will not fall yes and 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.130
 arrange paid testing 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.500
 prohibited for such purposes better 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.880
 giving away keys to fans what 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.720
 tackling valv can only 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.820
 greet 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.190
 raw projects in the service will definitely 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.410
 less well and on this news ran out 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.040
