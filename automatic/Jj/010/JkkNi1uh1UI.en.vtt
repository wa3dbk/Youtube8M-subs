 Samuel: When will you fail to make a mistake? 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:57.399
 Saul was disobedient to my command . 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.399

 He's really tall and he's not good at it. 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.670
 Samuel saw the appearance of medicines and saw that he was the king of God 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.939
 I thought it was. 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.049

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:05.320

 Do not judge people by appearance. 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.240
 Man corrects appearance 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.240

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.630

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.730
 So I sent and proved 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.730
 There is plenty of time 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:14.390
 I heard the voice of the dog God. 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:17.959
 This boy was chosen by me as the second king of Israel . 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:22.000
 He poured oil on David's head and prayed. 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.000
 Let him be king. 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:34.330
 Samuel anointed David with a blessing on his head. 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:40.840
 But David still does not know that he was chosen as king. 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:46.810
 This was the second king of Israel that was built at the time. 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:50.470
 David did not know that he was chosen because he was the second of Israel, 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:57.610
 I was staying with a shepherd in the van. 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:05:01.030
 On the other hand, King Saul, who was forsaken by God , became haunted by glasses. 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:05.949
 I had a bad head day without Yiwu . 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:11.370
 King Saul, who heard rumors that David was well on his way, 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:11.370
 I was asked to play the crown of the palace.
