00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810 

and<00:00:00.089> for<00:00:00.390> our<00:00:00.480> team<00:00:00.840> if<00:00:01.190> it's<00:00:02.190> only<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.520> first

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
and for our team if it's only the first

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.320 
and for our team if it's only the first
time<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.510> really<00:00:04.440> feel<00:00:05.400> about<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:06.000> building

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
time to really feel about the building

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.089 
time to really feel about the building
because<00:00:06.660> we<00:00:06.720> have<00:00:06.930> seen<00:00:07.140> some<00:00:07.410> pictures<00:00:07.589> even

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
because we have seen some pictures even

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.700 
because we have seen some pictures even
before<00:00:08.580> we<00:00:08.790> are<00:00:08.910> coming<00:00:09.300> but<00:00:09.480> that's<00:00:10.349> really

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
before we are coming but that's really

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.220 
before we are coming but that's really
the<00:00:10.800> first<00:00:10.980> time<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.969> really<00:00:12.269> experience<00:00:12.840> a

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
the first time to really experience a

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.400 
the first time to really experience a
different<00:00:14.059> different<00:00:15.059> part<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.260> building

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
different different part of the building

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.349 
different different part of the building
so<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.340> think<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:18.410> kind<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.910> policies<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.180> kind

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
so I think it's kind of policies it kind

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.000 
so I think it's kind of policies it kind
of<00:00:21.420> strike<00:00:21.869> quite<00:00:22.230> striking<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.359> and<00:00:24.890> what<00:00:25.890> we

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
of strike quite striking and and what we

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.390 
of strike quite striking and and what we
just<00:00:26.220> carry<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:28.260> give<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.010> some

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
just carry this and to give the some

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.659 
just carry this and to give the some
kind<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.880> intuitive<00:00:30.599> reaction<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.340> space

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
kind of intuitive reaction to this space

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.830 
kind of intuitive reaction to this space
and<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:35.370> take<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.790> kind<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.180> drive<00:00:36.480> for

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
and to to take this kind of drive for

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.690 
and to to take this kind of drive for
enough<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.770> some<00:00:37.950> ideas

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
enough to you have some ideas

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.900 
enough to you have some ideas
that's<00:00:39.090> quite<00:00:39.300> really<00:00:39.719> number<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:39.989> also

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
that's quite really number one also

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.270 
that's quite really number one also
quite<00:00:41.910> good<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.570> don't<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.280> really

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
quite good so we don't have to really

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.540 
quite good so we don't have to really
think<00:00:44.730> too<00:00:45.300> much<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:46.020> mean<00:00:46.620> about<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> details

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
think too much I mean about the details

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.959 
think too much I mean about the details
and<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.510> gather<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.260> whole<00:00:49.620> idea<00:00:50.070> from

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and we just gather the whole idea from

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.950 
and we just gather the whole idea from
well<00:00:51.750> as<00:00:52.039> outsider<00:00:53.039> actually<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.850> think<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
well as outsider actually I think the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.459 
well as outsider actually I think the
social<00:00:55.469> aspects<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.399> being<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.260> school

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
social aspects of being in a in a school

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.889 
social aspects of being in a in a school
and<00:00:58.620> working<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:59.039> many<00:00:59.309> people<00:00:59.670> is<00:01:00.449> sort<00:01:00.840> of

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and working with many people is sort of

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.179 
and working with many people is sort of
the<00:01:01.050> advantage<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:02.329> architecture<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:04.189> sort

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the advantage of architecture and sort

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.609 
the advantage of architecture and sort
of<00:01:05.250> teamwork<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.750> really<00:01:07.020> important

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
of teamwork so it's a really important

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.399 
of teamwork so it's a really important
issue<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.040> think<00:01:08.159> yeah<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> students<00:01:10.290> I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
issue I think yeah for the students I

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.190 
issue I think yeah for the students I
think<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.710> an<00:01:10.830> incredibly<00:01:11.600> good<00:01:12.600> training

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
think it's an incredibly good training

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.289 
think it's an incredibly good training
ground<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.680> actually<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.400> able<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.970> sort<00:01:15.210> of

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
ground to actually be able to sort of

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.300 
ground to actually be able to sort of
conceived<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.080> an<00:01:16.170> idea<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.740> kind<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.070> deal

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
conceived it of an idea and kind of deal

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.730 
conceived it of an idea and kind of deal
with<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.580> idea<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.810> actually<00:01:19.200> pursue

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
with that idea and then actually pursue

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.780 
with that idea and then actually pursue
it<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:19.979> communicator<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.390> very<00:01:21.600> defined

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
it and communicator in a very defined

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.249 
it and communicator in a very defined
process<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.030> very<00:01:24.060> defined<00:01:24.750> kind<00:01:25.140> of

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
process in a very defined kind of

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.800 
process in a very defined kind of
timeframe<00:01:25.560> which<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.580> think<00:01:27.030> sort<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.330> that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
timeframe which I I think sort of that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.260 
timeframe which I I think sort of that
layer<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.189> intensity<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.909> is

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
layer of intensity I think is is

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.020 
layer of intensity I think is is
something<00:01:30.780> which<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.170> really<00:01:31.500> engaging<00:01:32.030> so

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
something which is really engaging so

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.840 
something which is really engaging so
there's<00:01:33.180> really<00:01:33.360> nice<00:01:34.040> working<00:01:35.040> we've<00:01:35.670> got

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
there's really nice working we've got

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.300 
there's really nice working we've got
two<00:01:36.060> tutors<00:01:36.390> from<00:01:37.140> Glasgow<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.430> student

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
two tutors from Glasgow and one student

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.240 
two tutors from Glasgow and one student
I<00:01:39.340> think<00:01:39.610> that's<00:01:40.020> been<00:01:41.020> really<00:01:41.049> important<00:01:41.770> to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
I think that's been really important to

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.850 
I think that's been really important to
have<00:01:42.460> people<00:01:43.390> outside<00:01:43.869> our<00:01:44.079> room<00:01:44.290> commenting

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
have people outside our room commenting

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.359 
have people outside our room commenting
almost<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.990> most<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.590> most<00:01:47.710> progress<00:01:48.189> we've

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
almost the most the most progress we've

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.899 
almost the most the most progress we've
made<00:01:48.399> is<00:01:48.850> through<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.210> discussions<00:01:49.780> we<00:01:49.960> have

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
made is through the discussions we have

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.899 
made is through the discussions we have
across<00:01:51.909> these<00:01:52.810> two<00:01:53.020> different<00:01:53.350> schools

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
across these two different schools

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.450 
across these two different schools
because<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.689> know<00:01:55.810> basic<00:01:56.259> challenges<00:01:56.770> our

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
because you know basic challenges our

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.069 
because you know basic challenges our
preconceptions<00:01:59.490> makes<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:01.390> change<00:02:01.720> in<00:02:01.990> the

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
preconceptions makes the change in the

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.679 
preconceptions makes the change in the
scheme<00:02:02.350> happen<00:02:02.740> quicker<00:02:03.000> not<00:02:04.000> that<00:02:04.240> short<00:02:04.509> of

scheme happen quicker not that short of

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.999 
scheme happen quicker not that short of
time<00:02:04.750> but<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.860> meet<00:02:06.399> people<00:02:08.009> throughout

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
where they're they obviously don't know

they're building banks and they haven't
been<00:02:54.790> beaten<00:02:55.209> by<00:02:55.390> working<00:02:55.750> in<00:02:55.870> practice<00:02:56.410> so

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
been beaten by working in practice so

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.590 
been beaten by working in practice so
that<00:02:57.579> they<00:02:57.700> come<00:02:57.850> up<00:02:58.000> with<00:02:58.120> these<00:02:58.180> wild<00:02:58.480> ideas

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
that they come up with these wild ideas

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.240 
that they come up with these wild ideas
and<00:02:59.260> then<00:02:59.350> they<00:02:59.440> push<00:02:59.650> them<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.010> push<00:03:00.069> them

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
and then they push them and push them

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.819 
and then they push them and push them
and<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.790> have<00:03:00.880> to<00:03:00.910> do<00:03:01.209> something<00:03:01.420> actually

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
and you have to do something actually

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.170 
and you have to do something actually
okay<00:03:02.829> I<00:03:02.859> wouldn't<00:03:03.250> normally<00:03:03.430> do<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.850> but<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.150> is

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
okay I wouldn't normally do it but it is

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.360 
okay I wouldn't normally do it but it is
possible<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:05.019> it's<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.500> good<00:03:05.680> there<00:03:06.160> is<00:03:06.340> a

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
possible and it's a good there is a

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.230 
possible and it's a good there is a
reason<00:03:06.790> why

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
reason why

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.660 
reason why
doing<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:08.680> it's<00:03:08.830> forced<00:03:09.130> me<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.460> think

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
doing that so it's forced me to think

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.540 
doing that so it's forced me to think
again<00:03:10.030> about<00:03:10.440> pushing<00:03:11.440> me<00:03:11.500> against<00:03:11.770> never<00:03:12.370> you

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
again about pushing me against never you

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.960 
again about pushing me against never you
can<00:03:12.700> see<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:12.910> ideals<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:14.220> certainly<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.340> would

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
can see the ideals and certainly I would

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.120 
can see the ideals and certainly I would
hope<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.290> people<00:03:17.290> while<00:03:17.680> you're<00:03:17.770> working

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
hope that people while you're working

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
hope that people while you're working
with<00:03:18.280> those<00:03:18.730> sweeping<00:03:19.180> for<00:03:19.360> me<00:03:19.510> perhaps

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
with those sweeping for me perhaps

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.370 
with those sweeping for me perhaps
improve<00:03:22.150> their<00:03:22.390> skills<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:23.020> learn<00:03:23.230> different

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
improve their skills and learn different

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.640 
improve their skills and learn different
ways<00:03:23.710> of<00:03:23.920> thinking<00:03:24.040> about<00:03:24.250> things<00:03:28.320> is<00:03:29.320> unique

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
ways of thinking about things is unique

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.710 
ways of thinking about things is unique
because<00:03:30.520> it<00:03:30.880> doesn't<00:03:31.150> happen<00:03:31.240> every<00:03:31.540> day<00:03:31.570> that

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
because it doesn't happen every day that

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.780 
because it doesn't happen every day that
you<00:03:32.410> know<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.590> can<00:03:32.770> join<00:03:33.160> me<00:03:33.340> for<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.580> first

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
you know you can join me for the first

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.520 
you know you can join me for the first
quarter<00:03:34.000> different<00:03:34.360> team<00:03:34.540> could<00:03:35.200> be<00:03:35.230> involved

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
quarter different team could be involved

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.740 
quarter different team could be involved
in<00:03:35.710> the<00:03:35.770> kind<00:03:35.950> of<00:03:35.980> three<00:03:36.190> days<00:03:36.400> designs<00:03:36.880> you

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
in the kind of three days designs you

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.500 
in the kind of three days designs you
know<00:03:37.870> with<00:03:38.080> young<00:03:38.230> people<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:39.400> can't<00:03:40.210> do<00:03:40.360> it

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
know with young people you can't do it

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.230 
know with young people you can't do it
what<00:03:41.230> about<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.620> profession<00:03:42.130> box<00:03:42.340> Academical

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
what about the profession box Academical

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.560 
what about the profession box Academical
terms<00:03:43.480> it's<00:03:44.320> no<00:03:44.440> it's<00:03:45.310> rather<00:03:45.490> as<00:03:45.970> misogynist

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
terms it's no it's rather as misogynist

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.200 
terms it's no it's rather as misogynist
it's<00:03:49.570> strange<00:03:50.490> work<00:03:51.490> with<00:03:51.670> those<00:03:51.790> students

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
it's strange work with those students

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.820 
it's strange work with those students
because<00:03:52.720> everybody<00:03:53.050> comes<00:03:53.200> we<00:03:53.440> take<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.620> back

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
because everybody comes we take a back

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.490 
because everybody comes we take a back
road<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.310> I<00:03:55.270> think<00:03:55.840> we<00:03:55.960> all<00:03:56.050> have<00:03:56.200> different

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
road and I think we all have different

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.420 
road and I think we all have different
why's<00:03:56.590> it<00:03:56.740> working<00:03:58.620> it's<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.680> big<00:03:59.890> therapeutic

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
why's it working it's a big therapeutic

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.260 
why's it working it's a big therapeutic
process<00:04:00.670> so<00:04:01.210> we<00:04:01.330> just<00:04:01.570> have<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.810> jump<00:04:01.990> in<00:04:03.270> sort

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
process so we just have to jump in sort

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.150 
process so we just have to jump in sort
of<00:04:04.300> adopts<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:05.230> it's<00:04:06.060> it's<00:04:07.060> good<00:04:07.300> it<00:04:07.630> is<00:04:08.050> a

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
of adopts so it's it's good it is a

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160 
of adopts so it's it's good it is a
serious<00:04:09.160> learning<00:04:09.550> experience<00:04:10.060> I<00:04:10.150> think<00:04:10.300> it's

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
serious learning experience I think it's

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.110 
serious learning experience I think it's
kind<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.730> kind<00:04:12.730> of<00:04:14.040> nerve-wracking<00:04:15.120> yeah

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
kind of a kind of nerve-wracking yeah

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.960 
kind of a kind of nerve-wracking yeah
yeah<00:04:16.690> but<00:04:17.170> particularly<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:17.890> guys<00:04:18.730> from

yeah but particularly the the guys from
Illinois<00:04:19.299> who<00:04:19.540> don't<00:04:19.750> go<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:19.900> bed<00:04:20.170> until<00:04:20.230> 5:00
