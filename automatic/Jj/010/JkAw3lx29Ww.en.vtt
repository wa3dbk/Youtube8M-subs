00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
them don't because they're really

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.770 
them don't because they're really
expensive<00:05:18.789> currently<00:05:19.789> airplay<00:05:20.419> is<00:05:20.599> only

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
expensive currently airplay is only

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.480 
expensive currently airplay is only
available<00:05:20.990> through<00:05:21.349> Wi-Fi<00:05:22.010> because<00:05:22.220> of<00:05:22.430> the

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
available through Wi-Fi because of the

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.740 
available through Wi-Fi because of the
protocol<00:05:22.849> and<00:05:23.210> because<00:05:23.419> of<00:05:23.449> all<00:05:23.660> the

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
protocol and because of all the

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.629 
protocol and because of all the
streaming<00:05:24.169> that<00:05:24.289> it<00:05:24.410> has<00:05:24.500> to<00:05:24.620> do<00:05:24.770> so<00:05:25.009> it<00:05:25.340> seems

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
streaming that it has to do so it seems

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.520 
streaming that it has to do so it seems
that<00:05:25.759> Apple<00:05:26.240> is<00:05:26.300> planning<00:05:26.750> to<00:05:26.780> bring<00:05:27.110> this<00:05:27.289> to

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
that Apple is planning to bring this to

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.260 
that Apple is planning to bring this to
Bluetooth<00:05:28.039> which<00:05:28.310> is<00:05:28.460> much<00:05:28.699> cheaper<00:05:28.729> for

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
Bluetooth which is much cheaper for

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.390 
Bluetooth which is much cheaper for
everybody<00:05:29.720> though<00:05:29.930> sadly<00:05:30.260> it'll<00:05:31.039> only<00:05:31.220> work

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
everybody though sadly it'll only work

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.270 
everybody though sadly it'll only work
on<00:05:31.789> Bluetooth<00:05:32.240> 4.0<00:05:32.960> enabled<00:05:33.380> devices<00:05:33.650> that's

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
on Bluetooth 4.0 enabled devices that's

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.879 
on Bluetooth 4.0 enabled devices that's
the<00:05:34.520> catch<00:05:34.729> so<00:05:35.030> unless<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.110> have<00:05:36.139> an<00:05:36.500> iPhone

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
the catch so unless you have an iPhone

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.460
