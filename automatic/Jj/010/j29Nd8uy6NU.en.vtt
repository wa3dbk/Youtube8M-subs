00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
different so i'm not thinking too much

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.520 
different so i'm not thinking too much
of<00:00:20.850> an<00:00:20.940> advantage<00:00:21.030> here<00:00:21.420> i<00:00:21.600> was<00:00:22.200> looking<00:00:22.320> over

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
of an advantage here i was looking over

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.020 
of an advantage here i was looking over
the<00:00:22.680> track<00:00:22.920> map<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.370> lot<00:00:23.610> of<00:00:23.730> technical

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.030 
the track map a lot of technical

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.450 
the track map a lot of technical
sections<00:00:24.690> a<00:00:24.840> lot<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.110> step<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.560> step<00:00:25.890> off<00:00:26.160> and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
sections a lot of step on step off and

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.830 
sections a lot of step on step off and
the<00:00:26.760> tracks<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.120> to<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> little<00:00:27.450> bit<00:00:27.540> soft

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
the tracks going to be a little bit soft

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.840 
the tracks going to be a little bit soft
tonight<00:00:28.170> yeah<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.770> wanted<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.490> put<00:00:29.610> a<00:00:29.670> lot<00:00:29.820> of

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
tonight yeah I wanted to put a lot of

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.100 
tonight yeah I wanted to put a lot of
rhythms<00:00:30.120> in<00:00:30.270> so<00:00:30.510> there<00:00:30.660> could<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.780> different

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
rhythms in so there could be different

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.260 
rhythms in so there could be different
options<00:00:31.590> for<00:00:31.680> passing<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.000> my<00:00:33.120> idea

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
options for passing and that was my idea

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.509 
options for passing and that was my idea
it<00:00:34.230> looks<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.769> really<00:00:34.949> ready<00:00:35.190> so

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
it looks like it to be really ready so

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.009 
it looks like it to be really ready so
some<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.699> the<00:00:35.820> triples<00:00:36.179> are<00:00:36.449> probably<00:00:36.839> it's

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
some of the triples are probably it's

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.290 
some of the triples are probably it's
going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.199> be<00:00:37.260> doubles<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> rhythm<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.399> we

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
going to be doubles and the rhythm so we

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.389 
going to be doubles and the rhythm so we
never<00:00:39.449> know<00:00:39.600> till<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:39.839> get<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.050> there<00:00:40.399> what

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
never know till we get out there what

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
did outdoor testing and I wrote a little

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.630 
did outdoor testing and I wrote a little
bit<00:00:54.600> before<00:00:54.749> Minneapolis<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.589> just<00:00:56.399> wasn't
