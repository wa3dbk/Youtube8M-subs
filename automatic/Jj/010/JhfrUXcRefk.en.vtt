 Vinkeveen are complete according to the PVD and the PVV leader Geert Wilders has 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:31.050
 get it right but the prices rise when sitting in a big difference 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.940
 between yes after the beaten with 3 0 yes it was me that I had fallen short 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.560
 all in all 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.860
 by riding red between the rider or moderate who sets himself up for life 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.479
 people who currently have a subscription m 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.169
 people are already working on it so it's a remote pick up but none of it 

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:50.009
 both of them only have themselves modern and danced a mystery themselves 

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:53.009
 there is, however, no reason to prosecute him 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.090
 more than ten years already got a soil in the forest also made it mandatory because there 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.830
 to buy a car while it is actually all that the 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.340
 cable connection on 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.129
 and then you actually had a back yard and had it with gigabit cnn 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.210
 and also a built-in telephony functionality but do it 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.600
 Use with an incident or not that they actually owned a complete product 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.560
 yes we were quite skeptical when other sources 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.710
 because even to yourself suppliers who have long been the complete 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.359
 modem routers in their range if you have one 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.039
 on a number of close but mostly they are very limited in functions 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.640
 we can continue this week 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.909
 that strikes me tv brussels media actually are already seeing what you think of a base 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.080
 expects that it is also very nice that young can switch between two 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.380
 four and five artists yes he is 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.600
 goal 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.880
 yes and is it actually all all functions in that of an abandoned waited 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.220
 is of course super extensive march rijswijk anp ruined do this before 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.420
 can keep a little eye on what quite a few are set up and chalets in themselves 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.770
 to take 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.740
 are a five-person 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.869
 by both sides on two choirs 4 and 5 years old the one shame is you 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.790
 it cannot do at the same time with not what they call simon peres by 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.510
 gangs 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.960
 you have to make a choice for one or the other we still don't have any 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.520
 Statically an hour 5:30 is a lot faster than developing 4 but if you do 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.750
 device at home you do not have to 5 4 to be able to communicate with this 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.480
 Device actually stuck in Victoria Jacott and I can always still 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.040
 myself a wooden role of the government for example 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.489
 places and then your network will increase again yes 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.549
 the substance is not the only fault that could be caused by the delivery of the vans 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.129
 parties can choose or is it just a laugh and you just get there 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.319
 sent home and then I can participate yes 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.889
 but in the direction of everything choose the wndr4000 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:35.779
 so bis top model anyway yes it is the most high end models are something 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:39.519
 here fell 50 included move throughput support m 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.779
 you have to position a little bit opposite the 42 is from the left 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:44.699
 for example yes it is one 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:48.959
 a very elaborate model and if you face the left the plysje is more 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:53.969
 in terms of price and the internet this immediately put a lot cheaper yes even if 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.129
 a routine 20 euro requests are for this and yes if you then look at the 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.790
 transfer speeds then they just have it 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.330
 very very quickly to a grade of five voters this will be the fastest we ever had 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.989
 have tested the 116 meters the press comes on tv via truss 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.939
 that is really fast 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.019
 in that respect there seems to have been a revolution in the last two years 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.489
 World of Balls Mistakes Have Happened at those speeds that make sense a steep rise 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.679
 Yes 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.919
 that also makes it no more interesting under heavy applications 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.480
 doing opera faust is still a disadvantage 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.230
 Not sinke is reliable and one can always be circumstances in which 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.170
 aalbers strike yes if you really pay and then you still just have to bare 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.260
 draw between two computers yes but yes so you can really seriously wireless 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.610
 networks nowadays and for the third time call this stand alone chime.in you 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.180
 she meant and so you can get the pen and two packages at the same time 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.449
 competition work 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.080
 and then you even get network 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.410
 they will be five years the band is much less polluted by other things like 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.230
 baby monitor are security cameras this morning devices that can hold up to 15 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.770
 years of quick use for the computers that has the highest speed 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:54.809
 need 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:58.389
 the two were able to leave four seating networks for the other to high streets 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.709
 They make it important that you have a good and wireless adapter in need 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.029
 The bookers' seats are in the rest, which eventually became 5 4 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:06.349
 new year and

 he also did and put together 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.709
 and that, as far as I'm concerned, the most special of the bunch 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.010
 This international by author on this is a complete larger and by far the 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.509
 smallest the original yes and the stepping into the funny is that too 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.430
 once again it does not b and feeling for the chair is still on 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.059
 starting the wk and therefore just wise is legs and nutrients and press manager 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.660

 need for your laptop 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.800
 or or four more tablets if you no longer have a connection, yes and that is 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.420

 Klostergaard don't want to set up the two gates through and border 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.020
 the lan port 700 employees

 except that 105 km variant notary exact and just standard ecommerce divers 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.080
 yet about forty employees were not too bad 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.550
 And what you say is actually when you have to be a couple you have before you 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.169
 a tablet that showed 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.889
 Wired networking connection has a very good if you only have one 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:33.970
 cable I have not been able to do anything 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.540

 You can also use the internet on yes and that is also very funny that you are that you 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.310
