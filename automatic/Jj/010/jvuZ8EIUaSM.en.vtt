00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.949
 more people today in story again 

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:07.190
 video and 2wd already read and my story 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.750
 Monster House and I found it now 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.330
 actually already visitors of 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.860
 the one who wrote that and 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.980
 Let's start right now 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.950
 So I've got my first 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.870
 I mean somehow yes okay 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.200
 somehow I need something with him 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.610
 I can then play yes yes 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.350
 We will take one off one shelf 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.920
 make room for the strong and so on 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:34.989
 Continue and keep it the most dreamlike 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.510
 until then agreed to an internat 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.190
 Now I stopped and 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.470
 I thought about doing it in bed 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:48.320
 can and so on first , I have 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.600
 simply turned the scarf to where I 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.430
 fabric has overlapped and 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.040
 instead of laying on the ground 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.070
 other bed to get the double bed 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.020
 That's what I did when I failed 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.329
 do not play or something in the art halt 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.459
 I do not remember what it was on everyone 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:09.679
 case of a board game of the carton 

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:11.179
 blanket had only begun to stop 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:15.350
 put said so my puppies 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:17.509
 finished ridiculous to what I did 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.689
 previously I had had before I my 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:26.479
 have broken down house then I 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.950
 So my started a meeting what I am 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.549
 no longer need to cut open 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.319
 the movie look and then have the the 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.240
 cover of the playing card grad 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.409
 has entered the filling of the inserted 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.200
 so it's a bit softer 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.200
 as well as the valley better said 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:48.529
 then I have a small cardboard box 

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:50.719
 taken as the little box then have 

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:53.179
 in between clustered rhine tipped off per 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.880
 Product said so my closet and 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.859
 has just asked my grandma about it 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.810
 to harbor a few coins and a few jackets 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.679
 and jeans had made it to me 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.679
 then everything went in there 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.830
 so I knew more where to go 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.390
 stop the three had their room and the 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.519
 other not living room more and more 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.250
 and somehow I have to think it over 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.120
 you surely know these 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.680
 regulatory systems compulsory desk 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.989
 these drawers about such three 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.519
 are on top of each other and so what did I have 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.840
 only from cardboard I have two 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.519
 Drawer out done 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.560
 So there were two drawers on the shelf 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.130
 done out a little bit every day 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.380
 There I have space out of styrofoam 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.790
 you made a crowd 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.040
 have set even smaller hook 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.970
 tinkered and bags 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.519
 then hung there and then takes 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.380
 these two regulatory systems the 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.400
 between falling drawers did frizzy 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.720
 it looked empty and there 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.549
 I then just have then still hold 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.160
 times four monsters had balding and 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.440
 that was then her bed as said 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.650
 pretty ridiculous and if I have 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.069
 At the back I think that my god 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.980
 Of course I can do a lot for myself today 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.579
 better 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.190
 yes, all of the time I stop it 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.829
 youtube does not look for high beds 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.400
 could somehow do and then has 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:21.190
 just synonymous found a video and I have 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.440
 then stop and do the same 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.120
 then I had a dresser 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.940
 I had then two high beds 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.350
 reingetan so if there is a technical and 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.720
 that was just like that again 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.480
 said a room 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.260
 yes, and now they are mine 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.400
 The first few monsters are called the rooms and 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.709
 I can not go on any further 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.620
 recall 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:51.040
 when you see my house ringing 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.220
 look at their youngest where there is one more 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.700
 bit looks like house and still 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.940
 pretty much at the beginning you always know 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.090
 Scroll down to the bottom and see 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.889
 you really like it was then 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.970
 could have looked with the 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.979
 latest monster house update video times 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.860
 to compare 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:17.140
 and there is a lot going on 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.950
 from a year so I am myself 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.650

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.720
 tinkering and it is really great 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.600
 I've also looked at it now 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.930
 that latter eldest mass out 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:37.300
 update video and it's really great how 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:39.690
 you changed everything and on 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.420
 at first it just seems totally 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:46.030
 Now be for the latest video 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.900

 somehow something somehow tell 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.460
 story does not matter if the monster is high 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.230
