considering<00:03:05.100> how<00:03:05.580> much<00:03:05.760> battery<00:03:06.650> life<00:03:07.650> it

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
considering how much battery life it

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.490 
considering how much battery life it
supports<00:03:08.580> 12,000<00:03:09.270> milliamps<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:10.110> actually

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
supports 12,000 milliamps is actually

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.260 
supports 12,000 milliamps is actually
quite<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.800> lot<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:13.350> know<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.500> typical

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
quite a lot you know a typical

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.540 
quite a lot you know a typical
smartphone<00:03:15.410> takes<00:03:16.410> up<00:03:16.620> about<00:03:16.890> eighteen

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
smartphone takes up about eighteen

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.970 
smartphone takes up about eighteen
hundred<00:03:18.000> milliamps<00:03:19.070> so<00:03:21.290> again<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.860> know

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
hundred milliamps so again you know

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.300 
hundred milliamps so again you know
pretty<00:03:23.760> pretty<00:03:24.060> good<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.360> battery<00:03:25.350> life<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.739> I

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
pretty pretty good a battery life and I

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.220 
pretty pretty good a battery life and I
believe<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.820> could<00:03:27.180> also<00:03:27.390> charge<00:03:27.780> maybe<00:03:28.050> an

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
believe it could also charge maybe an

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.050 
believe it could also charge maybe an
iPad<00:03:28.590> probably<00:03:29.340> about<00:03:29.430> one<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.850> half<00:03:29.880> times

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
iPad probably about one and a half times

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.570 
iPad probably about one and a half times
maybe<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.870> little<00:03:31.019> bit<00:03:31.200> more<00:03:31.410> than<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:31.950> so

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
maybe a little bit more than that so so

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.940 
maybe a little bit more than that so so
pretty<00:03:32.760> pretty<00:03:33.030> pretty<00:03:33.810> powerful<00:03:34.140> battery

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
pretty pretty pretty powerful battery

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.910 
pretty pretty pretty powerful battery

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
power motion 12,000 and take a look at

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.940 
power motion 12,000 and take a look at
the<00:03:47.220> side<00:03:49.400> no<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:50.640> it's<00:03:50.880> uh<00:03:51.120> it's<00:03:51.660> about<00:03:51.950> twice

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
the side no so it's uh it's about twice

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.310 
the side no so it's uh it's about twice
the<00:03:52.980> size<00:03:53.280> of<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.970> smartphone<00:03:54.480> as<00:03:54.780> far<00:03:54.989> as<00:03:55.110> the

the size of a smartphone as far as the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.320 
the size of a smartphone as far as the
the<00:03:55.590> depth<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:57.600> in<00:03:58.440> depth<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.950> it

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.690 

here's<00:04:03.330> here's<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.080> socket<00:04:04.440> itself<00:04:04.769> as<00:04:05.010> two<00:04:05.250> USB

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
here's here's a socket itself as two USB
