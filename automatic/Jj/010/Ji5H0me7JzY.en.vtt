00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 the top car tv plus a boxing for you 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.750
 and this is boxing a video card 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:16.680
 nice to meet safai a radeon 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:19.529
 hd 77 70 with a gaga chip of r 5 is a 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.590
 personal work see through old chan net 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.400
 what's nice nice to add from the box 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.260
 that you have here in the box or if it has a 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.700
 or in the case of it is 28 nanometers or 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.090
 be 1 smaller newer architecture makes 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.649
 components are closer than 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.980
 suggests it will eventually generate more 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.350
 heat then that goes out there that sees 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.969
 It's the technology of our band for you. 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.030
 breathing is a memory vapor camera 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.530
 ddr5 is much faster and 13 already speaks in 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.390
 videos prior to our search 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.899
 channel talking about other boards 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.920
 explains the difference from r 3 to r 5 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.159
 mdf 2.0 can be extended up to three 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.860
 monitors and if you use outlet drink 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.600
 displayport of her with robot as the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.640
 italy adapter more you can 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.100
 extend up to four 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.520
 monitors at the same time this can stop 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.700
 with ample evidence and express 3.0 that 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.810
 more than make decisions and clear academy 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.770
 with 3d and fame open this girl there 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.770
 people talk about more details 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:38.270
 that's the saddest part of our 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.420
 anxiety video of withdrawing from the box 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:47.200
 There's really plenty of media box out there. 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:50.630
 and is a part of satisfaction is a part 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.460
 search for knowledge and made it so 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.850
 excited about both the video of a boxing 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.950
 huh 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:02.840
 let's always install adapter 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.950
 seeing green for a new installation 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.380
 huh 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:14.140
 with the release of the cd clothes and a 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.160
 six- pin adapter for those who do not have 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.460
 in the source 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.620
 but to run this here or on the website 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.580
 of their band they say something around 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.670
 300 to 400 makes the standard for who usually 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:34.060
 500 watt tel even though it is already 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:37.040
 It's good to go out with energy then 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.100
 enough about it's there became our 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.300
 ex-agent had opened a law for ex 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.600
 top 79 90 if I'm not mistaken but here it is 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:56.570
 I myself comes from technology that is the 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:59.630
 heat chamber can take this face is 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.940
 Well cool is a very extensive fan contest is 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.800
 very extensive then that the king for ex 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.950
 is that it's a steam camera that stays 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.900
 next to the core is more or less 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.480
 here and you 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.760
 besides the steam core that honor is 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.650
 one is a very narrow camera that 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.330
 put under the sinks do not know 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.410
 can you see around? 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:24.250
 is this kind of a liquid evaporating 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:29.150
 it speeds up the heat exchange process 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.970
 between the plate of the core and the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.340
 aluminum blades and to complete them 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.250
 still added the parents of snake 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.370
 here between the camera and the 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.960
 blades that make the heat come 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.690
 out here so you have a 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.970
 a heat transfer dissipation 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.240
 the faster you both here central with 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.550
 the camera on porches and with the parents 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.620
 that play out so the fans can 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.090
 do their job 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.830
 After I was talking, this is 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.090
 speaking that it was a smaller processor with 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.010
 an architecture of 28 nanometers and as 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.020
 is a smaller architecture will end 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.740
 generating more heat and they will compensate 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:13.700
 this course is great the dose in 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:17.150
 'next here is the displayport output 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.830
 you can use with ram or when the 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.200
 table to put academy displayport 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:25.280
 is one to a standard you usually see 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.010
 macbook pro macbook pro out there that is 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.780
 a pattern of another high definition or 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.460
 be above me 80,080 of the 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.340
 more modern displays the default here 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.420
 Brazilian for now we are in HD 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.260
 1080p 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:45.110
 the two duties that have most to show 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.290
 the 6-pin input a standard input 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.480
 majority of the 500 four 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:58.670
 high-end sports already comes with this 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:05:01.970
 Connector and then there's 77 seventy it there 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.580
 Staff this was the fault radeon hd 77 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:08.180
 seventy see for exchange garrett edition 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.850
 which made overclocking one thing that I 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.120
 I said that it is interesting to lose control 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.640
 amd catalyst is very interesting to 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.910
 you take a look at both the state of the board 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.630
 how much do not make some adjustments 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:27.470
 this is a board with an investment in 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:30.440
 house from 450 to 500 reais 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.500
 we have her in history also a 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.020
 her next competitor was gtx 550 ti 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.150
 and we tested it earlier 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.470
 despite its old rate generation 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.210
 of this 650 new generation of the 16 that is the 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.409
 what are we going to show today in boxing? 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.719
 near and 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:50.539
 You saw them watching the new video. 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:52.969
 products and we will put a grid 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.219
 of the other for running test of 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:58.789
 performance to see how it works out 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:06:02.119
 investment difference compared to 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:04.879
 the difference in beauty performance 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:06.800
 if you like click like I was 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:08.629
 We want to sign up for the channel. 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.259
 will make more videos more tests now 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:14.629
 in the samuca of the samuca plays 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:16.309
 he always comes here he does the tests and 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:17.539
 the actor's son . 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:20.239
 another game that we got 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:23.019
 fit the agenda and that 's it guys 

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:23.019
 thank you
