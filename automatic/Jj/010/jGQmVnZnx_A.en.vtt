a lot of people he said again but Adan

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.220 
a lot of people he said again but Adan
has<00:02:10.630> I<00:02:11.530> think<00:02:12.390> eight<00:02:13.390> starts<00:02:14.049> last<00:02:14.950> season<00:02:15.549> and

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
has I think eight starts last season and

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.050 
has I think eight starts last season and
14<00:02:18.450> substitution<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.260> he<00:02:20.709> didn't<00:02:21.280> had<00:02:21.519> any

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
14 substitution so he didn't had any

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.000 
14 substitution so he didn't had any
chances<00:02:22.930> it's<00:02:23.319> not<00:02:23.530> true

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
chances it's not true

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.650 
chances it's not true
in<00:02:24.250> my<00:02:25.090> opinion<00:02:25.709> but<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:27.150> want<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.299> stipulate

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
in my opinion but I want to stipulate

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.360 
in my opinion but I want to stipulate
that<00:02:29.639> because<00:02:30.639> a<00:02:30.670> lot<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.000> people<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:32.200> not<00:02:32.560> a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
that because a lot of people is not a

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.860 
that because a lot of people is not a
good<00:02:34.090> argument<00:02:38.579> he<00:02:39.579> was<00:02:39.819> one<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.630> best

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
good argument he was one of the best

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.449 
good argument he was one of the best
players<00:02:41.200> last<00:02:41.560> season<00:02:43.319> he<00:02:44.319> was<00:02:44.530> almost<00:02:44.980> League

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
players last season he was almost League

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.879 
players last season he was almost League
best<00:02:45.670> outfield<00:02:46.450> play<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.049> season<00:02:47.410> before<00:02:47.530> you

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
best outfield play the season before you

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.420 
best outfield play the season before you
came<00:02:48.359> so<00:02:49.359> we<00:02:49.959> can<00:02:50.440> be<00:02:50.560> reasonable<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.340> expect

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
came so we can be reasonable to expect

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.550 
came so we can be reasonable to expect
that<00:02:51.940> he<00:02:52.090> would<00:02:52.329> stop<00:02:52.930> all<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.260> way<00:02:53.290> 8k<00:02:53.980> why

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
that he would stop all the way 8k why

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.520 
that he would stop all the way 8k why
was<00:02:56.560> he<00:02:56.829> was<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.010> best<00:02:57.220> player<00:02:57.400> yeah<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.660> and

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
was he was the best player yeah and and
