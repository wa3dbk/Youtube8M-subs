00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.690
 all the pluses and minuses of work in a pair 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.120
 and as an example I will show how we do 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.009
 half a percent of us win with Dimka vl1 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.170
 first I want to warn you that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.270
 working in pairs will help you raise the bar 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.609
 qualities that says that you have 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.560
 there will be a greater chance to get on the channel 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.560
 wot-fan'e already work with serious 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.330
 sponsored together 1 plus work in pair this 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.220
 exchange of experience because always 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.710
 some other person might know 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.180
 something you do not know and if you are with 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.309
 someone will create 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.290
 shared videos top really this you 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.940
 will help to learn something new and you 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.290
 be able to share with your partner 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.790
 something new 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.040
 but of course if you still find out 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.870
 something new this will open for you 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.300
 a bunch of new doors you can do 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.219
 what you haven't done before but 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.469
 the more will rise very much to you 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.120
 other people's interest is also very 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.039
 useful because you will have more 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.109
 followers and more interesting 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.359
 dating second plus is work in 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.890
 team if you can find a good one 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.750
 mate then you will always have 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.460
 get better mood when you 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.470
 will be engaged with the rollers especially with 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.840
 the highest voice will and write a couple then 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.580
 your conversation will be more cheerful that you have 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.530
 will cheer and you will 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.689
 cheer but in general it is you 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.790
 will help in life because you learn 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.460
 work in a team without it nowhere 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.290
 3 plus is an exchange of audiences and it is 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.390
 really useful plus after all it 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.759
 will bring as you subscribers because 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.829
 followers of your partner even if 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.869
 you never worked together nobody 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.299
 never expected it entail yet 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.400
 more interest in your channel and always 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.530
 your buddy or your followers 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.740
 subscribers can come to his channel 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.420
 or on your channel is a plus for both to 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.549
 Fortunately, only one minus and tons 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.290
 applies only to those who record the voice 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.630
 for a couple like me for example doing in 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.579
 half a percent to win and minus this in 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.930
 that it's hard to decide when it says 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.369
 someone is something definite 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.079
 and most often of course better 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.240
 prepare any script with 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.620
 timings so that everyone understands when 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.720
 his 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.150
 start talking and this already takes a very 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.550
 a lot of time and on 1 improvisation not 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.620
 always get to go and supplement 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.510
 This minus is that time is not always 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.160
 maybe you have a job or y 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.320
 your partner for example someone 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.300
 got the idea someone ready to do a 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.430
 someone else is busy or not at all 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.140
 at the computer and this of course is sad then 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.630
 there is to some extent you depend friend 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.240
 from a friend so if you want to go more 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.280
 easy way, then you probably all 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.230
 still have to distribute power and someone 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.120
 one will mount and someone else 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.430
 will deal with the voice but it is already 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.840
 completely different plan videos and such 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.670
 meet where more often 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.410
 but if you want to write a voice for a couple 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.150
 then still you will have to some 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.280
 degrees depend on each other 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.440
 all about writing lyrics and every 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.510
 make it separate simply and then already 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.090
 someone alone will be this all but 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.220
 this is a completely different knock and I personally 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.560
 don't do either as i said before 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.750
 just wait for your partner and works 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.890
 either on improvisation or somehow there 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.690
 arrange timings 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.670
 and at some certain point will 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.830
 already talk one of you of course for 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.959
 I would advise you to start copying 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.060
 that here is someone one is making voices already 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.610
 someone else makes a video so be it 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.380
 easier for you and your partner but if 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.270
 you want to go more difficult and 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.280
 do more lively videos then you 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.050
 will have to choose the second option and write 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.270
 to voice for a couple which of course is 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.130
 more complicated but still it looks 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.650
 more cheerful and more interesting 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.480
 even though it seems to you that this is all 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.489
 difficult indeed all these difficulties 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.709
 this is worth the first opportunity 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.870
 get on wot-fan it really 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.670
 good opportunity and worth it 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.709
 to strain find some 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.959
 partner collaboration and 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.060
 secondly new features and new 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.250
 love is always good is 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.110
 improves mood and overall morale 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.360
 Well, at the end of the video, I briefly tell you 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.760
 I will explain how work is going on 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.190
 half a percent win first 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.980
 A replay is selected from a pile of those who 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.800
 we are sent shoulder choose how I do 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.930
 and lvl 1 after the replay found 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.870
 unanimously selected this replay i 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.880
 I write down and finally shoulder mounted 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.550
 mounts so that everything starts with 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.530
 free cams and all sorts of dull boring 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.630
 moments when the tank drives for a long time or 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.940
 recharged or something else were all 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.680
 accelerated two times or even 3 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.260
 that in the end they give us hearty and not 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.900
 prolonged video series and then go to 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.269
 skype already ready video we throw in 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.880
 video editor in which after that 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.310
 write over this movie at least 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.350
 15 10 second intro 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.870
 and then after all the clues from 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.090
 improvisation don't record such a voice 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.460
 so as not to interrupt each other and was 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.590
 everything is interesting and vigorous after which 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.530
 me, my partner throws off his path 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.810
 and I'm already setting up everything there, I'm mounting everything 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.240
 and the result is a full fit 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.550
 joint video on this and actually 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.080
