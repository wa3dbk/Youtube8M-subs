constantly keeping your eyes down the
field<00:01:10.229> who<00:01:10.740> work<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.100> play<00:01:11.310> action<00:01:11.549> which

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
field who work a play action which

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.330 
field who work a play action which
simulates<00:01:12.570> both<00:01:12.930> ball<00:01:13.229> fakes<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.799> hand<00:01:14.040> fakes

I<00:01:14.549> think<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.880> pretty<00:01:15.090> important<00:01:15.630> in

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
I think this is pretty important in

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.270 
I think this is pretty important in

action<00:01:21.299> doesn't<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:21.960> your<00:01:22.020> ball<00:01:22.229> fake

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
action doesn't have to be your ball fake

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.620 
action doesn't have to be your ball fake
does<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> hand<00:01:23.670> fake<00:01:23.909> that's<00:01:24.360> what

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
does it to be a hand fake that's what

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.510 
does it to be a hand fake that's what
they<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:24.869> best<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.500> continue<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.979> wrap<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.400> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
they do best and continue to wrap it and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.819 
they do best and continue to wrap it and
then<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.150> also<00:01:27.299> will<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> flip<00:01:28.170> featural

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
then you also will do a flip featural

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.469 
then you also will do a flip featural
which<00:01:29.310> helps<00:01:29.610> quarterbacks<00:01:30.000> keep<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.329> ball

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
which helps quarterbacks keep the ball

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.660 
which helps quarterbacks keep the ball
