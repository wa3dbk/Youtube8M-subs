broken in not even close

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.520 
broken in not even close
that's<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.060> hard<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:27.360> I'm<00:01:27.479> squeezing<00:01:30.500> what<00:01:31.500> I

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that's as hard as I'm squeezing what I

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.969 
that's as hard as I'm squeezing what I
did<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:32.040> was<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.700> tightened<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> wrist<00:01:33.720> strap

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
did do was I tightened the wrist strap

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.480 
did do was I tightened the wrist strap
right<00:01:34.979> there

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
right there

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.810 
right there
I<00:01:35.810> like<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> tighter<00:01:37.200> fit<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.310> Pedroia

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
I like the tighter fit but the Pedroia

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.999 
I like the tighter fit but the Pedroia
fits<00:01:39.150> too<00:01:39.659> tight<00:01:43.490> there<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.380> um<00:01:46.380> this

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
fits too tight there it is but um this

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.210 
fits too tight there it is but um this
glove<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.399> probably<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:49.350> best<00:01:49.619> leather<00:01:49.860> I've

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
glove is probably the best leather I've

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.109 
glove is probably the best leather I've
ever<00:01:50.520> had<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> glove<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:54.030> me<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.450> think

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
ever had on a glove it to me I think

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.429 
ever had on a glove it to me I think
it's<00:01:57.119> better<00:01:57.360> than<00:01:57.570> some<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> stockade<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
it's better than some of the stockade to

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.120 
it's better than some of the stockade to
Kayla<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.070> I've<00:01:59.219> had<00:01:59.430> but<00:02:00.740> it's<00:02:01.740> definitely

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
Kayla that I've had but it's definitely

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.190 
Kayla that I've had but it's definitely
not<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.280> mm<00:02:03.000> leather<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.270> think<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> quality<00:02:04.170> is

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
not a mm leather I think the quality is

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.100 
not a mm leather I think the quality is
too<00:02:04.409> good<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.119> think<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.750> 2k

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
too good for that so I think it is a 2k

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.990 
too good for that so I think it is a 2k
leather<00:02:07.489> that's<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.789> my<00:02:08.940> opinion

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
leather that's just my opinion

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.130 
leather that's just my opinion
and<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.840> way<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.080> feels<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.380> me<00:02:14.020> it's<00:02:15.020> an

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
and to the way it feels to me it's an

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.790 
and to the way it feels to me it's an
awesome<00:02:15.290> glove<00:02:15.710> though<00:02:16.190> I<00:02:16.870> got<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.960> 1787

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
awesome glove though I got the 1787

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
awesome glove though I got the 1787
because<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.430> do<00:02:19.490> like<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.880> little<00:02:20.270> more<00:02:20.420> length
