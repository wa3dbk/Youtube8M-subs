get<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:48.000> 12<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:48.930> hoping<00:01:49.470> for

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
get that with 12 and I'm hoping for

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.730 
get that with 12 and I'm hoping for
angel<00:01:50.070> 13<00:01:50.850> at<00:01:51.000> least<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.600> changes<00:01:52.439> back

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
angel 13 at least that that changes back

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.370 
angel 13 at least that that changes back
to<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.340> way<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.549> used<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.119> um<00:01:55.640> just<00:01:57.049> it<00:01:58.049> just

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
to the way it used to be um just it just

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.870 
to the way it used to be um just it just
it<00:01:58.590> doesn't<00:01:58.799> feel<00:01:59.070> as<00:01:59.219> smooth<00:01:59.490> as<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.729> would

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it doesn't feel as smooth as I would

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.609 
it doesn't feel as smooth as I would
like<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.329> um<00:02:00.509> there's<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.530> many

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
like it to be um there's just so many

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.630 
like it to be um there's just so many
different<00:02:01.710> things<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:02.159> do<00:02:02.250> here's<00:02:02.460> me

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
different things you can do here's me

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.980 
different things you can do here's me
just<00:02:02.909> like<00:02:03.060> dive<00:02:03.240> into<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.600> boards<00:02:03.810> with<00:02:03.960> a

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
just like dive into the boards with a

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.359 
just like dive into the boards with a
stick<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.560> little<00:02:04.799> bit<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.100> difference

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
stick just that little bit of difference

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.160 
stick just that little bit of difference
just<00:02:06.090> adds<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.390> little<00:02:06.479> bit<00:02:06.600> more<00:02:06.750> creativity

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
just adds a little bit more creativity

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.919 
just adds a little bit more creativity
to<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> game<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.629> little<00:02:09.629> bit<00:02:09.690> more<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
to the game and a little bit more to

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.640 
to the game and a little bit more to
user<00:02:10.259> separations<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
user separations and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.640 
user separations and
angel<00:02:11.890> 12<00:02:12.159> hands<00:02:12.400> currently<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:14.319> I<00:02:14.349> think<00:02:14.439> they

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
angel 12 hands currently so I think they

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.429 
angel 12 hands currently so I think they
took<00:02:14.769> a<00:02:14.890> step<00:02:15.099> back<00:02:15.370> with<00:02:15.579> that<00:02:18.329> it<00:02:19.329> just<00:02:19.659> more

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
took a step back with that it just more

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.110 
took a step back with that it just more
examples<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.069> just<00:02:21.250> ain't<00:02:21.489> y'all<00:02:21.760> on<00:02:21.909> how<00:02:22.060> you

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
examples it just ain't y'all on how you

examples it just ain't y'all on how you
used<00:02:22.299> to<00:02:22.420> be<00:02:22.540> able<00:02:22.599> to<00:02:22.720> celebrate<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.590> one

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
don't have a lot of options in terms of

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.250 
don't have a lot of options in terms of
the<00:02:58.689> custom<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:01.000> custom<00:03:01.359> ability<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.139> if

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
the custom the custom ability of it if

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.009 
the custom the custom ability of it if
you<00:03:02.379> will<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.760> few<00:03:04.329> new<00:03:04.420> animations<00:03:04.959> that

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
you will like a few new animations that

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.229 
you will like a few new animations that
they<00:03:05.200> added<00:03:05.560> but<00:03:05.769> it's<00:03:05.980> still<00:03:06.220> very<00:03:06.489> stiff<00:03:07.090> in

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
they added but it's still very stiff in

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.179 
they added but it's still very stiff in
terms<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.689> the<00:03:08.170> inputs<00:03:08.620> on<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:08.769> controller

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
terms of the inputs on the controller

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.929 
terms of the inputs on the controller
which<00:03:09.849> is<00:03:10.000> really<00:03:10.359> disappointing<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:11.939> that's

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
which is really disappointing and that's

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.129 
which is really disappointing and that's
why<00:03:13.090> I'm<00:03:13.150> kind<00:03:13.359> of<00:03:13.389> talking<00:03:13.689> about<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.870> while

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
why I'm kind of talking about it while

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.780 
why I'm kind of talking about it while
it's<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.319> little<00:03:14.560> thing<00:03:14.799> this<00:03:15.250> also<00:03:15.459> goes<00:03:15.730> into

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
it's a little thing this also goes into

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.449 
it's a little thing this also goes into
other<00:03:16.359> aspects<00:03:17.019> of<00:03:17.169> the<00:03:17.290> game<00:03:17.319> other<00:03:18.250> than

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
other aspects of the game other than

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.309 
other aspects of the game other than
user<00:03:18.819> celebrations<00:03:19.569> in<00:03:19.720> terms<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:20.019> just<00:03:20.169> a

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
user celebrations in terms of just a

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.539 
user celebrations in terms of just a
control<00:03:20.590> in<00:03:20.829> general<00:03:21.190> for<00:03:21.669> any<00:03:21.699> Cho<00:03:21.970> 12<00:03:23.519> but<00:03:24.519> I

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
control in general for any Cho 12 but I

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.789 
control in general for any Cho 12 but I
overall<00:03:25.480> that's<00:03:25.870> pretty<00:03:26.019> much<00:03:26.109> my<00:03:26.290> opinion<00:03:26.680> of

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
overall that's pretty much my opinion of

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.649 
overall that's pretty much my opinion of
what<00:03:27.459> I<00:03:27.489> wanted<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.819> talk<00:03:28.000> about<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.599> just

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
what I wanted to talk about it and just

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.509 
what I wanted to talk about it and just
the<00:03:29.349> little<00:03:29.560> things<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.829> bothered<00:03:30.310> me<00:03:30.370> about

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
the little things that bothered me about

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.580 
the little things that bothered me about
the<00:03:30.730> celebrations<00:03:31.329> I<00:03:31.540> don't<00:03:32.379> know<00:03:32.440> if<00:03:32.530> you

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
the celebrations I don't know if you

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.740 
the celebrations I don't know if you
