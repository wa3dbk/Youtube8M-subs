00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.429
 after the defeat against holland the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.980
 midfielder of the Mexican national team 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.470
 André saved acknowledged that the pain 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.170
 by this elimination was even greater than 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.850
 the one he felt in Germany-2006 when the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.460
 tricolor also stayed very close to 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.200
 advance to the last 16 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.790
 I do not know what 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.360
 I'm not without word the truth that I do not 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.120
 I think out of this way four 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.940
 minutes of having it very close to being 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.050
 nothing to make history for our country 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.180
 and I can not do anything there's a lot 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.309
 frustration there is much sadness courage 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.420
 with ourselves because in the end it was 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.770
 our mistake 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.850
 especially first goal not to defend well 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.039
 corner shot 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.089
 but you can not do much anymore 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:58.089
 we are out again and thanks to the 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:02.109
 people for supporting us so much for believing in 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:05.110
 us and now think about 4 years trying 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.700
 to return and that is the good 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.520
 there are no words, there are no words 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.039
 true that nothing was said 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.750
 the few who had a little encouragement and 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.170
 of energy to try to encourage the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.969
 others and nothing else there are no words for 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.000
 describe the sadness that you feel 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.650
 now 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.600
 I do not know let's dream about that game 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.340
 a lot of time to the goats of the vitola that 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.480
 he has never talked about habits but 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.250
 today 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.460
 a player that was thrown in all the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.870
 party at the end did not see any 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.630
 warning during the match and 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.820
 final a league pitar not so much that it 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.350
 strip 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.409
 and good what is a lot of frustration 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.070
 a lot of healing a lot of sadness and 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.780
 that follows the charges of each one follows 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.610
 try to be at a good level try to 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.820
 be good to keep coming the 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.440
 selection and come try to be in 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.440
 four years again 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.570
 totally blame the referee because 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.930
 also if we had defended 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.970
 well that play by forms in the volleyball and 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.180
 nothing happens there are also errors 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.380
 our then neither is 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.270
 I would like to blame 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.860
 leave 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.950
 the headers tomorrow complaining 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.720
 complaining the referee is not or you 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.810
 They analyze but it is a reality 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.910
 coincidence is since people are more 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.340
 thought 1 football is not thought and 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.810
 unfortunately at least what we 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.730
 touched this global all the mistakes 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.970
 serious were against in mexico no and 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.310
 the sad one after this elimination the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.080
 Mexican national team flew to his headquarters 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.600

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.030
