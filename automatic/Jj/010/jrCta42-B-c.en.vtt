their tracks in the snow and usually

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.600 
their tracks in the snow and usually
pretty<00:00:59.149> safe<00:00:59.420> x<00:00:59.719> it's<00:00:59.989> been<00:01:00.170> a<00:01:00.200> long<00:01:00.530> two<00:01:01.520> or

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.580 

feel<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:35.300> what<00:01:36.300> kind<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.630> Colby<00:01:36.990> ad<00:01:37.230> but<00:01:37.440> it's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
feel this what kind of Colby ad but it's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.100 
feel this what kind of Colby ad but it's
been<00:01:37.770> windy<00:01:38.010> and<00:01:38.370> how<00:01:39.120> long<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.600> been<00:01:39.660> cold

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
been windy and how long it's been cold

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.070 
been windy and how long it's been cold
and<00:01:40.370> particularly<00:01:41.370> this<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:42.150> date<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.840> be

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
and particularly this the date it can be

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.390 
and particularly this the date it can be
cold<00:01:43.350> at<00:01:43.440> night<00:01:43.620> but<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.950> warms<00:01:44.160> up<00:01:44.340> during

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
cold at night but if it warms up during

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.360 
cold at night but if it warms up during
the<00:01:44.730> day<00:01:44.910> it'll<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:46.080> racing<00:01:46.530> freezing<00:01:47.100> so

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
the day it'll be racing freezing so

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.400 
the day it'll be racing freezing so
we've<00:01:48.120> had<00:01:48.300> a<00:01:48.330> period<00:01:48.600> where<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:48.960> been<00:01:49.140> below

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
we've had a period where it's been below

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.470 
we've had a period where it's been below
freezing<00:01:49.680> through<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.190> day<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:50.640> quite<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> few

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
freezing through the day for quite a few

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.940 
freezing through the day for quite a few
weeks<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.020> that's<00:01:52.140> what<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.470> takes<00:01:52.620> to<00:01:52.830> get

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
weeks and that's what it takes to get

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.870 
weeks and that's what it takes to get
good<00:01:53.160> ice

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:06.210
