Hey guys, John here with here with RealTruck.com.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.500
Today I want to show you how to install the
ICI Stainless Steel Rocker Panels onto this

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:18.769
2014 GMC Sierra.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.090
As you can see here, they come with everything
you need to put this up on your truck.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.539
An easy no-drill installation, nice beautiful
chrome finish, and they also help protect

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.610
your paint from the rocks and debris, and
other stuff that might fly up and damage your

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.610
paint.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.500
So the next step is to get these on the truck.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.760
As you can see here, we've laid out all of
our pieces.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.910
We get a good count, make sure that we have
all the pieces that we're supposed to have.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:53.550
And so, the next thing that you want to do
with your panels is test fit them to make

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.190
sure that you have them in the right spot.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.340
And that they're actually going to line up
like they're supposed to.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.239
Make sure that you clean this really well,
wash it with some soap and water, and then

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.530
take some Isopropyl alcohol or something of
that nature, and wipe down the whole area

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.159
where you're going to be putting these on.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.820
And this one looks pretty good, so we're going
to go ahead and put this one up in place.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.250
And the way we're going to do that is we're
just going to take some masking tape.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.570
What we're going to do is tear off a few pieces
of it.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.159
Then what we're going to do with our panel
is we're going to get it up in place where

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.140
we want to install it, makes sure that it's
all lined up nicely.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:47.200
And then once it is, we'll take our masking
tape, and just put it on here to hold it in

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.719
place.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:58.780
And then we'll just let it hang there.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.249
So what we're going to do is we're going to
flip up our panel, and we're going to peal

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:05.719
back our piece.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.860
Okay so once we have our tape pealed off from
the back side of this, then what we're going

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.640
to so is we're going to go ahead, and push
it into place.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.490
We want to make sure we rub it down really
well, so that you get it to stick really well

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.060
to the body of the truck.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.730
We're going to go ahead and remove our tape.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:38.170
And then we're just going to hang on to it,
because we'll use it on the next one.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.270
Okay, once we've got our tape off, we've got
our panel on nice, you can do this one of

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.270
two ways.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.420
You can either put them all on, with this
stuff on or you can peal this off as you go.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.870
I like to just peal it as I go, because right
away you kind of get to start seeing what

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.150
it looks like on the truck which is kind of
a really awesome thing.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.920
So we're going to peal this off as we go,
here.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.600
Okay, there you go, as you guys can see that's
a really nice accent to add to the truck.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.600
Very inexpensive, it's going to protect the
body of the truck from rock damage, and stuff

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.900
coming off the road. and it's going to look
good for a long time.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.430
So what we're going to do at this point is
go ahead and put the rest of these on, and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.430
then we'll show you what this truck looks
like with all these rocker panels on.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:41.930
So we'll get after that.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:52.240
You see how great these things look on here.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.620
That's it, that's how easy and simple it is
to install these ICI Stainless Steel Rocker

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.190
Panels onto your truck.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:11.780
So remember, until next time, happy motoring.
