due he had an ok game is he the best

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.880 
due he had an ok game is he the best
player<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.270> Africa<00:01:51.900> that<00:01:52.080> with<00:01:52.320> weep<00:01:52.650> like

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
player in Africa that with weep like

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.100 
player in Africa that with weep like
suddenly<00:01:53.370> gonna<00:01:54.060> start<00:01:54.360> seeing<00:01:54.690> towards<00:01:55.050> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
suddenly gonna start seeing towards the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.680 
suddenly gonna start seeing towards the
end<00:01:55.230> of<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.350> season<00:01:55.760> no<00:01:56.760> I<00:01:56.790> still<00:01:57.330> think<00:01:57.570> he's

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
end of the season no I still think he's

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.030 
end of the season no I still think he's
not<00:01:57.870> good<00:01:58.020> enough<00:01:58.050> I<00:01:58.470> still<00:01:58.710> think<00:01:58.860> he's<00:01:58.950> an

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
not good enough I still think he's an

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.800 
not good enough I still think he's an
average<00:01:59.280> player<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.820> today<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.720> to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
average player and today is not going to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.300 
average player and today is not going to
change<00:02:00.870> that<00:02:01.230> but<00:02:01.440> he<00:02:01.650> did<00:02:01.830> have<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.980> good<00:02:02.130> game

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
change that but he did have a good game

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.370 
change that but he did have a good game
the<00:02:02.790> midfield<00:02:03.240> did<00:02:03.510> click<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> lot<00:02:04.140> better

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the midfield did click a lot better

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.260 
the midfield did click a lot better
today<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.280> personally<00:02:05.730> think<00:02:06.030> it's

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
today and I personally think it's

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.419 
today and I personally think it's
because<00:02:06.480> of<00:02:06.659> R<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.960> its<00:02:07.170> key<00:02:07.380> all<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.980> play

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
because of R is its key all of this play

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.580 
because of R is its key all of this play
that<00:02:09.060> we've<00:02:09.179> seen<00:02:09.420> there's<00:02:09.899> been<00:02:10.080> effective

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
that we've seen there's been effective

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.130 
that we've seen there's been effective
in<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:10.890> last<00:02:11.069> three<00:02:11.400> games<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:12.000> think<00:02:12.750> comes

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
in the last three games I think comes

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.229 
in the last three games I think comes
from<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.409> tempo<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.129> rose<00:02:14.370> its<00:02:14.580> key<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.940> think

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
from the tempo of rose its key I think

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.899 
from the tempo of rose its key I think
he<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.629> massively<00:02:16.530> important<00:02:17.069> player<00:02:17.310> to

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
he is a massively important player to

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.399 
he is a massively important player to
the<00:02:17.940> way<00:02:18.150> we've<00:02:18.360> paid<00:02:18.599> in<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.810> last<00:02:19.019> three

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
the way we've paid in the last three

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.920 
the way we've paid in the last three
games<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.920> yet<00:02:20.489> am<00:02:21.030> i<00:02:21.209> confident<00:02:21.690> he'll<00:02:21.900> be

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
games and yet am i confident he'll be

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.390 
games and yet am i confident he'll be
playing<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.409> the<00:02:22.500> next<00:02:22.680> game<00:02:22.830> no<00:02:23.099> I'm<00:02:23.220> not

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
playing in the next game no I'm not

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.130 
playing in the next game no I'm not
confident<00:02:23.849> because<00:02:23.970> Begley<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:24.900> doesn't

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
confident because Begley just doesn't

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.320 
confident because Begley just doesn't
