00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello to you all peace and and this is new 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.240
 cycle video dedicated to the gameplay 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.210
 korkmaz that 2 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.420
 as I told you I bought 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.719
 a little bit during the sale 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.270
 New Year's toys in the incentive and in fact 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.600
 I am sure that this game is for you all 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.570
 like it is made very high quality 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.789
 pretty funny and actually I have it already 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.960
 experienced at the novice level let's 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.540
 try to pass and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.739
 at the level of a combat magician we are from the first location 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.399
 as soon as you appear you 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:45.120
 show what where and how what 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:47.910
 currency bet and her cheek glasses so what 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.890
 did I really die like this 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.670
 ingloriously 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.449
 driven by google and powerless 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.289
 surrounded by enemies 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.969
 I deserve the best fate they came for 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.729
 me once I was their queen and 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.530
 now these are my executioners 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.140
 I will not spoil you this story 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.840
 I'm sure you always watch the video and it 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.840
 you will like tra-ta-ta-ta 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:25.439
 actually actually let's see 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:32.159
 what weapon can we afford so 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:37.110
 I will touch that it is pretty good 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.570
 last we do so and install 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.860
 the most important thing at the beginning of the trap will become 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.860
 but I usually install here 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:57.490
 , Rarely comes all started but that any 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.490
 less like I still have 1600 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.270
 put here and 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:12.510
 on the floor let him slow down somewhere 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.300
 here he still can not put but you never know 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.000
 who let us come here well, that produce 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:23.580
 horde despite the fact that traps are pretty 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.800
 powerfully beats you need all the same 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.100
 aside from falling because you are also not 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.430
 weak and your auto attacks put good 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.430
 damage 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.340
 on the tower is undoubtedly a useful thing 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:50.260
 how do you imagine you are playing 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.010
 and you have gold and the first acts 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.620
 quote 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.020
 so that in the sim card then it was pretty 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:04.180
 easy to pass if you played 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:06.700
 let's say so to the one who calls for something 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.840
 knows how to put that sort of thing 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.840
 about the same situation 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.300
 and didn't play much games like 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.540
 tower defense 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.550
 but I don't like him as much 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:35.170
 moving need to think what to put 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:38.310
 to survive in this harsh world is that 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.310
 if you pass 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:46.640
 you just don’t help your kelpies 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:56.170
 so I still have to live 44 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:04:02.000
 but not yet 2 4 wave kill streak 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:04.760
 killing spree the next group at all 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.030
 Soon so do not give quietly here 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:14.750
 so let's get it in here 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:18.489
 do go 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.489
 mom they are already here 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.190
 drank then 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.310
 this is this 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.690
 it is necessary here and numbers under and so if you 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.550
 a little bit knocked down nothing terrible 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:53.150
 the main thing that the orcs did not pass you are 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:59.090
 cool you just cool all ahead and we 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:02.110
 under the version of some clever org he took 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.110
 cost my traps 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.660
 So 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:21.319
 and so 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:28.250
 finally so here they are not needed let's 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:31.719
 spend our money here is not something that 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.719
 also here it is possible 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:49.960
 let's just about anything in anywhere else 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:52.960
 I won’t be ready 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.960
 forward 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:03.170
 last horde who survived van 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.170
 see counter 44 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:16.440
 but I have to sneak behind me to join 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.440
 I think 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:26.330
 he decided to go this way 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.330
 straight to him 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:40.820
 just do not have to stand at the farthest 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:43.450
 to hell the name is not a domestic weapon this 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.450
 generally chic 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:00.409
 we look at the minutes 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:09.159
 how many do I have left but damn 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:09.159
 they go and go go and go handed over 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:32.350
 you won't really quite pass 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:41.200
 great technology I already looking at my 

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:44.110
 everything is just about the whole weapon we 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.270
 handled well what can I say by 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.070
 my very good we earned 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.590
 shards that can then spend 

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.610
 further on 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.270
 spell own spell book 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.050
 and choose weapon traps or this glory 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:59.290
 eat my gear 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:02.830
 on that i what's on now and everything 

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:05.670
 enjoy life so that was with you 

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:11.640
