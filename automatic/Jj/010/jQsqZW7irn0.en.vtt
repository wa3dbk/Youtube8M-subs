00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.070
 My name is Alejandro Perez Gonzalez I 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.010
 at the university of rey juan carlos 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.800
 from vicálvaro and I'm about to do the 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.810
 last mock of law right now I 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.090
 I feel a little nervous and I hope that 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.100
 less than in the final exam I feel 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.170
 It's quiet but it's not that nervous 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.790
 dial is to me and I think I've prepared 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.520
 well enough for me to 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.070
 come out I called Maria Perez Fernandez 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.450
 we are going to perform the last simulation in 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.920
 real conditions I think that the 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:45.350
 simulacrum will come out a bit more or less 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.420
 like the last but good right now 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.760
 I feel a little nervous to merit the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.860
 mock about all the fear say oh 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.510
 I hope that I get it right so hello 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.820
 I call looking at a mural ok I feel 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.820
 Nervous but also very eager 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.280
 I think this drill is important 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.960
 because at the same time that you are in this 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.490
 university like that gives you a little bit of 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.290
 knowledge of where you are going to do 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.150
 really the exam and that that takes away 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.460
 enough nerves to the tier in the 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.320
 official but it's better for me to leave 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.320
 my nerves here today and the day of the exam 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.140
 Do the classroom if it's hot if it's cold 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.150
 if you are more comfortable less to know a 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.300
 little the area to know where to 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:55.610
 park and control a little the 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:58.130
 nerves I am when initiating directors and 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.619
 I just did the last simulation of 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.930
 the cala machete or to choose when 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.119
 come out of the exam the truth is that 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.770
 I thought it was going to be more difficult than 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.539
 that has been although it is true that 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.009
 there were some questions that proved a 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.200
 money milestone I feel quite 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.660
 satisfied the truth the questions if 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.730
 you have studied well is your reward 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.560
 because yes you notice that you have 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.170
 had better drills and it has 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.060
 it seemed quite difficult what happens is 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.349
 that this after the 'whites' up 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.300
 that I do not put the results we're going to go 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.720
 because the sea is very much a root of the know 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.280
 Of course I've seen that you 're not giving more 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.260
 time other times after having 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.720
 done the simulation I realized that the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.180
 preparation is quite good and we have been 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.360
 formed very well we have made a mogollón 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.080
 of simulacra teaches us many techniques 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.269
 of exam to be able to solve questions 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.160
 that maybe we do not know but if 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.100
 we can draw somehow I feel 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.440
 pretty prepared for 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.110
 to do it well and I hope to get 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.360
 square after this drill I see myself 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.460
 in comparison quite better prepared 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.230
 that other people for example that have not 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.390
 I had so much time to study because 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.860
 we arrived from March or that neither 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.140
 they have even been prepared in academia 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.360
 then I see that it has that factor yes that 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.780
 we go with more world and what I have more 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.850
 Possibilities to answer questions 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.080
 that he has never seen in my life because the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.730
 exam everything what the time that is 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.500
 focused directly to laugh as if 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:41.120
 out today of sharm in a sense that 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:44.900
 This way is friend of my step by cto 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.910
 I emphasize that they have much forced me to 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.120
 study because I have little strength of 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.430
 will and being on top of earrings 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.950
 making you mocks 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.500
 do the evaluations then you 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.430
 force study and put your goals 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.629
 if I were to introduce myself again to measure 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.109
 that I would introduce myself with this academy 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.879
 because it makes studying a lot easier 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.040
 constancy is also top you and others 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.609
 teachers are very attentive have a 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.730
 forum that helps you respect the doubts 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.160
 in the race 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.630
 I studied another different way as 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.820
 studied now has studied now 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.770
 I consider studying what I have 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.160
 learned about everything the amount of 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:30.669
 material and resources of which 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.800
 we have to study so much of the 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.840
 own manual as the breakdown book 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.370
 is that very good process is very useful 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.830
 that I believe that the things that have 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.449
 taught is captured forever and 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.210
 will not die as much for law as for 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.610
 this daily practice in this life you 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.139
 you are really interested and you 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.760
 you try, I think you can 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.060
 get personally I would repeat 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.060
 oil
