saves have not yet gotten them or just

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.680 
saves have not yet gotten them or just
recently<00:00:40.890> got<00:00:41.010> them<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.239> they<00:00:42.390> can't<00:00:42.600> use

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
recently got them and they can't use

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.850 
recently got them and they can't use
their<00:00:42.719> codes<00:00:43.020> anymore<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.500> I'm<00:00:43.559> trying<00:00:43.800> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
their codes anymore so I'm trying to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.110 
their codes anymore so I'm trying to
contact<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.280> company<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.760> see<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:44.910> there's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
contact the company to see if there's

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
any refund process I believe since it's

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.760 
any refund process I believe since it's
through<00:00:47.910> Amazon<00:00:48.360> there<00:00:48.539> might<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.770> especially

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
through Amazon there might be especially

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.470 
through Amazon there might be especially
if<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.340> haven't<00:00:50.640> gotten<00:00:50.760> yours<00:00:51.000> yet<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.390> your

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
if you haven't gotten yours yet and your

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.139 
if you haven't gotten yours yet and your
ship<00:00:51.750> then<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.289> would<00:00:52.410> look<00:00:52.559> into<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.190> I

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
ship then I would look into that but I

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.360 
ship then I would look into that but I
realize<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.780> they're<00:00:55.230> actually<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.980> UK
