CyanogenMod<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.700> I'm<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:48.059> using<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.629> stock

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
CyanogenMod so I'm just using the stock

CyanogenMod so I'm just using the stock
AOSP<00:00:50.550> launcher<00:00:54.800> everything<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:57.140> fairly

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
AOSP launcher everything is fairly

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.679 
AOSP launcher everything is fairly
smooth

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.779 

once<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:07.859> things<00:01:08.039> loaded<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:11.670> can

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
once you get things loaded you can

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:37.399 
once you get things loaded you can
actually<00:01:11.939> get<00:01:12.210> back<00:01:12.359> to<00:01:12.569> them<00:01:12.689> pretty<00:01:12.929> quick

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.319 

so<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.100> does<00:01:38.280> actually<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.640> pretty<00:01:38.790> good<00:01:38.969> job<00:01:39.149> of

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
so it does actually a pretty good job of

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:48.109 
so it does actually a pretty good job of
working<00:01:39.479> with<00:01:40.219> only<00:01:41.219> 512<00:01:41.939> Meg's<00:01:42.149> of<00:01:42.270> RAM<00:01:47.119> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
working with only 512 Meg's of RAM the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:57.959 
working with only 512 Meg's of RAM the
slide<00:01:49.399> brightness<00:01:50.399> adjustment<00:01:50.820> works

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:13.900 

at<00:01:58.479> least<00:01:58.659> it<00:01:58.810> was<00:02:00.810> there<00:02:01.810> goes

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:25.589 

camera<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.090> working

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.110 

let's<00:02:26.349> go<00:02:26.620> into<00:02:26.769> settings<00:02:27.159> here<00:02:27.400> one<00:02:27.969> of<00:02:28.060> the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
let's go into settings here one of the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.739 
let's go into settings here one of the
nicer<00:02:28.420> features<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.989> I<00:02:29.079> like<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:30.749> under

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:31.749 
nicer features that I like is under

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:33.989 
nicer features that I like is under
security<00:02:32.409> which<00:02:33.069> you<00:02:33.219> have<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.579> set<00:02:33.849> up<00:02:33.879> some

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:33.999 
security which you have to set up some

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:38.489 
security which you have to set up some
type<00:02:34.239> of<00:02:34.680> lock<00:02:35.879> to<00:02:36.879> do<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:38.139> whether<00:02:38.290> it's

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:38.499 
type of lock to do this so whether it's

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:45.050 
type of lock to do this so whether it's
the<00:02:38.560> pattern<00:02:38.859> or<00:02:40.680> password<00:02:42.060> but<00:02:43.060> we've<00:02:43.180> got

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
the pattern or password but we've got

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:53.159 
the pattern or password but we've got
privacy<00:02:46.060> guard<00:02:46.420> here<00:02:51.359> which<00:02:52.359> you<00:02:52.629> can<00:02:52.750> enable

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
privacy guard here which you can enable

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:59.789 
privacy guard here which you can enable
it<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:56.370> any<00:02:57.370> apps<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.939> you<00:02:58.120> install<00:02:58.799> you'll

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
it and any apps that you install you'll

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.229 
it and any apps that you install you'll
have<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.069> give<00:03:00.219> permission<00:03:00.519> to<00:03:01.409> access<00:03:02.409> your

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
have to give permission to access your

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.729 
have to give permission to access your
contacts<00:03:04.239> and<00:03:04.599> phone<00:03:04.810> lists<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.379> things<00:03:05.530> like

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
contacts and phone lists and things like

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.250 
contacts and phone lists and things like
that<00:03:08.549> so<00:03:09.549> that's<00:03:09.699> kind<00:03:09.969> of<00:03:10.030> nice<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:11.139> be<00:03:11.169> able

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
that so that's kind of nice to be able

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:23.390 
that so that's kind of nice to be able
to<00:03:11.439> lock<00:03:11.620> things<00:03:11.889> down<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.159> little<00:03:12.370> bit

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:48.180 

I<00:03:25.670> go<00:03:26.670> into<00:03:34.220> apps<00:03:35.220> here

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.340 

so<00:03:48.790> still<00:03:49.240> shows<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.480> decent<00:03:49.930> amount<00:03:49.990> of<00:03:50.170> RAM

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
so still shows a decent amount of RAM

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.820 
so still shows a decent amount of RAM
free<00:03:50.620> for<00:03:50.920> only<00:03:51.040> having<00:03:51.430> on<00:03:52.080> 512<00:03:53.080> max<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.530> start

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
free for only having on 512 max to start

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:06.350 
free for only having on 512 max to start
with

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:18.620 

that<00:04:07.360> is<00:04:07.540> KitKat<00:04:08.230> for<00:04:08.950> four<00:04:09.250> -<00:04:15.299> so<00:04:16.299> there<00:04:16.450> we<00:04:16.540> go
