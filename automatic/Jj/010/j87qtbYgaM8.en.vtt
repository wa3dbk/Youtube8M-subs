00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.159
 Llama Caillou learns to swim 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.650

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.560
 OK 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.930
 one 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.890
 maybe next time you get into the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.890
 Big pool 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.120
 remember when you were in the pool 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.290
 today like this 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.230
 you want dad teaches you how to swim and two 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.520
 days later he received his first 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.310
 class 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.500
 he liked to learn to swim and after 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.400
 some lessons started doing it 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.330
 getting better 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.330
 I know you can 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.260
 nothing happens 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.850
 that I wanted to swim and immerse myself as 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.850
 they make big kids 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.390
 I would like to go back to the water 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.709
 Well that seems like a good idea 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.850
 with me daddy and you'll see that I can 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.850
 I swim alone 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.240
 to that is extend your arms do it like 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.670
 I taught you that I walk on the ground 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.520
 of the pool and very soon he could swim 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.520
 without the help of anyone from dry 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.720
 and I am here you can do it 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.349
 It depends 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.450

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:52.860
 help him calm down he fell nothing towards 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.860

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.299
 I was there, it's not like that 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.860
