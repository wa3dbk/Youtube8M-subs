do bilinear make sure any so tropic
filtering<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.420> none<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.110> then<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
filtering is it none and then the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.310 
filtering is it none and then the
texture<00:01:41.189> quality<00:01:41.479> make<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.600> go<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.780> low<00:01:43.049> and

to do is you're going to start a new
server<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.310> really<00:01:53.549> doesn't<00:01:53.820> matter<00:01:53.939> what<00:01:54.390> map

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
server it really doesn't matter what map

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.020 
server it really doesn't matter what map
you<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.719> come<00:01:57.719> into<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.049> match<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.090 
you do so you come into the match and
then<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.240> let<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.540> load<00:02:00.659> up<00:02:00.920> because<00:02:01.920> we're

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
then just let it load up because we're

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.200 
then just let it load up because we're
going<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.399> doing<00:02:02.520> something<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
going to be doing something on the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.810 
going to be doing something on the
console<00:02:03.659> here

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.050 

all<00:02:09.820> right

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.920 

I'm<00:02:13.540> going<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.870> just<00:02:14.410> spawn<00:02:14.830> in<00:02:15.510> then<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.660> type

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
I'm going to just spawn in then you type

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.930 
I'm going to just spawn in then you type
in<00:02:17.790> /x<00:02:18.790> ik<00:02:21.000> FPS<00:02:22.290> CFG<00:02:23.290> I'll<00:02:24.099> put<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:24.849> the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
in /x ik FPS CFG I'll put that in the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.100 
in /x ik FPS CFG I'll put that in the
description<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:26.849> then<00:02:27.849> it'll<00:02:28.180> draw<00:02:28.720> your<00:02:28.930> FPS

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
description and then it'll draw your FPS

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.470 
description and then it'll draw your FPS
and<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.069> will<00:02:30.220> also<00:02:30.340> make<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.849> game<00:02:31.030> run<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.269> lot

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
and it will also make the game run a lot

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.960 
and it will also make the game run a lot
smoother<00:02:31.989> I'm<00:02:32.410> getting<00:02:32.860> bad<00:02:33.069> fps<00:02:33.580> right<00:02:33.819> now

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
smoother I'm getting bad fps right now

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.220 
smoother I'm getting bad fps right now
just<00:02:34.209> because<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.690> fact<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:35.050> I'm

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
just because of the fact that I'm

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.890 
just because of the fact that I'm
recording<00:02:35.880> but<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:37.060> guarantee<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.720> you

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
recording but I guarantee you that you

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.710 
recording but I guarantee you that you
would<00:02:38.110> get<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.260> lot<00:02:38.470> better<00:02:38.620> FPS<00:02:39.340> then<00:02:39.819> with

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
would get a lot better FPS then with

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.660 
would get a lot better FPS then with
just<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.230> low<00:02:41.410> settings<00:02:41.890> if<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.310> were<00:02:42.430> trying

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670
