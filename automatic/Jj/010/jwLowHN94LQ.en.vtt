cameras<00:00:29.140> you<00:00:29.529> can<00:00:29.679> actually<00:00:29.769> use<00:00:30.039> your<00:00:30.159> smart

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
cameras you can actually use your smart

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.150 
cameras you can actually use your smart
phones<00:00:30.759> your<00:00:31.089> devices<00:00:31.630> your<00:00:31.900> tablets<00:00:32.470> you

phones your devices your tablets you

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.530 
phones your devices your tablets you
could<00:00:33.280> actually<00:00:33.400> see<00:00:33.850> what<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.120> cameras

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
could actually see what the cameras

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.690 
could actually see what the cameras
seeing<00:00:34.750> you<00:00:35.290> know<00:00:35.410> into<00:00:35.680> clouds<00:00:35.920> and<00:00:36.250> also

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
seeing you know into clouds and also

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.450 
seeing you know into clouds and also
we'll<00:00:37.510> has<00:00:38.020> motion<00:00:38.410> detection<00:00:38.739> so<00:00:39.160> if<00:00:39.340> it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
we'll has motion detection so if it

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.069 
we'll has motion detection so if it
senses<00:00:39.910> something<00:00:39.940> that's<00:00:40.510> coming<00:00:40.750> into<00:00:40.899> the

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
senses something that's coming into the

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.660 
senses something that's coming into the
field<00:00:41.230> of<00:00:41.410> view<00:00:41.620> it's<00:00:42.430> going<00:00:42.550> to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
field of view it's going to

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.849 
field of view it's going to
automatically<00:00:43.090> save<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:44.109> to<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.379> clouds<00:00:44.620> and

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
automatically save it to the clouds and

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:46.139 
automatically save it to the clouds and
from<00:00:45.010> there<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.280> could<00:00:45.370> use<00:00:45.550> an<00:00:45.699> app<00:00:45.910> to

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
from there you could use an app to

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.540 
from there you could use an app to
actually<00:00:46.690> check<00:00:46.870> it<00:00:47.019> out<00:00:47.199> and<00:00:47.829> also<00:00:48.129> features

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
actually check it out and also features

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.599 
actually check it out and also features
night<00:00:49.480> vision<00:00:49.899> infrared<00:00:50.079> for<00:00:50.679> up<00:00:50.829> to<00:00:51.070> as

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
night vision infrared for up to as

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.330 
night vision infrared for up to as
infrared<00:00:52.179> night<00:00:52.390> vision<00:00:52.420> up<00:00:52.899> to<00:00:53.379> 15<00:00:53.739> meters<00:00:54.160> so

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
infrared night vision up to 15 meters so

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.069 
infrared night vision up to 15 meters so
it's<00:00:54.489> pretty<00:00:54.640> useful<00:00:55.030> if<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.510> want<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:55.870> you

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
it's pretty useful if you want to you

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.229 
it's pretty useful if you want to you
know<00:00:56.199> something<00:00:56.649> for<00:00:56.739> your<00:00:56.890> home<00:00:57.160> even<00:00:58.030> for

your business it might be something you
might<00:00:59.500> want<00:00:59.769> to<00:00:59.800> take<00:00:59.920> a<00:00:59.949> look<00:01:00.190> at<00:01:00.370> now<00:01:00.910> it's

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
might want to take a look at now it's

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.029 
might want to take a look at now it's
pretty<00:01:01.329> generic<00:01:01.510> with<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.199> design<00:01:02.710> nothing

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
pretty generic with the design nothing

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.860 
pretty generic with the design nothing
really<00:01:03.190> fancy<00:01:03.550> about<00:01:04.089> it<00:01:04.269> pretty<00:01:04.570> much<00:01:04.750> the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
really fancy about it pretty much the

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.360 
really fancy about it pretty much the
majority<00:01:05.260> that<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:05.410> the<00:01:05.710> camera

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
majority that is the camera

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.430 
majority that is the camera
yeah<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.180> lens<00:01:07.390> itself<00:01:07.660> mouthing<00:01:08.050> right<00:01:08.290> down

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
yeah the lens itself mouthing right down

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.160 
yeah the lens itself mouthing right down
the<00:01:08.560> middle<00:01:08.590> you<00:01:08.950> have<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.909> infrared<00:01:10.570> system

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
the middle you have the infrared system

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.690 
the middle you have the infrared system
of<00:01:11.320> course<00:01:11.560> in<00:01:11.740> place<00:01:12.009> they<00:01:12.490> have<00:01:12.610> a

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
of course in place they have a

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.330 
of course in place they have a
microphone<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:13.570> an<00:01:14.079> LED<00:01:14.530> light<00:01:14.770> on<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.040> front

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
microphone to an LED light on the front

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.179 
microphone to an LED light on the front
indicate<00:01:15.970> it's<00:01:16.210> getting<00:01:17.079> a<00:01:17.259> signal<00:01:17.829> and<00:01:17.979> also

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
indicate it's getting a signal and also

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.069 
indicate it's getting a signal and also
powered<00:01:18.430> on<00:01:18.579> of<00:01:18.759> course<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.570> features<00:01:19.900> also

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
powered on of course it features also

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.080 
powered on of course it features also
Wi-Fi<00:01:20.680> connectivity<00:01:21.250> so<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:21.939> don't

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
Wi-Fi connectivity so you don't

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.370 
Wi-Fi connectivity so you don't
necessarily<00:01:22.180> have<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.659> have<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.020> wired

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
necessarily have to have a wired

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.039 
necessarily have to have a wired
connection<00:01:23.619> just<00:01:24.280> because<00:01:24.549> in<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.759> back<00:01:25.049> yeah

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
connection just because in the back yeah

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.929 
connection just because in the back yeah
I<00:01:26.079> shall<00:01:26.259> have<00:01:26.380> yet<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.770> net<00:01:26.950> port<00:01:27.549> right<00:01:27.729> there

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
I shall have yet to net port right there

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.789 
I shall have yet to net port right there
so<00:01:28.450> good<00:01:28.689> hardwired<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.259> right<00:01:29.409> way<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.619> a

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
so good hardwired the right way to a

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.380 
so good hardwired the right way to a
router<00:01:30.040> but<00:01:30.460> if<00:01:30.520> you'd<00:01:30.670> rather<00:01:30.700> have<00:01:31.030> it

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
router but if you'd rather have it

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.480 
router but if you'd rather have it
Wireless<00:01:31.899> you<00:01:32.110> can<00:01:32.500> go<00:01:32.649> that<00:01:32.829> route<00:01:33.100> Edea

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
Wireless you can go that route Edea

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.910 
Wireless you can go that route Edea
setup<00:01:33.939> is<00:01:34.060> pretty<00:01:34.210> simple<00:01:34.810> once<00:01:35.649> you<00:01:35.740> have<00:01:35.829> it

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
setup is pretty simple once you have it

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.830 
setup is pretty simple once you have it
set<00:01:36.100> up<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.670> could<00:01:36.790> just<00:01:36.969> plug<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.540> into<00:01:37.659> a

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
set up you could just plug it into a

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.719 
set up you could just plug it into a
power<00:01:38.110> source<00:01:38.469> of<00:01:38.649> course<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:39.189> wall<00:01:39.460> and

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
power source of course to wall and

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.069 
power source of course to wall and
that's<00:01:40.030> pretty<00:01:40.210> much<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.570> it'll<00:01:40.750> work<00:01:40.780> with

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
that's pretty much it it'll work with

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.749 
that's pretty much it it'll work with
your<00:01:41.229> router<00:01:41.469> or<00:01:41.740> your<00:01:41.799> network<00:01:42.189> at<00:01:42.310> home<00:01:42.340> and

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
your router or your network at home and

it'll be able to actually see what's
going<00:01:45.070> on<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.670> can't<00:01:46.210> it's<00:01:46.689> now<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.170> base

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
going on you can't it's now the base

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.609 
going on you can't it's now the base
itself<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.880> could<00:01:49.060> attach<00:01:49.659> it<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.170> wall<00:01:50.590> or

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
itself you could attach it to a wall or

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.109 
itself you could attach it to a wall or
something<00:01:51.130> if<00:01:51.189> you<00:01:51.250> want<00:01:51.520> there's<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:51.969> little

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
something if you want there's a little

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.340 
something if you want there's a little
bit<00:01:52.210> of<00:01:52.270> flexibility<00:01:52.840> in<00:01:52.960> terms<00:01:52.990> of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
bit of flexibility in terms of

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.469 
bit of flexibility in terms of
orientation<00:01:54.100> but<00:01:54.939> this<00:01:55.119> is<00:01:55.180> something<00:01:55.450> that

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
orientation but this is something that

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.779 
orientation but this is something that
stays<00:01:55.840> stationary<00:01:56.229> for<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.860> most<00:01:57.039> part<00:01:57.369> so

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
stays stationary for the most part so

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:58.980 
stays stationary for the most part so
we're<00:01:57.909> gonna<00:01:58.000> check<00:01:58.180> out<00:01:58.329> the<00:01:58.479> app<00:01:58.630> here<00:01:58.869> and

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
we're gonna check out the app here and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.139 
we're gonna check out the app here and
show<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.170> exactly<00:01:59.289> what<00:01:59.799> it's<00:01:59.890> all<00:01:59.979> about

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
one why cam home monitor camera you can

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.720 
one why cam home monitor camera you can
actually<00:02:31.840> set<00:02:32.170> them<00:02:32.320> all<00:02:32.500> up<00:02:32.650> individually<00:02:33.280> so

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
actually set them all up individually so

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.130 
actually set them all up individually so
we<00:02:33.760> have<00:02:34.000> one<00:02:34.210> set<00:02:34.240> up<00:02:34.600> here<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.050> we

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
we have one set up here and we

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.470 
we have one set up here and we
identified<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.520> here<00:02:36.790> premiere<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.210> have

it off you could you could turn on also

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.050 
it off you could you could turn on also
motion<00:02:42.070> detection<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.700> even<00:02:42.940> get

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
motion detection and even get

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.880 
motion detection and even get
notifications<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.380> in<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.500> event<00:02:44.680> something

notifications so in the event something
if<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.760> does<00:02:45.940> pick<00:02:46.150> up<00:02:46.270> something<00:02:46.510> you'll

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
if it does pick up something you'll

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.990 
if it does pick up something you'll
email<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:48.010> when<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.280> actually<00:02:48.580> click<00:02:48.820> the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
email you so when you actually click the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.090 
email you so when you actually click the
camera<00:02:49.300> it's<00:02:49.900> gonna<00:02:50.080> launch<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.500> application

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
camera it's gonna launch the application

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.920 
camera it's gonna launch the application
and<00:02:51.220> jump<00:02:51.520> right<00:02:51.850> into<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.270> camera<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:52.780> we're

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
and jump right into the camera so we're

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.230 
and jump right into the camera so we're
seeing<00:02:53.110> when<00:02:53.350> it's<00:02:53.500> recording<00:02:54.310> right<00:02:54.460> now<00:02:54.490> now

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
seeing when it's recording right now now

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.120 
seeing when it's recording right now now
there's<00:02:55.930> hardly<00:02:56.080> quality<00:02:56.650> we<00:02:56.740> gotta<00:02:56.890> say<00:02:57.010> it's

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
there's hardly quality we gotta say it's

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.800 
there's hardly quality we gotta say it's
really<00:02:57.160> nice<00:02:57.490> as<00:02:57.670> long<00:02:57.700> as<00:02:58.000> there's<00:02:58.150> plenty<00:02:58.780> of
