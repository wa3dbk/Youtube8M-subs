flexible dieting which has been

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.090 
flexible dieting which has been
rebranded<00:00:15.059> if<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.870> fits<00:00:16.080> your<00:00:16.260> macros<00:00:16.410> today

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
which is really a bad acronym for the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.500 
which is really a bad acronym for the
reason<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.250> I'm<00:00:20.430> about<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.820> get<00:00:21.000> into<00:00:21.330> and

the opponents of if it fits your macros

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
used to create the strawman argument

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.790 
used to create the strawman argument
that<00:00:36.270> no<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.480> can't<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:37.110> eat<00:00:37.260> whatever<00:00:37.469> you

dietary deficiencies and they were right

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.660 
dietary deficiencies and they were right
but<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> problem<00:00:49.739> was<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.219> was<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> straw

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
but the problem was that it was a straw

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
people online who now do take it

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.670 
people online who now do take it

literal straw man argument it used to be
used<00:02:26.600> against<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:27.319> let's<00:02:27.530> clarify<00:02:27.800> the

difference because as someone who saw

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.900 
difference because as someone who saw
the<00:02:32.320> origin<00:02:33.320> of<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.709> term<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:34.340> saw<00:02:34.640> where<00:02:34.880> it

just in the long term but potentially in

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
the short term so there is a big
