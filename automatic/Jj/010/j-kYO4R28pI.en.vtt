00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
dishwasher is the biggest priority I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.899 
dishwasher is the biggest priority I
think<00:02:33.079> so<00:02:34.079> we<00:02:34.200> were<00:02:34.290> fully<00:02:34.560> ready<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.220> pass<00:02:35.609> the

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
think so we were fully ready to pass the

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.030 
think so we were fully ready to pass the
health<00:02:36.120> inspection<00:02:36.689> we<00:02:37.349> had<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.709> dishwasher

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
health inspection we had this dishwasher

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.520 
health inspection we had this dishwasher
up<00:02:38.579> and<00:02:38.760> running<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.720> second<00:02:40.140> he<00:02:40.260> showed

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
up and running and the second he showed

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.339 
up and running and the second he showed
up<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:41.220> crap<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.420> can't<00:02:42.659> pass<00:02:42.870> until<00:02:43.230> we

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
up it crap that you can't pass until we

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.589 
up it crap that you can't pass until we
have<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.530> dishwasher<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.090> guess<00:02:45.450> we're

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
have the dishwasher so I guess we're

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.179
