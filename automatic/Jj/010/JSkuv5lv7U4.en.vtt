here but i got it for four dollars i got

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.540 
here but i got it for four dollars i got
a<00:00:57.600> dollar<00:00:57.899> off<00:00:58.230> from<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.890> was<00:00:59.010> 299

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
a dollar off from it so it was 299

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.479 
a dollar off from it so it was 299
because<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.449> button<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.980> missing

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
because the button on here is missing

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.270 
because the button on here is missing
but<00:01:03.300> what<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.600> actually<00:01:03.840> thought<00:01:04.710> about<00:01:04.769> when<00:01:05.250> I

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
but what I actually thought about when I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.399 
but what I actually thought about when I
saw<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.850> was<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.240> because<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.869> buttons<00:01:07.049> are

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
saw it was that because the buttons are

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.649 
saw it was that because the buttons are
similar<00:01:07.799> colors<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> actual<00:01:08.790> jacket<00:01:09.450> I

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
similar colors to the actual jacket I

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.870 
similar colors to the actual jacket I
would<00:01:10.290> actually<00:01:10.680> appreciate<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.340> jacket<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
would actually appreciate the jacket a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.880 
would actually appreciate the jacket a
lot<00:01:12.060> more<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.570> i<00:01:12.689> replace<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.290> buttons<00:01:13.619> with

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
lot more if i replace the buttons with

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.070 
lot more if i replace the buttons with
something<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.610> had<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> little<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:15.869> more

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
