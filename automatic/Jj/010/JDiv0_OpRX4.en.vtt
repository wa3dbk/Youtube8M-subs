00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.360 
all right so we're gonna do a let's play
a<00:00:02.790> factorial<00:00:03.389> over<00:00:03.449> here<00:00:04.069> for<00:00:05.069> those<00:00:05.190> of<00:00:05.310> you

a factorial over here for those of you

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.710 
a factorial over here for those of you
who<00:00:05.520> have<00:00:05.640> watched<00:00:05.850> let's<00:00:06.150> try<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.420> know<00:00:06.629> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
basics of it if you don't it is a sort

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.540 
basics of it if you don't it is a sort
of<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.670> sci-fi<00:00:09.349> Survival<00:00:10.349> industrial<00:00:11.160> kind<00:00:11.429> of

of a sci-fi Survival industrial kind of

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.499 
of a sci-fi Survival industrial kind of
game

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
game

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.360 
game
we'll<00:00:13.230> start<00:00:13.410> off<00:00:13.559> looking<00:00:13.740> kind<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.250> a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
we'll start off looking kind of like a

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.890 
we'll start off looking kind of like a
top-down<00:00:14.730> minecraft<00:00:15.210> or<00:00:15.330> terraria<00:00:15.690> but<00:00:15.780> then

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
top-down minecraft or terraria but then

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.779 
top-down minecraft or terraria but then
becomes<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.619> completely<00:00:17.010> different<00:00:17.220> game<00:00:17.460> very

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
becomes a completely different game very

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.700 
becomes a completely different game very
very<00:00:17.850> quickly<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:19.199> again<00:00:19.470> we're<00:00:19.560> going<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
very quickly so again we're going to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.050 
very quickly so again we're going to
avoid<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.160> campaign<00:00:20.520> which<00:00:20.670> has<00:00:20.699> sort<00:00:20.970> of

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
avoid the campaign which has sort of

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.090 
avoid the campaign which has sort of
story<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.480> tutorial<00:00:21.960> kind<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.320> things<00:00:22.529> and

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
story and tutorial kind of things and

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.830 
story and tutorial kind of things and
it's<00:00:23.220> done<00:00:23.340> pretty<00:00:23.519> well<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:24.420> we're<00:00:24.750> gonna

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
it's done pretty well but we're gonna

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.029 
it's done pretty well but we're gonna
start<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.170> base<00:00:25.320> game<00:00:25.500> one<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.740> things<00:00:25.920> I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.310 
although I'm curious maybe I should put
the<00:00:59.609> Train<00:00:59.850> segmentation<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.629> very<00:01:01.079> high

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
the Train segmentation like very high

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.139 
the Train segmentation like very high
just<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.129> looks<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.370> let's

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
just to see what it looks like let's

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.759 
just to see what it looks like let's
let's<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.930> might<00:01:04.049> not<00:01:04.170> keep<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.619> map

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
let's do that we might not keep that map

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.929 
let's do that we might not keep that map
but<00:01:04.979> I'm<00:01:05.070> quite<00:01:05.250> curious<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
but I'm quite curious to see what it

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.080 
but I'm quite curious to see what it
looks<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> curiosity<00:01:08.090> I'm

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
looks like just out of curiosity I'm

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.370 
looks like just out of curiosity I'm
gonna<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.659> broken<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.110> train

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
gonna be like really broken up train

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.140 
gonna be like really broken up train
broken<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.799> with<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:13.909> thank<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.060> don't

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.100 
broken up with what thank you I don't
need<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.560> it<00:01:16.560> looks<00:01:17.750> not<00:01:18.750> all<00:01:18.930> that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
need that it looks not all that

need that it looks not all that
different<00:01:19.470> honestly<00:01:21.110> it's<00:01:22.110> not<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.320> this

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
different honestly it's not in this

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.039 
different honestly it's not in this
particular<00:01:22.590> area<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.570> we<00:01:24.570> were<00:01:24.720> plopped<00:01:24.990> down

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
particular area so we were plopped down

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.510 
particular area so we were plopped down
an<00:01:25.229> area<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.530> actually<00:01:25.799> has<00:01:25.890> no<00:01:26.100> resources

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
an area that actually has no resources

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.760 
an area that actually has no resources
immediately<00:01:27.479> where<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.720> are<00:01:27.869> there's<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.500> tiny

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
immediately where we are there's a tiny

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.940 
immediately where we are there's a tiny
bit<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.070> coal<00:01:29.340> over<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:30.409> there's<00:01:31.409> some<00:01:31.710> iron

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
bit of coal over there there's some iron

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.420 
bit of coal over there there's some iron
or<00:01:32.310> copper<00:01:33.090> lots<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.720> copper<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.290> south

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
just a few drop it in the output box and

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.390 
just a few drop it in the output box and
then<00:03:31.260> load<00:03:32.260> in<00:03:32.410> some<00:03:32.440> coal<00:03:32.800> into<00:03:32.980> our<00:03:33.160> drill

then load in some coal into our drill
now<00:03:34.000> we<00:03:34.060> can<00:03:34.240> get<00:03:34.330> regular<00:03:34.570> cold<00:03:35.020> dumps<00:03:35.380> into

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
now we can get regular cold dumps into

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.780 
now we can get regular cold dumps into
there<00:03:35.950> I'm<00:03:36.070> gonna<00:03:36.160> go<00:03:36.310> ahead<00:03:36.550> and<00:03:36.700> like

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.460 

now<00:03:53.510> what<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.840> interesting<00:03:54.020> about<00:03:54.320> the

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
now what is interesting about the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.080 
now what is interesting about the
campaign<00:03:54.800> are<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.040> automatic<00:03:55.280> attacks<00:03:55.880> and

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
campaign are the automatic attacks and

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.280 
campaign are the automatic attacks and
I'm<00:03:56.150> one<00:03:56.240> of<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.360> things<00:03:56.510> I<00:03:56.630> don't<00:03:56.690> like<00:03:56.990> isn't

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
I'm one of the things I don't like isn't

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.420 
I'm one of the things I don't like isn't
it<00:03:57.380> currently<00:03:57.770> in<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:57.980> free<00:03:58.190> play<00:03:58.400> mode

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
it currently in the free play mode

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.310 
it currently in the free play mode
there's<00:03:59.000> not<00:03:59.210> like<00:03:59.390> waves<00:03:59.660> of<00:03:59.870> enemies<00:04:00.140> that

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
there's not like waves of enemies that

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.530 
there's not like waves of enemies that
come<00:04:00.530> every<00:04:00.860> night<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.310> I<00:04:02.030> think<00:04:02.270> that<00:04:02.390> does

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
come every night and I think that does

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.450 
come every night and I think that does
make<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.780> bit<00:04:03.080> of<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.260> weaker<00:04:03.620> game<00:04:03.830> like<00:04:04.190> we<00:04:04.340> can

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
make a bit of a weaker game like we can

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.950 
make a bit of a weaker game like we can
go<00:04:04.580> out<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.760> these<00:04:04.850> camps<00:04:05.180> but<00:04:05.450> there's<00:04:05.840> not

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
go out to these camps but there's not

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.300 
go out to these camps but there's not
the<00:04:06.080> same<00:04:06.260> sort<00:04:06.440> of<00:04:06.500> incentive<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:06.980> get<00:04:07.220> up

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
the same sort of incentive to get up

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.590 
the same sort of incentive to get up
your<00:04:07.430> defenses<00:04:07.850> early<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.210> doesn't<00:04:08.270> let<00:04:08.510> you

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
your defenses early it doesn't let you

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.100 
your defenses early it doesn't let you
just<00:04:08.810> like<00:04:08.959> build<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:09.830> building<00:04:10.640> is<00:04:10.730> good<00:04:11.110> all

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
just like build and building is good all

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.240 
just like build and building is good all
right<00:04:12.260> it's<00:04:12.380> now<00:04:12.500> we've<00:04:12.620> got<00:04:12.770> enough<00:04:13.010> for<00:04:13.190> a

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
right it's now we've got enough for a

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.280 
right it's now we've got enough for a
few<00:04:13.430> of<00:04:13.520> those<00:04:13.720> what<00:04:14.720> we<00:04:14.750> really<00:04:14.959> want<00:04:15.200> there

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290

even a huge pile we're gonna want to
find<00:04:43.669> a<00:04:43.760> bigger<00:04:44.030> resource<00:04:44.510> of<00:04:44.660> it<00:04:44.780> somewhere

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
get some iron bars and then we can set

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.780 
get some iron bars and then we can set
up<00:04:57.290> some<00:04:57.500> miners<00:04:57.860> over<00:04:58.130> here<00:04:58.340> as<00:04:58.400> well<00:04:58.550> keep

with some coal and some more iron bits

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.120 
with some coal and some more iron bits
let<00:05:21.229> that<00:05:21.380> process<00:05:21.620> for<00:05:21.979> a<00:05:22.010> little<00:05:22.190> while

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
let that process for a little while

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.610 
let that process for a little while
watch<00:05:25.130> a<00:05:25.220> champ<00:05:26.110> really<00:05:27.110> hard<00:05:27.290> to<00:05:27.380> see<00:05:27.500> without

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
watch a champ really hard to see without

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.800 
watch a champ really hard to see without
being<00:05:27.710> full<00:05:28.100> screen<00:05:28.340> what<00:05:29.330> are<00:05:29.419> the<00:05:29.510> things<00:05:29.690> I

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
being full screen what are the things I

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.150 
being full screen what are the things I
could<00:05:29.990> do<00:05:30.110> actually<00:05:30.290> is<00:05:30.530> restart<00:05:30.979> the<00:05:31.100> stream

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
could do actually is restart the stream

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.060 
could do actually is restart the stream
in<00:05:31.640> 1080p<00:05:32.570> for<00:05:33.080> this<00:05:33.200> game<00:05:33.410> I<00:05:33.560> think<00:05:33.919> that

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
in 1080p for this game I think that

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.500 
in 1080p for this game I think that
would<00:05:34.160> actually<00:05:34.430> be<00:05:34.520> a<00:05:34.550> big<00:05:34.850> win<00:05:35.060> because<00:05:35.270> it's

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
would actually be a big win because it's

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.850 
would actually be a big win because it's
low<00:05:35.690> on<00:05:35.840> motion<00:05:36.200> let<00:05:36.320> me<00:05:36.410> go<00:05:36.500> and<00:05:36.590> do<00:05:36.680> that

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
low on motion let me go and do that

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.600 
low on motion let me go and do that
we're<00:05:36.950> gonna<00:05:37.040> take<00:05:37.190> down<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.400> stream

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
we're gonna take down the stream

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.780 
we're gonna take down the stream
temporarily<00:05:38.000> we'll<00:05:38.300> be<00:05:38.419> right<00:05:38.570> back
