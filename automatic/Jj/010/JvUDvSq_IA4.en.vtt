just here's a mega-structure jig 78 you
know<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.789> like<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.570> faster<00:00:37.170> fall<00:00:37.379> this<00:00:37.559> time

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
fish in it you'll actually see the bait

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.710 
fish in it you'll actually see the bait
fish<00:01:25.830> start<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.370> kind<00:01:26.550> of<00:01:26.700> come<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.360> towards

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
fish start to kind of come up towards

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.600 
fish start to kind of come up towards
you<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.830> almost<00:01:28.980> like<00:01:29.190> it<00:01:29.340> pulls

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
you and it's almost like it pulls

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.670 
you and it's almost like it pulls
everything<00:01:30.030> closer<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.410> kind<00:01:31.590> of

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
everything closer to you and it kind of

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.310 
everything closer to you and it kind of
you<00:01:32.550> know<00:01:32.610> kind<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.150> activates<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> fish<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you know kind of activates the fish and

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.540 
you know kind of activates the fish and
make<00:01:34.470> some<00:01:34.650> start<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.160> think<00:01:35.370> about

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
make some start one to think about

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.180 
make some start one to think about
feeding<00:01:35.820> because<00:01:36.320> it's<00:01:37.320> fall<00:01:37.560> time<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:38.010> year<00:01:38.130> I

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
feeding because it's fall time of year I

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.070 
feeding because it's fall time of year I
mean<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.910> can<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.210> tough<00:01:39.480> you<00:01:39.900> know<00:01:40.350> it's

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
mean it it can be tough you know it's

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.570 
mean it it can be tough you know it's
you<00:01:43.080> can<00:01:43.230> get<00:01:43.410> on<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.740> them<00:01:43.890> by<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.130> same<00:01:44.340> time

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
you can get on to them by the same time

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.630 
you can get on to them by the same time
you<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:44.910> you<00:01:44.940> can<00:01:45.210> grind<00:01:45.480> around<00:01:45.870> and<00:01:46.640> you

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
you know you can grind around and you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.060 
you know you can grind around and you
know<00:01:47.760> and<00:01:47.940> kind<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.180> junk<00:01:48.420> fish<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.860> it's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
know and kind of junk fish and and it's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.190 
know and kind of junk fish and and it's
it's<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.400> tough<00:01:50.610> time<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.970> year<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.630> guess

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
it's a tough time of year but I guess

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.810 
it's a tough time of year but I guess
the<00:01:52.320> main<00:01:52.350> thing<00:01:52.530> would<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:53.010> is<00:01:53.160> try<00:01:53.550> to<00:01:53.580> find

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the main thing would be is try to find

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.700 
the main thing would be is try to find
the<00:01:53.940> bait<00:01:54.120> see<00:01:54.540> how<00:01:54.720> far<00:01:54.990> back<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.410> creek

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the bait see how far back in the creek

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.650 
the bait see how far back in the creek
say<00:01:55.890> our<00:01:56.070> roots<00:01:56.730> are<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.030> mouse<00:01:57.210> if

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
say our roots are on the mouse if

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.420 
say our roots are on the mouse if
they're<00:01:57.870> halfway<00:01:58.080> back<00:01:58.380> or<00:01:58.740> sometimes

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
they're halfway back or sometimes

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.670 
they're halfway back or sometimes
they're<00:01:59.760> already<00:02:00.050> as<00:02:01.050> far<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.620> go

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
they're already as far as you can go

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.140 
they're already as far as you can go
back<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.250> there<00:02:02.370> and<00:02:02.430> then<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:02.940> really

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
back in there and then you can really

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.570 
back in there and then you can really
get<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.450> work<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.810> them<00:02:03.990> but<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:05.340> know<00:02:05.460> it's

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
get to work on them but you know it's

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.920 
get to work on them but you know it's
all<00:02:05.700> about<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.000> bait<00:02:06.150> fish<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.540> time<00:02:06.600> of
