some of the advantages of dual clutch

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.850 
some of the advantages of dual clutch
transmission<00:00:12.000> are<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.320> gives<00:00:13.350> the<00:00:13.680> rider

modes a normal Drive mode which is like
an<00:00:31.020> economy<00:00:31.439> mode<00:00:31.619> then<00:00:32.099> you've<00:00:32.309> got<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> sport

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
an economy mode then you've got a sport

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.299 
an economy mode then you've got a sport
mode<00:00:33.089> which<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.600> really<00:00:33.929> good<00:00:34.499> fun<00:00:34.769> to<00:00:35.129> ride

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
mode which is really good fun to ride

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.040 
mode which is really good fun to ride
and<00:00:35.339> it<00:00:35.789> lifts<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.510> actual<00:00:36.870> performance

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and it lifts the actual performance

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.009 
and it lifts the actual performance
level<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.100> then<00:00:38.819> you've<00:00:38.969> got<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.269> manual

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
level and then you've got a manual

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.569 
level and then you've got a manual
transmission<00:00:40.319> mode<00:00:40.920> which<00:00:41.069> means<00:00:41.249> that<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
transmission mode which means that the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.969 
transmission mode which means that the
rider<00:00:41.789> then<00:00:41.999> controls<00:00:42.449> the<00:00:43.139> gear<00:00:43.350> changes<00:00:43.859> as

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:43.979 
rider then controls the gear changes as

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:44.959 
rider then controls the gear changes as
and<00:00:44.159> when<00:00:44.249> he<00:00:44.429> wants<00:00:44.760> to

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
and when he wants to

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.899 
and when he wants to
so<00:00:45.809> all<00:00:45.929> intents<00:00:46.229> and<00:00:46.289> purposes<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.489> same

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
so all intents and purposes is the same

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.629 
so all intents and purposes is the same
as<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.569> normal<00:00:48.899> gearbox<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.979> manual<00:00:50.429> bike

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:50.639 
as a normal gearbox in the manual bike

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:52.729 
as a normal gearbox in the manual bike
the<00:00:51.449> only<00:00:51.659> difference<00:00:52.019> is<00:00:52.229> that<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.469> don't

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the only difference is that you don't

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.559 
the only difference is that you don't
have<00:00:52.979> mughelli<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.209> don't<00:00:54.359> have<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:54.569 
have mughelli but you don't have a

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:57.439 
have mughelli but you don't have a
clutch<00:00:54.809> lever<00:00:55.670> but<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.940> do<00:00:57.089> have<00:00:57.299> it

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
clutch lever but what you do have it

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.719 
clutch lever but what you do have it
through<00:00:57.989> different<00:00:58.319> drive<00:00:58.920> modes<00:00:58.949> which

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
through different drive modes which

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.299 
through different drive modes which
actually<00:01:00.149> then<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:01.319> rider<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.769> choose<00:01:02.039> what

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
actually then the rider can choose what

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.820 
actually then the rider can choose what

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
Modi wants to be and the bike just does

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.820 
Modi wants to be and the bike just does
the<00:01:05.010> rest<00:01:05.190> really

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.670 

and<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:10.420> demote<00:01:10.750> shifting<00:01:11.320> is<00:01:11.440> fully

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
and the demote shifting is fully

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.360 
and the demote shifting is fully
electronically<00:01:12.610> controlled<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.830> is<00:01:14.980> focused

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
electronically controlled it is focused

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.570 
electronically controlled it is focused
on<00:01:15.460> comfortable<00:01:16.090> riding<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.870> D<00:01:17.050> mode<00:01:17.260> is

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
on comfortable riding the D mode is

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.630 
on comfortable riding the D mode is
basically<00:01:18.580> an<00:01:19.950> economy<00:01:20.950> mode<00:01:21.160> which<00:01:21.400> means

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
basically an economy mode which means

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.830 
basically an economy mode which means
that<00:01:21.850> if<00:01:21.910> you're<00:01:22.030> riding<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.300> the<00:01:22.390> motorway<00:01:22.780> it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
that if you're riding on the motorway it

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.110 
that if you're riding on the motorway it
would<00:01:23.020> change<00:01:23.320> through<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.340> gearbox<00:01:24.700> as

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
would change through the gearbox as

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.910 
would change through the gearbox as
quickly<00:01:25.420> as<00:01:25.780> possible<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:26.410> give<00:01:26.560> you<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.740> best

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
quickly as possible to give you the best

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.460

economy<00:01:27.400> with<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.730> smoothest<00:01:28.470> ride

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
economy with the smoothest ride

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.760 
economy with the smoothest ride
basically<00:01:32.640> s<00:01:33.640> mode<00:01:34.000> also<00:01:34.330> fully<00:01:34.810> controlled

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
basically s mode also fully controlled

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.490 
basically s mode also fully controlled
by<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:35.980> ECU<00:01:36.460> it<00:01:37.270> is<00:01:37.420> more<00:01:37.600> targeted<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:38.140> sports
