these other cool features that they

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.530 
these other cool features that they
thought<00:03:51.250> of<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.459> really<00:03:51.700> usable<00:03:52.120> features

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
thought of a really usable features

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.970 
thought of a really usable features
they're<00:03:52.720> not<00:03:52.840> just<00:03:53.020> there<00:03:53.319> to<00:03:53.350> be<00:03:53.769> there

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
they're not just there to be there

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.110 
they're not just there to be there
they're<00:03:54.130> actually<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.550> boost<00:03:54.819> is<00:03:55.000> an

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
they're actually the boost is an

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.550 
they're actually the boost is an
essential<00:03:55.630> feature<00:03:55.930> where<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.290> want<00:03:56.470> to

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
essential feature where you want to

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.890 
essential feature where you want to
boost<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:57.040> lead<00:03:57.280> or<00:03:57.550> use<00:03:57.790> like<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:57.970> pseudo<00:03:58.510> third

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
boost a lead or use like a pseudo third

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.780 
boost a lead or use like a pseudo third
channel<00:03:59.349> also<00:04:00.010> in<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.250> back<00:04:00.459> there's<00:04:00.730> a

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
channel also in the back there's a

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.120 
channel also in the back there's a
little<00:04:01.110> design<00:04:02.110> that's<00:04:02.380> really<00:04:02.620> cool<00:04:02.890> it's<00:04:03.010> a

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
little design that's really cool it's a

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.759 
little design that's really cool it's a
dark<00:04:03.580> bright<00:04:03.880> switch<00:04:04.360> for<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.959> reverb<00:04:05.319> so<00:04:05.680> in

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
dark bright switch for the reverb so in

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.559 
dark bright switch for the reverb so in
the<00:04:05.860> bright<00:04:06.069> mode<00:04:06.310> it's<00:04:06.580> essentially<00:04:07.330> more

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
the bright mode it's essentially more

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.780 
the bright mode it's essentially more
like<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.810> studio<00:04:08.319> clean<00:04:08.799> reverb<00:04:09.160> but<00:04:09.580> in<00:04:09.670> the

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
like a studio clean reverb but in the

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.030 
like a studio clean reverb but in the
dark<00:04:10.090> mode<00:04:10.390> it'll<00:04:10.840> incorporate<00:04:11.620> some

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
dark mode it'll incorporate some

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.280 
dark mode it'll incorporate some
artifacts<00:04:12.730> emulating<00:04:13.480> what<00:04:13.720> goes<00:04:13.870> on<00:04:14.019> in<00:04:14.200> a

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
artifacts emulating what goes on in a

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.259 
artifacts emulating what goes on in a
spring<00:04:14.650> reverb<00:04:14.860> to<00:04:15.190> get<00:04:15.310> more<00:04:15.459> of<00:04:15.549> that<00:04:15.580> more

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
spring reverb to get more of that more

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.750 
spring reverb to get more of that more
