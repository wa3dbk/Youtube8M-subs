he<00:00:30.740> really<00:00:31.070> needs<00:00:31.370> to<00:00:31.490> put<00:00:31.670> this<00:00:31.790> frame<00:00:32.029> on<00:00:32.180> the

he really needs to put this frame on the
board

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.060 

I<00:00:36.700> think<00:00:37.210> he<00:00:37.330> just<00:00:37.360> tried<00:00:37.780> to<00:00:38.010> attempt<00:00:39.010> to

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
I think he just tried to attempt to

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.740 
I think he just tried to attempt to
nudge<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.550> pink<00:00:39.760> of<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:39.970> cushion<00:00:40.420> there<00:00:40.600> but

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
nudge the pink of the cushion there but

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.110 
nudge the pink of the cushion there but
the<00:00:41.470> priority<00:00:41.770> was<00:00:42.250> to<00:00:42.280> get<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:42.640> yellow<00:00:42.760> safe

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
the priority was to get the yellow safe

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.320 
the priority was to get the yellow safe
which<00:00:43.420> he<00:00:43.630> has<00:00:43.930> done<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.370> these<00:00:45.580> are<00:00:45.640> always

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
which he has done and these are always

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.120 
which he has done and these are always
awkward<00:00:46.510> when<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:46.990> object<00:00:47.110> ball<00:00:47.470> is<00:00:47.620> tight<00:00:47.920> on

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
awkward when the object ball is tight on

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.950 
awkward when the object ball is tight on
the<00:00:48.220> cushion<00:00:48.520> you've<00:00:49.300> got<00:00:49.450> to<00:00:49.600> avoid<00:00:49.750> the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
the cushion you've got to avoid the

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.120 
the cushion you've got to avoid the
double<00:00:50.080> kiss<00:00:50.440> ah

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
not too bad there's no way mark will be

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.650 
not too bad there's no way mark will be
attempting<00:01:00.200> a<00:01:00.380> pot<00:01:00.590> here<00:01:00.860> we'll<00:01:01.010> just<00:01:01.220> be

I know Sullivan's percentage just edges

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.649 
I know Sullivan's percentage just edges
a<00:02:18.219> little<00:02:18.250> higher<00:02:18.700> when<00:02:18.909> he<00:02:19.000> puts<00:02:19.180> his<00:02:19.239> mind<00:02:19.329> to

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
a little higher when he puts his mind to

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.140 
a little higher when he puts his mind to
it<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:20.200> all<00:02:20.349> know<00:02:20.560> tactically<00:02:21.549> he's<00:02:21.879> up<00:02:22.030> there

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
it we all know tactically he's up there

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:31.670 
it we all know tactically he's up there
with<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.420> very<00:02:22.629> best

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.800 

yes<00:02:32.549> indeed<00:02:32.790> he<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.180> he's<00:02:33.359> had<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.629> learn<00:02:33.750> that

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
yes indeed he is he's had to learn that

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.330 
yes indeed he is he's had to learn that
side<00:02:34.200> as<00:02:34.379> well<00:02:34.530> as<00:02:34.650> indie<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.040> think<00:02:35.219> that's

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
side as well as indie and I think that's

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.759 
side as well as indie and I think that's
