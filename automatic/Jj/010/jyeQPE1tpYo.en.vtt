00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820
 Well, talk to Alan and I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.180
 of how to make an automatic door in 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.280
 minecraft pocket 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:20.950
 and 0.8 point 1 still does not read the 0.9 point 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.950
 0 and I look forward many 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.360
 well this automatic door will serve you 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.360
 for your 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.070
 for example if you take more steps 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:42.570
 well you can serve them well let's start 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.050
 first they need to dig depending 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.950
 how much they want the length and I'm going to 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.950
 make this long 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.510
 how deep they want 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.070
 Y 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.159
 we will need 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.430
 you do not do it to the height that 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.540
 want to the depth they want and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.630
 as long as they want 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:24.649
 we will also need cactus sand 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.649
 and signs 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.210
 let's put this here we have to 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.240
 cut that here 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.240
 these two should say yes 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 after 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.010
 we put up signs 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.340
 and ready 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.340
 It must be like this 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.049
 now 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.560
 by in blocks of 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.560
 sand 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.950
 and they leave so alone now you by 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.580
 example begin to make their 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.580
 structures 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.160
 where 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.160
 and that's it 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.459
 can be two parts for example 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:43.430
 that they only have to break this block 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:47.950
 of ground grass and that sand 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.950
 that sand and we make videos 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.590
 and this here they break that block and that the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.400
 sand 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.400
 or the next 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.620
 it's a little bit more designed nothing 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:10.310
 more you put it 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.310
 A) Yes 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.650
 put the sand 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.330
 and ready there comes at your door 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.010
 automatic 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.010
 they can make it bigger 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.800
 as you want and I think that 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.050
 that's all 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.520
 I hope you have served them 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.820
 something this 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.150
 and then if you want more tutorials videos 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:45.280
 gameplays who likes to share and
