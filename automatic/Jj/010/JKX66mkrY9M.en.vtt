00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.450
 This scene is hard to bear 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.190
 that an old woman in a bremer 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.059
 nursing home so inhumane 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.070
 was treated 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.440
 here is the proof for the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.660
 Most of it remains unimaginable too 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.430
 marco weinhardt is stunned since 15 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.439
 years, the caretaker works with 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.029
 people in need of care together and 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.340
 attaches importance to a respectful approach 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.850
 the white see me totally shocking 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.280
 that you can get carried away 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.469
 Residents so the hardware to tackle 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.090
 but apparently there is mistreatment and 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.280
 neglect in the nursing home no 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.170
 bremer single case in the forums of 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.480
 current hour report audience of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.219
 your experiences 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.989
 this way, for example, perfectly fitting 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.270
 Dentures at meals not 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.760
 used or disappear altogether 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.010
 Consequence person can not chew 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.350
 does not lose weight and one 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.969
 another spectator writes last month 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.190
 has a resident in supervised living 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.809
 a suicide attempt was made in 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.519
 comatose condition of the railway 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.990
 responsible nurse discovered 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.360
 the farewell letter from the resident 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.799
 plugged in and found the lady 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.229
 is sleeping 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.360
 also Peter vien head of dorothee 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.310
 Soul House in Dusseldorf is shocked 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.350
 Although he considers the incidents from bremen to be 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.479
 an individual case but he also knows that 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.850
 more and more unqualified forces in the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.060
 be altenpflege used even 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.180
 funded by the federal agency for work 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.400
 women had made the good work 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.630
 Schlecker over the expected without 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.450
 Another thing is about the care of the elderly 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.250
 and he also does a care assistant 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.299
 so here so dementia with dementia 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.579
 people to work 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.189
 that is a social trend 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.650
 just like that 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.780
 is assumed and that does not fit 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.700
 marianne hofer, however , with her 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.770
 housing and caretaker marquardt 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.770
 fully satisfied only one thing bothers her 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.290
 but it lacks qualified 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.580
 forces are too few can be trained 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.830
 And the nursing homes have to be on the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.070
 cost to look 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.040
 State Secretary of Health Barbara 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.450
 Steffen calls for rethinking 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.180
 I think we need completely different people 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.700
 Solution We have to get away from today 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.760
 structure we have to whole 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.370
 other neighborhood structures 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.770
 situation where people have much more in their 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.200
 own environment in their social 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.090
 contacts can also live and live 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.840
 If you care and need support 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.120
 to have 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.040
 but until new structures actually do 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.080
 so long do the inhabitants of 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.730
 nursing homes optimally cared for and before 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.800
 overrun by the person protected 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.450
 become experienced nurses like marco 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.650
 werner retire when they are 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.300
 situations over the head grow 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.019
 When I realize I come the situation 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.070
 maybe not anymore 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.500
 can control 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.000
 because for me the resident I say 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.670
 now need a short break 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.650
 break is about colleagues asking if he 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.410
 since my activities can take over for 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.120
 moment most caregivers 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.220
 deserve respect and respect for 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.900
 her difficult job finds that too 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.880
 in the internet comments of ours 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.459
 viewers Karin writes about the 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.170
 Nurse of her 93 year old mother me 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.160
 I admired the mostly young people 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.080
 with which patience and friendliness 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.550
 they dealt with the inhabitants 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.620
 Temporarily prevailed there too 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.870
 lack of staff but the friendliness 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.820
 stayed that way, so would marianne 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.410
 hofer about marco wahlers write 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.540
 On his side she is looking forward to her 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.920
 afternoon coffee the kroll from bremen 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.920
 are here very far away
