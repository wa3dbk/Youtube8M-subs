00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
so yes I'm starting with this position

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.220 
so yes I'm starting with this position
as<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.660> can<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:17.300> just<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:19.020> rough

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
as you can see this is just the rough

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.300 
as you can see this is just the rough
really<00:00:19.680> rough<00:00:19.859> sketch<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:21.920> I'm<00:00:22.920> going<00:00:23.220> to

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
really rough sketch and I'm going to

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.330 
really rough sketch and I'm going to
show<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.670> how<00:00:24.590> this<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.980> going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.310> change

2 eating this stuff or eating the rough
sketch<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.840> make<00:00:40.730> which<00:00:41.730> fix<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.510> mistakes

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
sketch to make which fix the mistakes

sketch to make which fix the mistakes
and<00:00:43.910> or<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.270> arm<00:00:45.539> here<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.879> little<00:00:48.210> bit

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
and or this arm here is it a little bit

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:59.450 
and or this arm here is it a little bit
applying<00:00:51.559> rough<00:00:52.820> details<00:00:56.059> more<00:00:57.059> um<00:00:58.460> detailed

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
applying rough details more um detailed

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.510 
applying rough details more um detailed
or<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.910> guess<00:01:00.660> call<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.039> detailed

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
or I guess call this the detailed

the<00:01:06.299> layers<00:01:06.650> or<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.460> rough<00:01:08.670> sketch<00:01:08.970> we're

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the layers or the rough sketch we're

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.469 
the layers or the rough sketch we're
done<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.799> simple<00:01:12.049> pencils<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:14.479> practically

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
done with simple pencils and practically

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.609 
done with simple pencils and practically
I<00:01:15.509> know<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:17.400> or<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.939> last<00:01:18.150> layer<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:19.020> or

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
I know this one or the last layer is or

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.890 
I know this one or the last layer is or
the<00:01:19.830> last<00:01:20.009> um<00:01:22.460> lining<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.729> kind<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.450> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the last um lining was kind of like to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.499 
the last um lining was kind of like to
put<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.799> details<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.750> give<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.590> look

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
put on the details and to give a look

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.140 
put on the details and to give a look
before<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:31.369> before<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.670> inking<00:01:33.180> process

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
cleaning up the rough details and just

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.920 
cleaning up the rough details and just
take<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> look<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:42.000> there's<00:01:42.270> something<00:01:42.659> that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
take a look if there's something that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.030 
take a look if there's something that
needs<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.770> edited<00:01:44.399> or<00:01:44.850> something<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
needs to be edited or something and

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.680 
needs to be edited or something and
finally<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.840> another

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
finally just another

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
in King I want to inking that lining

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.700 
in King I want to inking that lining
Blair<00:01:54.980> with<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.850> mechanical<00:01:56.480> pencil<00:01:57.260> to<00:01:57.440> see

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
Blair with the mechanical pencil to see

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.950 
Blair with the mechanical pencil to see
how<00:01:58.010> it<00:01:58.220> looks<00:01:58.510> you<00:01:59.510> see<00:01:59.660> the<00:01:59.780> difference

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
how it looks you see the difference

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.610 
how it looks you see the difference
between<00:02:00.350> this<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:00.830> this<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.910> know<00:02:02.720> I<00:02:03.080> had

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
between this and this you know I had

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
them what um the same exact thing except

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.500 
them what um the same exact thing except
that<00:02:08.960> here<00:02:09.500> all<00:02:10.100> I<00:02:10.130> did<00:02:10.369> was<00:02:10.610> just<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.330> rough

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
that here all I did was just the rough

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.620 
that here all I did was just the rough
drawings<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.800> rough<00:02:13.010> details<00:02:13.520> this<00:02:14.240> here

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
drawings and the rough details this here

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.820 
drawings and the rough details this here
I<00:02:14.900> gave<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.800> drawing<00:02:16.330> more<00:02:17.330> details<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.200> you

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
I gave the drawing more details and you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.350 
I gave the drawing more details and you
see<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.130> one<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.430> not<00:02:19.550> really<00:02:19.880> cleaned<00:02:20.180> up

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
see this one is not really cleaned up

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.660 
see this one is not really cleaned up
this<00:02:20.660> is<00:02:20.840> much<00:02:21.350> cleaner<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:22.070> course<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:22.460> one

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
this is much cleaner of course this one

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.550 
this is much cleaner of course this one
will<00:02:22.820> be<00:02:22.940> ink<00:02:23.240> ink<00:02:23.810> later<00:02:24.710> on<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:27.170> yeah

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
will be ink ink later on so yeah

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.920 
will be ink ink later on so yeah
actually<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> position<00:02:29.150> doesn't<00:02:29.360> take<00:02:29.660> more

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
actually the position doesn't take more

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.560 
actually the position doesn't take more
than<00:02:30.080> about<00:02:30.200> 10<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.160> 20<00:02:31.430> minutes<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:32.060> do<00:02:32.210> with

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
than about 10 to 20 minutes to do with

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.030 
than about 10 to 20 minutes to do with
the<00:02:32.780> rough<00:02:32.960> details<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.710> doesn't<00:02:33.950> take

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
the rough details so it doesn't take

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.180 
the rough details so it doesn't take
really<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.430> lot<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.820> time<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.780> at<00:02:35.930> least<00:02:36.260> this

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
really a lot of time but at least this

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.880 
really a lot of time but at least this
was<00:02:37.580> kind<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.120> like<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:38.360> heart<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:39.020> position<00:02:39.800> are

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
was kind of like a heart of position are

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.620 
was kind of like a heart of position are
there<00:02:40.070> some<00:02:40.280> parts<00:02:40.580> which<00:02:40.760> was<00:02:41.000> kind<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.390> hard

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
there some parts which was kind of hard

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.580 
there some parts which was kind of hard
that<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:41.840> practice<00:02:42.320> on<00:02:42.500> like<00:02:43.690> how<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.750> arm<00:02:45.200> is

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
that I practice on like how the arm is

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.320 
that I practice on like how the arm is
going<00:02:45.950> and

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
going and

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.830
