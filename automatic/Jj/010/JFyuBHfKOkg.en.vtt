tips<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.719> get<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.049> guys<00:00:16.170> started<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:17.190> get<00:00:17.340> some

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
tips to get you guys started to get some

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.029 
tips to get you guys started to get some
sound<00:00:17.730> going<00:00:18.119> through<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.740> pretty<00:00:19.740> much<00:00:19.890> to

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
sound going through and pretty much to

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.279 
sound going through and pretty much to
get<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> creative<00:00:20.580> juices<00:00:20.760> flowing<00:00:21.330> alright

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
get the creative juices flowing alright

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.250 
get the creative juices flowing alright
so<00:00:22.529> first<00:00:23.100> tip<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.689> turn<00:00:24.869> off<00:00:25.050> all

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
so first tip I like to just turn off all

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.410 
so first tip I like to just turn off all
the<00:00:25.410> filters<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:26.550> know<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.849> don't<00:00:26.939> really<00:00:27.210> use

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the filters you know we don't really use

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.960 
the filters you know we don't really use
a<00:00:27.449> filter<00:00:27.810> right<00:00:28.140> away<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.220> hear<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
a filter right away we can hear the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.840 
a filter right away we can hear the
natural<00:00:30.529> synthesizer<00:00:33.649> all<00:00:34.649> right<00:00:34.770> second<00:00:35.700> tip

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
natural synthesizer all right second tip

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.350 
natural synthesizer all right second tip
is<00:00:36.030> start<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:36.989> oscillator<00:00:38.239> just<00:00:39.239> like

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
is start with one oscillator just like

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.799 
is start with one oscillator just like
so

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
so

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.470 
so
start<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.980> mixer<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.430> split<00:00:41.790> mode<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
start your mixer in split mode so you

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.940 
start your mixer in split mode so you
can<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.870> hear<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.320> thing<00:00:43.500> at<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> time<00:00:43.739> you

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
can just hear one thing at a time you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.490 
can just hear one thing at a time you
can<00:00:44.219> also<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.940> know<00:00:45.140> toggle<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.260> left

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
can also just you know toggle it left

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.959 
can also just you know toggle it left
and<00:00:46.710> right<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.760> since<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.760> muting<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and right but since I'm just muting a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.939 
and right but since I'm just muting a
whole<00:00:51.510> bunch<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.719> stuff<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.680> leave<00:00:52.829> it

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
whole bunch of stuff you can leave it

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.080 
whole bunch of stuff you can leave it
down<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> center<00:00:55.579> alright<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.760> now<00:00:57.059> you

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
down on the center alright so now you

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.939 
down on the center alright so now you
can<00:00:57.360> choose<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:58.109> kind<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.320> synthesis<00:00:58.770> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
can choose what kind of synthesis you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.610 
can choose what kind of synthesis you
want<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.579> sgt<00:01:00.390> analog<00:01:00.899> sync<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
want you know sgt analog sync and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.770 
want you know sgt analog sync and
whatever<00:01:02.579> whatever<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.539> want<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.750> choose

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
whatever whatever you want to choose

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.320 
whatever whatever you want to choose
mess<00:01:04.409> around<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.030> then<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.270> would

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
mess around with that then you would

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.410 
mess around with that then you would
open<00:01:06.510> up<00:01:07.850> your<00:01:08.850> filter<00:01:09.270> right<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:12.090> know<00:01:12.210> go

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
open up your filter right so you know go

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.300 
open up your filter right so you know go
ahead<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.840> mess<00:01:13.350> around<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.860> so

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
ahead and mess around it like that so

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.200 
ahead and mess around it like that so
choose<00:01:14.880> your<00:01:15.030> synthesis<00:01:16.490> however<00:01:17.490> many

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
choose your synthesis however many

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.219 
choose your synthesis however many
oscillators<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.869> want<00:01:20.299> then<00:01:21.299> go<00:01:21.900> into<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
oscillators you want then go into the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.429 
oscillators you want then go into the
filters<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:24.119> I'm<00:01:24.869> gonna<00:01:24.990> leave<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
filters and I'm gonna leave you to the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.950 
filters and I'm gonna leave you to the
filters<00:01:25.619> off<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:26.820> now<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.150> we're<00:01:27.869> gonna

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
filters off just for now and we're gonna

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.690 
filters off just for now and we're gonna
use<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> wobble<00:01:28.619> effect<00:01:28.710> right<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.549> get

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
use the wobble effect right just to get

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.800 
use the wobble effect right just to get
some<00:01:30.000> cool<00:01:30.630> sounds<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:33.270> notice<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:33.780> I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
some cool sounds going so notice how I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.760 
some cool sounds going so notice how I
move<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.759> nothing's<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.770> what

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
move that up and nothing's going what

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.230 
move that up and nothing's going what
you<00:01:37.890> want<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.460> make<00:01:38.790> sure<00:01:38.820> you're<00:01:39.090> in

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
you want to do is make sure you're in

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.800 
you want to do is make sure you're in
this<00:01:40.280> button<00:01:41.280> right<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.850> click<00:01:42.329> wobble

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
this button right here you click wobble

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.889 
this button right here you click wobble
them<00:01:42.960> out<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:44.329> mess<00:01:45.329> around<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
them out and mess around with the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.870 
them out and mess around with the
oscillator<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.649> let's<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:47.670> something

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
oscillator like let's just do something

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.490 
oscillator like let's just do something
else<00:01:48.119> here<00:01:48.360> I'll<00:01:49.020> use<00:01:49.079> analog<00:01:49.619> sting<00:01:51.500> was

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
else here I'll use analog sting was

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.550 
else here I'll use analog sting was
high-pitched

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
high-pitched

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.340 
high-pitched
all<00:01:55.560> right<00:01:55.970> so<00:01:56.970> we're<00:01:57.870> gonna<00:01:57.930> mess<00:01:58.200> around

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
all right so we're gonna mess around

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.080 
all right so we're gonna mess around
with<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:59.330> little<00:02:00.330> pan<00:02:01.110> pot<00:02:01.440> just<00:02:02.430> know<00:02:02.880> we're

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
with this little pan pot just know we're

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.999 
with this little pan pot just know we're
gonna<00:02:04.160> mimic<00:02:05.160> that<00:02:05.670> kind<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.910> sound<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:07.009> this

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
gonna mimic that kind of sound and this

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.770 
gonna mimic that kind of sound and this
is<00:02:08.490> pretty<00:02:09.450> much<00:02:09.630> right<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:12.720> can

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
is pretty much right here so you can

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.260 
is pretty much right here so you can
find<00:02:13.080> your<00:02:13.200> synths<00:02:13.640> here<00:02:14.640> one<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.090> two

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
find your synths here one and two

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.030 
find your synths here one and two
filters<00:02:15.840> one<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.260> two<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.710> each<00:02:17.690> fader

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
filters one and two and each fader

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.070 
filters one and two and each fader
represents<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:21.150> knob<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.660> there's<00:02:21.870> three

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
represents the knob so there's three

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.110 
represents the knob so there's three
here<00:02:22.350> there's<00:02:23.040> three<00:02:23.220> here<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.490> from<00:02:23.850> left<00:02:24.060> to

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
here there's three here so from left to

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.880 
here there's three here so from left to
right<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.630> would<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.200> controlling<00:02:25.770> these

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
right I would be controlling these

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.940 
right I would be controlling these
things<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.330> on<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:27.990> forth<00:02:28.230> all<00:02:28.860> right

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
things and so on and so forth all right

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.640 
things and so on and so forth all right
so<00:02:29.100> I'm<00:02:29.160> just<00:02:29.310> gonna<00:02:29.400> move<00:02:29.520> this<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:33.410> right<00:02:34.410> and

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
so I'm just gonna move this up right and

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
so I'm just gonna move this up right and
I'm<00:02:34.980> gonna<00:02:35.070> leave<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.280> somewhere<00:02:35.520> right

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
I'm gonna leave it somewhere right

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.430 
I'm gonna leave it somewhere right
somewhere<00:02:36.330> there<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:38.240> right<00:02:39.240> now<00:02:39.420> my<00:02:39.870> wobbled

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
somewhere there and right now my wobbled

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.640 
somewhere there and right now my wobbled
amount<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.830> set<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.700> sine<00:02:42.180> wave<00:02:42.440> at<00:02:43.440> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
amount is set to a sine wave at the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.590 
amount is set to a sine wave at the
slowest<00:02:44.280> position<00:02:44.730> right<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.270> as<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.050> move<00:02:46.230> up

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
slowest position right so as you move up

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.430 
slowest position right so as you move up
it<00:02:48.600> does<00:02:49.040> change<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.250> time<00:02:50.959> can<00:02:51.959> also<00:02:52.110> see<00:02:52.350> it

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
it does change in time can also see it

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:00.140 
it does change in time can also see it
here<00:02:56.690> right<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:59.280> can<00:02:59.430> also<00:02:59.580> set<00:02:59.820> this<00:02:59.910> up

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
here right and you can also set this up

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.290 
here right and you can also set this up
for<00:03:00.180> let's<00:03:00.840> say<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.050> live<00:03:01.440> or<00:03:02.300> program

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
for let's say a live or program

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.520 
for let's say a live or program
situation<00:03:04.200> where<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.130> would<00:03:05.400> go<00:03:05.519> into<00:03:05.820> this

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
situation where I would go into this

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.000 
situation where I would go into this
wobble<00:03:07.530> knob<00:03:07.860> which<00:03:08.550> looks<00:03:08.880> like<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:10.050> would

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
wobble knob which looks like and I would

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.400 
wobble knob which looks like and I would
so<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.610> would<00:03:11.940> select<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.390> velocity<00:03:12.930> sets<00:03:13.170> knob

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
so I would select the velocity sets knob

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.310 
so I would select the velocity sets knob
position<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.640> depending<00:03:15.300> on<00:03:15.420> how<00:03:15.690> hard<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.140> hit

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
position so depending on how hard I hit

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.690 
position so depending on how hard I hit
if<00:03:16.920> I'm<00:03:17.040> doing<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.550> a<00:03:17.640> live<00:03:17.820> situation

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.930 

it<00:03:21.120> changes<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.260> tempo<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.799> that<00:03:23.549> wobble

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
it changes the tempo of that wobble

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:35.090 
it changes the tempo of that wobble
effect<00:03:32.930> right<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.110> guys<00:03:34.260> pretty<00:03:34.739> much<00:03:34.920> get

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
effect right so you guys pretty much get

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.020 
effect right so you guys pretty much get
the<00:03:35.130> idea<00:03:35.459> but<00:03:35.820> if<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.570> wanted<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.370> do<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.549> in<00:03:38.850> a

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
the idea but if I wanted to do this in a

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.490 
the idea but if I wanted to do this in a
programmable<00:03:40.010> situation<00:03:42.049> which<00:03:43.049> is<00:03:43.200> really

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
programmable situation which is really

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.150 
programmable situation which is really
cool<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.920> would<00:03:44.670> go<00:03:44.820> into<00:03:44.970> my<00:03:45.450> piano<00:03:46.140> roll<00:03:46.350> for

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
cool I would go into my piano roll for

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.620 
cool I would go into my piano roll for
this<00:03:49.400> synthesizer<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.790> let's<00:03:51.360> say<00:03:51.450> if<00:03:51.540> I

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
this synthesizer and let's say if I

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.920 
this synthesizer and let's say if I
wanted<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.080> know<00:03:52.170> C<00:03:52.380> 5<00:03:52.620> whatever<00:03:53.100> C<00:03:54.030> 5<00:03:56.900> we<00:03:57.900> can

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
wanted you know C 5 whatever C 5 we can

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.000 
wanted you know C 5 whatever C 5 we can
definitely<00:03:58.709> change<00:03:58.950> velocity<00:03:59.450> to<00:04:00.450> control

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
definitely change velocity to control

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.350 
definitely change velocity to control
you<00:04:02.010> know<00:04:02.099> how<00:04:02.250> we<00:04:02.310> want<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.760> right<00:04:02.880> so<00:04:03.090> maybe

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
you know how we want it right so maybe

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.640 
you know how we want it right so maybe
in<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.510> beginning<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:03.930> wanted<00:04:04.290> something<00:04:04.500> like

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
in the beginning I wanted something like

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:16.670 
in the beginning I wanted something like
this

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.160 

right<00:04:17.680> so<00:04:17.920> that<00:04:18.670> just<00:04:18.970> makes<00:04:19.600> things<00:04:19.720> so<00:04:19.989> much

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
right so that just makes things so much

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.590 
right so that just makes things so much
easier<00:04:20.310> when<00:04:21.310> we<00:04:21.670> want<00:04:21.850> to<00:04:21.940> change<00:04:22.180> it<00:04:22.330> up<00:04:22.420> in

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
easier when we want to change it up in

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.140 
easier when we want to change it up in
our<00:04:22.720> song<00:04:22.960> right<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.900> next<00:04:26.080> tip<00:04:26.350> that<00:04:26.620> I<00:04:26.800> would

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
our song right the next tip that I would
