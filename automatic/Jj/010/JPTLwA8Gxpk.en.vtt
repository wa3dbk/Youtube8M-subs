before<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.170> light<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.979> reason<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.430> do

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
before you light it the reason you do

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.240 
before you light it the reason you do
this<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:42.150> because<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.780> oil<00:01:43.049> prevents<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.009> wax

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
this is because the oil prevents the wax

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.289 
this is because the oil prevents the wax
from<00:01:44.610> sticking
