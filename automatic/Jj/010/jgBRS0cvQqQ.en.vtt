 descreste of German engineering that 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.420
 we just saw or that we're going to see where 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.190
 where are we going to realize a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.869
 amount of things that people can 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.000
 have in a sturdy car but 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.550
 comfortable we will meet in a 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.960
 minutes where we are going to ride where the 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.060
 mom handle so she finds that 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.700
 bring good to Carlos tell us about the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.280
 engine the amarok engine now we are 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.990
 knowing the new automatic brand that 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.340
 It is a vehicle that has an engine 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.649
 2,000 cubic centimeters and 200 turbo 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.659
 horsepower that has special 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.119
 the automatic brand is a launch 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.860
 totally new where are we going to find 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.780
 a sequential 8-speed box 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.550
 then people can put the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.379
 changes up to 8 speeds towards 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.950
 front also has a box 

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:02.780
 changes 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.340
 where I can put sports for example 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.320
 maps the never good on road I put 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.170
 story accelerated the car pulls me out all its 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.750
 maximum 10 good a fact that I 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.580
 it seemed very curious in the part from where 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.620
 mentions good is a truck like it 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.450
 it says of trocha for is comfortable is that 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.890
 You can also customize in what 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.290
 the air conditioning tell us a 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.390
 little is usually have that is a 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.950
 of the fights with the couple that one puts 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.720
 very cold air and the other person the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.489
 he wants more hot then nothing bad 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.989
 that it's over since the problem the hand 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.459
 that automatic has air 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.709
 vision vision to where I can 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.590
 make the air independent so that the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.280
 person does not suffer hot or cold 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.620
 compared to that of the vital 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.569
 there is one important thing and that is that amarok 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.640
 automatic I do not have to do 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.860
 absolutely nothing to put the 4x4 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.110
 she alone does everything inclusive 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.600
 normally the vans I have to 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.069
 I have to activate the bass to 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.170
 put me on a trail like the one 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.330
 let's see now and in this truck 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.160
 not in that the goal in alone and the 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.050
 car immediately with your computer 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.970
 that is smart he is setting what 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.360
 brake tire so you do not waste 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.920
 the door in that good wheel carlos and a 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.050
 huge problem that we have what 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.700
 the product fines the amarok also 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.160
 comes with solution to the problem they have 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.660
 osores look at us the city 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.820
 every time we see more photomulses is 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.410
 important to know that amaro account 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.910
 with two systems one that has a 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.519
 alerting each other speed me 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.800
 exceeded 60 to 80 what I want 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.480
 schedule the sea ​​or I will have a 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.060
 alert is going to be warning me in a way 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.769
 that they do not leave me or tomorrow to sanction and 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.269
 the other is the cruising speed the 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.100
 truck has cruising speed 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.870
 where I can program in the regional 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.920
 at 80 kilometers of speed she remains 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.440
 sustained that speed 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.150
 good carlos and tell us you have controls 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.829
 that does not have controls in amarok 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.610
 automatic the most complete of the market 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.320
 where 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.810
 I for example today lowering palms 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.790
 simply act I put the control of 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.110
 descent and the truck alone without having 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.660
 that to be touching brake she is going down 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.390
 regulate what it generates generates me that 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.800
 no more brake pads are wasted 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.630
 that I 'm not abusing the pedal 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.760
 brake the cart is settling where 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.740
 you need where you do not need it good and 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.670
 tell us a little about the attraction 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.750
 how the attraction works, the meat is 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.209
 permanently it was working in 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.150
 4x4 and will have to distribute settling the 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.400
 attraction towards the rear wheels to 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.250
 the front wheels there is a data 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.800
 important is that normally in palms 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.000
 or going down from situations where you find 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.590
 a wet 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.660
 the truck tends to draw the tail very 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.390
 easy a normal peak but bitter not 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.130
 I love how it is acting which in 4x4 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.680
 finished that is headache of the 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.560
 curves badly caught in picops good and 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.669
 tell us about social we are going here 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.250
 awesome this truck has butt 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.380
 of speed of 180 kilometers really 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.150
 but I do not advise because here we do not have 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.860
 tracks for those speeds but of all 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.120
 ways the ball van and in a 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.830
 pretty safe truck where 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.870
 next you're going to speed the goal is 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.460
 too comfortable I invite you to 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.320
 german and engines to know her 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.000
 to handle it we have the test 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.760
 drive available for people 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.050
 try it normally a test route 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.090
 a turn around the block they are not going to 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.710
 enjoy come to germany and we know 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.810
 the vehicle in a very situations 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.970
 different where we need to 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.560
 the 4x4 had to strain we have here 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.060
 in colombia the one they want in that 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.080
 call time we have no availability 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.570
 silver white black dark blue 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.979
 dark gray beige we already have a good 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.630
 portfolio for people to
