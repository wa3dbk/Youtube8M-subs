right<00:00:03.310> now<00:00:03.489> I'm<00:00:03.580> going<00:00:03.730> to<00:00:03.790> fire<00:00:04.029> up<00:00:04.210> the<00:00:04.330> topo

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:04.660 
right now I'm going to fire up the topo

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.160 
right now I'm going to fire up the topo
mapping<00:00:05.109> on<00:00:05.200> the<00:00:05.319> garmin<00:00:05.800> montana<00:00:05.939> 600<00:00:06.939> series

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
mapping on the garmin montana 600 series

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.419 
mapping on the garmin montana 600 series
let's<00:00:08.170> start<00:00:08.440> by<00:00:08.559> clicking<00:00:08.769> the<00:00:08.950> map<00:00:09.190> and

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:09.429 
let's start by clicking the map and

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.850 
let's start by clicking the map and
taking<00:00:09.820> a<00:00:09.850> look<00:00:10.000> at<00:00:10.210> the<00:00:10.660> world<00:00:10.960> based<00:00:11.350> map<00:00:11.620> in

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
taking a look at the world based map in

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.670 
taking a look at the world based map in
the<00:00:11.980> unit<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:13.540> is<00:00:13.720> the<00:00:13.840> base<00:00:14.050> map<00:00:14.320> that<00:00:14.500> comes

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
the unit this is the base map that comes

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.859 
the unit this is the base map that comes
in<00:00:14.920> the<00:00:15.010> three<00:00:15.220> units<00:00:15.610> but<00:00:16.390> what<00:00:16.539> you'll<00:00:16.660> find

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
in the three units but what you'll find

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.830 
in the three units but what you'll find
is<00:00:17.080> on<00:00:17.289> the<00:00:17.439> 650<00:00:18.010> T<00:00:18.280> units<00:00:18.670> it<00:00:18.850> will<00:00:18.970> also<00:00:19.240> have

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
is on the 650 T units it will also have

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.520 
is on the 650 T units it will also have
100k<00:00:20.710> topo<00:00:21.220> preloaded<00:00:21.910> in<00:00:22.060> the<00:00:22.180> unit<00:00:22.510> so<00:00:23.320> this

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.530 
100k topo preloaded in the unit so this

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.500 
100k topo preloaded in the unit so this
is<00:00:23.710> how<00:00:23.860> you'll<00:00:24.039> see<00:00:24.310> the<00:00:24.490> map<00:00:24.699> detail<00:00:25.150> on<00:00:25.390> the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
is how you'll see the map detail on the

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.410 
is how you'll see the map detail on the
montana<00:00:25.990> 600<00:00:26.740> and<00:00:26.860> 650<00:00:27.310> units<00:00:27.820> without<00:00:28.060> any

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
montana 600 and 650 units without any

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.140 
montana 600 and 650 units without any
extra<00:00:28.779> mapping<00:00:29.170> and<00:00:29.470> the<00:00:29.680> 650<00:00:30.250> T<00:00:30.550> units<00:00:30.939> will

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
extra mapping and the 650 T units will

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.299 
extra mapping and the 650 T units will
have<00:00:31.180> contour<00:00:31.720> lines<00:00:31.960> of<00:00:32.140> 100k<00:00:32.680> topo

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
have contour lines of 100k topo

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.309 
have contour lines of 100k topo
so<00:00:33.699> you<00:00:33.789> can<00:00:33.940> see<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.269> shading<00:00:34.719> it<00:00:34.809> uses<00:00:35.170> to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:35.319 
so you can see the shading it uses to

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:37.559 
so you can see the shading it uses to
show<00:00:35.499> the<00:00:35.649> mountains<00:00:36.069> around<00:00:36.280> Las<00:00:37.089> Vegas<00:00:37.449> at

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:37.569 
show the mountains around Las Vegas at

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:39.599 
show the mountains around Las Vegas at
the<00:00:37.600> north<00:00:37.809> part<00:00:38.050> of<00:00:38.079> Las<00:00:38.229> Vegas<00:00:38.620> here<00:00:38.829> what<00:00:39.550> I

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
the north part of Las Vegas here what I

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:40.860 
the north part of Las Vegas here what I
want<00:00:39.760> to<00:00:39.850> do<00:00:39.969> is<00:00:40.089> show<00:00:40.300> you<00:00:40.359> how<00:00:40.449> that<00:00:40.719> will

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
want to do is show you how that will

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.599 
want to do is show you how that will
look<00:00:41.019> with<00:00:41.429> 100k<00:00:42.429> and<00:00:43.170> 24k<00:00:44.170> topo<00:00:44.589> let's<00:00:45.339> turn

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
look with 100k and 24k topo let's turn

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:51.090 
look with 100k and 24k topo let's turn
it<00:00:45.729> on<00:00:46.799> there<00:00:47.799> we<00:00:47.889> go<00:00:48.039> and<00:00:48.280> Nabal<00:00:48.639> go<00:00:49.510> back<00:00:50.100> okay

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
it on there we go and Nabal go back okay

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.489 
it on there we go and Nabal go back okay
let's<00:00:51.339> go<00:00:51.729> back<00:00:51.940> to<00:00:52.089> where<00:00:52.239> we<00:00:52.269> started<00:00:52.499> and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:53.499 
let's go back to where we started and

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.259 
let's go back to where we started and
there<00:00:53.769> we<00:00:53.889> have<00:00:54.069> it<00:00:54.190> you<00:00:54.339> can<00:00:54.489> see<00:00:54.699> all<00:00:54.729> this

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
there we have it you can see all this

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:56.789 
there we have it you can see all this
rich<00:00:55.510> black<00:00:55.780> color<00:00:55.809> around<00:00:56.289> here

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
rich black color around here

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.359 
rich black color around here
that's<00:00:57.309> all<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:58.239> 24k<00:00:58.839> topo<00:00:59.379> you<00:00:59.859> can<00:01:00.010> see<00:01:00.249> up

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:00.369 
that's all the 24k topo you can see up

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:01.739 
that's all the 24k topo you can see up
here<00:01:00.399> where<00:01:00.729> the<00:01:00.850> colors<00:01:01.209> are<00:01:01.389> but<00:01:01.539> without

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
here where the colors are but without

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:02.639 
here where the colors are but without
the<00:01:01.989> black<00:01:02.199> blobs

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
the black blobs

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.070 
the black blobs
that's<00:01:03.159> the<00:01:03.339> 100k<00:01:03.699> topo<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.750> then<00:01:04.839> you<00:01:04.960> can

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
that's the 100k topo and then you can

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.800 
that's the 100k topo and then you can
see<00:01:05.260> all<00:01:05.409> this<00:01:05.770> almost<00:01:06.520> grayscale<00:01:07.210> edging

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
see all this almost grayscale edging

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.170 
see all this almost grayscale edging
around<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.200> outside<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:09.190> is<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.580> base<00:01:09.880> map

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
around the outside that is the base map

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.540 
around the outside that is the base map
that<00:01:10.390> comes<00:01:10.570> in<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.900> unit<00:01:11.260> okay<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:12.160> let's

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
that comes in the unit okay so let's

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.040 
that comes in the unit okay so let's
start<00:01:12.790> zooming<00:01:13.030> in<00:01:13.330> and<00:01:13.450> what<00:01:13.570> I<00:01:13.600> want<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.870> show

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
start zooming in and what I want to show

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.220 
start zooming in and what I want to show
you<00:01:14.110> is<00:01:14.350> in<00:01:14.980> between<00:01:15.130> where<00:01:15.550> it<00:01:15.580> says<00:01:16.200> 4400

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
you is in between where it says 4400

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.440 
you is in between where it says 4400
that's<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.040> difference<00:01:18.370> between<00:01:18.430> 100k<00:01:19.210> top

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
that's the difference between 100k top

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.230 
that's the difference between 100k top
on<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.720> top<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:20.080> 24k<00:01:20.860> top<00:01:21.100> on<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.370> bottom<00:01:21.490> so

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
on the top and 24k top on the bottom so

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.000 
on the top and 24k top on the bottom so
let's<00:01:22.420> start<00:01:22.720> zooming<00:01:22.960> in<00:01:23.260> on<00:01:23.320> that<00:01:23.470> area<00:01:23.830> and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
let's start zooming in on that area and

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.070 
let's start zooming in on that area and
take<00:01:24.580> a<00:01:24.610> look<00:01:24.820> at<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.030> contour<00:01:25.420> lines<00:01:25.600> show<00:01:25.900> up

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
take a look at the contour lines show up

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.130 
take a look at the contour lines show up
differently<00:01:26.370> there's<00:01:27.370> 100<00:01:27.850> there's<00:01:28.240> 24k<00:01:28.960> you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
differently there's 100 there's 24k you

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.050 
differently there's 100 there's 24k you
can<00:01:29.290> see<00:01:29.410> the<00:01:29.560> real<00:01:29.830> thick<00:01:30.280> black<00:01:30.610> topo<00:01:30.940> lines

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
can see the real thick black topo lines

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.510 
can see the real thick black topo lines
the<00:01:31.930> reason<00:01:32.230> that's<00:01:32.320> so<00:01:32.440> thick<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.070> black<00:01:33.310> is

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
the reason that's so thick and black is

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.190 
the reason that's so thick and black is
because<00:01:33.790> there's<00:01:33.970> so<00:01:34.210> many<00:01:34.360> lines<00:01:34.660> are<00:01:34.870> in<00:01:34.990> so

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
because there's so many lines are in so

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.050 
because there's so many lines are in so
much<00:01:35.260> detail<00:01:35.560> that's<00:01:36.370> just<00:01:36.580> coming<00:01:36.790> out<00:01:36.940> as

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
much detail that's just coming out as

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.300 
much detail that's just coming out as
one<00:01:37.240> black<00:01:37.540> blob<00:01:37.840> result<00:01:38.770> here<00:01:38.950> you<00:01:39.040> can<00:01:39.160> see

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
one black blob result here you can see

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.190 
one black blob result here you can see
the<00:01:39.370> 100k<00:01:39.700> top<00:01:40.000> is<00:01:40.150> just<00:01:40.360> starting<00:01:40.660> to<00:01:40.750> open<00:01:40.960> up

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
the 100k top is just starting to open up

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.680 
the 100k top is just starting to open up
because<00:01:41.890> there<00:01:42.040> are<00:01:42.130> less<00:01:42.280> lines<00:01:42.610> showing<00:01:43.480> a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
because there are less lines showing a

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.590 
because there are less lines showing a
contour<00:01:44.260> area<00:01:44.820> again<00:01:45.820> you<00:01:45.940> can<00:01:46.090> see<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.360> black

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
contour area again you can see the black

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.810 
contour area again you can see the black
lines<00:01:46.930> a<00:01:47.110> black<00:01:47.290> blob<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.770> 100k<00:01:48.370> is<00:01:48.430> opening

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
lines a black blob and 100k is opening

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.120 
lines a black blob and 100k is opening
up<00:01:48.909> a<00:01:49.000> bit<00:01:49.150> more<00:01:49.360> let's<00:01:50.290> just<00:01:50.470> keep<00:01:50.620> zooming<00:01:50.830> in

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
up a bit more let's just keep zooming in

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.540 
up a bit more let's just keep zooming in
again<00:01:51.550> there<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:53.050> 24k<00:01:53.530> topo<00:01:54.040> just<00:01:54.340> turned

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
again there the 24k topo just turned

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.399 
again there the 24k topo just turned
from<00:01:54.700> black<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:54.940> red<00:01:55.150> and<00:01:55.870> what<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.140> is<00:01:56.260> is

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
from black to red and what that is is

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.260 
from black to red and what that is is
because<00:01:56.500> it's<00:01:56.740> going<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.010> his<00:01:57.159> next<00:01:57.670> level<00:01:58.090> of

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
because it's going to his next level of

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.780 
because it's going to his next level of
a<00:01:58.450> contour<00:01:59.409> line<00:01:59.560> detail<00:01:59.860> so<00:02:00.550> let's<00:02:00.700> keep

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
a contour line detail so let's keep

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.820 
a contour line detail so let's keep
going<00:02:00.850> in<00:02:01.620> there<00:02:02.620> it<00:02:02.740> goes<00:02:02.920> again<00:02:04.770> now<00:02:05.770> you

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
going in there it goes again now you

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.170 
going in there it goes again now you
really<00:02:06.220> start<00:02:06.550> seeing<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.880> difference

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
really start seeing the difference

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.629 
really start seeing the difference
between<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.540> two<00:02:07.690> topics<00:02:08.310> thick<00:02:09.310> thick

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:09.639 
between the two topics thick thick

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.339 
between the two topics thick thick
amount<00:02:09.909> of<00:02:10.090> topographic<00:02:10.869> line<00:02:11.049> here<00:02:11.230> in<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
amount of topographic line here in the

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.500 
amount of topographic line here in the
24<00:02:11.829> and<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.430> hundreds<00:02:12.790> already<00:02:12.909> started<00:02:13.420> to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
24 and the hundreds already started to

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.750 
24 and the hundreds already started to
open<00:02:13.810> right<00:02:13.959> up

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
open right up

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.410 
open right up
keep<00:02:15.420> going<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:17.510> going<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:19.909> here<00:02:20.909> we<00:02:21.000> go<00:02:21.120> take<00:02:21.390> a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
keep going in going in here we go take a

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.660 
keep going in going in here we go take a
look<00:02:21.599> at<00:02:21.689> that<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.170> you've<00:02:22.680> got<00:02:22.829> 100k<00:02:23.280> top<00:02:23.519> at

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
look at that so you've got 100k top at

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.089 
look at that so you've got 100k top at
the<00:02:23.760> top<00:02:23.790> 24<00:02:24.450> at<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.599> bottom<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.409> can<00:02:25.470> see<00:02:25.769> how

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
much detail you have on the 24k and what

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.589 
much detail you have on the 24k and what
you<00:02:29.189> can<00:02:29.310> do<00:02:29.400> with<00:02:29.549> this<00:02:29.640> unit<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.269> can<00:02:30.390> just

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
you can do with this unit is I can just

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.520 
see the elevation I mean at that point
where<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.569> point<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.900> touching<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.319> it's

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
where that point is touching so it's

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.380 
where that point is touching so it's
touching<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.890> contour<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.299> either

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
