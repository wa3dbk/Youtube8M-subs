this<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> boss<00:00:07.020> dd6

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
this is a boss dd6

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.700 
this is a boss dd6
a<00:00:08.250> digital<00:00:08.970> delay<00:00:09.240> pedal<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.780> I'm<00:00:10.349> playing<00:00:10.559> on

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
a digital delay pedal and I'm playing on

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.799 
a digital delay pedal and I'm playing on
a<00:00:10.769> Fender<00:00:11.040> Stratocaster<00:00:11.309> into<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.880> Vox<00:00:12.150> ac30

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
a Fender Stratocaster into a Vox ac30

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:22.810 
a Fender Stratocaster into a Vox ac30
here<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.099> clean<00:00:14.400> signal

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.470 

alright<00:00:23.820> now<00:00:24.029> let's<00:00:24.330> engage<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:25.019> pedal<00:00:25.789> and<00:00:26.789> I

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
alright now let's engage the pedal and I

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.540 
alright now let's engage the pedal and I
have<00:00:28.189> it<00:00:29.189> set<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.740> highest<00:00:31.980> delay

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
have it set on just on the highest delay

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.260 
have it set on just on the highest delay
setting<00:00:32.969> with<00:00:34.399> tapped<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.880> sort<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
setting with tapped in just sort of a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:01:03.950 
setting with tapped in just sort of a
medium<00:00:36.480> delay<00:00:37.309> sound

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.470 

this<00:01:04.960> pedal<00:01:05.200> has<00:01:05.560> pretty<00:01:06.070> basic<00:01:06.340> controls<00:01:07.000> so

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
this pedal has pretty basic controls so

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.960 
this pedal has pretty basic controls so
we<00:01:07.570> can<00:01:07.750> see<00:01:07.960> there's<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.260> level<00:01:09.220> here<00:01:09.520> which<00:01:09.790> is

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
we can see there's a level here which is

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.950 
we can see there's a level here which is
the<00:01:10.180> delay<00:01:10.360> level<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:16.060> feedbacks<00:01:16.540> just

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
the delay level and the feedbacks just

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.460 
the delay level and the feedbacks just
the<00:01:17.080> length<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.620> the<00:01:18.090> trail<00:01:19.090> delay<00:01:19.960> time<00:01:20.230> we

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
the length of the trail delay time we

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.969 
the length of the trail delay time we
can

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.719 

we<00:01:24.979> can<00:01:25.130> manually<00:01:25.490> adjust<00:01:28.210> or<00:01:29.439> we<00:01:30.439> can<00:01:30.649> tap<00:01:31.549> it

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
we can manually adjust or we can tap it

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.590 
we can manually adjust or we can tap it
in<00:01:31.880> with<00:01:32.569> the<00:01:32.770> actual<00:01:33.770> switch<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:35.090> engage<00:01:35.390> our

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
in with the actual switch to engage our

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.130 
in with the actual switch to engage our
tap<00:01:35.869> we<00:01:36.399> hold<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.670> on/off<00:01:37.939> switch<00:01:38.450> for<00:01:38.810> a

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
tap we hold the on/off switch for a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:47.679 
tap we hold the on/off switch for a
couple<00:01:39.740> seconds<00:01:43.509> and<00:01:44.509> hold<00:01:45.469> it<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:47.240> we<00:01:47.539> can

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
couple seconds and hold it and we can

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.419 
couple seconds and hold it and we can
tap<00:01:47.899> our<00:01:48.079> delay<00:01:48.350> which<00:01:48.619> is<00:01:48.770> pretty<00:01:49.189> useful

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
tap our delay which is pretty useful

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.249 
tap our delay which is pretty useful
when<00:01:49.789> you're<00:01:49.909> on<00:01:49.969> stage<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:50.899> then<00:01:51.020> we<00:01:51.109> also

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
when you're on stage and then we also

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.620 
when you're on stage and then we also
have<00:01:51.530> some<00:01:51.740> modes<00:01:51.979> here<00:01:52.340> we<00:01:52.459> got<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.819> 2600

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
have some modes here we got the 2600

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.169 
have some modes here we got the 2600
milliseconds<00:01:54.289> 800<00:01:56.229> 380<00:01:57.579> and<00:01:58.579> we<00:01:58.759> also<00:01:58.909> have

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
milliseconds 800 380 and we also have

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:05.169 
milliseconds 800 380 and we also have
reverse<00:01:59.599> hold<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.860> warp<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:02.509> I'm<00:02:03.429> on<00:02:04.429> the<00:02:04.610> 2600

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
reverse hold and warp so I'm on the 2600

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:11.199 
reverse hold and warp so I'm on the 2600
milliseconds<00:02:06.130> settings<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:09.789> this<00:02:10.789> is<00:02:10.910> a<00:02:10.940> very

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
milliseconds settings and this is a very

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:26.580 
milliseconds settings and this is a very
straight<00:02:11.690> kind<00:02:11.989> of<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.310> just<00:02:13.310> digital<00:02:13.640> too<00:02:14.599> late

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.640 

turn<00:02:27.590> on<00:02:27.709> some<00:02:27.920> overdrive<00:02:28.489> from<00:02:29.500> prints<00:02:30.500> of

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
turn on some overdrive from prints of

00:02:30.650 --> 00:03:26.410 
turn on some overdrive from prints of
tone<00:02:30.890> analog<00:02:31.370> man

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.940 

now<00:03:27.420> let's<00:03:27.660> go<00:03:27.840> over<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:29.120> reverse<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:31.650> we

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
now let's go over to the reverse and we

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:51.520 
now let's go over to the reverse and we
have<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.490> retype<00:03:33.180> our<00:03:33.540> setting

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.509 

we<00:03:52.530> can<00:03:52.709> also<00:03:52.890> set<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.549> time<00:03:53.849> with<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:56.220> delay

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
we can also set the time with the delay

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:15.760 
we can also set the time with the delay
knob

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.449 

that's<00:04:16.770> reverse

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
that's reverse

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:28.360 
that's reverse
can<00:04:17.640> I<00:04:17.760> sounds<00:04:18.090> cool<00:04:18.440> now<00:04:19.440> we<00:04:19.500> got<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:19.920> hold

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:39.630 

if<00:04:29.370> we<00:04:29.759> play<00:04:30.120> a<00:04:30.150> note

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.540 

people

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.080 

basically<00:04:47.550> holds<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.770> last<00:04:49.770> second<00:04:50.400> when<00:04:50.940> you

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
basically holds the last second when you

00:04:51.090 --> 00:05:08.010 
basically holds the last second when you
press<00:04:51.300> it<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.690> we<00:04:52.590> got<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.920> warp

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.320 

it'll<00:05:09.020> just<00:05:09.050> kind<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:09.680> hold<00:05:10.490> it<00:05:10.670> there<00:05:10.880> sort<00:05:11.240> of

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
it'll just kind of hold it there sort of

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.580 
it'll just kind of hold it there sort of
on<00:05:11.450> a<00:05:11.480> feedback<00:05:12.110> loop<00:05:12.889> so<00:05:13.480> that<00:05:14.480> is<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.139> boss

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
on a feedback loop so that is the boss

maybe six doesn't have a external tap
tempo<00:05:25.490> switch<00:05:26.030> so<00:05:27.020> you<00:05:27.080> have<00:05:27.530> to<00:05:27.710> either<00:05:27.830> dial

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160

00:05:44.570 --> 00:06:19.049 
and the other delay modes and it goes
green<00:05:44.900> and<00:05:45.230> we<00:05:45.500> can<00:05:45.680> tap<00:05:45.890> in<00:05:46.070> our<00:05:46.220> tempo
