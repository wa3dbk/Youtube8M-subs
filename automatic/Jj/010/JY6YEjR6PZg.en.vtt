internally it's built solid it takes

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.850 
internally it's built solid it takes
about<00:01:41.610> nine<00:01:42.150> hours<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.750> charge<00:01:43.020> over<00:01:43.710> the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
it only charges at point 8 amps so it's

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.850 
it only charges at point 8 amps so it's
not<00:03:43.720> going<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.959> give<00:03:44.080> me<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.380> full<00:03:44.620> speed

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.250 
good deal considering how much you juice
you<00:04:09.310> get<00:04:09.489> out<00:04:09.610> of<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:09.820> you<00:04:10.060> can<00:04:10.600> charge<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.930> nexus

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
you get out of it you can charge a nexus

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.560 
you get out of it you can charge a nexus
4<00:04:11.440> 4<00:04:11.680> or<00:04:11.769> 5<00:04:11.950> times<00:04:11.980> easily<00:04:12.700> you<00:04:13.239> know<00:04:13.329> that

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
4 4 or 5 times easily you know that

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.449 
4 4 or 5 times easily you know that
that's<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:14.079> judging<00:04:14.739> by<00:04:14.860> you<00:04:14.920> know<00:04:15.280> the

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
that's a judging by you know the

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.599 
that's a judging by you know the
decoration<00:04:16.180> of<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.539> cells<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.859> wiring<00:04:18.430> and

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
decoration of the cells the wiring and

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.460 
decoration of the cells the wiring and
so<00:04:19.359> on<00:04:19.539> and<00:04:19.750> so<00:04:19.900> forth

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
so on and so forth

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.840 
so on and so forth
I<00:04:20.500> really<00:04:20.860> like<00:04:21.010> how<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.160> can<00:04:21.430> charge<00:04:21.700> it

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
I really like how you can charge it

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.300 
I really like how you can charge it
superfast<00:04:22.330> with<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.840> two<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.320> one<00:04:23.650> amp<00:04:23.920> ports

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
superfast with the two and one amp ports

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.490 
superfast with the two and one amp ports
and<00:04:24.490> you<00:04:24.730> can<00:04:24.850> also<00:04:24.970> charge<00:04:25.690> two<00:04:26.050> things<00:04:26.320> at

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
and you can also charge two things at

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.250 
and you can also charge two things at
once<00:04:26.710> so<00:04:27.400> you<00:04:27.460> could<00:04:27.640> charge<00:04:27.850> an<00:04:28.210> iPad<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.230> a

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
once so you could charge an iPad and a

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.800 
once so you could charge an iPad and a
nexus<00:04:29.590> 4<00:04:29.800> at<00:04:29.920> the<00:04:30.010> same<00:04:30.160> time<00:04:30.370> which<00:04:31.000> is<00:04:31.300> gives

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
nexus 4 at the same time which is gives

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.220 
nexus 4 at the same time which is gives
a<00:04:31.960> total<00:04:32.260> of<00:04:32.350> 3<00:04:32.980> amps<00:04:33.310> out<00:04:33.430> which<00:04:34.090> is<00:04:34.270> pretty

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
a total of 3 amps out which is pretty

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.070 
a total of 3 amps out which is pretty
cool<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:36.370> like<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.120> way<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.360> looks<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.780> wish

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
cool and I like the way it looks I wish

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.990 
cool and I like the way it looks I wish
it<00:04:38.230> wasn't<00:04:38.410> as<00:04:38.770> much<00:04:38.950> as<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.220> fingerprint

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
it wasn't as much as a fingerprint

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.960 
it wasn't as much as a fingerprint
fingerprint<00:04:40.780> magnet<00:04:40.930> maybe<00:04:41.500> a<00:04:41.670> Lumina<00:04:42.670> metal

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
fingerprint magnet maybe a Lumina metal

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.940 
fingerprint magnet maybe a Lumina metal
design<00:04:43.300> or<00:04:43.570> something<00:04:43.750> like<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.020> I<00:04:44.380> wish<00:04:44.770> it

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
design or something like that I wish it

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.290 
design or something like that I wish it
didn't<00:04:45.160> take<00:04:45.280> so<00:04:45.430> long<00:04:45.580> to<00:04:45.760> charge<00:04:45.940> but<00:04:46.210> of

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
didn't take so long to charge but of

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.330 
didn't take so long to charge but of
course<00:04:46.480> that<00:04:46.660> makes<00:04:46.810> sense<00:04:47.110> it's<00:04:47.920> a<00:04:48.040> little

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
course that makes sense it's a little

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.180 
course that makes sense it's a little
heavy<00:04:48.610> but<00:04:48.910> not<00:04:49.810> too<00:04:49.990> heavy<00:04:50.140> and<00:04:50.440> everything

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
heavy but not too heavy and everything

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.570 
heavy but not too heavy and everything
