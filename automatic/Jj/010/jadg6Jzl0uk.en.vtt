00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.430
 you are stupid sensitivities 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.339
 dad we love you days 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:13.209
 thank you for debt income here must purse parisian a little cold it's done 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:14.909
 but thank you for having welcomed 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:16.509
 romeo 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.439
 the cafe beaubourg is that it's beautiful because bobo is closed the one where 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.220
 I wanted to go he is in work 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.859
 why employees aspire to their homes will resort to targeting 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.789
 photo here 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.769
 everyone understands when we change technique stopped reproducing what we 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.620
 had been able to see for a while we had five years with digital it was said 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.700
 it needs the same quality in argentina and the same quality to the lot has not 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.920
 of reach it's not the same techniques senegal anyway 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.039
 big features given on screen 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.760
 stage of light that are burned 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.280
 and slightly iridescent around it's in the bottom right now the 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.649
 digital photography was never that an artifact it was their body for 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.479
 pixel pairs with% veyra red and blue so this is with interest a 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:55.850
 donor filter 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.810
 so it's a reconstitution to clean up the film and that to 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.120
 my opinion also if we increase the number of pixels and manufacturers of 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.140
 shared alpine enclosures compromise 60 or 100 million pixels on 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.620
 will never be able to reduce under its problems of dynamics and 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.430
 popularization the embarrassing for me it's a new means of expression on the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.290
 master well for me basically I summarize the inkjet not as 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.210
 some 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.640
 we now see our prints 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.170
 of silver on the inkjet that's not true she still believed 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.189
 problems in flat colors etc 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.880
 to participate in fact 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.880
 and aesthetically we get to have renderings 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.870
 different clues by accelerating ethnic differences 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.850
 that the photographer 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.470
 little fictitiously 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.500
 accept particular jerk saw i saw reims carl shows of keyzer 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.460
 precisely the art elected and technicians france richelieu been elected him he does 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.230
 all the prints itself now this has a quality of only 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.399
 who is watchable 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.170
 and what does he like in what does it mean stop the photographer has found 

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:59.240
 there a means of expression which is not the case for everyone 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.840
 a little bit the case for everyone but the manufacturers are in the process of 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.220
 working on the current on new sensors 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.790
 would generate 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.049
 according to you the France of light 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.419
 I cried the basic colors look 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.469
 so at that moment we would come back to 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:16.819
 the 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.339
 movie settings 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.249
 we could actually arrive with 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.329
 it's even made the same nuances as the movie 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.329
 and with degrees of precision of definition 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.069
 higher than those of the film 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.649
 me I can not ask a question aftermath 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.649
 in argentina that may remain that white laurent 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.219
 which is a way of expression tonight 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.599
 and which fictitiously lets you look at some people who want to 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.869
 express themselves in black and white while the color for and 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.939
 I'm here for her because it's not easy especially with the 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.849
 progress that will be made in five six seven eight years 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.430
 could completely pass at that time the digital water but if we 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.299
 come 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.900
 in digital to have the nuances 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.799
 we had 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.390
 m in film, knowing that digital definitions are already 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.829
 significantly higher at that time 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.489
 if we think about the storage problem lyon no more reason for costs of 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.159
 work in digital color 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.839
 then black and white body 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.799
 we have occasion barcelona note a support in itself 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.860
 and she knows the one right now who is staying ahead of the last 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.889
 figure that I had he recently in France the black and white keeps up and 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.659
 even maybe a little bit growing time 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.479
 filming while the color film continues its tumbling body 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.510
 thank you goodbye 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.510
 alas the next to the approached magazine goes on to win 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.560
 benjamines 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.549
 but we can say that you have not heard
