include<00:02:18.150> into<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.510> pack<00:02:18.720> then<00:02:19.560> if<00:02:20.010> we<00:02:20.220> go<00:02:20.400> on

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
include into the pack then if we go on

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.449 
include into the pack then if we go on
to<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.540> cash<00:02:21.780> machine<00:02:21.959> itself<00:02:22.560> see<00:02:23.280> this

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
to the cash machine itself see this

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.310 
to the cash machine itself see this
one's<00:02:23.669> actually<00:02:24.090> printed<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.660> you've<00:02:25.049> not<00:02:25.230> had

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
one's actually printed on you've not had

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.750 
one's actually printed on you've not had
to<00:02:25.500> stick<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.709> sticker<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.130> there<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:26.579> that's

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
to stick a sticker on there so that's

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.710 
to stick a sticker on there so that's
nice<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.209> don't<00:02:27.329> honest

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
nice I don't honest

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.040 
nice I don't honest
we're<00:02:27.930> not<00:02:28.140> doing<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:28.760> everything

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
we're not doing it with everything

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.210 
we're not doing it with everything
because<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.140> can<00:02:31.230> guarantee<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.680> 15<00:02:32.190> years

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
because you can guarantee in 15 years

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.980 
because you can guarantee in 15 years
time<00:02:32.460> if<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:32.940> piece<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.300> still<00:02:33.480> about<00:02:33.660> it'll

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
time if this piece is still about it'll

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.990 
time if this piece is still about it'll
still<00:02:34.200> have<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.770> where<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.820> one

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
still have that on where is that one

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.300 
still have that on where is that one
there<00:02:36.240> will<00:02:36.990> probably<00:02:37.110> rub<00:02:37.500> off<00:02:37.680> within<00:02:38.130> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
there will probably rub off within the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.740 
there will probably rub off within the
next<00:02:38.610> two<00:02:39.030> years<00:02:39.290> with<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.320> little<00:02:40.650> bit<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:40.860> play

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
next two years with a little bit of play

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.670 
next two years with a little bit of play
obviously<00:02:42.750> unless<00:02:43.140> you're<00:02:43.410> just<00:02:43.470> putting

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
obviously unless you're just putting

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.920 
obviously unless you're just putting
them<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:44.010> display<00:02:44.190> but<00:02:44.970> even<00:02:45.240> then<00:02:45.420> they<00:02:45.780> might

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
them on display but even then they might

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.500 
them on display but even then they might
just<00:02:46.230> fade<00:02:46.560> change<00:02:47.160> color<00:02:47.490> which<00:02:48.360> is

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
just fade change color which is

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.080 
just fade change color which is
unfortunate<00:02:49.200> but<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.770> cash<00:02:50.460> machine<00:02:50.610> itself

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
unfortunate but the cash machine itself

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.000 
unfortunate but the cash machine itself
is<00:02:51.390> quite<00:02:51.630> nice<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.200> does<00:02:52.350> come<00:02:52.530> with<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.710> slot

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
is quite nice it does come with a slot

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.580 
is quite nice it does come with a slot
in<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.220> front<00:02:53.460> we<00:02:54.270> do<00:02:54.450> get<00:02:54.720> two<00:02:54.960> pieces<00:02:55.200> of

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
in the front we do get two pieces of

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.240 
in the front we do get two pieces of
money<00:02:56.630> with<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.780> set<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.320> they<00:02:58.740> do<00:02:58.800> just

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
money with this set and they do just

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.530 
money with this set and they do just
slot<00:02:59.550> inside<00:03:00.170> like<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.830> also<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.090> opens

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
slot inside like that and also it opens

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.180 
slot inside like that and also it opens
up<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:03.990> can<00:03:04.200> then<00:03:04.560> get<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.740> money<00:03:05.010> out

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
up so you can then get the money out

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.800 
up so you can then get the money out
there<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.880> slot<00:03:06.150> on<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.300> back<00:03:06.480> as<00:03:06.690> well

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
there is a slot on the back as well

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.240 
there is a slot on the back as well
which<00:03:07.050> can<00:03:07.260> be<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.440> pain<00:03:07.650> because<00:03:07.920> if<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.130> fill

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
which can be a pain because if you fill

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.850 
which can be a pain because if you fill
it<00:03:08.370> up<00:03:08.459> too<00:03:08.880> much<00:03:08.910> or<00:03:09.420> put<00:03:10.200> them<00:03:10.320> in<00:03:10.410> quite<00:03:10.620> fast

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
it up too much or put them in quite fast

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.340 
it up too much or put them in quite fast
they<00:03:11.160> do<00:03:11.310> pop<00:03:11.550> out<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.820> back<00:03:12.000> sometimes<00:03:12.540> and

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
they do pop out the back sometimes and

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.350 
they do pop out the back sometimes and
but<00:03:13.560> still<00:03:13.650> that's<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:14.010> nice<00:03:14.190> touch<00:03:14.459> when<00:03:15.180> it's

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
but still that's a nice touch when it's

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.760 
but still that's a nice touch when it's
on<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> base<00:03:15.690> plate<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.200> will<00:03:16.320> have<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.620> put

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
on a base plate you will have to put

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.350 
on a base plate you will have to put
something<00:03:17.100> underneath<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.640> because<00:03:18.030> on<00:03:18.240> the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
something underneath it because on the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.150 
something underneath it because on the
base<00:03:18.510> plate<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.990> will<00:03:19.170> not<00:03:19.410> allow<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.890> open

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
base plate it will not allow you to open

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.990 
base plate it will not allow you to open
it<00:03:20.490> more<00:03:20.670> than<00:03:21.000> about<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:21.690> which<00:03:22.500> is

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
it more than about that which is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.920 
it more than about that which is
unfortunate<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.120> should<00:03:24.270> fail<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.720> may<00:03:24.870> be

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
unfortunate it should fail that may be

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.900 
unfortunate it should fail that may be
just<00:03:25.230> an<00:03:25.470> extension<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.250> bottom<00:03:26.490> but

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
just an extension on the bottom but

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.130 
just an extension on the bottom but
still<00:03:27.090> it's<00:03:27.240> a<00:03:27.300> nice<00:03:27.420> enough<00:03:27.660> piece<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.050> have

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
still it's a nice enough piece to have

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.560 
still it's a nice enough piece to have
in<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.410> set<00:03:28.620> then<00:03:29.190> if<00:03:29.430> we<00:03:29.550> come<00:03:29.760> on<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.150> the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
in the set then if we come on to the

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.100 
in the set then if we come on to the
first<00:03:30.930> burglar<00:03:32.090> thief<00:03:33.090> robber<00:03:33.480> or<00:03:33.810> whatever

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
first burglar thief robber or whatever

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.810 
first burglar thief robber or whatever
you<00:03:34.200> want<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.350> call<00:03:34.560> him<00:03:34.769> then<00:03:35.400> he<00:03:35.640> has<00:03:35.790> a

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
you want to call him then he has a

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.180 
you want to call him then he has a
backpack<00:03:36.269> on<00:03:36.300> comes<00:03:37.050> with<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.230> gray<00:03:37.470> cap<00:03:37.850> and

backpack on comes with a gray cap and
that<00:03:41.190> style<00:03:42.560> flashy<00:03:43.560> Jersey<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.280> he<00:03:44.370> has<00:03:44.550> on

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
that style flashy Jersey that he has on

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.460 
that style flashy Jersey that he has on
there<00:03:44.940> nothing<00:03:45.450> on<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.690> back<00:03:45.870> underneath<00:03:46.350> the

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
there nothing on the back underneath the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.970 
there nothing on the back underneath the
backpack<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:48.540> they<00:03:49.350> never<00:03:49.500> go<00:03:49.620> on<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.890> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
backpack and they never go on to the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.030 
backpack and they never go on to the
second<00:03:50.400> one<00:03:51.080> it<00:03:52.080> doesn't<00:03:52.350> come<00:03:52.470> with<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> second

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
second one it doesn't come with a second

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.220 
second one it doesn't come with a second
set<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.190> handcuffs<00:03:53.810> this<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:54.989> from<00:03:55.200> a
