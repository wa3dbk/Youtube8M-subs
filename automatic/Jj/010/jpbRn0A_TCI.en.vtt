00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.880
 a warm welcome my name is 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:08.969
 david fuchs i would like to welcome you 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.150
 Welcome to our customer as a theme 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:15.750
 Today we have renovated old building and 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.880
 wood surfaces theme renovation 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.220
 old building I am with a customer today 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.050
 already told me and what is that now 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.819
 decisive to say human i would like 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.009
 now I have new bow but 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.390
 We have a critical background 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.880
 here in this house following situation 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.520
 we have a wooden floor and a 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.380
 Wooden floor really has its pitfalls 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.150
 has his situation or his 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.270
 characteristics and every manufacturer 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.100
 please make sure you look for it when you have one 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.320
 make soil on the wooden floor on it 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.690
 you should note certain parameters 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.090
 and we want to show that today 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.130
 often in old buildings and also 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.010
 here the case the old evidence still on 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.470
 on the ground has a pvc and I ask 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.420
 to tear out the old coverings 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.680
 They are often told to let them in there 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.260
 is still some footfall sound insulation 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.480
 use laminate or parquet 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.870
 fatal i beg you do it 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.880
 Out 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.219
 the material is in for just that 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.049
 it can not breathe properly then have 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.179
 they do not even look at what is really 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.880
 under the ground how is the situation 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:17.310
 which are possibly scruffy 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.990
 are they moldy may still be 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.460
 somehow take off and look screw 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.749
 That's why we do it now 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.579
 once so we take the floor now 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:25.999
 get out and look at the situation 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.999
 has down 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.590
 So the lining is gone now it is 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.940
 you can decide the floor 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.460
 they'll look at it too 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.350
 Immediately we still see a recording 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.200
 we should definitely the 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.570
 brightness and the flatness of the floor 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.300
 check that generally was all floors 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.280
 even with strecky only stop at wood 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.230
 among reasons is it's very, very often 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.060
 properly mentioned here again that 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.000
 you find the situation that the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.650
 ground is canceled to the middle or to the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.050
 Walls somewhere canceled is that they 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.840
 when over it go some cracking noises 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.600
 or that they are in short supply 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.760
 turvy these are all the points the 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.200
 they have to prepare and also away 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.780
 before they get one now 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.060
 new ground against quite important as 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.440
 check how do you control that 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.850
 underground I want them now 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.100
 are you once with the report seems 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.540
 a demonstration was is if they have a 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.820
 judge time take at least two 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.860
 because it has the same length 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.140
 really can check for a right 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.400
 greater length as is now the 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.540
 underground if you now a whole 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.800
 take small piece then you can 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.290
 Do not really check if the floor 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.850
 somewhere to say away but says here 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.080
 at this two meter length you can do that 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.610
 already see very clearly 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.620
 I also ask her a bit 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.300
 to come closer and although we once 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.980
 down here underneath and the light show 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.769
 the standard says that about a meter long 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.720
 do not have a larger ground wave or dell 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.640
 may be of three millimeters that is in 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.030
 the middle should not be bigger than 3 mm 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.130
 his 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.810
 they will realize here now that 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.180
 bowl the individual planks 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.160
 that in turn is not bad 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.570
 is pointed these later were new 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.100
 first there is a damming 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.830
 over it and then comes the new 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.989
 floor makes these short distances 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.720
 the floor the new floor very stable 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.330
 but a big dent like a tub 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.550
 or a little stroll that makes that 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.610
 All stable again and they will be 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.470
 incidents thank you 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.630
 the floor will go down to new ground 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.590
 give in and wiggle that necessarily must 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.690
 be prevented 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.970
 that is very important every time you 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.520
 a new floor next to the laminate 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.540
 Parquet or vinyl is not allowed 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.700
 certainly not naked 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.500
 connection over the years if 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.360
 People are always there again and again 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.490
 give it over when the war connection 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.380
 be out because light motion is in it 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.090
 and then sometime the connection goes 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.730
 apart and fame form 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.660
 no manufacturer is a guarantee for this 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.430
 pronounce 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.560
 For the sake of it, I'll show you this 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.750
 Here too, they are very important in measuring the 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.160
 ground off and to the judge really of 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.890
 Corner to corner We will do that now too 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.950
 equal and the norm no bigger one 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.490
 Ground shaft or dents as 3 mm at 1 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.490
 meter width 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.520
 the first part is done the dog 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.380
 was checked we have a few things 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.270
 shown what you have to pay attention to 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.250
 underground we want you now the 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.690
 recommend the second part where we with 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.690
 laying of a laminate beginning
