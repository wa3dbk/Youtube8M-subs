right<00:02:08.570> now<00:02:08.750> on<00:02:08.929> iron<00:02:09.140> ore<00:02:09.290> uh<00:02:09.560> yeah<00:02:10.429> we're

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
right now on iron ore uh yeah we're

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.130 
right now on iron ore uh yeah we're
quite<00:02:11.060> bullish<00:02:11.239> on<00:02:11.540> iron<00:02:11.780> ore<00:02:12.019> it's<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.980> as

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
quite bullish on iron ore it's the as

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.810 
quite bullish on iron ore it's the as
economies<00:02:15.140> go<00:02:15.500> through<00:02:15.980> industrialized

growth<00:02:17.239> they<00:02:17.570> run<00:02:18.049> through<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.320> series<00:02:18.620> of

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
growth they run through a series of

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.020 
growth they run through a series of
phases<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:21.040> important<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.340> both<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:22.850> first

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
phases and important to both the first

and<00:02:23.329> second<00:02:23.840> phases<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:25.070> iron<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:26.329> reason

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
and second phases is iron the reason

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.270 
and second phases is iron the reason
that<00:02:26.870> iron<00:02:27.139> ore<00:02:27.410> hasn't<00:02:27.769> been<00:02:27.889> a<00:02:28.010> large

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
that iron ore hasn't been a large

those<00:03:05.269> supplies<00:03:05.660> have<00:03:05.900> been<00:03:05.930> used<00:03:06.290> up<00:03:06.550> yeah

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
those supplies have been used up yeah

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.070 
those supplies have been used up yeah
they<00:03:07.970> have<00:03:08.180> been<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.390> lot<00:03:08.630> of<00:03:08.690> supplies<00:03:08.989> in

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
they have been a lot of supplies in

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.720 
they have been a lot of supplies in
terms<00:03:09.440> of<00:03:09.530> base<00:03:09.680> metals<00:03:10.070> as<00:03:10.190> your<00:03:10.340> as<00:03:10.489> your

terms of base metals as your as your

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.670 
terms of base metals as your as your
your<00:03:11.480> brother<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:11.989> were<00:03:12.170> talking<00:03:12.350> about

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
your brother and I were talking about

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.170 
your brother and I were talking about
just<00:03:13.040> prior<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.310> our<00:03:13.489> conversation<00:03:14.300> here<00:03:14.720> a

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
just prior to our conversation here a

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.790 
just prior to our conversation here a
lot<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.510> base<00:03:17.660> metal<00:03:17.900> supplies<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.650> don't

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
lot of the base metal supplies I don't

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.590 
lot of the base metal supplies I don't
want<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:19.010> say<00:03:19.160> they're<00:03:19.340> being<00:03:19.580> used<00:03:20.000> up<00:03:20.330> that

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
want to say they're being used up that

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.300 
want to say they're being used up that
people<00:03:20.870> are<00:03:20.959> starting<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.350> realize<00:03:21.860> that<00:03:21.890> with

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
people are starting to realize that with

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.880 
people are starting to realize that with
the<00:03:22.430> increased<00:03:22.880> demand<00:03:23.050> supply<00:03:24.050> is<00:03:24.290> really

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
the increased demand supply is really

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.710 
the increased demand supply is really
becoming<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.400> major<00:03:25.580> issue<00:03:25.850> i<00:03:26.000> mean<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.690> know

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
becoming a major issue i mean you know

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.300 
becoming a major issue i mean you know
and<00:03:27.140> that's<00:03:27.290> evidence<00:03:27.709> right<00:03:27.890> now<00:03:28.069> by<00:03:28.250> the

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
and that's evidence right now by the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.130 
and that's evidence right now by the
copper<00:03:28.670> market<00:03:28.700> we've<00:03:29.120> got<00:03:29.300> copper<00:03:29.720> at<00:03:29.840> almost

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
copper market we've got copper at almost

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.710 
copper market we've got copper at almost
almost<00:03:30.380> record<00:03:31.100> high<00:03:31.220> prices<00:03:31.250> right<00:03:31.970> now<00:03:32.120> it

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
almost record high prices right now it

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.569 
almost record high prices right now it
pretty<00:03:33.140> close<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.620> record<00:03:33.799> it's<00:03:34.190> certainly

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
pretty close to a record it's certainly

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.509 
pretty close to a record it's certainly
the<00:03:35.299> only<00:03:35.510> higher<00:03:36.260> prices<00:03:36.920> were<00:03:37.100> before<00:03:37.280> the

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
the only higher prices were before the

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.360 
the only higher prices were before the
the<00:03:38.090> debt<00:03:38.269> crunch<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:39.829> reason<00:03:40.190> for<00:03:40.220> that

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
the debt crunch and the reason for that

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.370 
the debt crunch and the reason for that
again<00:03:40.820> is<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.360> there's<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:42.019> slight

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
again is that there's a slight

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.440 
again is that there's a slight
difference<00:03:42.410> between<00:03:43.250> copper<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.060> some<00:03:44.360> of

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
difference between copper and some of

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.090 
difference between copper and some of
the<00:03:44.540> other<00:03:44.690> metals<00:03:45.049> with<00:03:45.230> copper<00:03:45.680> which<00:03:45.920> is<00:03:46.070> a

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
the other metals with copper which is a

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.630 
the other metals with copper which is a
very<00:03:46.400> old<00:03:46.610> metal<00:03:47.890> historically<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:49.010> is<00:03:49.400> the

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
very old metal historically that is the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.569 
very old metal historically that is the
the<00:03:49.940> humanities<00:03:50.780> been<00:03:50.959> using<00:03:51.290> for<00:03:51.470> almost<00:03:51.650> ten

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
thousand years the way to generate

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.599 
thousand years the way to generate
copper<00:03:56.840> at<00:03:56.989> scale<00:03:57.320> was<00:03:57.680> recognized<00:03:58.280> when

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
copper at scale was recognized when

into<00:04:05.209> play<00:04:05.420> but<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:06.170> best<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.650> those<00:04:06.829> have

five or six years to do that's what's

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.729 
five or six years to do that's what's

you're<00:05:21.349> in<00:05:21.529> ahead<00:05:22.039> of<00:05:22.099> that<00:05:22.429> you'll<00:05:22.819> do<00:05:22.969> very

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:22.999 
you're in ahead of that you'll do very

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:25.479 
you're in ahead of that you'll do very
well<00:05:23.300> once<00:05:24.079> it's<00:05:24.289> underway<00:05:24.649> we<00:05:24.919> tend<00:05:25.189> to<00:05:25.309> leave

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:25.489 
well once it's underway we tend to leave

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:27.939 
well once it's underway we tend to leave
it<00:05:25.579> alone<00:05:25.669> not<00:05:26.089> entirely<00:05:26.809> but<00:05:27.199> we<00:05:27.469> do<00:05:27.589> tend<00:05:27.860> to

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
it alone not entirely but we do tend to

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.519 
it alone not entirely but we do tend to
leave<00:05:28.129> that<00:05:28.279> alone<00:05:28.459> so<00:05:29.300> that's<00:05:29.899> important

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:30.529 
leave that alone so that's important

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.169 
leave that alone so that's important
when<00:05:30.679> you<00:05:30.889> look<00:05:31.009> at<00:05:31.129> a<00:05:31.159> medal<00:05:31.399> like<00:05:31.519> copper<00:05:31.969> or
