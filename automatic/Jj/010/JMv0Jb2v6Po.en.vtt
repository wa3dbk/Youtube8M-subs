00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.460
 What is the Efterskole school in Denmark? 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:23.500
 Efterskole allows students (in a year at a boarding school) to build an independent life 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.820
 Understand the meaning of life and think about the responsibility of the family 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.340
 And have a year to train yourself 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.280
 My daily life may be like other people 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.580
 But now I have deeper understanding and a broader perspective. 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.800
 They just came like children, but they grew very fast. Now I feel that they have matured a lot. 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:58.420
 I feel that I have grown a lot, become more outgoing, and prefer social 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.060
 You leave home for a year and you will feel free. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.700
 You will have an experience you have never experienced before. 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.880
 For example, if you want to be a good dancer, you have the chance to realize this dream. 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.140
 And it will become better in mathematics, physics, etc. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.480
 Because you are in a completely different environment 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.260
 In the Efterskole school, you have all the possibilities 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.280
 I have a lot of interest, I want to spend more time on these interests. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.760
 Efterskole gave me a lot of opportunities, we can play guitar, paint, etc. 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:54.040
 So I want to be better, I want to delve into them for my favorite things. 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.880
 Here we can play like children, but grow every moment. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.060
 Itâ€™s the day I got along with me, let me grow up. 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.380
 Going to Efterskole is the most valuable decision of my life. 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.200
 I learned a lot of knowledge that I have never touched before. 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:27.140
 They can choose to go home on weekends, but most students choose to stay here this weekend. 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.320
 When I am at home, ready to go back to Efterskole, I will tell my mom: 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.100
 Mom, I am going home. 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:44.580
 Moreover, I like my roommate very much, I feel that she is my family. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.880
 I am very similar to my roommate, it is really amazing. 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:16.620
 We are from different places, we are not early people, but we are very surprised to get up early, there are many people who go downstairs to eat breakfast, but it is very quiet, maybe everyone is not enough to sleep. 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.160
 Learn how to socialize and learn how to make friends 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.080
 Keep trying new things, here is a journey for me 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.760
 They live here, study, work here 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.360
 I didn't get used to it at first because I was not used to living with others. 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.680
 But now I am used to it, so I made a lot of friends. 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.480
 It is because of them that the school is full of life. 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:00.320
 Everything here is a do-it-yourself 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.340
 You can't see what others do first, and then learn to do it. This is not the case here. You must take the initiative to try, learn, and work hard. 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:15.260
 You have to wash your clothes, mopping the floor, cleaning, and doing a lot of things for your mother. 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:26.080
 Now I know how to do it myself. I was not used to it at first. 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:36.700
 Now I don't think this is a problem, I can do it myself. 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:44.380
 Therefore, labor itself has great educational significance, and it is not just cramming teaching. 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.980
 Personally, I have gained a lot and I have become more useful. 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.000
 They work together, they know that unity is power. 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.880
 You can hear the sound of the nearby swan, I feed the swan every Tuesday. 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:14.820
 This is a thing that makes me very happy, and the beach is nearby, I also like to go for a walk. 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:27.160
 I have made many good friends here and met many interesting people. 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:36.820
 The teacher is like a friend and will chat with me often. 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.820
 The teacher does not have a high shelf, they are like friends of the same age. 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.000
 They know me very well, as a friend, as an individual, as a person 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:06:00.220
 Teacher-friendly attitude makes me more confident in answering questions in class 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.120
 So I am more likely to say my thoughts. 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:12.400
 It is a wonderful thing for a teacher to understand himself. 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:26.800
 I feel that I am more independent now, I can make my own decisions, I know what I am doing. 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:38.640
 Change your life and discover the true self with us 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.400
 Fun, challenging, have friends 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.480
 Become more independent and make me feel good
