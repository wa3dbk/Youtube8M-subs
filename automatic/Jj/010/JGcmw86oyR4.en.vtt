up there by finger game because it's

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.770 
up there by finger game because it's
very<00:00:11.040> much<00:00:11.280> down-to-earth<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.240> know<00:00:12.480> that

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
very much down-to-earth I know that

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.990 
very much down-to-earth I know that
because<00:00:13.080> well<00:00:13.259> I'm<00:00:13.530> done<00:00:13.769> go<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.280> also<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.820> have

because well I'm done go and also I have

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.050 
because well I'm done go and also I have
the<00:00:15.150> proof<00:00:15.389> right<00:00:15.630> there<00:00:16.320> that's<00:00:17.220> right<00:00:17.490> this

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the proof right there that's right this

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.370 
the proof right there that's right this
is<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.930> my<00:00:19.529> clown<00:00:19.920> from<00:00:20.369> W<00:00:21.000> D<00:00:21.180> now<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.350> a

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
is the my clown from W D now this is a

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.189 
is the my clown from W D now this is a
network<00:00:23.250> attached<00:00:23.699> storage<00:00:23.850> device<00:00:24.449> or<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
network attached storage device or in a

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.769 
network attached storage device or in a
server<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.859> way<00:00:26.609> meaning<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.119> very<00:00:27.390> much<00:00:27.599> like

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
server and way meaning is very much like

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.419 
server and way meaning is very much like
an<00:00:27.930> external<00:00:28.349> hard<00:00:28.500> drive<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:28.949> instead<00:00:29.369> of

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
an external hard drive but instead of

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.609 
an external hard drive but instead of
connecting<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.150> computer<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:31.080> connect<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
connecting to a computer you connect to

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.549 
connecting to a computer you connect to
a<00:00:31.650> hub<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.369> switch<00:00:32.730> or<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.180> router<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.870> become

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
a hub a switch or a router and become

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.310 
a hub a switch or a router and become
available<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.370> rest<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.450> network<00:00:36.660> now

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
available to the rest of the network now

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.110

in<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.649> server<00:00:37.980> like<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.489> not<00:00:38.610> new<00:00:38.850> in

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
in a server like this it's not new in

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.720 
in a server like this it's not new in
fact<00:00:39.149> before<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.989> EE<00:00:40.829> has<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.190> few<00:00:41.579> episodes

such as this my book world right here or

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.729 
such as this my book world right here or
the<00:00:46.320> my<00:00:46.500> book<00:00:46.710> line<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.399> newer<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.500> yes<00:00:49.500> I

have<00:00:50.070> everything<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.719> my<00:00:51.870> clouds

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
have everything but the my clouds

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.750 
have everything but the my clouds
different<00:00:52.680> though<00:00:52.800> because<00:00:52.829> apart<00:00:53.579> from

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
different though because apart from

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.970 
different though because apart from
serving<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.480> local<00:00:54.690> network<00:00:55.050> now<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.710> can

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
serving the local network now you can

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.790 
serving the local network now you can
actually<00:00:56.190> share<00:00:56.699> data<00:00:57.329> through<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.170> internet

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
actually share data through the internet

actually share data through the internet
very<00:00:59.430> easily<00:00:59.850> let<00:01:00.600> me<00:01:00.719> show<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.199> example<00:01:01.469> I

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
very easily let me show it for example I

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.740 
very easily let me show it for example I
can<00:01:01.829> take<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.280> know<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> photo<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.910> my<00:01:03.390> friend

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
can take you know the photo of my friend

can take you know the photo of my friend
behind<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.140> camera<00:01:04.379> over<00:01:04.680> there<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> few<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.460> them

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
behind a camera over there a few of them

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.050 
behind a camera over there a few of them
like<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.330> looking<00:01:06.990> good<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.460> would

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
like that looking good and then I would

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.170 
like that looking good and then I would
upload<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.320> my<00:01:10.500> cloud<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.070> now<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
upload this to the my cloud and now I

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.870 
upload this to the my cloud and now I
can<00:01:12.420> actually<00:01:12.840> view<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.380> my<00:01:13.830> laptop<00:01:14.369> or

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
can actually view it on my laptop or

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.910 
can actually view it on my laptop or
share<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.540> with<00:01:15.570> many<00:01:15.869> many<00:01:16.229> other<00:01:16.320> devices

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
share it with many many other devices

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.580 
share it with many many other devices
and<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.479> happen<00:01:18.840> even<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.290> these<00:01:19.409> two

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and that can happen even if these two

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.499 
and that can happen even if these two
devices<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.400> thousands<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.150> miles<00:01:21.299> away

devices here are thousands of miles away
as<00:01:21.869> long<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.799> they<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.189> both<00:01:23.220> connected<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
as long as they are both connected to

as long as they are both connected to
the<00:01:24.420> internet<00:01:24.960> where<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.860> say<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.159> sure

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the internet where I can say for sure

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.640 
the internet where I can say for sure
that<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.729> my<00:01:26.909> cloud<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.330> very<00:01:27.659> easy<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.350> set<00:01:28.619> up
