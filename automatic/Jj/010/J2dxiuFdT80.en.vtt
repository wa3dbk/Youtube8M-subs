00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.610
 probably not 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.440
 in May 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hello sovereignty 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.889
 fifteenth part 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.809
 water contract of the year 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:12.839
 crucial role 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.400
 flat girl as usual where 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.429
 more important than Douglas Medium 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.920
 we keep telling you fashion 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.359
 and by the way, here's a look even more 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.060
 to compose a little bit or 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.019
 the system 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.890
 the paths are the ways of the family which 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.609
 we told the last part 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.910
 and she now looks much more so 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.960
 compact and cables naturally hid behind 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.680
 the wall 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.230
 it was even more beautiful 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.970
 attentive users 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.170
 noticed that 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.200
 character 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.640
 recycling is used such 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.090
 thing like a compressor 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.410
 what is this thing 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.510
 bridge see then I know what this thing 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.910
 thefts 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.440
 Shoigu 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.620
 she calls items and basically how much 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.190
 options 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.440
 true much of what he May 20 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.489
 but I want this in detail 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.040
 and we want in general 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.710
 touch on one thing that's how to practice 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.240
 diamonds 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.730
 except that 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.550
 this 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.750
 we already talked about it once 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.570
 and now it's time 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.950
 talk obama but first by the way how 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.640
 Kravtsa compressor 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.710
 and that's how he ended up looking set 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.190
 court we really do not get very 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.080
 beautiful row 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.210
 but then we will break it into everything 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.690
 perimeter workshop 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.790
 Here we have a compressor, it is already connected to 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.420
 network 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.370
 to brighten diamonds 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.370
 we need such kabula 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.130
 we have them Kravtsa and simply enough 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.280
 tongue coal crumb and silicon 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.799
 Now we are for special 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.860
 compressor 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.470
 which is by the way about aids he knows something 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.270
 nothing small lord myself 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.060
 developer 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.290
 poland see still church cover 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.300
 Kharlamov 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.180
 yes then there really are compressors he 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.360
 use for big enough 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.079
 recipe quantities 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:10.990
 his puck steps 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.979
 personally 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.589
 sell the ball now see we get 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:16.699
 list 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:18.299
 Kamchatka 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.439
 something like this but the trick is that it 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.709
 shorter compress 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:25.899
 half dollars 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:27.969
 we began to look for 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.879
 now we will need more 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.429
 in Poland and the Czech Republic such 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.199
 you can throw them no yes thanks as here 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.199
 books 1 discussed 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:41.049
 I picked them up 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.189
 now we go to march 8 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.089
 we lay out like a chest 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:47.199
 compress datas 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.389
 n but here it is compost 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.939
 crumb compression and get 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:52.899
 count chang 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.229
 in patients he spoke Russian 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.469
 it's not all the cat understood now 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.919
 need to sing attack our compressors 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.919
 and availability 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.729
 recycling by 5 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.189
 when the amount is again like many 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.689
 Kirghiz know about real life 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.939
 that it is possible to get artificial diamonds 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.799
 by deception and Russia strongly pressed you 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.729
 carbon and coal is nothing more than 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.429
 carbon 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:23.719
 and cheers you live artist 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.079
 yes you have a media field 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.109
 we got for us mark once heard in 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.049
 pocket fairy tale see bacter showed that 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.719
 he began to appear usually 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.249
 so kind all good he was unusual 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:40.249
 as 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.749
 past sheikh like kamaz well i mean 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:44.669
 versions 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.019
 he was just for what 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.999
 for sometimes the brain as follows from such 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:51.569
 could say 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.419
 just whom we communicate both ball practical 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.079
 doubted how 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.599
 offer them 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.719
 during the audit but the matter is due 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.139
 changes in new density versions 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:03.939
 news 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.739
 the plot still sits on 1 2 5 these 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.940
 may have failed 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.890
 older 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.740
 but by the way I want to note that we are sitting 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.279
 on the field with such old versions 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:15.039
 because they are getting cooler 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:17.370
 the mattress is more difficult to do at a loss 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.169
 say the creators 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.099
 so year 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.319
 so that there is one more way 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.529
 moment 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.189
 we are ordinary users earlier 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.629
 bronze key to collect things and 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.929
 surely many people know the world ourselves 

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:34.180
 often encountered 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.139
 what when are you going to thing that 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.569
 she is 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.569
 sometimes a block falls out of the car 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.349
 we have such a wonderful 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.150
 electric nbu lynch 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.469
 which by the way is like kravets 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:50.469
 yes Sasha Capulet just 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.580
 if we we can collect everything 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.840
 but it will be the same with probability 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.720
 not so that only the engine yard falls out 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.749
 so 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:01.069
 you must set the right mouse button to them 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:02.770
 letter m 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.210
 Capulet now appears. 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.710
 low pilaf is famous for its troubled was 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.770
 crisis year 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.660
 that if it wasn't we knew that we could 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.660
 collect things and kia 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.229
 they are going but 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.210
 we have enough care products 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.639
 Dushanbe projects programs and wait for 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.210
 I'm kinda like I'm going to someone else's boxing 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.210
 I'll tie it up 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.240
 In sum, by the way about the change, he does not remember what 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.580
 who is mon well exactly how much 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.620
 he is now eliminating a lot in Karachi 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.530
 how completely the heat in the temple is 4000 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.999
 the reason is correct as 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.259
 then as a percentage and so what 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:45.669
 barannikov 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.650
 that's why it allows pricing 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.889
 collecting rather complicated things that 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.180
 Avt which year as for example our batteries 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.979
 sunlight 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.800
 in which actually 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.029
 the entire network is provided 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:59.069
 yes collected 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:00.689
 all the time beam from when this happens 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.099
 to be honest 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.050
 so one compressor is one of the initiators 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.319
 lost 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.590
 the foresun on the picket in the fifth is too cruel 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.309
 and by the way another very important point 

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:16.419
 never great 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.900
 Yes, you gentlemen, never 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.240
 do not make noise 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.169
 right-click on the box 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.379
 if you hold the key because otherwise you 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:27.900
 will have to tune in to new ones again 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.690
 that's how you see by the way here I have for 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.330
 wall held wire 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.669
 interesting 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.479
 she will have to me now 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:35.250
 I had to 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.069
 like that 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:38.949
 re-do therefore surveying any 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:41.949
 other 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.869
 delight there 

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:46.789
 as you understand in the first circles as 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:47.409
 told 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:48.969
 does not break 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:52.029
 when monaca doesn't break at sunset 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.539
 this is absolutely true her on this 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:58.369
 so here is thrift because we already have 

00:06:58.369 --> 00:06:59.439
 there is 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:01.229
 get that stake large percentage of things 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:03.239
 three four keys to projects already when 

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:05.409
 start to break they increased like 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:07.629
 as a percentage 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:09.659
 the percentage of the likelihood that they are his 

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:10.740
 simply 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.840
 militants to leave the car Platon two 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.180
 somewhere else there 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.449
 well 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:17.939
 Basically factor 

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:20.540
 so we can say that we are all 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.919
 maybe someone did not think so 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:24.680
 short or yes and 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.779
 you can sleep goodbye wedding 

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.240
 change 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.460
 his fskn suffered 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.819
 about 

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:35.659
 need further
