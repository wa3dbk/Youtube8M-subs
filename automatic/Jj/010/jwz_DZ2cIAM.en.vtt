00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
in there Sheldon I really think

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.990 
in there Sheldon I really think
definitely<00:01:34.900> has<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.290> comedic<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.430> comedic

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
definitely has the comedic the comedic

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.120 

juice<00:03:39.530> box<00:03:41.050> this<00:03:42.050> is<00:03:42.200> a<00:03:42.290> show<00:03:42.560> that<00:03:42.590> I

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
juice box this is a show that I

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.600 
juice box this is a show that I
definitely<00:03:43.610> could<00:03:43.940> see<00:03:43.970> myself<00:03:44.120> watching<00:03:44.840> um

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
from start to finish I think big bang

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.320 
from start to finish I think big bang
theory<00:03:48.980> is<00:03:49.130> on<00:03:49.250> like<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.550> fourth<00:03:49.820> season<00:03:50.060> now

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
theory is on like the fourth season now

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.780 
theory is on like the fourth season now
fourth<00:03:50.660> or<00:03:50.810> fifth<00:03:51.020> season<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.740> I'm<00:03:52.040> seriously

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
fourth or fifth season and I'm seriously

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.910 
fourth or fifth season and I'm seriously
contemplating<00:03:53.450> about<00:03:53.510> renting<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.500> dvds<00:03:54.890> or

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
contemplating about renting the dvds or

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.500 
contemplating about renting the dvds or
something<00:03:55.610> like<00:03:55.700> that<00:03:55.760> so<00:03:56.150> I<00:03:56.180> can<00:03:56.360> see

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
something like that so I can see

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.510 
something like that so I can see
everything<00:03:56.930> from<00:03:57.500> start<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.920> finish<00:03:58.190> I<00:03:58.340> think

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
everything from start to finish I think

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.580 
everything from start to finish I think
it's<00:03:58.640> something<00:03:58.820> I'd<00:03:59.030> really<00:03:59.180> like<00:03:59.590> overall

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
it's something I'd really like overall

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.530 
it's something I'd really like overall
it<00:04:00.800> was<00:04:00.920> a<00:04:00.980> really<00:04:01.220> enjoyable<00:04:01.340> pilot<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.390> I

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
it was a really enjoyable pilot and I

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.790 
it was a really enjoyable pilot and I
could<00:04:02.720> definitely<00:04:02.930> see<00:04:03.290> why<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.470> lot<00:04:03.620> of<00:04:03.680> people

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
could definitely see why a lot of people

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.920 
could definitely see why a lot of people
are<00:04:04.100> fans<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:04.520> the<00:04:04.610> show<00:04:04.640> and<00:04:05.060> I'm<00:04:05.240> sure<00:04:05.450> shows

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
get better after pilots always so if

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.970 
get better after pilots always so if
that<00:04:08.300> was<00:04:08.630> as<00:04:08.840> enjoyable<00:04:08.990> as<00:04:09.350> it<00:04:09.500> was<00:04:09.650> I'm<00:04:09.830> sure

here we go in the winter that seat is

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.220 
here we go in the winter that seat is
close<00:04:32.940> enough<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.389> radiator<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.960> remain

close enough to the radiator to remain
warm<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:34.860> yet<00:04:34.980> not<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:35.370> close<00:04:35.610> as<00:04:35.790> to<00:04:35.820> cause

the<00:04:42.210> television<00:04:42.810> at<00:04:42.960> an<00:04:43.050> angle<00:04:43.410> that<00:04:43.500> is

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
the television at an angle that is

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.170 
the television at an angle that is
neither<00:04:43.770> direct<00:04:44.250> thus<00:04:44.580> discouraging

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
create a parallax Distortion I could go

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.300 
create a parallax Distortion I could go
on<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.850> think<00:04:50.850> I've<00:04:50.970> made<00:04:51.120> my<00:04:51.180> point
