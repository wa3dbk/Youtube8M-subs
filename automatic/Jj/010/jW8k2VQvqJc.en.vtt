00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.460
 Well, today it has touched me 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.210
 that demand that there was a little bit the 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.720
 let's free 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.089
 let's start with the assembly workshop 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.840
 of the assembly section and before that 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:35.300
 I want to show you some tests 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.660
 let's talk about today's Indians 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.090
 indian steel in its three varieties the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.750
 dark closed indian who has the color 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.820
 of strong steel the middle closed India 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.560
 it's a little clearer and the Indian 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.920
 light steel 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.050
 among these varieties there is another Indian 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.510
 which is the crystal and a little so that 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.840
 You see the difference I put a leaden 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.330
 below the color of the lead that is very 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.640
 similar to dark steel but the 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.740
 difference is the tone 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.009
 many people 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.110
 He asks what he wants to fish with and always 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:17.320
 I say the same 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.320
 He fished with a single fly all year 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.670
 It is a very simple fly and it is a fly 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.119
 who fishes from April to October 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.770
 He carries two blade feather goose 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.930
 tip behind the neck 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.030
 we set them 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.330
 above you see that I start the assembly at 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.490
 reverse the head first I do it to not 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.890
 then fatigue the head in excessive and 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.219
 with a cdc pen I'm going to do the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.390
 body a rust color 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.580
 orange 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.710
 I'm taking a few million and I'm going 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.710
 rolling them in the assembly age 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.130
 we cover it and we start doing the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.510
 body turned around so that we 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.060
 be lumpy 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.590
 now let's use a pen of 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.250
 lion's neck 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.250
 to make the legs and let's look 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.890
 we're talking about a single big one we're going 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.069
 to look for a wide pen 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.069
 I have set the pen and I will fit the 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.340
 wings 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:30.499
 and I'm going to put them in v and roll them up 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.499
 behind the pen 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.350
 two laps 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.090
 fixing the up done the wings 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.590
 backward 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.590
 and two laps ahead 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.940
 I finish 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.940
 short 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.860
 I cut the tag always as medium 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.750
 centimeter then again it's better that 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.239
 I was a little bit long that did not cut 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.620
 because the length can always be cut 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.620
 and this is the final shot of the fly
