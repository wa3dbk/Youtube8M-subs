00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.379
 original that is without making the effects 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.609
 butterfly not true and you like to play 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.809
 mus we already knew that neither but sure 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.260
 that you like the cartoons of the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.989
 politicians not so in Spain are a success 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.570
 first of all because we can be edges with 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.049
 the politicians and put them green without that 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.190
 these can judge us more or less 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.710
 thanks to the magic of freedom of 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.170
 press because this video game is based 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.700
 in the world of cartoons though 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.090
 for that are the games that are a 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.420
 fuck the domino in a normal way and the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.860
 mus and how not in a fucking town with 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.860
 beret pirulo gaÃ±anes 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.590
 starting copy 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.070
 if you wonder if the game is 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.160
 done with pain you are very wrong the 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.960
 game is from 1995 but long before 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.670
 they will launch windows 98 and well I want 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.260
 say 95 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.530
 also draw with commands was not so 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.320
 easy is more they have difficulties up 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.290
 with the sound I'm the cabo don luis 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.380
 jover I am and been the daughter clan 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.710
 here is the king of the game call me uncle 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.710
 Matthew 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.710
 now that they have touched the range of them 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.690
 the soundtrack is copied from cinema 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.180
 neighborhood and what they recorded when 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.180
 they put the program on television 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.180
 i 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.480
 but the stupidest of these 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.120
 videogames is that their benders do not 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.530
 can not even imitate celebrities 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.620
 It looks like a free wade made with a 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.290
 internet community that goes the freak 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.960
 fun game they give a thousand laps because the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.780
 rules are the same as in the domain and 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.780
 just like the mus to domino will be played but 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.400
 the mus not because I'm more of poker and 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.800
 while you play you can listen to the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.200
 dialogues of celebrities or the odd 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.750
 joke 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.540

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.960
 influenced by the fourth moon 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.570
 waning do not trust him 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.260

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.260

 well go neither the wine nothing 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.950

 music to a friend like my blender 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.170
 impulsive and without qualms you can already 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.170
 prepare 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.520
 the cost of ideas movie preferred 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:45.880
 Snow White and the seven events 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:50.880
 I look in his brain and see I see I do not see anything 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:55.220
 knows more the fox for old and for fox 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.220
 insatiable seeker of his future 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.980
 juanma type that you change them according to me 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.980
 dead gives me a chewing gum 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.900
 ah 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.159
 ah 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.159
 I double 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.010
 blue 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.100
 I need three letters 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.100
 for me one 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.430
 evidently found game 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.430
 gave way 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.370
 I do not want beans 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.870
 I pass and I give birth 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.400
 the game was sold to all 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.560
 public since that of those 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.030
 video games are considered for children without 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.960
 However, the video game has some 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.960
 very ugly words 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.950
 luigi 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.340
 everything that indicates what royalty 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.409
 playable will end is true and the 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.960
 series is already quite old I like every 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.460
 find more material without forgetting 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.830
 the everyday problems that I have the 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.009
 life I think it will be better and it will end in 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.680
 the 666 I thought that as a final point 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:20.069
 release it on December 21 coinciding 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.530
 with the Mayan prophecy I also dedicate myself 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.000
 a little more to the world of animation and 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.190
 that was what I had in mind before 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.770
 make playable royalty plus I have to 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.199
 being versatile I can not live forever 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.979
 of a single probeza that's why I do 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:37.080
 comics books short films I am 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.569
 versatile as leonardo da vinci or 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.759
 Jesus Christ and although I finished doing 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:44.909
 playable is not the end of the 11 oddities 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:46.530
 the others are quite younger and 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:48.810
 when instead I 'll dedicate a little bit to 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.979
 but for now I just want 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.949
 dedicate myself to making productions 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:55.229
 youtube Original yes that 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:56.400
 they want to continue the series when 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.129
 finish you can create our own 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.889
 chapters you just have to follow my 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:02.820
 formula of the chapter the formula of 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:04.800
 royalty 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.470
 and maybe you'll get to do it better 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.440
 that I but for the moment enjoy the 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.910
 last chapters of the series although not 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.820
 it will be the definitive end of royalty 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.620
 playable original will always be the 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.390
 Internet forums - and the odd 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.760
 cosplay that will try to save it from 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.600
 I forget even if I have to pay some 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.600
 strong price
