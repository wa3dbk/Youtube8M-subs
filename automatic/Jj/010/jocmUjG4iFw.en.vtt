hi today I'm going to talk about safety

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.970 
hi today I'm going to talk about safety
and<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:03.360> jam<00:00:03.629> Chuck<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.350> how<00:00:04.589> that<00:00:04.770> works

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
and the jam Chuck and and how that works

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.670 
and the jam Chuck and and how that works
and<00:00:05.100> how<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.310> kind<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.759> get<00:00:05.910> it<00:00:06.060> all<00:00:06.509> set<00:00:06.779> up<00:00:06.930> so

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
and how to kind of get it all set up so

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
and we'll talk about just basic safety

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.950 
and we'll talk about just basic safety
in<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.929> shop<00:00:13.139> all<00:00:14.070> right<00:00:14.250> first<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.610> all<00:00:14.700> I

in the shop all right first of all I
talked<00:00:15.960> about<00:00:15.990> safety<00:00:16.850> the<00:00:17.850> lathe<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.240> a

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
talked about safety the lathe is a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.580 
talked about safety the lathe is a
little<00:00:18.539> different<00:00:18.840> than<00:00:18.930> most<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.199> tools<00:00:19.470> in

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
little different than most the tools in

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.490 
little different than most the tools in
the<00:00:19.680> shop<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:21.150> can<00:00:21.330> suck<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.750> into<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.230> so

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the shop it it can suck you into it so

the shop it it can suck you into it so
you<00:00:22.920> know<00:00:23.039> tools<00:00:23.640> into<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.269> when<00:00:24.449> when<00:00:24.810> you're

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
you know tools into it when when you're

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.900 
you know tools into it when when you're
turning<00:00:25.170> or<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:26.099> can<00:00:26.250> throw<00:00:26.460> stuff<00:00:26.699> at<00:00:26.849> you

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
turning or it can throw stuff at you

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
quite a few things come off the lathe

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.179 
quite a few things come off the lathe
but<00:00:30.810> I've<00:00:30.960> only<00:00:31.050> had<00:00:31.289> one<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.529> them<00:00:31.740> one<00:00:32.160> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
but I've only had one of them one of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.250 
but I've only had one of them one of
them<00:00:32.340> hit<00:00:32.489> me<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:33.059> was<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> ball<00:00:33.480> had<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> small

was trying to get out of the way and it

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.720 
was trying to get out of the way and it
caught<00:00:39.360> me<00:00:39.540> just<00:00:40.050> scrape<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.920> side<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.640> my

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
caught me just scrape the side of my

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.100

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
cheek that's the only thing I've really

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.729 
cheek that's the only thing I've really
had<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:44.219> hit<00:00:44.550> me<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> leg<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.960> keep<00:00:46.590> your

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
had and hit me on the leg but keep your

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.889 
had and hit me on the leg but keep your
toe<00:00:46.950> rest<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.399> up<00:00:47.850> right<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.510> against<00:00:48.840> your

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
toe rest up up right up against your

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.930 
toe rest up up right up against your
work<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.500> not<00:00:49.649> not<00:00:50.129> pulling<00:00:50.550> your<00:00:50.700> tools

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
work so it's not not pulling your tools

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.810 
work so it's not not pulling your tools
down<00:00:51.680> trying<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> pull<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.250> out<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.520> hand

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
down trying to pull it out of your hand

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.209 
down trying to pull it out of your hand
that<00:00:54.510> helps<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.930> lot<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.199> keep<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.039> supported

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that helps a lot to keep it supported

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.599 
that helps a lot to keep it supported
all<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> way<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.629> far<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.609> if

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
all the way up as far as you can if

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
all the way up as far as you can if
you're<00:00:59.850> turning<00:01:00.210> something<00:01:00.420> something<00:01:01.320> big

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
you're turning something something big

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.590 
you're turning something something big
you<00:01:01.829> know<00:01:02.160> turn<00:01:02.550> your<00:01:02.760> lathe<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.090> till<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.570> just

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
you know turn your lathe up till it just

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.509 
you know turn your lathe up till it just
starts<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.140> vibrate<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.799> then<00:01:04.949> back<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.369> off

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
starts to vibrate and then back it off

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.080 
starts to vibrate and then back it off
it<00:01:06.619> you<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.040> want<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> get<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.580> get<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.790> true

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it you you want to get it get it true

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.270 
it you you want to get it get it true
before<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.479> start<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.869> turn<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.200> off<00:01:10.320> turn<00:01:11.250> it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
before you start to turn it off turn it

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.899 
before you start to turn it off turn it
up<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.930> has<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> any<00:01:13.680> sort<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.130> defects<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.790> it

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
up if it has a any sort of defects in it

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.120 
up if it has a any sort of defects in it
you<00:01:15.180> want<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:16.290> careful<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> keep<00:01:16.950> that

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you want to be careful and keep that

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.820 
you want to be careful and keep that
lathe<00:01:17.369> speed<00:01:17.729> down<00:01:18.030> don't<00:01:18.509> don't<00:01:19.080> turn<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> up

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
lathe speed down don't don't turn it up

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.350 
lathe speed down don't don't turn it up
too<00:01:20.040> much

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
too much

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.800 
too much
and<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.650> speed<00:01:23.009> depends<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> size<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.659> it

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and that speed depends on the size of it

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.530 
and that speed depends on the size of it
so<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:25.619> not<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.280> general<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.360> run

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
so it's not just a general you can run

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.590 
so it's not just a general you can run
it<00:01:27.659> at<00:01:27.810> 1500<00:01:28.500> rpm<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.850> whatever<00:01:30.240> you

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
it at 1500 rpm or you know whatever you

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.980 
it at 1500 rpm or you know whatever you
need<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> need<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.509> decide<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.750> piece<00:01:33.960> of

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
need to need to decide on the piece of

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.100 
need to need to decide on the piece of
wood<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.740> need<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> know<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.869> large

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
wood you need to know if it's a large

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.990 
wood you need to know if it's a large
large<00:01:37.560> piece<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> defect<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.610> need<00:01:38.909> to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
large piece with the defect you need to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.969 
large piece with the defect you need to
back<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.210> off<00:01:39.570> or<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:40.110> you're<00:01:40.350> turning<00:01:40.590> pins

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
back it off or if you're turning pins

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
can't even see that a defect in the wood

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.800 
can't even see that a defect in the wood
and<00:03:29.890> until<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.220> start<00:03:30.489> turning<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.360> so

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
and until you start turning it and so

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.039 
and until you start turning it and so
you<00:03:31.930> don't<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.290> just<00:03:32.320> don't<00:03:32.590> know<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:34.690> be

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
you don't you just don't know so just be

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.850 
you don't you just don't know so just be
as<00:03:35.170> safe<00:03:35.410> as<00:03:35.620> possible<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:36.430> try<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.860> minimize

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
as safe as possible and try and minimize

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.460 
as safe as possible and try and minimize
the<00:03:39.100> risk<00:03:39.130> so<00:03:39.760> all<00:03:40.660> right<00:03:40.810> let's<00:03:40.840> go<00:03:41.230> ahead<00:03:41.290> and

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
the risk so all right let's go ahead and

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.069 
the risk so all right let's go ahead and
talk<00:03:41.620> about<00:03:41.670> jam<00:03:42.670> Chuck<00:03:42.700> all<00:03:43.420> right<00:03:43.600> so<00:03:43.959> when

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
talk about jam Chuck all right so when

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.870 
talk about jam Chuck all right so when
you're<00:03:44.170> doing<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.440> jam<00:03:44.650> Chuck<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:45.070> want<00:03:45.340> want

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
you're doing a jam Chuck you want want

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.750 
you're doing a jam Chuck you want want
this<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.299> be<00:03:46.450> parallel<00:03:47.019> with<00:03:47.079> with<00:03:47.709> this<00:03:48.010> so<00:03:48.549> it

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
this to be parallel with with this so it

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.360 
this to be parallel with with this so it
has<00:03:48.940> as<00:03:49.090> much<00:03:49.239> wood<00:03:49.840> contact<00:03:50.380> as<00:03:50.560> possible<00:03:51.190> and

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
has as much wood contact as possible and

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.069 
has as much wood contact as possible and
you<00:03:52.030> want<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.299> leave<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.480> little<00:03:52.750> bit<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:53.019> a

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
you want to leave a little bit of a

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.229 
you want to leave a little bit of a
collar<00:03:53.350> on<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.370> has<00:03:54.549> something<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:55.090> butt

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
collar on it so it has something to butt

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.710 
collar on it so it has something to butt
up<00:03:55.390> against<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.260> that<00:03:56.470> it<00:03:56.650> will<00:03:57.010> true<00:03:57.310> up<00:03:57.430> and

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
up against so that it will true up and

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.800 
up against so that it will true up and
you<00:03:58.720> want<00:03:58.959> it<00:03:59.079> to<00:04:01.260> seat<00:04:02.260> all<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.590> way<00:04:02.739> down<00:04:03.810> and

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
you want it to seat all the way down and

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.740 
you want it to seat all the way down and
you<00:04:05.620> want<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.340> be<00:04:06.459> fairly<00:04:06.760> tight<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:07.480> it'll

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
you want it to be fairly tight so it'll

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.590 
you want it to be fairly tight so it'll
run<00:04:07.930> run<00:04:08.500> true<00:04:08.890> if<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.790> still<00:04:10.030> had<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.269> tenon

on here you bring the tail stock up to

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.970 
on here you bring the tail stock up to
the<00:04:13.090> tenon<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:13.570> you<00:04:13.930> can<00:04:14.079> turn<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.470> majority

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
the tenon and you can turn the majority

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.280 
the tenon and you can turn the majority
of<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.160> tenon<00:04:15.489> off<00:04:15.780> even<00:04:16.780> if<00:04:16.870> you're<00:04:16.989> doing

can turn the majority to tenon off

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.350 
can turn the majority to tenon off
before<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.400> have<00:04:21.520> to<00:04:21.640> pull<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.910> tail<00:04:22.120> stock

you<00:04:46.450> undercut<00:04:46.990> this<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.170> little<00:04:47.380> bit<00:04:47.590> it'll<00:04:47.830> be

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
you undercut this a little bit it'll be

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.920 
you undercut this a little bit it'll be
tight<00:04:48.280> when<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.580> first<00:04:48.760> put<00:04:49.030> it<00:04:49.120> on<00:04:49.240> and<00:04:49.540> then

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
tight when you first put it on and then

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.440 
tight when you first put it on and then
just<00:04:49.960> loosen<00:04:50.500> up<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:50.740> flop<00:04:51.250> around<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:51.940> it's

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
just loosen up and flop around and it's

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.970 
just loosen up and flop around and it's
the<00:04:52.570> same<00:04:52.870> with<00:04:53.020> this<00:04:53.230> you<00:04:53.410> want<00:04:53.650> them<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.860> be

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
the same with this you want them to be

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.400 
the same with this you want them to be
be<00:04:54.610> parallel<00:04:55.090> so<00:04:55.270> it's<00:04:55.450> a<00:04:55.540> nice<00:04:55.720> tight<00:04:55.990> fitting

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
be parallel so it's a nice tight fitting

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.030 
be parallel so it's a nice tight fitting
you<00:04:56.560> get<00:04:57.070> that<00:04:57.250> little<00:04:57.430> pop<00:04:57.760> on<00:04:58.000> it<00:04:58.180> so<00:04:58.750> on<00:04:59.410> the

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
you get that little pop on it so on the

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.240 
you get that little pop on it so on the
jam<00:05:00.280> Chuck<00:05:01.260> they<00:05:02.260> come<00:05:02.500> in<00:05:02.590> handy<00:05:02.740> got<00:05:02.980> a<00:05:03.010> lot

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
jam Chuck they come in handy got a lot

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.160 
jam Chuck they come in handy got a lot
of<00:05:03.280> stuff<00:05:03.580> especially<00:05:03.730> little<00:05:04.360> boxes<00:05:04.810> I<00:05:04.960> use

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
of stuff especially little boxes I use

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.740 
of stuff especially little boxes I use
them<00:05:05.380> on<00:05:05.500> on<00:05:05.950> almost<00:05:06.610> all<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.030> boxes<00:05:07.390> I<00:05:07.540> make

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
them on on almost all the boxes I make

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.950 
them on on almost all the boxes I make
there<00:05:07.960> they're<00:05:08.670> just<00:05:09.670> invaluable<00:05:10.210> I<00:05:10.660> think

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
there they're just invaluable I think

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.960 
there they're just invaluable I think
all<00:05:11.560> right<00:05:11.620> I<00:05:11.860> hope<00:05:12.070> that<00:05:12.280> cleared<00:05:12.550> it<00:05:12.640> up<00:05:12.790> I

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
all right I hope that cleared it up I

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.820 
all right I hope that cleared it up I
just<00:05:13.330> try<00:05:13.540> and<00:05:13.600> keep<00:05:13.690> them<00:05:13.810> parallel<00:05:14.020> and<00:05:14.560> put

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
just try and keep them parallel and put

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.960 
just try and keep them parallel and put
a<00:05:14.860> little<00:05:15.010> collar<00:05:15.310> on<00:05:15.520> there<00:05:15.670> so<00:05:15.820> it<00:05:15.910> has

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
a little collar on there so it has

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.590 
a little collar on there so it has
something<00:05:16.390> to<00:05:16.420> seat<00:05:16.690> up<00:05:16.810> against<00:05:17.260> I<00:05:18.130> like<00:05:18.940> I

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
something to seat up against I like I

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.460 
something to seat up against I like I
was<00:05:20.140> doing<00:05:20.470> a<00:05:20.620> baby<00:05:21.490> rattle<00:05:22.320> something<00:05:23.320> like

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
was doing a baby rattle something like

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.800 
was doing a baby rattle something like
this<00:05:23.710> I<00:05:23.890> used<00:05:24.610> Jam<00:05:24.880> talk<00:05:25.120> on<00:05:25.270> a<00:05:25.300> tube<00:05:25.570> but

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
this I used Jam talk on a tube but

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.870 
this I used Jam talk on a tube but
basically<00:05:26.230> just<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.710> sand<00:05:26.980> it<00:05:27.100> so<00:05:27.580> there's

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
basically just to sand it so there's

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.760 
basically just to sand it so there's
very<00:05:28.150> little<00:05:28.330> contact<00:05:28.840> on<00:05:29.080> the<00:05:29.170> wood<00:05:29.320> too<00:05:29.590> but

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
very little contact on the wood too but

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.670 
very little contact on the wood too but
it's<00:05:29.920> just<00:05:30.040> put<00:05:31.050> something<00:05:32.050> for<00:05:32.320> it<00:05:32.380> to<00:05:32.440> seat

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
it's just put something for it to seat

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.790 
it's just put something for it to seat
on<00:05:32.710> here<00:05:33.100> and<00:05:33.780> turn<00:05:34.780> it<00:05:34.930> down<00:05:35.050> and<00:05:35.320> then<00:05:35.410> I<00:05:35.530> just

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
on here and turn it down and then I just

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.100 
on here and turn it down and then I just
just<00:05:36.280> slide<00:05:36.580> them<00:05:36.670> on<00:05:36.820> there<00:05:37.000> and<00:05:37.300> just<00:05:37.600> sand

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
just slide them on there and just sand

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.900 
just slide them on there and just sand
up<00:05:38.260> the<00:05:38.410> very<00:05:38.590> top<00:05:38.890> of<00:05:39.070> it<00:05:39.220> when<00:05:39.610> I'm<00:05:39.730> doing

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
up the very top of it when I'm doing

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.210 
up the very top of it when I'm doing
something<00:05:40.150> like<00:05:40.270> that<00:05:40.500> all<00:05:41.500> right<00:05:41.680> I<00:05:41.920> hope

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
something like that all right I hope

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.220 
something like that all right I hope
that<00:05:42.400> helped<00:05:42.670> clear<00:05:43.540> up<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.780> question<00:05:44.080> about

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
that helped clear up the question about

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
that helped clear up the question about
the<00:05:44.410> tenon<00:05:44.980> and<00:05:45.910> just<00:05:46.420> don't<00:05:46.840> forget<00:05:47.160> try<00:05:48.160> and

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
the tenon and just don't forget try and

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.670 
the tenon and just don't forget try and
work<00:05:48.370> as<00:05:48.520> safe<00:05:48.700> as<00:05:48.880> possible<00:05:49.060> it's<00:05:49.690> it's

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
work as safe as possible it's it's

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.440 
work as safe as possible it's it's
there's<00:05:50.950> always<00:05:51.130> going<00:05:51.460> to<00:05:51.820> be<00:05:51.880> a<00:05:51.970> risk<00:05:52.210> but

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
there's always going to be a risk but

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.110 
there's always going to be a risk but
you<00:05:52.630> can<00:05:52.840> minimize<00:05:53.650> a<00:05:53.890> lot<00:05:54.160> of<00:05:54.280> them<00:05:54.400> with<00:05:54.640> just

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
you can minimize a lot of them with just

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.480 
you can minimize a lot of them with just
some<00:05:55.270> basic<00:05:55.300> basic<00:05:56.020> things<00:05:56.050> but<00:05:56.410> next<00:05:57.280> week

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
some basic basic things but next week

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.730 
some basic basic things but next week
I'm<00:05:57.670> gonna<00:05:57.820> do<00:05:58.060> a<00:05:58.090> sharpening<00:05:58.780> video<00:05:59.080> but

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
I'm gonna do a sharpening video but

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.470
