00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
custom paint job because the paint

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.219 
custom paint job because the paint
pretty<00:01:38.790> much<00:01:38.939> cost<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.420> same<00:01:39.600> regardless<00:01:40.020> of

I'm going to show you that's very subtle
that<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:32.020> makes<00:04:32.260> a<00:04:32.380> big<00:04:32.500> difference<00:04:32.920> in

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
that that makes a big difference in

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.240 
that that makes a big difference in
terms<00:04:33.220> of<00:04:33.700> of<00:04:34.600> appearance<00:04:35.170> is<00:04:35.350> by<00:04:35.980> adding

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
terms of of appearance is by adding

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.310 
terms of of appearance is by adding
things<00:04:36.670> in<00:04:37.000> underneath<00:04:37.540> of<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.870> paint<00:04:38.080> or

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
paint and if you look down here since

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.520 
paint and if you look down here since
this<00:04:42.580> is<00:04:42.760> a<00:04:42.790> big<00:04:43.030> off-road<00:04:43.540> four-wheel-drive

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
this is a big off-road four-wheel-drive

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.190 
this is a big off-road four-wheel-drive
truck<00:04:45.070> we<00:04:45.280> implemented<00:04:45.970> in<00:04:46.210> some<00:04:46.690> what's

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
truck we implemented in some what's

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.070 
truck we implemented in some what's
called<00:04:47.410> rocker<00:04:47.710> guard<00:04:48.100> that<00:04:48.760> we<00:04:49.000> painted<00:04:49.510> the

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
called rocker guard that we painted the

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.230 
called rocker guard that we painted the
same<00:04:50.320> color<00:04:50.380> as<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.250> rest<00:04:51.430> of<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:51.730> truck<00:04:51.970> and

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
same color as the rest of the truck and

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.240 
same color as the rest of the truck and
we<00:04:52.540> just<00:04:52.870> broke<00:04:53.110> it<00:04:53.260> with<00:04:53.350> a<00:04:53.410> tape<00:04:53.680> line<00:04:53.980> and

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
we just broke it with a tape line and

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.010 
we just broke it with a tape line and
sprayed<00:04:54.460> this<00:04:54.670> on<00:04:54.910> and<00:04:55.150> then<00:04:55.240> painted<00:04:55.630> over<00:04:55.900> it

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
sprayed this on and then painted over it

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.770 
sprayed this on and then painted over it
and<00:04:56.560> this<00:04:56.710> adds<00:04:56.950> some<00:04:57.220> lower<00:04:57.670> protection<00:04:58.660> from

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
and this adds some lower protection from

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.930 
and this adds some lower protection from
rock<00:04:59.020> chips<00:04:59.320> and<00:04:59.560> gives<00:04:59.920> the<00:05:00.070> truck<00:05:00.310> a<00:05:00.340> heavier

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
rock chips and gives the truck a heavier

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.080 
rock chips and gives the truck a heavier
duty<00:05:01.240> look<00:05:01.420> without<00:05:02.400> making<00:05:03.400> it<00:05:03.550> stand<00:05:03.850> out

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
duty look without making it stand out

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.210 
duty look without making it stand out
like<00:05:04.360> if<00:05:04.570> this<00:05:04.720> were<00:05:04.930> black<00:05:05.230> then<00:05:05.950> it<00:05:06.100> would

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
like if this were black then it would

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.870 
like if this were black then it would
look<00:05:06.400> it<00:05:07.300> would<00:05:07.450> it<00:05:07.630> would<00:05:07.690> stand<00:05:07.990> out<00:05:08.200> so

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
look it would it would stand out so

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.240 
look it would it would stand out so
implementing<00:05:09.880> in<00:05:10.000> things<00:05:10.330> like<00:05:10.420> that<00:05:10.570> can<00:05:11.140> be

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
implementing in things like that can be

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.610 
implementing in things like that can be
really<00:05:12.250> easy<00:05:12.610> simple<00:05:13.540> things<00:05:13.780> to<00:05:14.050> do<00:05:14.200> that

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
really easy simple things to do that

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.500 
really easy simple things to do that
will<00:05:15.310> make<00:05:15.490> your<00:05:15.610> paint<00:05:15.850> job<00:05:15.940> look<00:05:16.270> very
