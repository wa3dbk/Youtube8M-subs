 Well really I Allais did you say that was purchased Do Tteyuu from or is 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:46.230
 I thought it might be time to wait until the new product presentation and buy a new guy, but something like that 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.200

 Such money will not be spent waiting for the new presentation 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:04.170
 Recently due 6 of the depreciation of the yen 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:06.800
 I thought that the absolute price would be high, but I thought it would be bought before the price was high and bought 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.800
 Did 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:18.340

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.369

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.750
 Connection with television 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:52.510
