00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
your graphics card which speaking of

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.539 
your graphics card which speaking of
this<00:01:50.490> case<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.149> fit<00:01:51.420> GPUs<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.649> 330

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.370 
this case can fit GPUs up to 330
millimeters<00:01:54.270> there's<00:01:54.630> also<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.140> nicely

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
millimeters there's also this nicely

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.319

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
thought out bracket which fantex calls

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.840 
thought out bracket which fantex calls
the<00:01:57.799> multifunctional<00:01:58.860> mid<00:01:59.189> plate<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.700> this

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the multifunctional mid plate and this

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.670 
the multifunctional mid plate and this
plate<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.180> hold<00:02:00.540> an<00:02:00.689> additional<00:02:01.170> hard<00:02:01.409> drive

water<00:02:05.040> cooling<00:02:05.340> reservoir<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.659> this

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
water cooling reservoir now I like this

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.330 
water cooling reservoir now I like this
a<00:02:06.869> lot<00:02:07.020> because<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.680> gives<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.039> additional

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
a lot because it gives you additional

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.699 
a lot because it gives you additional
storage<00:02:08.879> or<00:02:09.179> cooling<00:02:09.569> solutions<00:02:10.110> all<00:02:10.319> without

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
storage or cooling solutions all without

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.650 
storage or cooling solutions all without
blocking<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.310> graphics<00:02:11.790> card<00:02:12.090> which<00:02:12.390> sits

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
blocking the graphics card which sits

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.550 
blocking the graphics card which sits
just<00:02:12.780> underneath

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
just underneath

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.199 
just underneath
and<00:02:13.830> another<00:02:14.100> great<00:02:14.340> thing<00:02:14.550> about<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.970> case

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
and another great thing about this case

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.930 
and another great thing about this case
is<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.480> removable<00:02:16.230> radiator<00:02:17.100> bracket<00:02:17.730> but

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
is the removable radiator bracket but

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.000 
is the removable radiator bracket but
all<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.270> takes<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.630> four<00:02:19.140> screws<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.740> this

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
all it takes is four screws and this

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.250 
all it takes is four screws and this
plate<00:02:20.310> slides<00:02:20.730> out<00:02:21.000> which<00:02:21.450> makes<00:02:21.750> radiator

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
plate slides out which makes radiator

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.070 
plate slides out which makes radiator
installation<00:02:23.010> much<00:02:23.550> easier<00:02:23.580> in<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.480> small<00:02:24.780> case

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
installation much easier in a small case

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.590 
installation much easier in a small case
and<00:02:25.380> this<00:02:25.950> bracket<00:02:26.400> supports<00:02:26.790> radiators<00:02:27.360> up

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
and this bracket supports radiators up

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.260 
and this bracket supports radiators up
to<00:02:27.870> 280<00:02:28.740> millimeters<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.670> speaking<00:02:30.180> of

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
to 280 millimeters and speaking of

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.620 
to 280 millimeters and speaking of
radiators<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.230> case<00:02:31.500> supports<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.630> 240
