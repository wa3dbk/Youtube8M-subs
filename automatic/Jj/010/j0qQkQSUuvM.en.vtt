00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hi I'm Tim Gipson and I want to talk to

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.700 
hi I'm Tim Gipson and I want to talk to
you<00:00:03.149> about<00:00:03.210> how<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.570> loosen<00:00:03.990> that<00:00:04.080> stuck<00:00:04.380> screw

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
you about how to loosen that stuck screw

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.920 
you about how to loosen that stuck screw
now<00:00:05.520> what<00:00:05.730> I've<00:00:05.819> done<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.150> I've<00:00:06.299> just<00:00:06.480> put<00:00:06.720> some

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
now what I've done is I've just put some

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.770 
now what I've done is I've just put some
screws<00:00:07.460> here<00:00:08.460> in<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.760> wood<00:00:08.940> block<00:00:09.210> just<00:00:09.630> so

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
screws here in this wood block just so

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.820 
screws here in this wood block just so
we<00:00:09.900> can<00:00:10.050> demonstrate<00:00:10.290> some<00:00:10.830> things<00:00:11.099> but<00:00:12.830> you

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
we can demonstrate some things but you

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.499 
we can demonstrate some things but you
have<00:00:13.950> different<00:00:14.130> reasons<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:15.089> screws<00:00:15.360> are

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
have different reasons that screws are

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.810 
have different reasons that screws are
stuck<00:00:15.809> now<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.500> may<00:00:16.770> have<00:00:17.010> where<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.609> heads

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
stuck now you may have where the heads

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.849 
stuck now you may have where the heads
have<00:00:17.910> gotten<00:00:18.210> stripped<00:00:18.510> out<00:00:18.779> where<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.710> may

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
have gotten stripped out where you may

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.269 
have gotten stripped out where you may
run<00:00:20.039> into<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.340> situation<00:00:20.840> where<00:00:21.840> you've<00:00:22.619> got<00:00:22.890> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
run into a situation where you've got a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.929 
run into a situation where you've got a
bolt<00:00:23.910> or<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.570> screw<00:00:24.990> that's<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.220> metal<00:00:26.550> parts

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
bolt or a screw that's in metal parts

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.470 
bolt or a screw that's in metal parts
and<00:00:27.090> those<00:00:27.300> tend<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.660> rust<00:00:27.930> now<00:00:28.769> first<00:00:29.179> if<00:00:30.179> it's

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
and those tend to rust now first if it's

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.759 
and those tend to rust now first if it's
just<00:00:30.689> rust<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.140> you're<00:00:31.289> dealing<00:00:31.590> with<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
just rust that you're dealing with a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.979 
just rust that you're dealing with a
screw<00:00:32.189> that's<00:00:32.340> stuck<00:00:32.669> then<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.630> want<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.870> use

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
screw that's stuck then you want to use

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.280 
screw that's stuck then you want to use
something<00:00:34.320> like<00:00:34.410> wd-40<00:00:35.750> wd-40<00:00:36.750> will<00:00:36.870> actually

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
something like wd-40 wd-40 will actually

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.350 
something like wd-40 wd-40 will actually
penetrate<00:00:37.500> down<00:00:38.070> into<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.460> screw<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.090> many

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
penetrate down into a screw and many

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.920 
penetrate down into a screw and many
times<00:00:39.719> will<00:00:40.910> loosen<00:00:41.910> up<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.210> rust<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.780> allow

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
times will loosen up that rust and allow

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.260 
times will loosen up that rust and allow
you<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.170> get<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.500> stuck<00:00:43.739> screw<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
you to get that stuck screw out and it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.910 
you to get that stuck screw out and it
simply<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.960> want<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.260> spray<00:00:46.530> down<00:00:46.770> at

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
simply you just want to spray down at

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.350 
simply you just want to spray down at
the<00:00:47.039> base<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.579> know<00:00:47.969> I'll<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.090> demonstrate

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the base you know I'll just demonstrate

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.319 
the base you know I'll just demonstrate
on<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.020> right<00:00:49.289> now

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
on this right now

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.389 
on this right now
now<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> screw<00:00:52.110> still<00:00:52.590> does<00:00:52.770> not<00:00:52.949> come<00:00:53.250> out

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
now if the screw still does not come out

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.880 
now if the screw still does not come out
after<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.030> spray<00:00:54.390> then<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.530> want<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> do

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
after you spray then what you want to do

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.410 
after you spray then what you want to do
is<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.070> want<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.309> take<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:56.610> screwdriver<00:00:56.910> in

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
is you want to take your screwdriver in

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.260 
is you want to take your screwdriver in
this<00:00:57.600> case<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> Phillips<00:00:58.710> head<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
this case this is the Phillips head and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.229 
this case this is the Phillips head and
just<00:01:00.270> give<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> couple<00:01:01.460> gentle<00:01:02.460> taps<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
just give a couple gentle taps with a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
just give a couple gentle taps with a
hammer<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.320> lot<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.530> times<00:01:04.830> what<00:01:05.070> that'll

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
hammer and a lot of times what that'll

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.020 
hammer and a lot of times what that'll
do<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.670> that'll<00:01:05.880> loosen<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.510> rust<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:08.030> now

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
do is that'll loosen that rust up now

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.420 
do is that'll loosen that rust up now
also<00:01:09.240> important<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> consider<00:01:10.200> when<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.220> deal

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
also important to consider when you deal

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.160 
also important to consider when you deal
with<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.909> screw<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.390> has<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> Phillips<00:01:13.080> head

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
with a screw that has a Phillips head

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.280 
with a screw that has a Phillips head
such<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.890> which<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.369> cross<00:01:14.760> pattern

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
such as this which is that cross pattern

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.480 
such as this which is that cross pattern
you<00:01:16.290> want<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.500> make<00:01:16.650> sure<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.950> use<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> right

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you want to make sure you use the right

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.820 
you want to make sure you use the right
size<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.020> number<00:01:19.259> one<00:01:19.439> Phillips

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
size this is the number one Phillips

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.679 
size this is the number one Phillips
head<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.430> number<00:01:20.729> two<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.509> for

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
head this is a number two so this is for

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.450 
head this is a number two so this is for
really<00:01:21.930> small<00:01:21.990> screw<00:01:22.530> heads<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.340> you're

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
really small screw heads so if you're

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
really small screw heads so if you're
trying<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.960> loosen<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.200> stuck<00:01:25.409> screw

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
trying to get loosen up a stuck screw

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.320 
trying to get loosen up a stuck screw
make<00:01:25.830> sure<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.159> using<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.580> right<00:01:26.640> sized<00:01:27.030> head

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
make sure you using the right sized head

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.350 
make sure you using the right sized head
and<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.659> will<00:01:27.780> help<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.110> out

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
and that will help you out

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.899 
and that will help you out
now<00:01:30.360> if<00:01:30.720> tapping<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.590> doesn't<00:01:32.310> work<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
now if tapping it doesn't work and you

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.469 
now if tapping it doesn't work and you
still<00:01:33.180> got<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:34.070> stuck<00:01:35.070> screw<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.329> also

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
still got a stuck screw you can also

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.499 
still got a stuck screw you can also
take<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.869> file<00:01:37.200> such<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.299> can

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
take a file such as this and you can

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.499 
take a file such as this and you can
file<00:01:40.040> each<00:01:41.040> side<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> screw<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.299> you

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
file each side of the screw so that you

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.389 
file each side of the screw so that you
have<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> flat<00:01:42.990> surface<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.710> both<00:01:43.890> sides<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
have a flat surface on both sides of the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.359 
have a flat surface on both sides of the
screw<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.840> then<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.829> take<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> pair<00:01:47.340> of

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
screw and then you can take a pair of

to put in the top you would drill down

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.970 
to put in the top you would drill down
into<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.390> top<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.840> screw<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.380> then<00:02:31.830> you

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
into the top of the screw and then you

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.680 
into the top of the screw and then you
would<00:02:32.130> use<00:02:32.160> an<00:02:32.430> extractor<00:02:33.030> like<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.480> to

would use an extractor like this to
remove<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:35.239> I'm<00:02:36.239> Tim<00:02:36.540> Gipson<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.140> that's

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
remove that I'm Tim Gipson and that's

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.269 
remove that I'm Tim Gipson and that's
some<00:02:37.620> tips<00:02:37.739> on<00:02:38.160> how<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.370> remove<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.790> stuck<00:02:38.819> screw
