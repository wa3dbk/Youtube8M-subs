00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.450
 welcome to the many points like 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:13.710
 I will introduce you to the backpack 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.200
 futura vario 50 + 10 doctor is the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.980
 version 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.960
 women the 45 + 10 and that of ali years 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.900
 a fax relationship and convince 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.220
 braces a little thinner also at 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.740
 waist level of the hips with 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.730
 a shape also a little bit 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.739
 different adapted to the morphology 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:35.489
 so ends the interest and the specificity 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:39.280
 of this bag knows that it will be well suited 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.420
 for hiking in hot weather because 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.540
 that he will ensure a very good 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.560
 back ventilation and he uses a back 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:50.170
 nets stretched in it allows for 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.010
 maintain a permanent space between the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.329
 bag and back and so a circulation of 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.430
 the air that will be permanent 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.260
 so that's a characteristic 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.920
 found in general rather on 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.600
 thresholds of small literate doctor and the 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.799
 specialist and who was there then 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.479
 developed for 1.5 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:12.579
 how crashes you see we have in 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:18.009
 permanently this space between the back and of 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:22.450
 his gallery then the principle is a 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.189
 aluminum frame inside that goes 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.960
 ensure both the deferral of charges 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.119
 on the hip belt is also 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.990
 who will stretch the net and maintain 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.810
 permanence this distance between the bag 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.189
 and the back we also have a 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.560
 interesting feature is that 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.229
 whereas with a parade in general 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.539
 does not have any height adjustment 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.719
 models here to clothe to develop a 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.520
 system that will allow to adjust the 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.389
 height of the straps in relation to the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.740
 size of the person 

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:53.799
 so we are really with the same 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.069
 features that 1.5 large liter 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:00.849
 traditional then we're on a 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.560
 padding so with a foam that 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:05.880
 perforated blunt so there too for 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.880
 promote evacuation 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.160
 liberation so as I told you we 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.530
 is really about a bag designed for 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.489
 resale it is at maximum and so well 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.010
 suitable for hikes by slicing 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.330
 the downside compared to those over 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.120
 extension is that I do not advise 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.670
 earlier for him average load 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.720
 because if you want we are really 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.310
 loaded it is better maybe 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.410
 to use a classic sagan with a 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.180
 expected carry of water to have really 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:42.390
 the charge for cars other point 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.200
 interesting sax and will find all 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.299
 the classic storage of a coronation in 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.410
 littering so a main compartment 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.709
 which is divided in two with ip access 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.549
 madsack a partition that is removable 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.470
 we have hot interesting direct access 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.010
 inside the bag with an opening 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.010
 bags 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.980
 we can open the bag completely for 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.930
 access to these affairs the militant rummy 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.900
 it is interesting to harass asylum 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.680
 to do without having discharged and then 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.329
 accepts additional from the top of the bag 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.420
 and again it's interesting that 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.670
 we have a good enhancement so in case of 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.769
 need we can possibly load a 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.349
 little foam knowing piece is very 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.989
 rise and that at the same time the flap 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:35.530
 also will be able to adjust a bit in 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.609
 smell to fully cover the answer so 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.650
 at level llodra will find easily 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:45.040
 a big mouth on the top and is 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.230
 also a pocket on the inside side 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.139
 storage we also have storage 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.349
 interesting there is a little pocket on 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:57.430
 the front but we mostly pockets 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:59.290
 sideways so a net pocket for this 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.900
 that we need to keep within reach of 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.840
 the hand for example a blunder of 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:10.000
 snacks and then also a pocket 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.310
 zipped which is extensible so 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.200
 there remains 26 the shipboard load but where 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.079
 it also allows to see the 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.290
 downloads when needed from 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.680
 compression straps and then we go them 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.140
 usual door stick door ice ax and 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.200
 so various seems like they allow 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.140
 to best adjust the bag and the 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.260
 completely charge 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:38.110
 so here we are going to result on a bag that 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.590
 will suit for the average and the 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.860
 long hike moderately loaded and 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.370
 which will be ideal for hikes by 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.169
 warm weather 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.590
 if we want to have good ventilation 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.590
 bull
