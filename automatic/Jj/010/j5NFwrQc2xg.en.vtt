00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.820
 bus everything with you a tip well 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.320
 fast here today I am leaving this 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.730
 ask that I came across this mayor 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.490
 here is a splinter a crack in the 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.820
 truth in the piece has a micro defect 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.970
 What do I need to reappropriate? 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.580
 How's the size right, then? What do I do? 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.470
 I'll do it here, I'll cover this. 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.239
 that exist in the market they do not 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.400
 work well in this type of situation 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.000
 like that two years then I go 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.470
 use 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.030
 I'm going to use a good attack says it 's a 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.979
 quick glue right 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.890
 It could be any other I like until 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:55.489
 that bond because she is not so fast aa 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.940
 drying it so I'll apply here a 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.920
 bit of cola is and I'll get a 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.260
 bit of the dust of the wood I came 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.130
 leaving right doing in the same place and 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.130
 I will tighten 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.100
 OK 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.119
 How small is it not worth it? 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:28.929
 do this dough off I 'll apply one 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.929
 a little more than cola 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.280
 and it was in that defect 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.200
 this spatula here is a piece of 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.170
 silicone to be because it tube silicone 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.619
 and that when the century in the game was 15 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.119
 lake for this type of situation 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:06.810
 ah and it's good that cola does not stick January 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:09.119
 Okay, now let it dry and stuff. 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.780
 I'll show you the result 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.780
 after you're done 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:40.030
 good folks as you can see is still 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:43.480
 that stay is the mark of the crack is by 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.190
 less there is more 11 there is no more one 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.730
 here there is nothing more that 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.489
 How can I pluck a splinter? 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.120
 I ended up here and that little point 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.870
 he 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.959
 it was also closed so I need 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.379
 until the end of that and that 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.150
 cause a depression here in that part 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.109
 in dark woods work until a 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:12.040
 A little better, what I liked about this one. 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:14.019
 technique was because it does not stay 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:20.140
 different when using the base mass of 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:23.769
 white glue that with the mark for example 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.380
 in this piece here, I ended up using this 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.079
 it's the same technique right here ok 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.470
 you can see that there was only one 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:35.290
 TapanÃ£ line focuses on her bank. 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.540
 a line 1 on tone with respect to the 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.079
 wood then really solved the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:45.700
 It's okay, then, this is it. 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:49.030
 I'll leave this one but the one that can save 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.069
 any part and any of someone 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.120
 Why, everybody, a hug to everyone and even the 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.120
 next video 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.659
