have a lot of black girls or watching my

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.500 
videos and I thought this would be
helpful<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:00.870> them<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.010> price<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.300> $20<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
helpful for them so the price is $20 a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.479 
helpful for them so the price is $20 a
month<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:04.890> three<00:01:05.280> month

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
month or you can get three month

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.420 
month or you can get three month
subscription<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:06.439> $55<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.220> how<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
