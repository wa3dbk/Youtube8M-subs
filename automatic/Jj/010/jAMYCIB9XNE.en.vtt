okay<00:00:01.669> this<00:00:02.669> is<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.030> part<00:00:03.810> 3<00:00:04.770> of<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.100> tutorial

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
okay this is the part 3 of the tutorial

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.040 
okay this is the part 3 of the tutorial
what<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.350> did<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.799> define<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.910> project<00:00:09.360> we

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
what we did is we define the project we

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.180 
what we did is we define the project we
write<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.740> code<00:00:10.769> right<00:00:11.990> instruction<00:00:13.070> for<00:00:14.070> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
write the code right instruction for the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.359 
write the code right instruction for the
CPU<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:15.389> write<00:00:15.630> instruction<00:00:17.840> to<00:00:18.840> import<00:00:19.199> or<00:00:19.619> to

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
CPU we write instruction to import or to

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.590 
CPU we write instruction to import or to
use<00:00:21.020> Microsoft's<00:00:22.250> pasta<00:00:23.250> tools<00:00:23.490> Michael<00:00:24.330> is

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
use Microsoft's pasta tools Michael is

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.420 
use Microsoft's pasta tools Michael is
actually<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.230> sieving<00:00:25.590> functions<00:00:26.250> but

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
actually a sieving functions but

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.970 
actually a sieving functions but
assembly<00:00:27.210> they<00:00:27.630> call<00:00:27.840> them<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.650> call<00:00:28.859> them

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
assembly they call them we call them

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.870 
assembly they call them we call them
pasta<00:00:29.429> dough's<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:30.420> define<00:00:30.779> data<00:00:31.019> structure

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
pasta dough's we define data structure

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.209 
pasta dough's we define data structure
we<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.660> written<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.710> main<00:00:35.390> section<00:00:37.219> that's

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
we have written the main section that's

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.240 
we have written the main section that's
actually<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.540> keyword<00:00:39.899> section<00:00:40.160> but<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
actually the keyword section but the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.979 
actually the keyword section but the
main<00:00:41.370> part<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.500> code<00:00:44.120> we<00:00:45.120> push<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
main part of the code we push the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.020 
main part of the code we push the
parameter<00:00:46.469> into<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> stack<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.610> entered

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
parameter into the stack and we entered

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.290 
parameter into the stack and we entered
main<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.710> only<00:00:49.829> thing<00:00:50.039> left<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
main and the only thing left to do is to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.330 
main and the only thing left to do is to
run<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.670> beautiful<00:00:54.629> an

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
run it and so it is beautiful an

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.639 
run it and so it is beautiful an
assembly<00:00:56.340> program<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.510> very<00:00:57.660> easy<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.440> write

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
assembly program was very easy to write

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.299 
assembly program was very easy to write
and<00:00:58.980> believe<00:00:59.940> me<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.480> runs<00:01:00.960> faster<00:01:01.949> than<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
and believe me it runs faster than the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.620 
and believe me it runs faster than the
wind<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:05.189> only<00:01:05.309> thing<00:01:05.489> left<00:01:05.670> after<00:01:06.479> we

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
wind and the only thing left after we

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.469 
wind and the only thing left after we
run<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.900> program<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.619> save<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
run this program and we save it

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.179 
run this program and we save it
basically<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:10.140> know<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.740> very<00:01:10.950> proud

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
basically you know it can be very proud

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.499 
basically you know it can be very proud
of<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.610> did<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.119> actually<00:01:14.509> watch

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
of what we did you can actually watch

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.270 
of what we did you can actually watch
the<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.200> size<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> program<00:01:16.979> it's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the the size of the program it's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.649 
the the size of the program it's
probably<00:01:17.700> under<00:01:18.320> seven<00:01:19.320> or<00:01:19.470> five<00:01:19.860> K's<00:01:20.659> which

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
probably under seven or five K's which

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.289 
probably under seven or five K's which
is<00:01:21.810> cool<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.979> an<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.490> an<00:01:23.580> actual<00:01:23.880> Windows

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
is cool for an for an actual Windows

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.260 
is cool for an for an actual Windows
program<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.590> what<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.890> want<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.189> show<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.430> now

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
program but what I want to show you now

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.830 
program but what I want to show you now
is<00:01:27.540> why<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.810> use<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:27.990> nope<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:29.540> because<00:01:30.540> if

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
is why we use the nope here because if

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.280 
is why we use the nope here because if
you<00:01:30.869> want<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.170> debug<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.560> program<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:33.290> line

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you want to debug this program this line

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.630 
you want to debug this program this line
won't<00:01:34.710> generate<00:01:35.159> any<00:01:35.369> by<00:01:35.909> any<00:01:37.400> debug<00:01:38.400> point

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
won't generate any by any debug point

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.330 
won't generate any by any debug point
steps<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.590> want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> debug<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
steps so if you want to debug the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.929 
steps so if you want to debug the
program<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.450> go<00:01:42.780> start<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
program then we have to go start in the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.230 
program then we have to go start in the
order<00:01:45.210> right<00:01:45.540> after<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:48.360> section<00:01:49.110> start<00:01:50.240> so

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
order right after this section start so

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
order right after this section start so
I'm<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> start<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> push<00:01:52.460> and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
I'm going to start with the push and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.990 
I'm going to start with the push and
look<00:01:54.149> at<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.420> we<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:54.960> even<00:01:55.700> debug<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
look at this we can even debug the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.569 
look at this we can even debug the
program<00:01:57.030> very<00:01:57.840> easily<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> free

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
program very easily this is a free

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.270 
program very easily this is a free
product<00:02:00.140> doesn't<00:02:01.140> cost<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> down<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.100> can

look<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.200> register<00:02:07.649> window<00:02:08.250> here

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
look I have the register window here

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.180 
look I have the register window here
which<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.539> do

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
which you can do

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.840 
which you can do
going<00:02:10.430> to<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.670> back<00:02:10.880> windows<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:12.650> have<00:02:13.250> all

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
going to the back windows and have all

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.050 
going to the back windows and have all
kinds<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:14.780> goodies<00:02:15.140> here<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:16.910> the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
kinds of goodies here this is the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.520 
kinds of goodies here this is the
register<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:20.000> most<00:02:20.660> languages<00:02:21.110> it

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
register and in most languages it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.040 
register and in most languages it
doesn't<00:02:21.830> important<00:02:22.220> but<00:02:22.430> here<00:02:23.390> in<00:02:23.540> assemblies

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
doesn't important but here in assemblies

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.600 
doesn't important but here in assemblies
crucial<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:25.250> look<00:02:25.700> at<00:02:25.820> what<00:02:25.910> we<00:02:26.030> get<00:02:27.190> we<00:02:28.190> got<00:02:28.370> a

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
crucial and look at what we get we got a

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.780 
crucial and look at what we get we got a
X<00:02:29.170> loading<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.290> code<00:02:30.470> addressed<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.340> pushing

it<00:02:31.910> into<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.300> stack<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.990> can<00:02:33.680> see<00:02:34.180> stuck<00:02:35.180> are

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
it into the stack you can see stuck are

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.920 
it into the stack you can see stuck are
you<00:02:36.080> still<00:02:36.320> being<00:02:36.530> changed<00:02:36.970> again<00:02:37.970> here<00:02:39.790> and
