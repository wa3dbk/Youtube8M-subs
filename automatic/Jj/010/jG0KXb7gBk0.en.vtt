of<00:04:44.210> your<00:04:44.360> BMXers<00:04:44.960> are<00:04:45.139> doing<00:04:45.380> this<00:04:45.470> so<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:45.650> guess

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
of your BMXers are doing this so I guess

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.770 
of your BMXers are doing this so I guess
this<00:04:45.979> is<00:04:46.070> probably<00:04:46.220> like<00:04:46.550> one<00:04:46.910> of<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.060> world's

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
this is probably like one of the world's

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.379 
this is probably like one of the world's
oldest<00:04:48.440> fixes<00:04:49.160> it's<00:04:49.669> not<00:04:49.789> a<00:04:49.820> fixed<00:04:50.180> II<00:04:50.240> though

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
oldest fixes it's not a fixed II though

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.540 
oldest fixes it's not a fixed II though
because<00:04:50.930> it<00:04:51.020> is<00:04:51.139> a<00:04:51.169> coaster<00:04:51.560> brake<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:52.220> pedal

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
because it is a coaster brake you pedal

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.529 
because it is a coaster brake you pedal
backwards<00:04:52.759> to<00:04:53.150> brake

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539
