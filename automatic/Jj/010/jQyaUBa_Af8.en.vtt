I<00:00:04.890> will<00:00:05.460> try<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:05.970> explain<00:00:06.839> wet-on-wet<00:00:07.500> Ising

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
I will try to explain wet-on-wet Ising

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.600 
I will try to explain wet-on-wet Ising
one<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.210> my<00:00:09.420> favorite<00:00:10.050> techniques<00:00:10.340> here<00:00:11.340> you

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
one of my favorite techniques here you

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.900 
one of my favorite techniques here you
can<00:00:11.849> see<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.570> easter<00:00:13.080> egg<00:00:13.230> cookie<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.250> icing

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
can see this easter egg cookie the icing

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.870 
can see this easter egg cookie the icing
is<00:00:15.059> completely<00:00:15.690> flat<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.410> colors<00:00:16.890> blend

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
is completely flat the colors blend

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.400 
is completely flat the colors blend
together<00:00:18.230> but<00:00:19.230> still<00:00:19.619> remain<00:00:20.220> separate<00:00:21.410> this

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
together but still remain separate this

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.050 
together but still remain separate this
technique<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.400> little<00:00:23.580> tricky<00:00:23.910> at

experience a little bit less painful try
to<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.480> your<00:00:30.750> design<00:00:31.109> somewhat<00:00:31.769> planned<00:00:32.189> in

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
to have your design somewhat planned in

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.900 
to have your design somewhat planned in

this<00:00:36.600> important<00:00:37.290> factor<00:00:37.829> icing<00:00:38.570> consistency

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
this important factor icing consistency

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.979 
this important factor icing consistency
is<00:00:39.780> key<00:00:40.410> your<00:00:40.739> icing<00:00:41.370> needs<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.270> heal<00:00:42.629> which

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
is key your icing needs to heal which

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.260 
is key your icing needs to heal which
means<00:00:43.350> when<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.040> stir<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> bowl<00:00:45.000> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
means when you stir it in the bowl and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.020 
means when you stir it in the bowl and
then<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.050> stop<00:00:46.410> stirring<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.489> has<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
then you stop stirring it it has to

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.930 
then you stop stirring it it has to
level<00:00:48.390> out<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> bottom<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> bowl<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
level out in the bottom of the bowl and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.200 
level out in the bottom of the bowl and
become<00:00:50.940> completely<00:00:51.420> flat<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.170> level<00:00:53.210> this

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
become completely flat and level this

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.490 
become completely flat and level this
you<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.570> achieved<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.199> correct

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you have achieved the correct

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.560 
you have achieved the correct
consistency<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.460> your<00:00:56.670> master<00:00:57.090> batch<00:00:57.270> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
consistency with your master batch you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.139 
consistency with your master batch you
can<00:00:57.809> split<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.590> then<00:00:58.949> mix<00:00:59.340> your<00:00:59.640> icing

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
can split it up and then mix your icing

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.529 
can split it up and then mix your icing
with<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.199> food<00:01:01.440> color<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:02.010> your<00:01:02.250> choice<00:01:02.579> if

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
with the food color of your choice if

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.109 
with the food color of your choice if
you<00:01:03.600> were<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> say<00:01:04.409> put<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.100> runny<00:01:05.430> or<00:01:05.549> icing

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
you were to say put in a runny or icing

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.120 
you were to say put in a runny or icing
into<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.390> thicker<00:01:06.720> icing<00:01:07.200> what<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.680> will<00:01:07.890> have

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
into a thicker icing what you will have

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.609 
into a thicker icing what you will have
is<00:01:08.490> dense<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.299> your<00:01:09.659> icing<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.500> were

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
is dense in your icing and if you were

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.469 
is dense in your icing and if you were
to<00:01:10.740> put<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> thicker<00:01:11.280> icing<00:01:11.790> into<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.090> runny

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
to put a thicker icing into a runny

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.770 
to put a thicker icing into a runny
icing<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.290> will<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.710> bumps<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.180> icing

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
icing you will get bumps and so icing

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.800 
icing you will get bumps and so icing
consistency<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.740> very<00:01:17.330> important<00:01:18.330> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
consistency is very important to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.740 
consistency is very important to
achieving<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.470> perfectly<00:01:20.070> flat<00:01:20.750> ceramic

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
achieving a perfectly flat ceramic

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.249 
achieving a perfectly flat ceramic
looking<00:01:22.140> finish<00:01:22.729> wet<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.909> wet<00:01:23.939> icing<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.960> on

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
looking finish wet on wet icing is on

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.950 
looking finish wet on wet icing is on
the<00:01:25.530> runny<00:01:25.770> side<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.840> in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the runny side and so if you have it in

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.780 
the runny side and so if you have it in
piping<00:01:28.409> bags<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.040> leave<00:01:29.250> your<00:01:29.369> piping

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
piping bags and you leave your piping

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.450 
piping bags and you leave your piping
bags<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.329> your<00:01:30.600> work<00:01:30.780> surface<00:01:31.009> it<00:01:32.009> will<00:01:32.280> ooze

bags on your work surface it will ooze

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.880 
bags on your work surface it will ooze
out<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.360> may<00:01:33.630> find<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.229> easier<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.740> work

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
out and you may find it easier to work

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.249 
out and you may find it easier to work
in<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.189> squeeze<00:01:35.490> bottle<00:01:35.790> since<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:36.960> put<00:01:37.170> it

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
in a squeeze bottle since you can put it

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.030 
in a squeeze bottle since you can put it
upright<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:38.729> last<00:01:39.000> tip<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.680> try<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.710> be

somewhat sure that you will be

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.560 
somewhat sure that you will be
uninterrupted<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:44.369> moment<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.939> start<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
uninterrupted the moment you start a

this is wet-on-wet the whole thing has
to<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.399> done<00:01:53.490> before<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.360> icing<00:01:54.750> has<00:01:54.930> time<00:01:55.259> to

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
to be done before the icing has time to

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.859 
to be done before the icing has time to
dry<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.640> cannot<00:01:57.000> tend<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.570> crying
