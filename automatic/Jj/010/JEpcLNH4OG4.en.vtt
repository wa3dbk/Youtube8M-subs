00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.520
 Vung Tau is located on a peninsula on the coast of Vietnam. 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.080
 It is only about 125 kilometers from Saigon, so it is a popular place to escape for the weekends. 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.660
 Getting there must be easy. Many bus companies offer trips throughout the day. 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.240
 We chose FUTA Buslines, because of their convenient location. 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.300
 They can be found at 205 Pham Ngu Lao - right in the center of the backpacker resort. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.500
 The bus costs VND 125,000. It is a bit cramped, but it is only 1 hour 30 minutes to Vung Tau. 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.540
 The best way to get around Vung Tau is to rent a motorbike. 

00:00:35.997 --> 00:00:37.997
 Most websites can be seen in 1 day. 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.740
 I never felt that Jesus was my inner. 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.040
 But perhaps, if we go inside of Jesus ... 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.980
 On the southern end of Little Mountain, there is a large statue of Jesus that you can go into. 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.980
 It takes 30 minutes to walk to the top of the hill. 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.521
 Where did he take that boy? 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.020
 For some reason, they closed Jesus. We just sit here waiting. 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.040
 Maybe he needs a break, because he already has all his inner children. 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 Oh my God 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.759
 Something spewed out his anus. 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.260
 That guy pointed at me 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.118
 And he did this 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.300
 right? 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.800
 He said that I would not be inside of Jesus. 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.103
 Are they closed? 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.300
 Is not. 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.796
 He told me specifically. 

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:50.444
 What did you do? 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.260
 I wear short pants. 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.780
 Lesson here: Jesus will not allow you to be inside of him unless you wear pants. 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.520
 Although I never saw Jesus wear his pants. 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.260
 At the peak of Small Mountain is Vung Tau lighthouse. 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.020
 The drive up the hill is nice and the grounds offer great views of the city. 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.020
 Of course, it's closed in the middle of the day, but we are very happy to find a place that sells cold beer. 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.931
 What have you learned about the lighthouse so far? 

00:02:25.864 --> 00:02:27.864
 It was built in 1907. 

00:02:28.595 --> 00:02:30.595
 It is used to burn oil in its lamps. 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.860
 The next stop is Bach Dinh. 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.020
 It is located on Tran Phu Street by the Big Mountain. 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.380
 This is also the website of Phuoc Thang fortress. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.560
 In 1859, Vietnam fired the first shot against France from this position. 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.500
 39 years later, the fortress was demolished 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.720
 and a summer house was built for the governors of Cochinchina. 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.360
 Inside is nice. It contains some artifacts and some interesting furniture. 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.320
 You cannot leave Vung Tau without eating banh khot. 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.480
 It is a small rice cake that is fried and topped with shrimp. 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.500
 Take a piece of lettuce, fill it with your favorite herbs, add some daikon, and place a prawn on top. 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.140
 Then roll it and dip it into the sauce. 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.580
 You can find all over Vung Tau, but the best ones are done at a famous place on Nguyen Truong To Street. 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.900
 Be sure to stop at one of the cafes along the sea 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.160
 Where you can get a generous serving of rum. 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.920
 We spent the rest of the afternoon driving along the coast. 

00:04:11.435 --> 00:04:13.435
 There are 4 beaches in Vung Tau. 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.860
 Back Beach is the longest at 4 km. 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.500
 and also the most tourists. 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.260
 Pineapple and Bai Dau beaches are quite small, depending on the tide. 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.960
 Front Beach is probably the best option if you want to watch the sunset and be close to restaurants. 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.060
 There is also a park that has some interesting statues. 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.060
 We ignored the sand and ended up back at the hotel pool, where it was quiet and the country was refreshing.
