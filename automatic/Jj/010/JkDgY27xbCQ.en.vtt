one of the university's central campuses

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.630 
one of the university's central campuses
so<00:00:57.870> they're<00:00:58.140> gonna<00:00:58.230> freeze<00:00:58.649> all<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.520> these

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
so they're gonna freeze all of these

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.849 
so they're gonna freeze all of these
things<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.449> where<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.140> reproduce

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
things to where they can then reproduce

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.310 
things to where they can then reproduce
and<00:01:02.300> they<00:01:03.300> state<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:03.780> everything<00:01:04.170> has

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
and they state that not everything has

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.520 
and they state that not everything has
to<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.530> kept<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> petri<00:01:05.129> dish<00:01:06.260> they<00:01:07.260> state

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
to be kept in a petri dish they state

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.060 
to be kept in a petri dish they state
that<00:01:07.710> they're<00:01:08.460> they're<00:01:09.210> gonna<00:01:09.360> collect

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
that they're they're gonna collect

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.010 
that they're they're gonna collect
biomaterials<00:01:11.180> from<00:01:12.180> all<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.750> different

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
biomaterials from all the different

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.420 
biomaterials from all the different
branches<00:01:13.229> out<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:13.710> including<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
branches out there including the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.410 
branches out there including the
Botanical<00:01:14.939> Garden<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.680> zoos<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:18.030> these

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
Botanical Garden and the zoos all these

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.920 
Botanical Garden and the zoos all these
different<00:01:18.689> places<00:01:19.159> this<00:01:20.159> program<00:01:20.750> received<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
different places this program received a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.140 
different places this program received a
record<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.759> 1<00:01:23.759> billion<00:01:24.390> rubles

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
record of 1 billion rubles

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.289 
record of 1 billion rubles
so<00:01:27.150> it's<00:01:27.450> massive<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.820> goes<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.119> show

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
so it's massive and it just goes to show

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.440 
so it's massive and it just goes to show
if<00:01:30.540> they<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.560> accomplish<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.310> somewhere<00:01:33.180> in

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
if they can accomplish this somewhere in

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.660 
if they can accomplish this somewhere in
Russia<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.799> world<00:01:35.729> war<00:01:36.030> breaks<00:01:36.360> loose<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
Russia if world war breaks loose and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.700 
Russia if world war breaks loose and
billions<00:01:38.670> are<00:01:38.820> killed<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.329> wiped<00:01:40.140> out<00:01:40.380> if

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
billions are killed and wiped out if

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.200 
billions are killed and wiped out if
this<00:01:41.490> place<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:43.399> protected<00:01:44.399> that's<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.000> thing

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
this place is protected that's the thing

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
this place is protected that's the thing
there's<00:01:45.450> no<00:01:45.600> sense<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.930> building<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.500> up<00:01:46.619> here

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
there's no sense of building it up here

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.139 
there's no sense of building it up here
if<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.130> get<00:01:47.280> wiped<00:01:47.610> out<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.060> they

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
if we can just get wiped out so they

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.780 
if we can just get wiped out so they
better<00:01:48.329> think<00:01:48.570> about<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:50.310> could<00:01:50.610> be

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
better think about that this could be

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.639 
better think about that this could be
one<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.180> those<00:01:51.270> things<00:01:51.509> right<00:01:51.960> out<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.320> movie

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
one of those things right out of a movie

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.560 
one of those things right out of a movie
where<00:01:52.799> people<00:01:53.100> are<00:01:53.729> trying<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.060> locate<00:01:54.420> this

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
place down the road to find all of this

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.899 
place down the road to find all of this
life<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:58.110> I'll<00:01:58.890> be<00:01:59.100> honest<00:01:59.399> with<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.790> in
