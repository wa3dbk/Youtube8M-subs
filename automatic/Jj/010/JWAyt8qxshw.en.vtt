there's so many great things he said
there<00:04:59.289> first<00:04:59.800> of<00:04:59.919> all<00:05:00.039> the<00:05:00.190> comparison

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
there first of all the comparison

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.909 
there first of all the comparison
America<00:05:01.360> is<00:05:01.450> like<00:05:01.570> George<00:05:01.900> Zimmerman<00:05:03.750> sting

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
America is like George Zimmerman sting

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.400 
America is like George Zimmerman sting
and<00:05:05.919> yeah<00:05:06.640> that's<00:05:06.820> kind<00:05:07.030> of<00:05:07.120> true<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:08.169> then<00:05:08.320> he

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
and yeah that's kind of true and then he

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.640 
and yeah that's kind of true and then he
says<00:05:08.850> we<00:05:09.850> have<00:05:10.000> to<00:05:10.150> stop<00:05:10.510> bombing<00:05:10.870> people<00:05:11.200> if

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
says we have to stop bombing people if

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.420 
says we have to stop bombing people if
we<00:05:11.800> want<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.070> be<00:05:12.130> safe<00:05:12.310> over<00:05:12.550> here<00:05:12.580> now<00:05:13.390> look<00:05:13.720> I

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
we want to be safe over here now look I

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.969 
we want to be safe over here now look I
can't<00:05:15.430> stress<00:05:15.789> this<00:05:15.940> point<00:05:16.030> enough<00:05:16.830> that<00:05:17.830> is

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
can't stress this point enough that is

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.390 
can't stress this point enough that is
inarguable<00:05:19.020> that's<00:05:20.020> actually<00:05:20.530> been<00:05:20.710> shown

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
inarguable that's actually been shown

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.200 
inarguable that's actually been shown
via<00:05:22.110> data<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:23.710> what<00:05:23.860> I<00:05:23.919> mean<00:05:24.100> by<00:05:24.250> that<00:05:24.280> is<00:05:24.610> when

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
via data so what I mean by that is when

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.630 
via data so what I mean by that is when
you<00:05:25.300> look<00:05:25.330> at<00:05:25.570> the<00:05:25.720> raw<00:05:26.200> number<00:05:26.680> of<00:05:26.860> terrorists

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
you look at the raw number of terrorists

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.420 
you look at the raw number of terrorists
that<00:05:28.180> exist<00:05:28.539> in<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:28.780> world<00:05:28.810> today<00:05:29.110> and<00:05:29.770> you

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
that exist in the world today and you

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.900 
that exist in the world today and you
compare<00:05:30.970> it<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.710> before<00:05:32.710> we<00:05:32.979> started<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.700> war

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
compare it to before we started the war

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.840 
compare it to before we started the war
on<00:05:34.150> terror<00:05:34.740> there<00:05:35.740> are<00:05:35.950> more<00:05:36.190> terrorists

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
on terror there are more terrorists

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.750 
on terror there are more terrorists
today<00:05:37.740> now<00:05:38.740> think<00:05:38.979> about<00:05:39.070> what<00:05:39.250> that<00:05:39.550> means

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
today now think about what that means

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.040 
today now think about what that means
think<00:05:40.060> about<00:05:40.210> the<00:05:40.300> implications<00:05:40.780> of<00:05:40.840> that<00:05:40.960> you

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
think about the implications of that you

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.390 
think about the implications of that you
know<00:05:41.110> what<00:05:41.229> that<00:05:41.320> means<00:05:41.500> the<00:05:41.890> war<00:05:42.070> on<00:05:42.160> terror

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
know what that means the war on terror

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.420 
know what that means the war on terror
has<00:05:42.460> been<00:05:42.729> an<00:05:42.960> epic<00:05:43.960> and<00:05:44.169> complete<00:05:45.130> failure

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
has been an epic and complete failure

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.089 
has been an epic and complete failure
why<00:05:46.419> because<00:05:46.780> the<00:05:46.900> opposite<00:05:47.440> if<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.680> goal<00:05:47.890> was

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
why because the opposite if the goal was

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.580 
why because the opposite if the goal was
to<00:05:48.220> either<00:05:48.370> limit<00:05:49.180> terrorism<00:05:49.780> or<00:05:49.930> eliminate

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
to either limit terrorism or eliminate

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.520 
to either limit terrorism or eliminate
terrorism<00:05:51.310> /<00:05:51.820> terrorists<00:05:52.690> well<00:05:53.170> you<00:05:53.290> achieve

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
terrorism / terrorists well you achieve

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.390 
terrorism / terrorists well you achieve
the<00:05:53.650> opposite<00:05:54.010> goal<00:05:54.280> you<00:05:54.970> actually<00:05:55.180> flared<00:05:56.080> up

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
the opposite goal you actually flared up

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.380 
the opposite goal you actually flared up
anti-american<00:05:57.400> sentiments<00:05:57.940> and<00:05:58.060> made<00:05:58.240> more

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
anti-american sentiments and made more

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.900 
anti-american sentiments and made more
people<00:05:58.570> join<00:05:59.110> al-qaeda<00:05:59.620> and<00:05:59.920> join<00:06:00.430> radical

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
people join al-qaeda and join radical

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.850 
people join al-qaeda and join radical
groups<00:06:01.120> now<00:06:01.900> why<00:06:02.170> does<00:06:02.320> that<00:06:02.440> happen<00:06:02.590> well

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
groups now why does that happen well

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.020 
groups now why does that happen well
there's<00:06:03.040> actually<00:06:03.310> a<00:06:03.340> very<00:06:03.520> simple<00:06:03.880> reason

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
there's actually a very simple reason

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.640 
there's actually a very simple reason
turns<00:06:04.510> out<00:06:04.690> if<00:06:04.810> you<00:06:04.900> invade<00:06:05.170> Iraq<00:06:05.410> or<00:06:05.590> you
