00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
manipulation she still doesn't really

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.809 
manipulation she still doesn't really
like<00:02:22.049> it<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.260> much<00:02:22.409> but<00:02:22.590> I'm<00:02:23.220> hoping<00:02:23.549> that<00:02:23.610> it

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
like it that much but I'm hoping that it

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.089 
like it that much but I'm hoping that it
will<00:02:23.940> help<00:02:24.120> her<00:02:24.450> with<00:02:24.959> her<00:02:25.019> neck<00:02:25.470> throw<00:02:25.860> back

and<00:02:26.370> stuff<00:02:26.549> like<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.879> but<00:02:27.569> I<00:02:27.629> also<00:02:27.930> think

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
and stuff like that but I also think

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.080 
and stuff like that but I also think
that<00:02:28.500> she's<00:02:28.739> suffering<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.220> little<00:02:29.489> bit<00:02:29.670> from

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
that she's suffering a little bit from

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.580 
that she's suffering a little bit from
silent<00:02:30.870> reflux

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
silent reflux

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.289 
silent reflux
now<00:02:31.920> regular<00:02:32.129> reflux<00:02:32.819> is<00:02:32.940> when<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.150> baby

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
now regular reflux is when the baby

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.390 
now regular reflux is when the baby
projectile<00:02:33.870> vomits<00:02:34.379> they<00:02:34.680> can't<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.160> laying

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
projectile vomits they can't be laying

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.710 
projectile vomits they can't be laying
on<00:02:35.549> their<00:02:35.670> back<00:02:35.700> because<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.269> hurts<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:36.690> bad

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
on their back because it hurts so bad

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.869 
on their back because it hurts so bad
because<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.860> gas<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.430> stuff<00:02:38.610> like<00:02:38.730> that

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
because of the gas and stuff like that

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.020 
because of the gas and stuff like that
are<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.299> acid<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.260> should<00:02:40.410> say<00:02:40.640> with<00:02:41.640> silent

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
are the acid I should say with silent

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.699 
are the acid I should say with silent
reflux<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.540> baby<00:02:42.690> keeps<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.650> they

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
reflux the baby keeps it in and they

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.770 
reflux the baby keeps it in and they
kind<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:43.950> swallow<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.640> back<00:02:44.819> down<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:45.360> they<00:02:45.629> say

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
kind of swallow it back down so they say

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.210 
kind of swallow it back down so they say
it<00:02:45.930> actually<00:02:46.200> can<00:02:46.319> be<00:02:46.349> more<00:02:46.650> painful<00:02:46.890> because

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
it actually can be more painful because

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.680 
it actually can be more painful because
it's<00:02:47.340> like<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.700> acid<00:02:47.849> comes<00:02:48.239> up<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.599> then

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
it's like the acid comes up and then

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.690 
it's like the acid comes up and then
they<00:02:48.780> swallow<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.290> back<00:02:49.470> down<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:50.099> it's<00:02:50.610> very

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
they swallow it back down and it's very

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.580 
they swallow it back down and it's very
common<00:02:51.239> because<00:02:51.780> babies<00:02:52.170> have<00:02:52.319> such<00:02:52.470> an

stuff like that

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.720

of<00:03:02.819> what's<00:03:03.000> making<00:03:03.180> her<00:03:03.480> uncomfortable

because I do notice that she swallows a

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.849 
because I do notice that she swallows a
decent<00:03:06.299> amount<00:03:06.390> when<00:03:06.690> she's<00:03:06.870> up<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.500> she<00:03:07.709> has

decent amount when she's up and she has

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.500 
at home not going anyplace eating a lot
because<00:05:58.560> I'm<00:05:58.920> nursing<00:05:59.250> and<00:05:59.820> starving<00:06:00.270> all<00:06:00.390> the

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
because I'm nursing and starving all the

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.200 
because I'm nursing and starving all the
time<00:06:00.690> and<00:06:01.020> it<00:06:01.590> kind<00:06:01.770> of<00:06:01.890> comforts<00:06:02.640> me<00:06:02.880> in<00:06:03.000> some

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
time and it kind of comforts me in some

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.850 
time and it kind of comforts me in some
weird<00:06:03.360> way<00:06:03.570> knowing<00:06:04.260> that<00:06:04.410> other<00:06:04.560> people

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
weird way knowing that other people

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.970 
weird way knowing that other people
aren't<00:06:04.980> going<00:06:05.280> anywhere<00:06:05.370> any<00:06:06.180> place<00:06:06.240> either

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
aren't going anywhere any place either

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.590 
aren't going anywhere any place either
so<00:06:07.980> that's<00:06:08.400> actually<00:06:08.520> been<00:06:08.790> kind<00:06:08.970> of<00:06:09.030> fun<00:06:09.240> and

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
so that's actually been kind of fun and

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.270 
so that's actually been kind of fun and
I<00:06:09.900> think<00:06:10.110> also<00:06:10.260> it<00:06:10.530> really<00:06:10.620> helps<00:06:10.950> me<00:06:11.070> is<00:06:11.160> my

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
I think also it really helps me is my

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.340 
I think also it really helps me is my
faith<00:06:11.550> because<00:06:12.000> I<00:06:12.090> think<00:06:12.150> in<00:06:12.390> years<00:06:12.570> past<00:06:12.930> I

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
faith because I think in years past I

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.170 
faith because I think in years past I
would<00:06:14.070> have<00:06:14.100> just<00:06:14.340> kind<00:06:14.520> of<00:06:14.610> gotten<00:06:14.880> into<00:06:15.090> the

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
would have just kind of gotten into the

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.000 
would have just kind of gotten into the
depression<00:06:15.570> like<00:06:15.930> oh<00:06:15.990> my<00:06:16.200> gosh<00:06:16.500> this<00:06:16.860> is

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
depression like oh my gosh this is

terrible<00:06:17.040> and<00:06:18.110> just<00:06:19.110> not<00:06:19.530> being<00:06:19.740> able<00:06:19.800> to

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
terrible and just not being able to

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.530 
terrible and just not being able to
leave<00:06:20.100> the<00:06:20.250> house<00:06:20.430> would<00:06:20.730> just<00:06:20.760> drive<00:06:21.360> me

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
leave the house would just drive me

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.230 
leave the house would just drive me
crazy<00:06:21.900> but<00:06:22.590> I<00:06:23.040> think<00:06:23.100> my<00:06:23.340> faith<00:06:23.580> always<00:06:23.850> gives

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240
