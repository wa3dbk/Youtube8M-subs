on instinct I think I'll entire sense
pile<00:03:27.870> then<00:03:28.260> there's<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:29.750> notion<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:31.020> how<00:03:31.200> much

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
pile then there's the notion of how much

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.710 
pile then there's the notion of how much
smoke<00:03:31.770> does<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.220> particular<00:03:32.850> me<00:03:33.060> need<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.569> give
