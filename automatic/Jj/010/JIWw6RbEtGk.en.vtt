00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.169 

so<00:01:09.329> a<00:01:09.359> little<00:01:09.570> secret<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.079> mine<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.859> this<00:01:11.179> with

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:12.179 
so a little secret of mine for this with

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:15.590 
so a little secret of mine for this with
this<00:01:12.359> jug<00:01:12.719> stick<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.500> elastic<00:01:13.950> around<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.600> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
this jug stick and elastic around it the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.929

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
strings from the tea will fit into the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.080 
strings from the tea will fit into the
elastic<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.899> they<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.259> held<00:01:19.439> there

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
elastic so they can be held there
