that<00:00:30.240> I'm<00:00:31.140> gonna<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.969> securing<00:00:32.969> myself<00:00:33.450> up

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
that I'm gonna be securing myself up

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.170 
that I'm gonna be securing myself up
there<00:00:33.660> when<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.710> my<00:00:35.219> little<00:00:35.430> pump<00:00:35.850> I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
there when I do my little pump I

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.020 
there when I do my little pump I
actually<00:00:36.360> give<00:00:36.719> myself<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.440> little<00:00:37.829> room<00:00:38.030> where

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
actually give myself a little room where

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.299 
actually give myself a little room where
I'm<00:00:39.180> weightless<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> millisecond<00:00:41.250> I'm

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
I'm weightless for a millisecond I'm

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.470 
I'm weightless for a millisecond I'm
going<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.520> take<00:00:41.730> advantage<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.329> that

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
going to take advantage of that

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.869 
going to take advantage of that
weightlessness<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.530> transition<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> hand

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
weightlessness and transition the hand

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.590 
weightlessness and transition the hand
so<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> quick<00:00:45.719> thing<00:00:45.930> pump<00:00:46.829> quick

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
so it's a quick thing pump quick

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.790 
so it's a quick thing pump quick
weightless<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.809> millisecond<00:00:49.469> boom

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
weightless for a millisecond boom

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.220 
weightless for a millisecond boom
transition<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.670> hand<00:00:50.940> if<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.629> transition

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
transition that hand if I transition

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.250 
transition that hand if I transition
that<00:00:52.350> hand<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.129> drop<00:00:53.489> down<00:00:53.840> now<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.870> did<00:00:55.140> not

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that hand and I drop down now I did not

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.090 
that hand and I drop down now I did not
cover<00:00:55.500> any<00:00:55.710> ground<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.129> lost<00:00:56.789> ground<00:00:57.390> so

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
cover any ground I just lost ground so

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
you're noticing now is that we're not

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.630 
you're noticing now is that we're not

going full range of motion this full
range<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.030> motion<00:01:18.210> stuff<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.080> really<00:01:19.320> hard

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
range of motion stuff is really hard

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.380 
range of motion stuff is really hard
because<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.159> would<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> one-arm<00:01:20.939> pull-up

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
because that would be a one-arm pull-up

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.219 
because that would be a one-arm pull-up
and<00:01:21.570> most<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.290> us<00:01:22.409> don't<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.140> what<00:01:25.140> do

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
and most of us don't have it so what do

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.740 
and most of us don't have it so what do
we<00:01:25.290> do<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:26.009> stay<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.610> what's<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> problem

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
we do we stay in here what's the problem

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.420 
we do we stay in here what's the problem
with<00:01:27.869> staying<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:28.409> sometimes<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
with staying in here sometimes is that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.420 
with staying in here sometimes is that
we<00:01:29.670> are<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.409> pullers<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.740> are<00:01:31.920> pushers

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
we are not pullers we are pushers

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.670 
we are not pullers we are pushers
meaning<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.570> stronger<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.500> our

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
meaning that we are stronger in our

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.840 
meaning that we are stronger in our
extensors<00:01:35.340> tawny<00:01:36.000> blower<00:01:36.439> then<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.650> our

flexors<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.030> when<00:01:39.509> we're<00:01:39.659> hanging<00:01:39.869> here

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.039 
flexors so when we're hanging here
everything<00:01:41.490> gets<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.880> little<00:01:41.909> hot<00:01:42.240> especially

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
everything gets a little hot especially

everything gets a little hot especially
the<00:01:43.590> elbow<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.490> want<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> get<00:01:44.880> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
careful with that make sure you get

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.499 
careful with that make sure you get
exposed<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.399> dose<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:51.420> you
