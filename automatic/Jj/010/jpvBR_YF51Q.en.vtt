00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.019
 how to paint our union two layers this 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:08.019
 it's going to be the first 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.830
 all right 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.909
 as our new 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.850
 enamel does not matter 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.100
 if you want the color 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.100
 and what we're going to do here is that we're going 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.560
 to try that the brush does not remain with 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.259
 so much product 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.079
 let's try to make two lines of 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.720
 Diagonal shape does not matter that you do not 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.360
 go well but let's do what 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.250
 possible for them to come out 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.470
 and so thick list on the line the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.750
 true 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.460
 let's start from here and look 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.600
 with the novel the brush of time 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.600
 it matters to me 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.670
 the other producer the rain 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.220
 let's go with the next dow same no 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.620
 matter that you get it right but we're going to 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:49.850
 try to be in the same 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.850
 This beginning of your time so min 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.770
 twice is almost no resemblance to 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.760
 this truth but they go from the same side 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:08.930
 so if you want your sometime 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.300
 is a little maturity and cites once 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:15.470
 you will see very beautiful we have in the 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:19.780
 next thought up look 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.780
 let's move the broach at the same time 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.830
 it's like I see her turn the skewer 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.610
 so that it looks very pretty 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.830
 ok this is the ring finger of the girl 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.400
 we're really going to do it 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.250
 contrary ok we started this from 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.880
 here although then I was that it would be 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.290
 different 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.290
 from this other side 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.640
 then it is from the other side 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.770
 A) Yes 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.550
 look then look they are going to see 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.550
 different 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.490
 with the limit equal to how were the 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.490
 true species 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.880
 now with the other enamel this color 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.880
 comply 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.250
 we go 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.170
 let's do it I hope I'm not sensible 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.590
 it's because we're going to pass it like this 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.220
 cne 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:44.540
 it does not matter the order is going to look very 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:48.810
 nice as it looks on the light 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:52.819
 and seconds later dictated and look 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.819
 and play us all 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.240
 same 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.320
 then it will give that very nice touch 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.860
 the ring finger is the same but in a way 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.860
 contrary true 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.330
 We passed the er mantecÃ³n receives me is going to 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:17.040
 see very nice something easy 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.040
 but it looks very nice 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.810
 what is it to be so exaggerated 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.260
 even look you can apply it to 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.260
 reverse 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.010
 t 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.809
 and to make it a little bit more different 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:41.029
 this ring finger a bogey pin a pin 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:44.629
 we leave it open you can use the 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:46.370
 pain in all that I have but for 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:49.849
 that you see that you do not have to have those 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.689
 great tools we take the same 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.689
 enamel 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.760
 let's make some tourist balls 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.540
 as well as 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.190
 not so much as honestly as you want 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.660
 if you see 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:14.640
 different than taking more 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.640
 the mountain 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.120
 it's a nice and different way of thinking 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.120
 if you see 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.710
 nice I do not know to me it seems to me that it would be 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.520
 very nice then I know it's coming 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.770
 enamel we are going to apply 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.289
 this a layer of shine or enamel 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.889
 transparent and I think it's an idea 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:46.560
 very good that you can use the enamel 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.900
 that you want to be that you want truth 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.729
 but these are some ideas I think 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.210
 it is very easy that the nails are going to see 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.729
 very nice for that special day of 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.949
 graduation or any chance true 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.590
 so yes I hope you like my 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:05.009
