00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.970
 well who does not have much notion about how 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:13.540
 make a garden in comics 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:17.710
 I learned more or less and today gave 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:21.009
 right for me and I wanted to show you 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.980
 How do I do the procedure? 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:29.050
 make a proper hygiene dinner is the 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:32.770
 The next I got the way I am. 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:37.570
 seeing here how it is done by shrimp tide 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:46.740
 I already asked for a gif conflict of the form nÃ© 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:50.830
 in this way I gave of a juice where it leaves 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:55.180
 so the lead and with these tools 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:01:00.400
 so I cut and model with the line 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:04.269
 Fourth and her model's scissors stand 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:10.170
 more or less so he out of this way 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:13.869
 the way it is shot well right 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.639
 note that the so the water line gives the 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:21.969
 The finish of the songo stays inside the dream 

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:26.649
 So you have to do with the scissors. 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:29.490
 I went to power is to open the hole today. 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.249
 there for you to put the other stand 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.649
 right 

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:40.799
 after I pick up and the wiper file 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.799
 in it it looks more or less like that 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.500
 stays like this 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.890
 I'll take him and give him a hand. 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:57.150
 Normal quenched ink enamel paint such 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:01.640
 which I always use to deal with the first hand 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:07.200
 of ink and then I use creativity 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:09.270
 how to put the desired colorations and 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.350
 at your discretion in the coloration you 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.230
 Wish 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.830
 I'd rather do more or less like this. 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:24.980
 after them painted right 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:30.450
 they stay like this, it kills a lot 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:34.500
 here where I live here it 's cool here it 's 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:39.870
 kill a lot of them with the abit woods 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:43.620
 You kill pretty good bug and the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:49.200
 paints that I use enamels are these 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.320
 so is quite flashy tire flame 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.950
 enough attention 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.330
 correct after painting with enamel 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:03.660
 this finish 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.739
 I give resin bath the bath 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.110
 resin 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:12.780
 There is a resin bath 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:18.380
 It's worth staying a lot, it's so bright and 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:21.690
 do not drop the paint, that's it folks 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.780
 It was pretty cool and it has given 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.780
 result
