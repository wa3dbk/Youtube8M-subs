 not sure heated up and in this 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.960
 it's about my favorite steffen and 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.960

 Here are the rune massing order 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:24.369
 and items animal needs to have with wales 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.800
 to give away grass hardcore one 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.720
 Passive is the best skill in game 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.940
 to get as good as anyone 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.440
 because it is almost impossible to go ahead 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.150
 Run your first skill is perfect 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.030
 suitable for it will leave 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.080
 once you come to is the length 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.150
 besides , they are very good too 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.970
 suitable and at the tower to load and 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.739
 everyone's ability to the future 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.140
 Dodge hardcore professionally 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.059
 with your second ability you can 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.620
 eat it even better than yours 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.010
 first then you can still the 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.080
 silly and burdened at the same time 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.710
 Smaller gangster faster than any other 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.710
 kill 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:10.240
 soraya and the tower hessen so wacker 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.850
 kill under the fountain and without 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.280
 akw kill problems before she can do it 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.040
 hide in your smoke cloud 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.350
 your third ability allows you 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.390
 with no problems, everything in the future 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.350
 to shoot away from her and you 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.760
 to save the life 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.660
 sometimes the opponents will be too 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.660
 still her displays 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.010
 and if you are busy you hipster 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.810
 so that his oldies completely unnecessary for 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.790
 a ass and you do not need that 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.740
 the worst skill the nad carey 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.360
 That's why you should have it 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.650
 you just use it to dragon 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.650
 and nothing else 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.840
 if tristan at the beginning of the game to 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.640
 weighed too far forward and that goes 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.260
 Wonder on board the hardcore on it 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.890
 on it and bring her to her meat 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.960
 to eat 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.880
 after that , she glanced up 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.890
 they land and the first time hard on 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.350
 she always did her job if 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.360
 possible because they refresh your autotxt 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.400
 and shoot in the wall as soon as you get off 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.450
 you have to go into the opposing support exhaust 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.910
 you shine that immediately 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.380
 after that, it did not kill it 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.680
 kill because she did not have a fresh one 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.650
 continued then so bravely and 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.540
 she also brings her diligence waynes 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.540
 own move is good only for eating 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.870
 after that move can flash namely 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.870
 a good hoogland so the village sw 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.849
 It goes on and first class so you on 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.980
 laying it going and without 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.940
 problems with a passive and your 1 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.530
 percent quattrone sweetheart kill 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.330
 then, for example, six to of 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.190
 fresh blood pressure always ends up with hulbee 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.050
 office go on it and everything 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.030
 use what you have asked to return 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.260
 to become 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.300
 because your support maybe times 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.860
 not so disabled shit is then 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.310
 maybe he can do both kills 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.920
 to let 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.220
 You do not have to press everything 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.730
 down left then click fixes 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.130
 for this 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.019
 and that's why adc 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.640
 my role is because half of the 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.569
 work of support and only one man 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.430
 the whole you get well if 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.410
 you want him you can do that for him 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.660
 save lives when he is in danger goes 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.739
 He goes down and kill all the opponents of him 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.450
 try to kill 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:42.840
 make your multi faster for that 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:44.790
 when you 're at it, go to a tower 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.010
 deliver and there two juice the opponents 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.320
 running around destroyed the tower to the end and 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.959
 then do a multi-role date of thinking 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.850
 and everything you love again 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.109
 always do your job if possible and 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.000
 if any skills too 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.650
 German thereby you are so fat that 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.250
 It can happen that two opponents 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.930
 be valid 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.130
 but that is not a problem because everything is 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.049
 you have to make is just the frogs 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.000
 click lantern and wait until one 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.829
 puck lands after that came up with multi 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.170
 the first opponent has thought of it 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.700
 then go on the second and kill 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.870
 as soon as it makes itself invisible surface 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.250
 in the wake and him as fast as 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.350
 possible to find and kill 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.350
 It should not be a problem because it is 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.039
 if you're just chilling in on it 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.810
 push tower to fresh one at a time 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.550
 puck then lands on the closer 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.960
 has put it a bit to return 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.210
 Not 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.889
 to be human and kill him think on 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.759
 how to flash and launch the best flash 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.800
 before you kill her when you're at it 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.330
 was to push a kita at once 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.009
 three opponents come is not a problem 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.050
 because all you have to do is yours 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.060
 multi and jean king so you fast 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.220
 then the ak never kills and then goes 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.560
 obviously out of his and he out of 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.550
 shoot away before the multi ends up 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.410
 chase them afterwards 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.150
 thanks to your passive and your beauty 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.620
 to constantly refresh if you autotxt 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.389
 it should not be a problem 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.630
 then use your muscles prediction 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.740
 to get data preceded 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.690
 you do not have a lot of team freedom 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.370
 Do more than once with your multi 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.490
 activate and then left kit too 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.870
 Press after an enemy can dead 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.120
 you first around a bit and are 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.800
 By doing that, you're dancing to the best 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.130
 again the swords ever thrown 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.930
 becomes 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.909
 3 2 1 after one of the adversary any 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.430
 false makes attali in this case 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.810
 can you go on it as soon as effect on 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.639
 It's his turn on him 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.949
 Ultras a few tips this anticipation 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:31.580
 He is back on him when he gets his 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:34.520
 invisible led him and then 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.919
 first the other opponents continue 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.289
 is suddenly breaking away and vitali too 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.479
 invites you to video kill in a team far 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.099
 any of your member of the catch 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.990
 is not that a problem was everything 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.340
 making is easy forward and then times 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.320
 left click again to press 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.909
 even if you contrast your multi on 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.710
 is not a problem because you fall so 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:53.630
 You will be able to do this for every opponent 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.719
 water pressure just all left click and 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.639
 killed after oma you see 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:02.990
 After that, jobs are his passive 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:05.090
 let your team and chase it continues to 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.979
 do you always have your crew and 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.630
 your passive one should 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.639
 do not send a problem to kill 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.289
 So just run after and have 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.860
 Do not be afraid of the tower 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.860
 weak 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.700
 if you monde save lives what you have to 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.300
 you immediately world on the king active 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.920
 use 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.690
 at all falls on that and kings 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.360
 Saugeil on green as first old 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.760
 because it's the at &amp; s as the only item 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.820
 currently i believe in giving and with 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.930
 lifestyle and so it is good but he is 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.520
 do not forget the teams too 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:40.310
 However , that does not sound like it 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:42.200
 Almost a little secret betrayed 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.550
 I'll give you the al 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.600
 left click is not one hundred percent 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.760
 right 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.340
 you should somehow try yourself too 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.220
 position yourself not to die like that 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.570
 far from the case in this team 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.160
 because the opponents in these games 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.350
 were somehow unnatural bad 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.710
 You can not just do it 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.090
 to press 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.100
 well, here's another example 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.750
 for the opponents on the pc and I wait until 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.940
 the way is and remains behind first 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.620
 then I go on tristan because that 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.450
 unbelievably badly positioned and 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.070
 the opponent is a pity carril as soon as you 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.230
 gone is i go to the first opponent 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.330
 I see in this case is the booklet 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.370
 then flat over the wall and led 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.150
 All providers still meaningful no danger 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.150
 exists more for me 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.340
 because if a deep I too late 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:34.910
 it turns out to be no problem because you 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.320
 but again only has to press 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.210
 where it just kind of feels like 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.460
 However, war does not matter 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.560
 somehow all closer so actually 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.500
 nobody because the loop team by ks 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:51.780
 did not matter chastity sun after nautilus 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:54.690
 braid year so it sounds like mine 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:57.030
 love funny that was my right 

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.600
 heated up thanks fans i say goodbye 

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.600
 protected
