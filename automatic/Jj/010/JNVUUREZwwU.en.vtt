00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.939 

so<00:00:46.969> here's<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.960> whole<00:00:48.079> deal<00:00:48.350> with<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.620> 4matic

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
so here's the whole deal with the 4matic

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.590 
so here's the whole deal with the 4matic
all-wheel<00:00:49.160> drive<00:00:49.399> system<00:00:49.940> why<00:00:50.030> it's<00:00:50.180> perfect

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
all-wheel drive system why it's perfect

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.470 
all-wheel drive system why it's perfect
for<00:00:50.629> this<00:00:50.809> type<00:00:51.050> of<00:00:51.079> landscape<00:00:51.829> as<00:00:52.239> often<00:00:53.239> as

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
for this type of landscape as often as

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.079 
for this type of landscape as often as
necessary<00:00:53.780> as<00:00:54.530> seldom<00:00:55.070> as<00:00:55.280> possible<00:00:55.309> you

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
necessary as seldom as possible you

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.540 
necessary as seldom as possible you
remember<00:00:56.540> that<00:00:56.719> motto<00:00:56.960> because<00:00:57.829> that<00:00:58.339> is

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
remember that motto because that is

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.490 
remember that motto because that is
referring<00:00:58.969> to<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.390> variable<00:00:59.989> torque

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
referring to a variable torque

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.430 
referring to a variable torque
distribution<00:01:01.659> how<00:01:02.659> does<00:01:02.839> that<00:01:02.960> work<00:01:03.170> the

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
distribution how does that work the

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.139 
distribution how does that work the
torque<00:01:03.680> distribution<00:01:04.280> is<00:01:04.369> normally<00:01:04.790> in<00:01:04.940> the

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
torque distribution is normally in the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.820 
torque distribution is normally in the
front<00:01:05.449> so<00:01:05.690> basic<00:01:06.110> driving<00:01:06.470> is<00:01:06.560> going<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.740> be

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
front so basic driving is going to be

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.770 
front so basic driving is going to be
front-wheel<00:01:07.220> drive<00:01:07.310> in<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.700> front<00:01:07.940> axle<00:01:08.270> will

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
front-wheel drive in the front axle will

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.660 
front-wheel drive in the front axle will
be<00:01:08.960> in<00:01:09.170> main<00:01:09.500> control<00:01:10.009> but<00:01:10.190> as<00:01:10.280> soon<00:01:10.490> as

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
be in main control but as soon as

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.940 
be in main control but as soon as
necessary<00:01:11.300> up<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:12.080> 50<00:01:12.440> percent<00:01:12.830> of<00:01:12.890> that

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
necessary up to 50 percent of that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.340 
necessary up to 50 percent of that
torque<00:01:13.280> can<00:01:13.460> swoop<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:14.420> rear<00:01:14.630> axle<00:01:14.840> and

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
torque can swoop to the rear axle and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.410 
torque can swoop to the rear axle and
that's<00:01:15.770> exactly<00:01:16.159> what's<00:01:16.520> helping<00:01:16.850> stabilize

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
that's exactly what's helping stabilize

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.889 
that's exactly what's helping stabilize
the<00:01:17.990> driving<00:01:18.470> right<00:01:18.950> now<00:01:19.160> right<00:01:19.850> here<00:01:20.119> whoa

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
the driving right now right here whoa

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.310 
the driving right now right here whoa
see<00:01:21.830> them<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.610> this<00:01:22.759> so-called<00:01:23.080> torque<00:01:24.080> on

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
see them so this so-called torque on

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.919 
see them so this so-called torque on
demand<00:01:24.979> will<00:01:25.729> allow<00:01:25.940> distribution<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.720> switch

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
demand will allow distribution to switch

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.770 
demand will allow distribution to switch
from<00:01:27.170> front<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.740> back<00:01:27.860> as<00:01:28.310> needed<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.300> that's

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
from front to back as needed and that's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.020 
from front to back as needed and that's
exactly<00:01:30.140> why<00:01:30.440> you'll<00:01:30.649> feel<00:01:30.920> stable<00:01:31.700> that's

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
exactly why you'll feel stable that's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.010 
exactly why you'll feel stable that's
exactly<00:01:32.390> what's<00:01:32.539> going<00:01:32.659> to<00:01:32.750> give<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:32.929> an

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
exactly what's going to give you an

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.680 
exactly what's going to give you an
outstanding<00:01:33.770> grip<00:01:34.009> on<00:01:34.220> any<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.909> every<00:01:35.450> type

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
outstanding grip on any and every type

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.870 
outstanding grip on any and every type
of<00:01:35.720> street<00:01:36.170> that's<00:01:36.619> why<00:01:36.830> I<00:01:36.860> can<00:01:37.340> actually<00:01:37.490> do

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
of street that's why I can actually do

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.520 
of street that's why I can actually do
this<00:01:38.060> without<00:01:38.330> being<00:01:38.479> too<00:01:39.110> scared<00:01:39.440> whoa<00:01:41.530> most

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
this without being too scared whoa most

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.250 
this without being too scared whoa most
of<00:01:42.679> the<00:01:42.770> time
