00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 Hello everyone today I received a package from 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.139
 nyx yourself 5 min right now I'll open it 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.019
 the parcel service was delivered soon 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.350
 in almost 12 days 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.750
 sent on November 22nd and today i'm here 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.660
 something December and and got that is 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.960
 let's see what they sent here 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.390
 and state that I remind you that I am sending 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.070
 service spsr 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.090
 that is, this delivery is not dependent on 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.140
 Russia wants 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.170
 so the parcel first income is faster a 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:46.070
 secondly they are in my opinion on the course 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.070
 the security men roll the box 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.210
 tight enough to say can not yet 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.899
 of course already stupid at the same time not so 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.899
 just hide 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.860
 status 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.010
 3 phones 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.830
 well, of course not in the middle well 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.150
 proper 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.800
 shaking is present when shaken 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.420
 here's a hundred must suffer 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:33.270
 I want to say that the parcel is controlled here 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.150
 so in the declaration I pointed to 2 niks 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.910
 cut off gigabyte 1 x 1 gig want 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.790
 notice that as you see us gigabyte I 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.450
 pointed out a little differently I wrote that 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.940
 This phone is now changed to a number 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.400
 There is not a google nexus and yes and better then 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.500
 there is a lot of grief and wrote something with 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.890
 another store bought roughly speaking 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.930
 slightly deceived or indicated a little not 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.600
 sort of actin like the wrong data 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.760
 actually here 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.320
 if everything correctly sent here should 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:15.510
 Knox be 3 to 32 gigabytes in this 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:21.709
 make sure on version 1 it is version 3 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:31.879
 will speak like this 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:31.879
 the second is again 32 gigabytes and the third is not 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.750
 reload add me just did not cover 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.159
 overcharges for shipping while delivering more 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.430
 one phone or group with 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:47.970
 somehow I just wanted to be oprah like 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.709
 we see in my invoice 2 nexus then 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.359
 there is an invoice as if I speak even 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.150
 about the fact that I have here is not accurate with 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.340
 overall version well, apparently stand-up 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.920
 nobody checks to spit so 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.260
 what i'm not saying need to send 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.159
 just like trimix at the same time I'm all 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.500
 at one's own risk 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:09.079
 Well, I took a chance so stuck 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.639
 sweetie postcard 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.819
 but it doesnâ€™t matter what to start with 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:20.750
 box 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:24.299
 turned out to be black white white black 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:45.060
 well let's start with black all the same not 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:49.919
 I want a Viennese box 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:55.760
 cut is not really part of the bet with 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:04:04.409
 different boxes need to cut anything 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:06.769
 in the forest above here also we prune another 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.769
 country 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:20.200
 here is a brand new cool interesting nexus 5 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.790
 For comparison, end gg2 show not 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.340
 Can it being video 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.200
 actually there is no other camera 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:37.900
 therefore it is included just we will see with a look 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:42.660
 the phone bundle of us goes blue 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:51.820
 a piece of paper closing why soar 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:56.530
 the violinist is shorter some kind of thing 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.600
 show how to activate everything where 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.300
 sound buttons are located 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:13.480
 switch and a small instruction on 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:15.520
 spanish and order hundreds of lesbian connector 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.660
 more than no headphones unfortunately 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.960
 Here again there is no treasure here might not 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:27.700
 for example sexy when from the past 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.730
 writing and maybe new but in general 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.910
 nexus 5 will tell you more conveniently lies a little 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.930
 rivers the same 2 cents less and feel 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:42.540
 five inch screen 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:42.540
 as everything quickly immediately Russian omit 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:51.660
 there is nothing to clean up 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:06:05.080
 don't know 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:08.559
 we keep the password low flow feet amount 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:20.119
 but hardly anyone home fabrics 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:22.339
 hack my network so well that it is 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:29.270
 cream was originally a film by the way that to me 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:37.219
 I like that small inscription imperceptibly 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:40.159
 someone may even erase in brief 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:44.089
 show you what it means button 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:48.020
 powered by sim card slot 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:50.059
 here are some ceramic buttons 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.020
 releasing her husband ceramic new what 

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:55.669
 right here this ceramic is not conductive I already 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:02.529
 google wants to become software 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:07.659
 ensuring in general I will understand everything I look 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:12.860
 so far i have no sense of unpacking 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:14.839
 in general, so that three nexus 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.240
 all is well everything has come to say 

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:18.860

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.319
