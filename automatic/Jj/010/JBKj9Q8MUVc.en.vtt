hello everyone and welcome to another
session<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.859> quotas<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.819> look<00:00:06.089> behind<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
session of quotas a look behind the

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.190 
session of quotas a look behind the
numbers<00:00:06.750> this<00:00:07.319> time<00:00:07.379> gasps<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.730> zerg<00:00:09.389> now

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
numbers this time gasps and zerg now

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.080 
numbers this time gasps and zerg now
taking<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.769> look<00:00:10.950> at<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.160> chart<00:00:11.400> one<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.030> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
taking a look at this chart one of the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.339 
taking a look at this chart one of the
first<00:00:12.330> things<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.690> notice<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.110> is

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
first things that you notice is that is

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.010 
first things that you notice is that is
that<00:00:13.500> not<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.250> many<00:00:14.309> units<00:00:14.969> for<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.570> zerg

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
that not that many units for the zerg

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.040 
that not that many units for the zerg
army<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:16.980> yeah<00:00:17.850> not<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.240> many<00:00:18.510> zerg<00:00:18.779> units

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
army so yeah not that many zerg units

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.320 
army so yeah not that many zerg units
for<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.199> zerg<00:00:19.560> army<00:00:19.800> secondly<00:00:20.310> i<00:00:20.520> didn't

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
for the zerg army secondly i didn't

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.240 
for the zerg army secondly i didn't
include<00:00:21.600> queens<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.380> zerg<00:00:22.590> means<00:00:22.800> as<00:00:22.949> they

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
include queens and zerg means as they

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.900 
include queens and zerg means as they
are<00:00:23.369> mineral<00:00:24.150> only<00:00:24.420> costs<00:00:25.230> now<00:00:26.010> one<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
are mineral only costs now one of the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700 
are mineral only costs now one of the
weird<00:00:27.180> things<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.599> I've<00:00:27.750> noticed<00:00:27.990> about<00:00:28.289> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
weird things that I've noticed about the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.939 
weird things that I've noticed about the
zerg<00:00:28.949> army<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.490> general<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.929> trying<00:00:31.830> to

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
zerg army in general is that trying to

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.190 
zerg army in general is that trying to
figure<00:00:32.130> out<00:00:32.250> their<00:00:32.489> Maps<00:00:32.730> production<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.570> a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
figure out their Maps production and a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.110 
figure out their Maps production and a
lot<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.530> how<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.040> chart<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.700> how<00:00:35.880> things

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
lot of how this chart and how things

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.330 
lot of how this chart and how things
were<00:00:36.300> highlighted<00:00:36.809> red<00:00:37.020> yellow<00:00:37.410> green<00:00:37.559> were

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
were highlighted red yellow green were

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.510 
were highlighted red yellow green were
based<00:00:38.610> upon<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.239> max<00:00:39.540> production<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.520> mass

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
based upon the max production and mass

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.490 
based upon the max production and mass
production<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.360> these<00:00:42.510> numbers<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:43.440> I

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
production for these numbers and what I

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.619 
production for these numbers and what I
quickly<00:00:43.770> realize<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.969> mass<00:00:45.210> production

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
quickly realize is the mass production

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.459 
quickly realize is the mass production
is<00:00:46.079> generally<00:00:46.980> lower<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.050> obvious<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.200> made

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
is generally lower and obvious and made

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.110 
is generally lower and obvious and made
a<00:00:49.500> lot<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.800> things<00:00:50.070> turn<00:00:50.370> red<00:00:50.760> when<00:00:50.969> they

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
a lot of things turn red when they

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.110 
a lot of things turn red when they
shouldn't<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.660> red<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.730> this

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
shouldn't be red so and in this

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.810 
shouldn't be red so and in this
particular<00:00:54.329> instance<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:56.070> only<00:00:56.399> thing<00:00:56.640> that

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
particular instance the only thing that

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.549 
particular instance the only thing that
really<00:00:56.969> should<00:00:57.300> be<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.840> middle<00:00:58.050> ish<00:00:58.199> I

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
really should be in the middle ish I

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.950 
really should be in the middle ish I
think<00:00:58.980> should<00:00:59.070> actually<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.609> yellow<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.510> I'll

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
think should actually be yellow so I'll

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.150 
think should actually be yellow so I'll
go<00:01:01.050> ahead<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.230> turn<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.680> yellow<00:01:01.980> and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
go ahead and turn that to yellow and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.950 
go ahead and turn that to yellow and
then<00:01:02.280> change<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.789> color<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.239> black<00:01:03.480> for<00:01:03.840> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
then change this color to black for you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.140 
then change this color to black for you
and<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.799> mute<00:01:04.979> list<00:01:05.189> would<00:01:05.280> actually<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.939> M

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
and the mute list would actually be M

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.420 
and the mute list would actually be M
yellow<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.290> particular<00:01:07.470> instance<00:01:07.770> now

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
yellow in this particular instance now

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.250 
yellow in this particular instance now
the<00:01:09.090> reason<00:01:09.330> behind<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.350> because<00:01:11.250> Zerg

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
the reason behind this is because Zerg

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.100 
the reason behind this is because Zerg
sir<00:01:13.260> units<00:01:13.590> built<00:01:13.830> I'm<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.520> low<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
sir units built I'm is so low and the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.080 
sir units built I'm is so low and the
amount<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.560> gas<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.130> are<00:01:17.250> able<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.759> mine

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
amount of gas that you are able to mine

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.780 
amount of gas that you are able to mine
during<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.720> time<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.229> relatively<00:01:20.100> low<00:01:20.520> as

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
during that time is relatively low as

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.929 
during that time is relatively low as
well<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.689> that's<00:01:22.020> why<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:23.040> affect

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
well so that's why it's going to affect

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.210 
well so that's why it's going to affect
that<00:01:24.060> mass<00:01:24.330> production<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.920> say

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
that mass production you can if I say

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.070 
that mass production you can if I say
you<00:01:26.280> know<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> middle<00:01:26.970> has<00:01:27.090> had<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> bill<00:01:27.840> time

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you know the middle has had a bill time

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.929 
you know the middle has had a bill time
of<00:01:28.259> 60<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.369> see<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.759> number

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
of 60 you can see that this number

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.910 
of 60 you can see that this number
instantly<00:01:30.420> jumps<00:01:30.869> at<00:01:30.960> 2.4<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.799> would

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
instantly jumps at 2.4 and that would

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.069 
instantly jumps at 2.4 and that would
obviously<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.700> green<00:01:33.000> number<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.810> i'll<00:01:33.960> go

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
obviously be a green number but i'll go

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.109 
obviously be a green number but i'll go
ahead<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.290> leave<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.619> back<00:01:34.829> at<00:01:34.979> 33<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
ahead and leave this back at 33 and the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.109 
ahead and leave this back at 33 and the
muta<00:01:36.360> list<00:01:36.540> does<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.229> fact<00:01:37.290> am<00:01:38.009> trained<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.579> 33

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
muta list does in fact am trained in 33

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.929 
muta list does in fact am trained in 33
units<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.479> time<00:01:39.659> now<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.920> look<00:01:41.579> at<00:01:41.759> these

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
units of time now a look at these

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.330 
units of time now a look at these
numbers<00:01:42.240> will<00:01:42.990> show<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.350> what<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.310> can

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
numbers will show you what you can

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.980 
numbers will show you what you can
really<00:01:44.729> train<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.360> what<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.840> really

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
really train up and what you can really

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.410 
really train up and what you can really
produce<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.710> zerg<00:01:47.399> player<00:01:47.490> instead<00:01:48.299> of

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
produce as a zerg player instead of

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.270

the middle is that easily so a seat

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.550 
the middle is that easily so a seat
assuming<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.730> have<00:03:34.959> two<00:03:35.959> bases<00:03:36.350> that

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
assuming that you have two bases that

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.050 
assuming that you have two bases that
means<00:03:36.799> that<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.069> most<00:03:37.370> mutis<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:37.819> will<00:03:37.970> be

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
means that the most mutis you will be

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.059 
means that the most mutis you will be
able<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.480> train<00:03:38.750> up<00:03:38.930> in<00:03:39.139> a<00:03:39.260> minute<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.680> about

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
able to train up in a minute is about

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.490 
able to train up in a minute is about
five<00:03:40.549> and<00:03:41.389> then<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:41.720> will<00:03:41.959> also<00:03:42.109> have<00:03:42.350> an

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
five and then you will also have an

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.720 
five and then you will also have an
excess<00:03:42.769> of<00:03:42.889> mineral<00:03:43.190> so<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.370> want<00:03:43.639> to<00:03:43.700> be

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
excess of mineral so you want to be

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.849 
excess of mineral so you want to be
dumping<00:03:44.299> those<00:03:44.420> minerals<00:03:44.900> towards<00:03:45.709> herb

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
dumping those minerals towards herb

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.009 
dumping those minerals towards herb
leans<00:03:46.069> a<00:03:46.250> very<00:03:46.700> very<00:03:46.910> natural<00:03:47.420> counter<00:03:47.720> unit

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
leans a very very natural counter unit

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.840 
leans a very very natural counter unit
that<00:03:48.319> can<00:03:48.440> also<00:03:48.650> change<00:03:48.980> num<00:03:49.280> banelings<00:03:49.700> as

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
that can also change num banelings as

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.759 
that can also change num banelings as

that has a lot of Marines and if you
have<00:03:56.269> Phoenix's<00:03:56.750> you'll<00:03:57.200> obviously<00:03:57.380> have<00:03:57.859> to

just<00:04:04.670> investors<00:04:05.359> I<00:04:05.540> really<00:04:05.900> like<00:04:06.079> investors

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
just investors I really like investors

just investors I really like investors
countering<00:04:07.630> Phoenix's<00:04:08.630> just<00:04:08.900> because

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
countering Phoenix's just because

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.900 
countering Phoenix's just because
they're<00:04:09.380> able<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.709> fungal<00:04:10.069> growth<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.519> then

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
they're able to fungal growth and then

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.729 
they're able to fungal growth and then
spawn<00:04:11.299> infested<00:04:11.810> terran<00:04:12.079> at<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.349> same<00:04:12.530> time

spawn infested terran at the same time
investor<00:04:13.639> is<00:04:13.700> a<00:04:13.760> perfect<00:04:14.180> counter<00:04:14.419> towards

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
investor is a perfect counter towards

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.110 
investor is a perfect counter towards
those<00:04:15.130> towards<00:04:16.130> those<00:04:16.220> very<00:04:16.519> very<00:04:16.729> fast<00:04:17.000> very

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
those towards those very very fast very

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.140 
those towards those very very fast very
mobile<00:04:17.599> on<00:04:18.200> Phoenix's<00:04:18.799> so<00:04:19.280> yeah<00:04:19.700> take<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:19.970> look

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
mobile on Phoenix's so yeah take a look

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.750 
mobile on Phoenix's so yeah take a look
at<00:04:20.299> this<00:04:20.390> chart<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:21.099> more<00:04:22.099> important<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.640> look

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
at this chart and more important to look

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.330 
at this chart and more important to look
at<00:04:22.909> the<00:04:23.390> percentage<00:04:23.900> of<00:04:23.990> one<00:04:24.229> base<00:04:24.440> gas

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
at the percentage of one base gas

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.520 
at the percentage of one base gas
for<00:04:25.790> zerg<00:04:26.060> in<00:04:26.240> particular<00:04:26.660> just<00:04:26.690> because<00:04:27.230> max

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
for zerg in particular just because max

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.030 
for zerg in particular just because max
production<00:04:28.040> doesn't<00:04:28.370> really<00:04:29.199> apply<00:04:30.199> to<00:04:30.350> zerg

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
production doesn't really apply to zerg

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.890 
production doesn't really apply to zerg
nearly<00:04:31.490> as<00:04:31.580> much<00:04:31.760> as<00:04:31.910> it<00:04:32.000> applies<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.330> Terran

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
nearly as much as it applies to Terran

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.140 
nearly as much as it applies to Terran
