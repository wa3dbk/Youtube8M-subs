and<00:00:18.760> I'm<00:00:18.850> going<00:00:19.000> to<00:00:19.029> be<00:00:19.150> talking<00:00:19.480> about<00:00:19.720> the

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
and I'm going to be talking about the

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.140 
and I'm going to be talking about the
importance<00:00:20.650> of<00:00:20.770> leg<00:00:21.070> training<00:00:21.460> and<00:00:21.730> why<00:00:22.090> it

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
importance of leg training and why it

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.030 
importance of leg training and why it
absolutely<00:00:22.900> must<00:00:23.290> be<00:00:23.470> included<00:00:23.740> in<00:00:23.950> your

aren't really a showy muscle group and

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:31.800 
aren't really a showy muscle group and
they<00:00:30.400> also<00:00:30.610> happen<00:00:30.939> to<00:00:31.150> be<00:00:31.239> one<00:00:31.480> of<00:00:31.540> the<00:00:31.689> most

train your legs and you train them hard

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.010 
train your legs and you train them hard
you'll<00:00:54.130> actually<00:00:54.340> experience<00:00:55.240> a<00:00:55.360> noticeable

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
you'll actually experience a noticeable

your<00:00:58.180> upper<00:00:58.390> body<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:59.080> the<00:00:59.560> reason<00:00:59.830> for<00:00:59.860> this

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
your upper body and the reason for this

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.800 
your upper body and the reason for this
is<00:01:00.130> very<00:01:00.580> simple<00:01:00.940> and<00:01:01.210> that<00:01:01.240> is<00:01:01.390> that<00:01:01.660> the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
is very simple and that is that the

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.870 
is very simple and that is that the

muscle building mechanism of the body is

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.420 
muscle building mechanism of the body is
not<00:01:04.269> limited<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.409> specific<00:01:05.439> muscles<00:01:06.340> that

growth hormone these powerful hormones

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.139 
growth hormone these powerful hormones
are<00:01:20.319> actually<00:01:20.710> one<00:01:20.859> of<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.979> primary<00:01:21.460> limiting

are actually one of the primary limiting
factors<00:01:22.689> that<00:01:23.109> determines<00:01:23.710> how<00:01:23.890> much<00:01:24.069> muscle

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
higher your levels of anabolic hormones

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.270 
higher your levels of anabolic hormones
are<00:01:28.749> the<00:01:29.079> more<00:01:29.350> muscle<00:01:29.590> you're<00:01:29.859> going<00:01:30.009> to<00:01:30.069> gain

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
are the more muscle you're going to gain

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.099 
are the more muscle you're going to gain
and<00:01:30.579> it<00:01:30.909> just<00:01:31.119> so<00:01:31.210> happens<00:01:31.659> that<00:01:31.749> the<00:01:31.929> most

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
and it just so happens that the most

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.169 
and it just so happens that the most
powerful<00:01:32.560> way<00:01:32.920> to<00:01:33.340> increase<00:01:33.759> your<00:01:33.789> body's

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
powerful way to increase your body's

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.419 
powerful way to increase your body's
natural<00:01:34.569> secretion<00:01:35.319> of<00:01:35.380> these<00:01:35.530> hormones<00:01:36.069> is

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
natural secretion of these hormones is

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.489 
natural secretion of these hormones is
through<00:01:36.789> the<00:01:36.880> use<00:01:36.909> of<00:01:37.090> hard<00:01:37.539> heavy<00:01:38.020> leg

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:38.499 
through the use of hard heavy leg

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:41.010 
through the use of hard heavy leg
training<00:01:38.799> I'm<00:01:39.130> talking<00:01:39.549> about<00:01:39.639> basic<00:01:40.509> leg

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
training I'm talking about basic leg

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.800 
training I'm talking about basic leg
exercises<00:01:41.590> like<00:01:41.889> squats<00:01:42.270> stiff<00:01:43.270> legged<00:01:43.479> dead

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
exercises like squats stiff legged dead

exercises like squats stiff legged dead
lifts<00:01:44.109> leg<00:01:44.560> presses<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.249> lunges<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.319> what

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
lifts leg presses and lunges and what

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.929 
lifts leg presses and lunges and what
this<00:01:47.439> means<00:01:47.829> is<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:47.979> if<00:01:48.189> leg<00:01:48.459> training<00:01:48.729> is

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
this means is that if leg training is

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.699 
this means is that if leg training is
not<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.270> part<00:01:49.689> of<00:01:49.780> your<00:01:49.899> regular<00:01:50.109> workout

not a part of your regular workout

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.739 
not a part of your regular workout
program<00:01:51.189> or<00:01:51.609> if<00:01:51.729> it<00:01:51.819> is<00:01:51.850> part<00:01:52.299> of<00:01:52.389> your<00:01:52.509> program

program or if it is part of your program
but<00:01:53.109> you're<00:01:53.200> simply<00:01:53.560> treating<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.069> as<00:01:54.159> an

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:54.279 
but you're simply treating it as an
