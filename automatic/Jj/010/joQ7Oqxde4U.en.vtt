 "Food sources of flame retardants" 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.090
 What do people in New York eat? 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.600
 I bet it's not just big apples (New York is called Big Apple, Big Apple). 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.210
 You may remember that I was discussing this study with you some time ago. 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.690
 It showed that the main sources of flame retardant chemicals 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.050
 they are in the American diet (with the exception of infants who receive all these pollutants directly 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.980
 from their mothers) different kinds of meat, fish, dairy products and eggs. 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.000
 What kind of meat is the worst? 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.649
 We only recently learned the answer. 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.879
 We know the fish are the worst. 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.719
 These are values ​​for a fish called halibut, which is one of the cleanest. 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:53.199
 As far as other types of meat are concerned, the level of consumption is just behind the fish 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.049
 poultry; then pork and then beef. 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.359
 What is this - between chicken and fish? 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.580
 Turkey. 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.299
 It follows that white meat is more contaminated with substances 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.430
 flame retardant than red meat. 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.780
 The highest concentration is actually 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.700
 found in dog and cat food. 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.460
 And what about polychlorinated naphthalenes? 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.719
 Before this study, 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.130
 were "information on the occurrence of these toxicologically significant 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.850
 industrial pollutants in food and their contact with humans 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.280
 PCN are chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.630
 potentially huge group of little known 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.399
 environmental contaminants of human origin. " 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.359
 Their chemical structure "can cause dioxin-like toxic effects." 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.270
 I understand it now. 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.170
 Although prohibited in many countries, 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.640
 which food shelf do you still find the most? 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.759
 In bread baskets? 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.420
 In the Dairy Department? 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.060
 Delicatessen? 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.689
 In the egg department? 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:08.720
 On the fish counter? 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.270
 Or in the fruit and vegetable department? 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.250
 Fish was the worst. Worst of the worst 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.230
 then salmon farmed on fish farms. 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.990
 Behind him is a salmon from organic farms. 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.610
 Behind salmon we find poultry and eggs. 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.310
 Let's get a little closer. 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.670
 Red meat has less; the worst is lamb. 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.730
 Then there are dairy products. 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.120
 And in the end, what is at the bottom of the food chain - plants: fruits, vegetables, pastries, etc. 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.001
 Vegetable foods have about ten times less of these pollutants than meat, milk, and eggs. 

00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:49.290
 They are about a hundred times safer than fish. 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.490
 This way you can get an idea of ​​which departments you should go through on yours 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:00.190
 visiting a supermarket.
