350<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.560> thing<00:00:16.770> was<00:00:16.920> crazy<00:00:17.190> fun<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.300> just

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
350 the thing was crazy fun but it just

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.670 
350 the thing was crazy fun but it just
didn't<00:00:18.660> have<00:00:18.750> enough<00:00:18.779> power<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.260> make<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.500> up

i<00:00:22.189> thought<00:00:23.189> about<00:00:23.400> stuffing<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.939> larger<00:00:24.240> engine

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
i thought about stuffing a larger engine

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.689 
i thought about stuffing a larger engine
into<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> old<00:00:25.019> BW<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:26.099> decided<00:00:26.580> that

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
into the old BW but decided that

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.189 
into the old BW but decided that
starting<00:00:27.060> off<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.449> modern<00:00:27.840> dirt<00:00:28.019> bike

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
starting off with a modern dirt bike

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.660 
starting off with a modern dirt bike
that<00:00:28.410> had<00:00:28.529> both<00:00:28.710> more<00:00:28.980> power<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.490> better

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
that had both more power and better

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.070 
that had both more power and better
suspension<00:00:30.090> would<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> much<00:00:31.050> better

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
suspension would be a much better

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.630 
suspension would be a much better
