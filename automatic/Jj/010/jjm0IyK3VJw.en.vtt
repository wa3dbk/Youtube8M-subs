 a theme on breaking bad which is a 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.590
 series that I love I'm going to select 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.420

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.659
 top left here so I'm going ferroni 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.170
 the image claj to sized to the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:42.360
 size I desire nails I'm going all 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.800
 select here and love affair hockey 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.960
 here is recording the image background 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.550
 modified screen so there now when 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.570
 I'm going to turn off my smartphone and that 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.050
 I'm going to bed but I 'm going 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.720
 put on stand by 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.750
 - lockscreen here I have my wallpaper 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.120
 custom and it slams frankly that 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.320
 changes buzz wallpaper and all 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.280
 that by looking at the lock screen 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.930
 basic 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.850
 you do not have to see install a 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.010
 alternative application dupes the blinds 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.420
 like gaulle to the heart that will replace 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.950
 the lockscreen but that will add a 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.540
 overlay yet more on your 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.160
 smartphone which can slow it down 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.930
 so here's this little trick 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.030
 I hope it will serve a lot 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.860

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.959
 I am asked regularly enough 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.850
 so you have the solution now 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.500
