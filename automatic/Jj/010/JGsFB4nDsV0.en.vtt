too

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.250 
too
so<00:02:21.680> that's<00:02:21.890> easy<00:02:22.189> to<00:02:22.730> get<00:02:22.879> to<00:02:23.360> another<00:02:23.989> power

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
so that's easy to get to another power

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.160 
so that's easy to get to another power
source<00:02:24.530> here<00:02:24.890> in<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.220> back<00:02:25.400> seat<00:02:28.359> so<00:02:29.359> that's

source here in the back seat so that's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.009 
source here in the back seat so that's
your<00:02:30.409> saturn<00:02:30.829> vue<00:02:31.069> ex<00:02:31.340> e<00:02:31.780> all-wheel<00:02:32.780> drive

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
your saturn vue ex e all-wheel drive

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.220 
your saturn vue ex e all-wheel drive
vehicle<00:02:34.120> got<00:02:35.120> dual<00:02:35.359> exhausts<00:02:35.870> here<00:02:36.049> on<00:02:36.140> the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
vehicle got dual exhausts here on the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.039 
vehicle got dual exhausts here on the
back<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:37.239> again<00:02:38.239> this<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.569> all<00:02:38.780> wheel<00:02:39.019> drive

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
back and again this is all wheel drive

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.640 
back and again this is all wheel drive
so<00:02:39.739> only<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:41.239> front-wheel<00:02:41.870> drive<00:02:41.900> goes<00:02:42.440> on

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
so only the front-wheel drive goes on

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.220 
so only the front-wheel drive goes on
dry<00:02:42.859> pavement<00:02:43.190> when<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.209> detects<00:02:44.629> slippage<00:02:45.079> on

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
dry pavement when it detects slippage on

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.050 
dry pavement when it detects slippage on
snow<00:02:45.440> or<00:02:45.470> ice<00:02:45.709> then<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.190> rears<00:02:46.430> kick<00:02:46.700> in<00:02:46.879> for

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
snow or ice then the rears kick in for

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.330 
snow or ice then the rears kick in for
the<00:02:47.120> all-wheel<00:02:47.480> drive<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:48.650> automatic<00:02:49.280> I

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
the all-wheel drive so it's automatic I

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.530 
the all-wheel drive so it's automatic I
don't<00:02:49.489> have<00:02:49.579> to<00:02:49.670> press<00:02:49.849> any<00:02:49.970> buttons<00:02:50.389> or

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
don't have to press any buttons or

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.190 
don't have to press any buttons or
anything<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:53.060> that's<00:02:53.180> how<00:02:53.420> that<00:02:53.480> goes

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
anything so that's how that goes

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.990 
anything so that's how that goes
so<00:02:54.769> again<00:02:55.069> our<00:02:55.540> 2007<00:02:56.540> view<00:02:56.959> X<00:02:57.170> e<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:58.760> price

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000
