and<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.100> little<00:03:07.100> boys<00:03:07.490> shouldn't<00:03:08.120> use<00:03:08.360> the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
and that little boys shouldn't use the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.270 
and that little boys shouldn't use the
grinder<00:03:08.960> yet<00:03:09.170> because<00:03:09.530> they<00:03:09.710> can<00:03:09.890> cut<00:03:10.100> their

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
grinder yet because they can cut their

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.970 
grinder yet because they can cut their
fingers<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:12.020> is<00:03:12.200> something<00:03:12.410> for<00:03:12.680> Mama<00:03:12.860> to

do

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.200 

I<00:03:27.500> think<00:03:28.500> about<00:03:28.710> you<00:03:29.010> can<00:03:29.250> buy<00:03:29.400> special<00:03:29.730> device

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
I think about you can buy special device

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.970 
I think about you can buy special device
to<00:03:30.720> do<00:03:30.900> just<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:32.120> grind<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.480> peel<00:03:34.110> off<00:03:34.590> of
