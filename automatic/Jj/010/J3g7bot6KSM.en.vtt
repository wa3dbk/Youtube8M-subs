you'll know how to lay
it<00:02:12.239> comes<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.540> really<00:02:12.689> handy<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.530> all<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.709> did<00:02:13.769> I

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
it comes in really handy so all I did I

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.059 
it comes in really handy so all I did I
just<00:02:14.159> did<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.370> really<00:02:14.640> basic<00:02:15.920> example<00:02:16.920> where<00:02:17.040> I

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
just did it really basic example where I

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.350 
just did it really basic example where I
literally<00:02:17.400> just<00:02:17.579> wrote<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.799> name<00:02:20.010> of

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
literally just wrote the the name of

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.910 
literally just wrote the the name of
science<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:22.079> put<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.349> piece<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.650> paper<00:02:22.799> in

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
science and I put the piece of paper in

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.309 
science and I put the piece of paper in
here<00:02:23.400> for<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> plastic<00:02:23.909> so<00:02:24.750> these<00:02:24.870> binders

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
here for the plastic so these binders

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.589 
here for the plastic so these binders
have<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:26.250> plastic<00:02:26.819> covering<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.299> it<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.540> you

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
have the plastic covering on it so you

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.300 
have the plastic covering on it so you
can<00:02:27.810> put<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:27.989> insert<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.980> did<00:02:29.159> the<00:02:29.280> same

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
can put it insert and I did the same

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.309 
can put it insert and I did the same
here<00:02:29.730> for<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:29.970> cover<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.480> can<00:02:30.540> see<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:30.870> disrobe

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
here for the cover you can see I disrobe

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.649 
here for the cover you can see I disrobe
science<00:02:31.799> but<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.790> could<00:02:32.940> type<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.269> up<00:02:33.329> you<00:02:33.540> can

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
science but you could type it up you can

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.690 
science but you could type it up you can
let<00:02:33.780> your<00:02:33.900> child<00:02:34.110> decorate<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.099> however<00:02:35.489> they

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
binder is still blue so that you'll have

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.569 
binder is still blue so that you'll have
a<00:02:39.359> color<00:02:39.629> coding<00:02:40.079> and<00:02:40.290> then<00:02:40.799> what<00:02:41.159> you<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.430> do

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
a color coding and then what you can do

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.819 
a color coding and then what you can do
is<00:02:42.000> inside<00:02:42.959> your<00:02:43.140> binder<00:02:43.470> you're<00:02:43.620> going<00:02:43.769> to

is inside your binder you're going to

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.430 
is inside your binder you're going to
have<00:02:43.980> these<00:02:44.280> wonderful<00:02:45.000> inserts<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.049> have

so<00:04:10.079> now<00:04:10.229> we're<00:04:10.530> avoiding<00:04:10.940> handouts<00:04:11.940> being

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
so now we're avoiding handouts being

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.899 
so now we're avoiding handouts being
squished<00:04:12.659> on<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.560> bottom<00:04:13.799> of<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:13.979> locker<00:04:14.250> or

the last tab that I put in here is for

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.010 
the last tab that I put in here is for
tests<00:04:36.430> so<00:04:36.640> some<00:04:36.940> teachers<00:04:37.360> require<00:04:37.660> that<00:04:37.900> the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
tests so some teachers require that the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.200 
tests so some teachers require that the
tests<00:04:38.350> come<00:04:38.500> back<00:04:38.560> after<00:04:39.070> they're<00:04:39.220> signed<00:04:39.520> but

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
tests come back after they're signed but

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.030 
tests come back after they're signed but
in<00:04:40.330> any<00:04:40.420> case<00:04:40.540> if<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.050> child<00:04:41.320> is<00:04:41.560> getting<00:04:41.890> a

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
test back for the parents signature or

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.100 
test back for the parents signature or
that's<00:04:45.550> not<00:04:45.730> required<00:04:46.120> for<00:04:46.210> signature<00:04:46.810> but

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
that's not required for signature but

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.350 
that's not required for signature but
they<00:04:47.230> can<00:04:47.410> just<00:04:47.650> keep<00:04:47.920> it<00:04:48.100> in<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.280> file<00:04:48.550> you<00:04:49.210> can

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
tests that need to be signed so you'll

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.130
