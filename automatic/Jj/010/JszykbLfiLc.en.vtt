00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.609
 look at the diet we pray media the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.770
 pioneer in the field of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.480
 weather and environmental information 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.910
 in quebec we will keep weather morning on 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.949
 Meteomedia waves of active people 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.949
 start their day with morning weather 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.140
 she was but when we are caught in 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.230
 the meshes autumn is winter is 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.600
 always december 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.170
 21:23 this year so we're still a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.129
 autumn d interest this is just a little 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.420
 everywhere in Quebec yesterday 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.460
 happily for the people of the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.840
 Province fewer materials therefore change 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.640
 of weapons improvements to the feet to 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.559
 montreal three rivers quebec that small 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.629
 bridge north-east you will be added 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.789
 the association trash a pure juice it's 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.280
 bruno vachon two consequences of this 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.320
 cold air and we will find this way 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.730
 repeated during the winter the quality of 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.829
 the air could leave something to be desired 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.199
 day in montreal week is also 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.699
 obviously condensation phenomenon of 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.290
 makes one night possibility of fog 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.210
 after bodies of water on the less than 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.840
 premium caliber so slippery floor 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.549
 on high calves private homes 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.869
 the excellent find the days before 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.790
 all the details but that have some 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.530
 days 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.720
 and what is to remember which 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.909
 evidently evaporation from the south florent 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.250
 so in places the activity is reduced 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.770
 on the roads that line the flat of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.930
 the streams are not yet 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.180
 completely frozen and that given the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.130
 temperatures of the last weeks 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.900
 the temperature of the water and would stay at 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.509
 rise up undermine quite a contrast with 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.280
 values ​​of -20 and wood - but 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.869
 as observed, therefore, is based on the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.030
 land areas south of the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.649
 québec second bag and smiled this morning at 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.930
 apart from that it's still okay enough for 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.149
 the velvety of the province with them or 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.390
 more for despite a little bit of 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.920
 pub swim on the abitibi passages 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.180
 cloudy about the consequences elsewhere at 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.860
 quebec 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.350
 the northeast were allowed and despite the fact 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.750
 we received 400 m swim at tmz 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.790
 it's still going pretty well this morning and 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.530
 the situation should improve in 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.119
 the premises will be more discreet 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.530
 Northeastern Ontario and Abitibi 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.030
 this afternoon to insult wants to believe 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.940
 the course of the skins on a warm-up 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.320
 today the sun will be more than yesterday 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.250
 we can see passages the game there is 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.170
 a small wind from the northeast 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.700
 same scenario on the Quebec side 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.860
 cloudy but fewer voices that evoke 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.600
 and physics at the level of the seas dared to 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.890
 madeleine just like on the north coast and 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.780
 to the singles and therefore badly to clermont and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.100
 third stone is 6000 of the two suns 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.100
 in the afternoon in friendship
