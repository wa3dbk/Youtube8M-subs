what's going on guys in the works and
how<00:00:19.260> about<00:00:19.410> these<00:00:19.650> next-gen<00:00:20.189> graphics<00:00:20.369> if

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
how about these next-gen graphics if

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.429 
how about these next-gen graphics if
you're<00:00:21.210> looking<00:00:21.420> at<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> screen<00:00:21.779> saying<00:00:22.140> what

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
you're looking at the screen saying what

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.720 
you're looking at the screen saying what
on<00:00:22.529> earth<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.800> going<00:00:22.890> on<00:00:23.189> i<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.519> show<00:00:23.699> you

on earth is going on i can show you
there's<00:00:24.180> no<00:00:24.269> problem<00:00:25.050> because<00:00:25.439> today<00:00:25.800> we<00:00:25.920> are

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
there's no problem because today we are

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.380 
there's no problem because today we are
going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.220> be<00:00:26.310> taking<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.670> look<00:00:26.699> at<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
going to be taking a look at one of the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.240 
going to be taking a look at one of the
new<00:00:27.539> tank<00:00:27.869> optics<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.410> battlefield<00:00:28.830> 4<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
new tank optics in battlefield 4 the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.209 
new tank optics in battlefield 4 the
irnv<00:00:29.880> now<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.750> irnv<00:00:31.170> optic<00:00:31.740> was<00:00:31.890> actually

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
irnv now the irnv optic was actually

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.430 
irnv now the irnv optic was actually
introduced<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.030> new<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.840> new<00:00:33.899> thing<00:00:34.320> in

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
introduced as a new a new thing in

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.139 
introduced as a new a new thing in
battlefield<00:00:34.860> 4<00:00:34.890> because<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.489> battlefield<00:00:36.120> 3

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
battlefield 4 because in battlefield 3

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.700 
battlefield 4 because in battlefield 3
you<00:00:36.480> only<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.809> had<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> choice<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.530> zoom

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
you only really had the choice of zoom

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.709 
you only really had the choice of zoom
optics<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.430> wasn't<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.239> wasn't<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.690> same

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
optics and it wasn't it wasn't the same

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.389 
optics and it wasn't it wasn't the same
setup<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.410> know<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.590> actually<00:00:40.829> had<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.250> give

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
setup you know you actually had to give

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.040 
setup you know you actually had to give
up<00:00:41.579> one<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> other<00:00:42.090> things<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.570> get<00:00:42.750> zoom

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
up one of the other things to get zoom

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.630 
up one of the other things to get zoom
optics<00:00:43.469> whereas<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:43.980> they've<00:00:44.219> split<00:00:44.489> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
optics whereas this they've split it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
optics whereas this they've split it
into<00:00:44.760> three<00:00:44.850> categories<00:00:45.239> where<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.320> can

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
into three categories where now you can

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.889 
into three categories where now you can
either<00:00:46.649> choose<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> zoom<00:00:47.340> optics<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> irnv<00:00:48.450> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
either choose a zoom optics the irnv and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.020 
either choose a zoom optics the irnv and
the<00:00:49.020> thermal<00:00:49.469> optics<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.430> don't<00:00:50.610> see<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> lot

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the thermal optics and I don't see a lot

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
the thermal optics and I don't see a lot
of<00:00:51.059> people<00:00:51.449> using<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> irnv<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.590> fact<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.949> lot

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
of people using the irnv in fact a lot

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.189 
of people using the irnv in fact a lot
of<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> people<00:00:53.579> I've<00:00:53.730> talked<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.180> who<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:54.960> big

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
of the people I've talked to who are big

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.930 
of the people I've talked to who are big
tankers<00:00:55.680> say<00:00:55.920> they<00:00:56.070> pretty<00:00:56.280> much<00:00:56.370> preferred

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
tankers say they pretty much preferred

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.060 
tankers say they pretty much preferred
the<00:00:57.090> zoom<00:00:57.300> optics<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.870> every<00:00:58.170> scenario<00:00:58.379> well<00:00:58.890> I

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the zoom optics in every scenario well I

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.740 
the zoom optics in every scenario well I
agree<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.760> them<00:00:59.910> for<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> most<00:01:00.300> part<00:01:00.480> there

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
agree with them for the most part there

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.660 
agree with them for the most part there
are<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> lot<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.410> maps<00:01:01.770> where<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.100> would<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.609> say

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
are a lot of maps where I would just say

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.520 
are a lot of maps where I would just say
just<00:01:03.120> run<00:01:03.300> zoom<00:01:03.539> optics<00:01:03.930> there's<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:04.320> no

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
just run zoom optics there's really no

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.550 
just run zoom optics there's really no
reason<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.159> run<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.720> R<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.170> V<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
reason to run the the R and V or the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.770 
reason to run the the R and V or the
thermal<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.400> maps<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.850> zavod<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:09.540> maps

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
thermal but on maps like zavod or maps

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.359 
thermal but on maps like zavod or maps
like<00:01:10.020> Dawnbreaker<00:01:10.470> where<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.979> little<00:01:11.280> bit

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
like Dawnbreaker where it's a little bit

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.740 
like Dawnbreaker where it's a little bit
harder<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.760> pick<00:01:11.970> people<00:01:12.299> out<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.540> know<00:01:12.630> it's

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
harder to pick people out you know it's

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.359 
harder to pick people out you know it's
a<00:01:12.810> little<00:01:12.960> bit<00:01:13.290> darker<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.950> certain<00:01:14.250> areas

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
a little bit darker in certain areas

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.850 
a little bit darker in certain areas
especially<00:01:15.150> zov<00:01:15.659> odd<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.229> very<00:01:16.530> difficult

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
especially zov odd it is very difficult

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.740 
especially zov odd it is very difficult
to<00:01:17.280> pick<00:01:17.520> people<00:01:17.820> out<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.090> trees<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
to pick people out of the trees and the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.480 
to pick people out of the trees and the
brush<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.560> all<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.799> clutter<00:01:20.159> that's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
brush and all the all the clutter that's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.190 
brush and all the all the clutter that's
around<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.820> map<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.330> I've<00:01:21.630> actually<00:01:21.869> found

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
around the map and I've actually found

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.560 
around the map and I've actually found
the<00:01:22.380> irnv<00:01:22.920> makes<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> little<00:01:23.939> bit<00:01:24.060> simpler

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the irnv makes that a little bit simpler

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.899 
the irnv makes that a little bit simpler
especially<00:01:25.409> since<00:01:25.650> infantry<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:26.790> your

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
especially since infantry is really your

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.219 
especially since infantry is really your
biggest<00:01:27.270> threat<00:01:27.509> especially<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> first

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
biggest threat especially on the first

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.890 
biggest threat especially on the first
you<00:01:28.710> know<00:01:28.829> points<00:01:29.729> there<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.509> you're

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
you know points there you know you're

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.420 
you know points there you know you're
working<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.290> flag<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.740> I'm<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.040> here<00:01:32.250> which

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
from about a month and a half ago when i

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.789 
from about a month and a half ago when i
first<00:01:36.030> started<00:01:36.180> tanking<00:01:36.600> with<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> irnv<00:01:37.409> i

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
first started tanking with the irnv i

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.469 
first started tanking with the irnv i
think<00:01:38.310> i'm<00:01:38.369> running<00:01:38.610> light<00:01:38.909> machine<00:01:39.329> gun

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
think i'm running light machine gun

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.670 
think i'm running light machine gun
action<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.020> when<00:01:40.200> i<00:01:40.229> actually<00:01:40.439> prefer

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
action on this when i actually prefer

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.530 
action on this when i actually prefer
the<00:01:41.070> heavy<00:01:41.340> machine<00:01:41.759> gun<00:01:41.939> because<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.509> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
the heavy machine gun because it is a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.569 
the heavy machine gun because it is a
little<00:01:42.720> bit<00:01:42.869> more<00:01:43.020> versatile<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.490> an

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
little bit more versatile but this is an

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.100 
little bit more versatile but this is an
infantry<00:01:45.030> base<00:01:45.210> load<00:01:45.479> out<00:01:45.630> because<00:01:45.869> i<00:01:45.960> am

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
infantry base load out because i am

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.020 
infantry base load out because i am
using<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> AP<00:01:46.740> shell<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.189> i'm<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.430> loaded<00:01:47.909> to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
using the AP shell so i'm not loaded to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.789 
using the AP shell so i'm not loaded to
go<00:01:48.180> up<00:01:48.329> against<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:48.960> other<00:01:49.170> tanks<00:01:49.680> in

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
go up against you know other tanks in

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.620 
go up against you know other tanks in
terms<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.670> using<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.090> staff<00:01:51.329> shell

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
terms of like using the staff shell

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.270 
terms of like using the staff shell
because<00:01:51.840> i<00:01:51.899> know<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.350> big<00:01:53.250> thing

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
because i know that is the big thing

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.330 
because i know that is the big thing
these<00:01:53.700> days<00:01:53.869> so<00:01:54.869> i<00:01:54.899> am<00:01:55.140> purely<00:01:55.649> an<00:01:55.890> infantry

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
these days so i am purely an infantry

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.190 
these days so i am purely an infantry
loadout<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:56.969> i<00:01:57.090> am<00:01:57.240> using<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.600> AP<00:01:57.930> shell

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
loadout because i am using the AP shell

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.260 
loadout because i am using the AP shell
and<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:59.159> can<00:01:59.310> see<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.490> there's<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.060> lot<00:02:00.240> of

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and you can see that there's a lot of

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.999 
and you can see that there's a lot of
situations<00:02:00.750> where<00:02:01.320> i'm<00:02:01.409> looking<00:02:01.740> into<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
situations where i'm looking into the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.770 
situations where i'm looking into the
train<00:02:02.520> cars<00:02:02.790> where<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.090> normally<00:02:03.180> wouldn't

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
train cars where I normally wouldn't

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.350 
train cars where I normally wouldn't
necessarily<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> person<00:02:05.250> but<00:02:05.969> do<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
necessarily see the person but do the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.210 
necessarily see the person but do the
fact<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> IR<00:02:07.469> envio<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.129> I'm

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
fact that I have the IR envio and I'm

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.859 
fact that I have the IR envio and I'm
able<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.489> pick<00:02:08.759> them<00:02:08.910> out<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.330> scenery<00:02:09.690> and

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
able to pick them out of the scenery and

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.900 
able to pick them out of the scenery and
pick<00:02:10.050> up<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.349> kill<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.400> actually<00:02:11.489> find<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
pick up the kill and I actually find it

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.700 
pick up the kill and I actually find it
to<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.000> very<00:02:12.090> very<00:02:12.330> useful<00:02:12.510> i<00:02:13.020> see<00:02:13.560> a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
to be very very useful i see a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.920 
to be very very useful i see a
lot<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.860> people<00:02:14.100> rely<00:02:15.030> on<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.300> zoom<00:02:15.510> optics

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
lot of people rely on the zoom optics

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.140 
lot of people rely on the zoom optics
and<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.140> don't<00:02:16.320> feel<00:02:16.650> like<00:02:17.010> Maps<00:02:17.340> like<00:02:17.490> savad

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
and I don't feel like Maps like savad

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.810 
and I don't feel like Maps like savad
really<00:02:18.870> benefit<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.680> much<00:02:19.950> from<00:02:20.280> using<00:02:20.640> zoom

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
really benefit that much from using zoom

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.820 
really benefit that much from using zoom
optics<00:02:21.210> I<00:02:21.300> think<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.600> most<00:02:21.780> situations<00:02:22.290> you're

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
optics I think in most situations you're

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.650 
optics I think in most situations you're
better<00:02:23.100> off<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.550> focusing<00:02:24.150> on<00:02:24.270> killing

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
better off just focusing on killing

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.810 
better off just focusing on killing
infantry<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.320> then<00:02:25.770> when<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> tank<00:02:26.280> or<00:02:26.400> lav

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
infantry and then when a tank or lav

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.760 
infantry and then when a tank or lav
comes<00:02:27.090> up<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.600> you've<00:02:27.780> got<00:02:27.990> your<00:02:28.110> AP<00:02:28.500> shell

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
comes up on you you've got your AP shell

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.770 
comes up on you you've got your AP shell
to<00:02:28.920> deal<00:02:29.100> with<00:02:29.250> them<00:02:29.400> now<00:02:29.850> one<00:02:30.090> counter<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.480> have

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
to deal with them now one counter I have

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.540 
to deal with them now one counter I have
found<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.260> would<00:02:31.620> be<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.950> use<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.370> high

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
found that would be to use the high

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.280 
found that would be to use the high
explosive<00:02:33.210> shell<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.570> cheese<00:02:33.930> shell<00:02:34.170> it

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
explosive shell the a cheese shell it

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.990 
explosive shell the a cheese shell it
makes<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.590> lot<00:02:34.800> easier<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.160> take<00:02:35.310> out<00:02:35.490> vehicles

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
makes a lot easier to take out vehicles

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.340 
makes a lot easier to take out vehicles
so<00:02:36.510> if<00:02:36.600> you're<00:02:36.720> wanting<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.080> have<00:02:37.320> your

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
so if you're wanting to have your

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.590 
so if you're wanting to have your
inventory<00:02:38.010> load<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:38.340> with<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.610> irnv<00:02:39.090> and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
inventory load out with the irnv and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.690 
inventory load out with the irnv and
then<00:02:40.050> your<00:02:40.440> light<00:02:40.680> or<00:02:40.920> heavy<00:02:41.070> machine<00:02:41.520> gun

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
then your light or heavy machine gun

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.400 
then your light or heavy machine gun
you'll<00:02:41.880> have<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.300> HD<00:02:42.750> shell<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.170> kind<00:02:43.350> of

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
you'll have the HD shell to kind of

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.960 
you'll have the HD shell to kind of
counter<00:02:43.710> other<00:02:43.890> vehicles<00:02:44.430> it'll<00:02:44.640> give<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.880> an

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
counter other vehicles it'll give you an

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.580 
counter other vehicles it'll give you an
advantage<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.570> them<00:02:45.750> but<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.230> does<00:02:46.380> have

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
advantage of them but it does have

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.380 
advantage of them but it does have
substantial<00:02:47.100> drop<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.550> oftentimes<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.210> will

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
substantial drop so oftentimes I will

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.300 
substantial drop so oftentimes I will
run<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.690> SAB<00:02:48.900> around<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.590> then<00:02:50.010> i'll<00:02:50.130> have

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
run the SAB around and then i'll have

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.160 
run the SAB around and then i'll have
the<00:02:50.430> ir<00:02:50.700> MV<00:02:50.970> with<00:02:51.180> my<00:02:51.450> machine<00:02:51.840> gun<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:52.140> choice

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
the ir MV with my machine gun of choice

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.350 
the ir MV with my machine gun of choice
as<00:02:52.650> my<00:02:52.860> secondary<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:53.640> there's<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.120> lot<00:02:54.300> of

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
as my secondary so there's a lot of

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.940 
as my secondary so there's a lot of
different<00:02:54.480> combinations<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.290> can<00:02:55.380> work<00:02:55.710> with

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
different combinations you can work with

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.670 
different combinations you can work with
in<00:02:56.190> particular<00:02:57.090> thermal<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.750> feel<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:58.440> can

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
in particular thermal I feel like I can

limitations to the thermal optics but I

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.010 
limitations to the thermal optics but I
just<00:03:23.400> find<00:03:23.640> that<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:23.910> way<00:03:24.270> too<00:03:24.330> bright<00:03:24.720> on<00:03:24.990> a

just find that it's way too bright on a

just find that it's way too bright on a

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
thermal it's almost like you're looking

seems<00:03:30.720> like<00:03:30.840> you're<00:03:30.930> just<00:03:31.050> looking<00:03:31.410> into<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
seems like you're just looking into the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.260 
seems like you're just looking into the
surface<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.250> Sun<00:03:32.460> and<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.850> then<00:03:33.120> they

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
surface of the Sun and that then they

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.000 
surface of the Sun and that then they
put<00:03:33.540> play<00:03:33.780> back<00:03:34.020> into<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.380> fact<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.680> maybe<00:03:34.920> I

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
put play back into the fact that maybe I

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.560 
put play back into the fact that maybe I
have<00:03:35.190> my<00:03:35.340> brightness<00:03:35.640> up<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.090> little<00:03:36.270> bit<00:03:36.390> much

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
have my brightness up a little bit much

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.330 
have my brightness up a little bit much
maybe<00:03:37.200> if<00:03:37.380> I'm<00:03:37.500> using<00:03:37.620> thermal<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.160> need<00:03:38.280> to

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
maybe if I'm using thermal I need to

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.100 
maybe if I'm using thermal I need to
tone<00:03:38.550> it<00:03:38.580> back<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.880> little<00:03:39.180> bit<00:03:39.390> but<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:39.870> most

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
tone it back a little bit but in most

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.900 
tone it back a little bit but in most
situations<00:03:40.320> since<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.070> do<00:03:41.130> play<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.430> little<00:03:41.550> bit

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
situations since I do play a little bit

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.610 
situations since I do play a little bit
more<00:03:42.090> aggressive<00:03:42.180> with<00:03:42.780> my<00:03:42.930> tanks<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.350> like<00:03:43.500> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
more aggressive with my tanks I like the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.960 
more aggressive with my tanks I like the
cat<00:03:43.800> flag<00:03:44.100> so<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.370> think<00:03:44.490> that's<00:03:44.670> what<00:03:44.880> they're

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
cat flag so I think that's what they're

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.930 
cat flag so I think that's what they're
best<00:03:45.210> for<00:03:45.540> i<00:03:45.780> find<00:03:46.650> myself<00:03:46.800> just<00:03:47.220> relying<00:03:47.700> on

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
best for i find myself just relying on

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.090 
best for i find myself just relying on
the<00:03:48.090> irnv<00:03:48.570> it's<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.900> lot<00:03:49.140> easier<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.620> pick<00:03:49.920> out

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
the irnv it's a lot easier to pick out

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.650 
the irnv it's a lot easier to pick out
the<00:03:50.280> signatures<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.760> people<00:03:51.180> figure<00:03:51.510> out

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
the signatures of people figure out

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.690 
the signatures of people figure out
where<00:03:51.840> they're<00:03:52.020> at<00:03:52.170> because<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.130> know<00:03:53.250> as<00:03:53.400> a

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
where they're at because you know as a

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.610 
where they're at because you know as a
tanker<00:03:54.240> one<00:03:54.450> of<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.630> most<00:03:54.840> annoying<00:03:55.140> things

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
tanker one of the most annoying things

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.500 
tanker one of the most annoying things
probably<00:03:55.980> is<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.400> MBT<00:03:56.850> law<00:03:56.880> it's<00:03:57.300> very

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
probably is the MBT law it's very

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.180 
probably is the MBT law it's very
difficult<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.230> figure<00:03:58.500> out<00:03:58.620> where<00:03:58.860> that<00:03:58.980> thing

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
difficult to figure out where that thing

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.800 
difficult to figure out where that thing
is<00:03:59.220> coming<00:03:59.490> from<00:03:59.790> just<00:04:00.000> because<00:04:00.330> of<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.480> route

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
is coming from just because of the route

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.570 
is coming from just because of the route
it<00:04:00.990> travels<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:02.010> fact<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.400> just

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
it travels and the fact that it just

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.580 
it travels and the fact that it just
kind<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.790> locks<00:04:03.060> onto<00:04:03.330> you<00:04:03.480> so<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.930> lot<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.320> times

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
kind of locks onto you so a lot of times

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.780 
kind of locks onto you so a lot of times
like<00:04:04.770> you<00:04:04.890> see<00:04:05.010> me<00:04:05.040> getting<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.400> hit<00:04:05.550> here<00:04:05.760> I

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
like you see me getting a hit here I

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.150 
like you see me getting a hit here I
don't<00:04:06.030> really<00:04:06.270> know<00:04:06.570> where<00:04:06.900> they're<00:04:07.080> at<00:04:07.290> but

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
don't really know where they're at but

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.280 
don't really know where they're at but
because<00:04:08.430> I've<00:04:08.550> got<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.820> irnv<00:04:09.270> on<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.720> can<00:04:10.020> see

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
because I've got the irnv on I can see

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.990 
because I've got the irnv on I can see
when<00:04:10.500> they<00:04:10.620> poke<00:04:10.860> around<00:04:11.010> corners<00:04:11.520> or<00:04:11.730> their

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
know where they're at I'm anticipating

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.360 
know where they're at I'm anticipating
them<00:04:15.450> reloading<00:04:16.109> that<00:04:16.260> law<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.890> I'm<00:04:17.010> able<00:04:17.160> to

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
them reloading that law and I'm able to

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.039 
them reloading that law and I'm able to
take<00:04:17.609> out<00:04:17.790> a<00:04:17.820> couple<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.330> people<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.690> probably

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
take out a couple of people I probably

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.720 
take out a couple of people I probably
wouldn't<00:04:19.739> have<00:04:19.859> seen<00:04:20.100> before<00:04:20.520> I<00:04:20.549> get

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
wouldn't have seen before I get

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.490 
wouldn't have seen before I get
destroyed<00:04:21.090> here<00:04:21.359> so<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.840> actually<00:04:21.989> considered

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
destroyed here so I actually considered

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.900 
destroyed here so I actually considered
that<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:22.620> pretty<00:04:22.860> successful<00:04:23.220> run<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.820> know

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
that a pretty successful run I you know

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.280 
that a pretty successful run I you know
I<00:04:23.940> probably<00:04:24.240> would<00:04:24.510> have<00:04:24.570> died<00:04:24.750> a<00:04:24.780> lot<00:04:25.020> quicker

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
I probably would have died a lot quicker

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.840 
I probably would have died a lot quicker
because<00:04:25.560> I<00:04:25.800> wouldn't<00:04:26.040> I<00:04:26.280> wouldn't<00:04:26.340> have<00:04:26.669> seen

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
because I wouldn't I wouldn't have seen

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.530 
because I wouldn't I wouldn't have seen
where<00:04:27.000> those<00:04:27.120> guys

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
where those guys

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.270 
where those guys
were<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:27.870> would<00:04:28.230> have<00:04:28.320> gotten<00:04:28.470> taken<00:04:28.620> out<00:04:28.860> now

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
were I would have gotten taken out now

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.350 
were I would have gotten taken out now
the<00:04:29.340> different<00:04:29.700> optics<00:04:30.000> aren't<00:04:30.240> just

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
the different optics aren't just

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.700 
the different optics aren't just
available<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.020> tank<00:04:31.260> driver<00:04:31.500> the

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
available to the tank driver the

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.230 
available to the tank driver the
secondary<00:04:32.250> gunner<00:04:32.490> can<00:04:32.700> actually<00:04:33.030> choose

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
secondary gunner can actually choose

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.850 
secondary gunner can actually choose
them<00:04:33.510> as<00:04:33.630> well<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.080> this<00:04:34.380> is<00:04:34.500> where<00:04:34.650> I<00:04:34.710> think

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
them as well and this is where I think

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.020 
them as well and this is where I think
it<00:04:34.950> gets<00:04:35.040> a<00:04:35.160> little<00:04:35.280> bit<00:04:35.490> interesting<00:04:35.910> because

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
it gets a little bit interesting because

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.880 
it gets a little bit interesting because
I<00:04:36.150> think<00:04:36.360> it's<00:04:36.510> very<00:04:36.780> useful<00:04:37.230> as<00:04:37.650> the

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
I think it's very useful as the

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.460 
I think it's very useful as the
secondary<00:04:38.340> gunner<00:04:38.700> to<00:04:38.820> run<00:04:39.030> irnv<00:04:39.540> for<00:04:40.140> several

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
secondary gunner to run irnv for several

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.290 
secondary gunner to run irnv for several
reasons<00:04:40.620> first<00:04:40.980> of<00:04:41.160> all<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:41.460> don't<00:04:41.640> have<00:04:42.060> to

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
reasons first of all you don't have to

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.690 
reasons first of all you don't have to
get<00:04:42.480> penalized<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:43.170> guess<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.560> say<00:04:43.770> as<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.520> main

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
get penalized I guess to say as the main

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.240 
get penalized I guess to say as the main
tank<00:04:45.030> driver<00:04:45.330> because<00:04:46.200> you<00:04:46.680> kind<00:04:47.040> of<00:04:47.100> have<00:04:47.220> to

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
tank driver because you kind of have to

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.800 
tank driver because you kind of have to
deal<00:04:47.430> with<00:04:47.520> vehicles<00:04:47.910> sometimes<00:04:48.270> as<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.660> main

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
deal with vehicles sometimes as the main

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.270 
deal with vehicles sometimes as the main
tank<00:04:49.050> driver<00:04:49.290> that's<00:04:49.590> that's<00:04:50.040> what<00:04:50.190> you're

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
tank driver that's that's what you're

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.170 
tank driver that's that's what you're
going<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.460> be<00:04:50.520> doing<00:04:50.670> you're<00:04:50.910> going<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.090> be

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
going to be doing you're going to be

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.550 
going to be doing you're going to be
dealing<00:04:51.330> with<00:04:51.480> vehicles<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.140> sometimes<00:04:52.440> the

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
dealing with vehicles and sometimes the

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.320 
dealing with vehicles and sometimes the
irnv<00:04:52.920> can<00:04:53.280> actually<00:04:53.610> distract<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.210> during

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
irnv can actually distract you during

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.390 
irnv can actually distract you during
tank<00:04:54.690> battles<00:04:55.080> I've<00:04:55.380> had<00:04:55.710> it<00:04:55.800> happen<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:56.130> me<00:04:56.250> a

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
tank battles I've had it happen to me a

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.270 
tank battles I've had it happen to me a
lot<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.120> times<00:04:57.480> whereas<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.470> gutter<00:04:58.740> your

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
lot of times whereas the gutter your

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.070 
lot of times whereas the gutter your
main<00:04:59.550> focus<00:04:59.970> is<00:05:00.120> infantry<00:05:00.600> that's<00:05:00.870> what

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
main focus is infantry that's what

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.870 
main focus is infantry that's what
you're<00:05:01.260> doing<00:05:01.290> you're<00:05:01.680> thinning<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.340> herd<00:05:02.610> of

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
you're doing you're thinning the herd of

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.820 
you're doing you're thinning the herd of
people<00:05:03.480> that<00:05:03.630> are<00:05:03.720> swarming<00:05:04.230> at<00:05:04.380> your<00:05:04.560> tank

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
people that are swarming at your tank

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.190 
people that are swarming at your tank
trying<00:05:05.430> to<00:05:05.580> see<00:05:05.730> for<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.120> trying<00:05:06.390> to<00:05:06.510> RPG<00:05:07.020> you

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
trying to see for you trying to RPG you

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.080 
trying to see for you trying to RPG you
so<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:07.710> makes<00:05:07.860> it<00:05:07.980> a<00:05:08.070> lot<00:05:08.250> easier<00:05:08.310> on<00:05:08.670> your<00:05:08.850> tank

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
so it makes it a lot easier on your tank

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.610 
so it makes it a lot easier on your tank
driver<00:05:09.330> when<00:05:09.570> you're<00:05:09.690> focusing<00:05:10.230> on<00:05:10.350> that

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
driver when you're focusing on that

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.620 
driver when you're focusing on that
another<00:05:11.250> big<00:05:11.520> advantage<00:05:11.550> is<00:05:12.060> you<00:05:12.120> can<00:05:12.390> help

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
another big advantage is you can help

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.900 
another big advantage is you can help
your<00:05:12.810> tank<00:05:13.080> driver<00:05:13.320> spot<00:05:13.800> mines<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.460> spot

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
your tank driver spot mines and spot

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.180 
your tank driver spot mines and spot
slams<00:05:15.300> because<00:05:15.990> slams<00:05:16.290> are<00:05:16.500> very<00:05:16.800> apparent

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
slams because slams are very apparent

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.310 
slams because slams are very apparent
when<00:05:17.430> you<00:05:17.550> use<00:05:17.700> in<00:05:17.850> irnv<00:05:18.300> and<00:05:18.720> I<00:05:19.110> don't<00:05:19.260> know

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
when you use in irnv and I don't know

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.750 
when you use in irnv and I don't know
how<00:05:19.530> many<00:05:19.560> times<00:05:19.920> i've<00:05:20.160> been<00:05:20.280> using<00:05:20.460> it<00:05:20.700> and

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
how many times i've been using it and

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.310 
how many times i've been using it and
i've<00:05:20.850> looked<00:05:21.090> down<00:05:21.390> and<00:05:21.570> i've<00:05:21.690> seen<00:05:21.930> a<00:05:21.960> slam

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
i've looked down and i've seen a slam

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.660 
i've looked down and i've seen a slam
that<00:05:22.500> I<00:05:22.560> normally<00:05:22.620> wouldn't<00:05:23.220> see<00:05:23.340> just

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
that I normally wouldn't see just

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.130 
that I normally wouldn't see just
because<00:05:23.760> it's<00:05:24.060> kind<00:05:24.300> of<00:05:24.390> glowing<00:05:24.690> it<00:05:24.930> kind<00:05:25.110> of

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
because it's kind of glowing it kind of

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.140 
because it's kind of glowing it kind of
has<00:05:25.290> this<00:05:25.440> like<00:05:25.620> weird<00:05:25.920> up<00:05:26.190> cue<00:05:26.670> to<00:05:26.880> it<00:05:27.030> they

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
has this like weird up cue to it they

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.180 
has this like weird up cue to it they
you<00:05:27.600> know<00:05:27.630> normally<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.260> slam<00:05:28.470> is<00:05:28.680> brown<00:05:28.920> it

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
you know normally the slam is brown it

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.650 
you know normally the slam is brown it
just<00:05:29.340> kind<00:05:29.490> of<00:05:29.550> blends<00:05:29.790> in<00:05:30.000> whereas<00:05:30.360> with<00:05:30.390> the

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
just kind of blends in whereas with the

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.540 
just kind of blends in whereas with the
irnv<00:05:31.050> it<00:05:31.320> makes<00:05:31.500> it<00:05:31.620> a<00:05:31.680> lot<00:05:31.890> easier<00:05:31.950> to<00:05:32.310> pick

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
irnv it makes it a lot easier to pick

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.800 
irnv it makes it a lot easier to pick
out<00:05:32.700> where<00:05:32.880> those<00:05:33.030> stupid<00:05:33.420> things<00:05:33.540> are

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
out where those stupid things are

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.420 
out where those stupid things are
because<00:05:34.020> they<00:05:34.110> are<00:05:34.290> very<00:05:34.320> difficult<00:05:35.100> to<00:05:35.220> see

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
because they are very difficult to see

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.880 
because they are very difficult to see
so<00:05:36.300> in<00:05:36.420> my<00:05:36.540> experiences<00:05:37.110> I<00:05:37.230> actually<00:05:37.380> find<00:05:37.710> the

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
so in my experiences I actually find the

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.040 
so in my experiences I actually find the

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
these guys I have a really great view of

where<00:05:55.380> everyone's<00:05:55.800> at<00:05:55.950> I<00:05:56.010> can<00:05:56.310> see<00:05:56.460> them

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
where everyone's at I can see them

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.250 
where everyone's at I can see them
poking<00:05:56.760> their<00:05:57.060> heads<00:05:57.090> over<00:05:57.390> the<00:05:57.630> walls<00:05:57.870> and

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
poking their heads over the walls and

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.470 
poking their heads over the walls and
I've<00:05:58.710> never<00:05:58.950> really<00:05:59.250> been<00:05:59.280> a<00:05:59.430> huge<00:05:59.790> fan<00:05:59.820> of<00:06:00.090> the

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
I've never really been a huge fan of the

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.300 
I've never really been a huge fan of the
zoom<00:06:00.690> optics<00:06:01.140> on<00:06:01.290> the<00:06:01.470> secondary<00:06:01.890> tank

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
zoom optics on the secondary tank

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.130 
zoom optics on the secondary tank
anyways<00:06:02.730> or<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.240> secondary<00:06:03.570> gunner<00:06:03.750> that<00:06:03.960> is

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
anyways or the secondary gunner that is

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.040 
anyways or the secondary gunner that is
just<00:06:04.620> because<00:06:04.860> you're<00:06:04.980> not<00:06:05.130> really<00:06:05.520> a<00:06:06.050> fitted

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
just because you're not really a fitted

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.630 
just because you're not really a fitted
to<00:06:07.200> shoot<00:06:07.470> people<00:06:07.650> at<00:06:07.920> longer<00:06:08.190> ranges<00:06:08.520> is

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
to shoot people at longer ranges is

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.130 
to shoot people at longer ranges is
actually<00:06:08.910> a<00:06:08.970> little<00:06:09.030> bit<00:06:09.270> more<00:06:09.450> difficult<00:06:09.690> as

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
actually a little bit more difficult as

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.110 
actually a little bit more difficult as
the<00:06:10.650> secondary<00:06:11.040> gunner<00:06:11.370> to<00:06:11.490> kill<00:06:11.670> people<00:06:11.820> so

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
the secondary gunner to kill people so

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.490 
the secondary gunner to kill people so
you're<00:06:12.210> better<00:06:12.420> off<00:06:12.480> focusing<00:06:12.840> on<00:06:13.260> close

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
you're better off focusing on close

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.010 
you're better off focusing on close
range<00:06:13.860> I<00:06:14.100> think<00:06:14.520> irnv<00:06:14.970> works<00:06:15.300> a<00:06:15.450> lot<00:06:15.630> better<00:06:15.690> in

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
range I think irnv works a lot better in

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.180 
range I think irnv works a lot better in
that<00:06:16.140> scenario<00:06:16.350> so<00:06:16.770> hopefully<00:06:17.070> you<00:06:17.130> guys

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
that scenario so hopefully you guys

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.670 
that scenario so hopefully you guys
enjoy<00:06:17.610> this<00:06:17.760> video<00:06:17.910> though<00:06:18.270> try<00:06:19.200> it<00:06:19.260> out<00:06:19.470> if

enjoy this video though try it out if
you<00:06:19.890> haven't<00:06:19.920> tried<00:06:20.400> it<00:06:20.520> it<00:06:20.790> might<00:06:21.120> work<00:06:21.300> for

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
you haven't tried it it might work for

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.730 
you haven't tried it it might work for
your<00:06:21.660> play<00:06:21.840> style<00:06:22.050> like<00:06:22.290> I<00:06:22.380> said<00:06:22.590> it<00:06:22.710> is

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
your play style like I said it is

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.070 
your play style like I said it is
limited<00:06:23.130> to<00:06:23.460> some<00:06:23.670> maps<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:24.120> prefer<00:06:24.450> it<00:06:24.600> more<00:06:24.840> on

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
limited to some maps I prefer it more on

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.560 
limited to some maps I prefer it more on
likes<00:06:25.350> Ovid<00:06:25.800> or<00:06:25.950> the<00:06:26.100> darker<00:06:26.460> maps<00:06:26.670> but<00:06:27.390> you

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
likes Ovid or the darker maps but you

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.820 
likes Ovid or the darker maps but you
know<00:06:27.660> it<00:06:27.810> works<00:06:27.960> on<00:06:28.110> a<00:06:28.140> lot<00:06:28.350> of<00:06:28.440> different<00:06:28.650> maps

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
know it works on a lot of different maps

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.020 
know it works on a lot of different maps
depending<00:06:29.250> on<00:06:29.340> what<00:06:29.580> you're<00:06:29.730> going<00:06:29.910> to<00:06:30.000> be
