actually cut very cleanly an exhaust

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.470 
actually cut very cleanly an exhaust
pipe<00:00:22.680> that's<00:00:23.279> what<00:00:23.400> it's<00:00:23.550> designed<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:24.060> and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
pipe that's what it's designed for and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.609 
pipe that's what it's designed for and
this<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:26.550> pipe<00:00:27.000> cutter<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.320> cutting

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
this is a pipe cutter with one cutting

the wheel that's used we have a whole
set<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.180> them<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.660> chain<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.920> tool

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
set of them on this chain this is a tool

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.670 
set of them on this chain this is a tool
designed<00:00:38.430> by<00:00:38.790> professionals<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:40.440> fully

designed by professionals and it's fully

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.459 
designed by professionals and it's fully
adjustable<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.460> as<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.600> take<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> deeper<00:00:43.260> cut

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
adjustable so as you take a deeper cut

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.690 
adjustable so as you take a deeper cut
into<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> metal<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:44.969> adjust<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:46.700> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
into the metal you can adjust it up the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.690 
into the metal you can adjust it up the
chain<00:00:48.000> locks<00:00:48.809> into<00:00:49.079> place<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.520> can

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
chain locks into place here as you can

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.090 
chain locks into place here as you can
see<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.350> holds<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.800> chain

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
see this is what holds the chain

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.979 
see this is what holds the chain
together<00:00:53.520> round<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.270> piping<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.840> you're

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
together round the piping that you're

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.799 
together round the piping that you're
going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.170> cut<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:56.210> think<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:57.360> you'll<00:00:57.480> find

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
going to cut I think what you'll find

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.260 
going to cut I think what you'll find
and<00:00:58.199> you'll<00:00:58.739> realize<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.670> catalytic

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
and you'll realize that that catalytic

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.119 
and you'll realize that that catalytic
converter<00:01:00.600> thieves<00:01:00.930> actually<00:01:01.379> use<00:01:01.649> these<00:01:01.890> to

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
converter thieves actually use these to

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.009 
converter thieves actually use these to
get<00:01:02.280> catalytic<00:01:02.789> converters<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.539> vehicles

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
get catalytic converters on vehicles

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.870 
get catalytic converters on vehicles
very<00:01:04.170> quickly<00:01:04.530> however<00:01:04.979> we're<00:01:05.489> not<00:01:05.700> those

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
very quickly however we're not those

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.410 
very quickly however we're not those
type<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.180> people<00:01:06.680> so<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:08.220> essence<00:01:09.119> what<00:01:09.270> we

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
type of people so in essence what we

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.330 
type of people so in essence what we
need<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:09.840> first<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.260> all<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.470> set<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
need to do first of all is set it up a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.750 
need to do first of all is set it up a
little<00:01:12.299> bit<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.630> tension<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.580> click<00:01:14.580> it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
little bit of tension on it click it

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.730 
little bit of tension on it click it
into<00:01:14.909> place<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:16.490> start<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.580> cut<00:01:18.740> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
into place and then start a cut the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.429 
into place and then start a cut the
cutters<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.430> very<00:01:20.759> efficient<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.450> each

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
cutters here are very efficient and each

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.380 
cutters here are very efficient and each
time<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.830> go<00:01:23.040> around<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.520> adjust<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.180> just

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
time you go around you adjust it up just

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.380 
time you go around you adjust it up just
a<00:01:24.540> little<00:01:24.570> bit<00:01:24.810> more<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.320> take<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> deeper<00:01:25.950> cut

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
a little bit more to take a deeper cut

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.910 
a little bit more to take a deeper cut
if<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.450> take<00:01:27.840> time<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.200> square<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> tool<00:01:28.710> up

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
if you take time to square the tool up

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.399 
if you take time to square the tool up
you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.220> get<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> very<00:01:29.700> accurate<00:01:30.090> straight<00:01:30.840> cut

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you can get a very accurate straight cut

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.609 
you can get a very accurate straight cut
like<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:31.979> I've<00:01:32.100> done<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.640> box<00:01:32.909> here<00:01:33.619> it

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
like what I've done on this box here it

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.590 
like what I've done on this box here it
doesn't<00:01:34.950> take<00:01:35.250> much<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.700> movement<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
doesn't take much of a movement to get a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.630 
doesn't take much of a movement to get a
full<00:01:36.900> cut<00:01:37.170> around<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.590> tubing<00:01:37.920> as<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.189> said<00:01:38.430> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
full cut around the tubing as I said and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.910 
full cut around the tubing as I said and
if<00:01:39.270> you're<00:01:39.450> clever<00:01:39.810> enough<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.650> know<00:01:40.740> how
