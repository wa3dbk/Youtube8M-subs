goes<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.380> pickup<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.399> one<00:01:44.549> goes<00:01:44.729> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
goes to this pickup and this one goes to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.450 
goes to this pickup and this one goes to
this<00:01:45.030> pickup<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.810> then<00:01:46.740> we<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:47.040> these<00:01:47.250> two

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
this pickup and then we have these two

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.740 
this pickup and then we have these two
switches<00:01:47.729> here<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.040> switch<00:01:50.750> selects

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
switches here so this switch selects

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.649 
switches here so this switch selects
between<00:01:51.990> either<00:01:52.710> pickup<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> middle<00:01:54.509> I
