00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.139 
water but ambient humidity in the air
shouldn't<00:01:55.369> really<00:01:55.520> be<00:01:55.640> much<00:01:55.910> of<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.119> problem

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
shouldn't really be much of a problem

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.740 
shouldn't really be much of a problem
for<00:01:56.690> him<00:01:57.399> of<00:01:58.399> course<00:01:58.670> he<00:01:58.849> still<00:01:59.090> has<00:01:59.240> all<00:01:59.270> the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
for him of course he still has all the

same<00:01:59.929> articulation<00:02:00.970> except<00:02:01.970> I<00:02:02.239> don't<00:02:02.300> think

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
same articulation except I don't think

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.050 
same articulation except I don't think
though<00:02:03.380> you<00:02:03.920> should<00:02:04.130> try<00:02:04.399> using<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.849> waist

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060

joint<00:02:05.390> because<00:02:05.569> then<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.440> tail<00:02:06.739> might<00:02:07.130> rip

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
joint because then the tail might rip

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.180 
joint because then the tail might rip
