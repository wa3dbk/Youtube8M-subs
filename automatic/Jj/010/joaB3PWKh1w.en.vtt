00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.980 
on the first and second people we just
did<00:02:14.920> okay<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:15.430> here's<00:02:15.880> what<00:02:16.030> all<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:16.630> sounds

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
did okay so here's what all that sounds

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:28.160 
did okay so here's what all that sounds
like<00:02:25.890> one<00:02:26.890> more<00:02:27.040> time<00:02:27.250> because<00:02:27.520> that's<00:02:27.820> pretty

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
like one more time because that's pretty

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.510 
like one more time because that's pretty
hard<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.260> digest<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.950> first<00:02:30.130> time<00:02:30.280> let's<00:02:30.430> do

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
hard to digest the first time let's do

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:41.580 
hard to digest the first time let's do
it<00:02:30.610> one<00:02:30.790> more<00:02:30.850> time<00:02:39.720> now<00:02:40.720> from<00:02:41.020> there<00:02:41.260> all<00:02:41.500> they

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
it one more time now from there all they

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.380 
it one more time now from there all they
got<00:02:41.740> left<00:02:41.800> is<00:02:42.100> inverted<00:02:42.520> parables<00:02:42.970> it's<00:02:43.150> that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
got left is inverted parables it's that

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.840 
got left is inverted parables it's that
simple

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
simple

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.680 
simple
actually<00:02:45.850> it's<00:02:45.940> not<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.150> simple<00:02:46.300> it<00:02:46.480> took<00:02:46.600> me

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
actually it's not that simple it took me

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.180 
actually it's not that simple it took me
a<00:02:46.750> while<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.900> get<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:47.230> down<00:02:47.410> but<00:02:47.770> once<00:02:48.100> you

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
a while to get this down but once you

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.380 
a while to get this down but once you
get<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.370> down<00:02:48.460> it<00:02:48.850> becomes<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.210> lot<00:02:49.330> easier

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
get it down it becomes a lot easier

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.160 
get it down it becomes a lot easier
right<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:51.040> last<00:02:51.220> part<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.790> beat<00:02:52.170> which

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
right so the last part of the beat which

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.860 
right so the last part of the beat which
falls<00:02:53.440> on<00:02:53.620> v4<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.340> gonna<00:02:54.520> be<00:02:54.870> inverted

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
falls on v4 is gonna be inverted

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.600 
falls on v4 is gonna be inverted
paradiddles<00:02:56.320> okay<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:57.100> it's<00:02:57.220> gonna<00:02:57.310> go<00:02:57.490> like

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
paradiddles okay so it's gonna go like

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:09.570 
paradiddles okay so it's gonna go like
this<00:03:02.370> one<00:03:03.370> more<00:03:03.520> time<00:03:07.680> okay<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.860> when<00:03:09.280> we<00:03:09.340> put

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
this one more time okay and when we put

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.400 
this one more time okay and when we put
that<00:03:09.670> all<00:03:09.730> together<00:03:10.120> with<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.690> entire<00:03:11.050> part

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
that all together with the entire part

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.900
