00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
University in any way that I can I think

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.140 
University in any way that I can I think
uwp<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.769> one<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.100> best-kept<00:03:17.459> secrets<00:03:17.940> not

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
uwp is one of the best-kept secrets not

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.490 
uwp is one of the best-kept secrets not
only<00:03:18.390> in<00:03:18.480> Wisconsin<00:03:19.049> but<00:03:19.079> throughout<00:03:19.440> the

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
only in Wisconsin but throughout the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.979 
only in Wisconsin but throughout the
country<00:03:20.130> I<00:03:20.310> think<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.910> class<00:03:21.180> size<00:03:21.510> is<00:03:21.540> the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
country I think the class size is the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.050 
country I think the class size is the
right<00:03:22.140> size<00:03:22.410> for<00:03:22.440> many<00:03:23.310> students<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.850> was<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
right size for many students it was the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.600 
right size for many students it was the
right<00:03:24.209> size<00:03:24.239> for<00:03:24.450> me<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.709> think<00:03:25.769> where

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
right size for me and I think where

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.539 
right size for me and I think where
these<00:03:26.760> students<00:03:27.150> come<00:03:27.360> from<00:03:27.540> really<00:03:28.200> makes

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
these students come from really makes

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:35.890 
these students come from really makes
makes<00:03:29.549> them<00:03:29.790> who<00:03:30.180> they<00:03:30.209> are

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.550 

I<00:03:36.010> thought<00:03:37.010> everything<00:03:37.220> looked

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
I thought everything looked

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.770 
I thought everything looked
I<00:03:38.620> wasn't<00:03:38.980> expecting<00:03:39.160> that<00:03:39.489> because<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.660> know

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
I wasn't expecting that because you know

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.140 
I wasn't expecting that because you know
my<00:03:40.870> dad<00:03:41.080> went<00:03:41.319> to<00:03:41.440> school<00:03:41.709> here<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.220> wasn't

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
my dad went to school here so wasn't

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.699 
my dad went to school here so wasn't
expecting<00:03:43.569> but<00:03:43.750> everything<00:03:44.080> was<00:03:44.200> really<00:03:44.380> new

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
expecting but everything was really new

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.550 
expecting but everything was really new
and<00:03:45.810> exciting<00:03:46.810> because<00:03:47.110> I<00:03:47.260> haven't<00:03:47.470> really

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
and exciting because I haven't really

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.740 
and exciting because I haven't really
visited<00:03:48.010> any<00:03:48.160> colleges<00:03:48.640> so<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.510> made<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.720> really

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
visited any colleges so it made a really

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.040 
visited any colleges so it made a really
good<00:03:50.050> first<00:03:50.230> impression<00:03:50.770> on<00:03:50.830> me
