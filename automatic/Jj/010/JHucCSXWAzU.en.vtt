of white card yeah
this<00:02:27.800> was<00:02:27.980> reactive<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:29.750> can<00:02:29.900> make<00:02:30.050> these

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
this was reactive and you can make these

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.720 
this was reactive and you can make these
mistiming<00:02:30.620> like<00:02:30.890> Garrigan<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:33.580> was

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.300 

better<00:02:37.730> than<00:02:37.880> coal

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.070
