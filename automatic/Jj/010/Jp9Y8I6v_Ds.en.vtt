through it and then also once we start
as<00:02:07.640> an<00:02:07.759> astronaut<00:02:08.209> for<00:02:08.569> me<00:02:08.750> who<00:02:08.959> did<00:02:09.170> not<00:02:09.259> have

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
as an astronaut for me who did not have

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.199 
as an astronaut for me who did not have
a<00:02:09.560> flying<00:02:09.890> background<00:02:10.459> or<00:02:10.729> have<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.030> military

background<00:02:12.080> where<00:02:12.260> maybe<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.590> had<00:02:12.890> was<00:02:13.010> put

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
background where maybe I had was put

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.100 
background where maybe I had was put
under<00:02:13.430> some<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:13.910> some<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.599> that<00:02:14.690> stress

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
under some of that some of that stress

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.800 
under some of that some of that stress
in<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.470> very<00:02:15.680> critical<00:02:16.400> situation<00:02:16.550> we<00:02:17.420> started

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
in a very critical situation we started

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.280 
in a very critical situation we started
flying<00:02:18.310> t-38<00:02:20.110> that

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
flying t-38 that

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.809 
flying t-38 that
aircraft<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:21.829> we<00:02:21.980> fly<00:02:22.219> in<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.519> astronaut

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
aircraft that we fly in the astronaut

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.429 
aircraft that we fly in the astronaut
office<00:02:22.849> and<00:02:23.390> for<00:02:23.569> me<00:02:23.659> that<00:02:23.689> was<00:02:24.019> very<00:02:24.079> good

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
office and for me that was very good

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.229 
office and for me that was very good
training<00:02:24.799> because<00:02:25.069> your<00:02:25.670> life<00:02:25.879> is<00:02:25.909> on<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
training because your life is on the

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.270 
training because your life is on the
line<00:02:26.540> if<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.840> do<00:02:26.989> something<00:02:27.379> really<00:02:27.530> silly<00:02:27.920> or

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
line if you do something really silly or

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.849 
line if you do something really silly or
stupid<00:02:28.310> in<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:28.939> airplane<00:02:29.329> and<00:02:29.689> so<00:02:30.049> so<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:30.680> you

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
stupid in the airplane and so so you you

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.530 
stupid in the airplane and so so you you
really<00:02:31.340> learn<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.519> work<00:02:31.879> under<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.209> stressful

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
really learn to work under a stressful

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.390 
really learn to work under a stressful
situation<00:02:32.689> and<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.890> think<00:02:34.069> that's<00:02:34.219> very

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
situation and I think that's very

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.880 
situation and I think that's very
important<00:02:34.969> when<00:02:35.060> you're<00:02:35.180> living<00:02:35.390> up<00:02:35.629> here<00:02:38.890> hi

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
important when you're living up here hi

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.459
