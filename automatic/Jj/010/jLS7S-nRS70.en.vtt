00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910 

I<00:00:00.030> think<00:00:00.329> that<00:00:00.539> the<00:00:00.750> sport<00:00:01.650> of<00:00:01.770> bodybuilding

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
I think that the sport of bodybuilding

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.320 
I think that the sport of bodybuilding
is<00:00:02.429> in<00:00:02.580> the<00:00:02.639> Crossroads

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
is in the Crossroads

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.539 
is in the Crossroads
I<00:00:03.510> think<00:00:04.350> that<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.680> sport<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:05.430> bodybuilding

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
I think that the sport of bodybuilding

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.720 
I think that the sport of bodybuilding
could<00:00:06.150> go<00:00:06.359> through<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.049> roof<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.730> become

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
could go through the roof and become

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.209 
could go through the roof and become
part<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.450> Olympics<00:00:09.860> become<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:11.010> an

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
part of the Olympics become of an

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.240 
part of the Olympics become of an
Olympic<00:00:11.550> sport<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.740> accepted<00:00:13.740> by<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
Olympic sport and accepted by the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.560 
Olympic sport and accepted by the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
general public in a huge way and be on

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.160 
general public in a huge way and be on
television<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.439> be<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.220> everything<00:00:20.670> or<00:00:21.240> it

television and be and everything or it

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.519 
television and be and everything or it
became<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.949> regresses<00:00:23.840> back<00:00:24.840> again<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.380> become

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
became a regresses back again to become

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.980 
became a regresses back again to become
a<00:00:25.710> subculture<00:00:26.340> where<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:27.480> only<00:00:27.599> for<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
a subculture where it's only for a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.609 
a subculture where it's only for a
limited<00:00:28.320> amount<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.300> characters<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:31.380> was

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
limited amount of characters like it was

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.680 
limited amount of characters like it was
in<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.640> 40s<00:00:33.300> 50s<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.110> 60s<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:35.120> I<00:00:36.120> think<00:00:36.540> it

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
in the 40s 50s and 60s and I think it

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.380 
in the 40s 50s and 60s and I think it
worked<00:00:36.960> very<00:00:37.230> hard<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.649> get<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.950> out<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.190> that

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
worked very hard to get it out of that

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.250 
worked very hard to get it out of that
in<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.570> 70s<00:00:40.879> and<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:42.120> were<00:00:42.270> successful<00:00:42.750> in

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
in the 70s and we were successful in

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.889 
in the 70s and we were successful in
convincing<00:00:43.739> people<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
convincing people that this is a

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.549 
convincing people that this is a
beautiful<00:00:46.230> body<00:00:47.149> but<00:00:48.149> now<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.289> people

gone<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.670> next<00:01:00.120> step<00:01:02.449> where<00:01:03.449> all<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.809> sudden

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
gone the next step where all of a sudden

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.470 
gone the next step where all of a sudden
the<00:01:04.260> body<00:01:04.500> does<00:01:05.489> not<00:01:05.670> look<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.180> acceptable

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
the body does not look as acceptable

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.920 
the body does not look as acceptable
simply<00:01:08.350> because<00:01:08.530> it's<00:01:08.890> too<00:01:09.100> big<00:01:09.130> it's<00:01:09.930> too

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
simply because it's too big it's too

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.770 
simply because it's too big it's too
enormous<00:01:11.470> and<00:01:11.710> it<00:01:12.610> doesn't<00:01:13.000> have<00:01:13.120> any<00:01:13.270> talent

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
enormous and it doesn't have any talent

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.760 
enormous and it doesn't have any talent
behind<00:01:13.960> it<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.880> therefore<00:01:16.320> when<00:01:17.320> you<00:01:17.350> look<00:01:17.620> at

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
behind it so therefore when you look at

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.730 
behind it so therefore when you look at

are 18 the proportion is gone
give<00:02:02.950> me<00:02:03.070> old<00:02:03.250> days<00:02:03.460> you<00:02:03.640> always<00:02:03.910> had<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.120> bring

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
give me old days you always had to bring

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.680 
give me old days you always had to bring
something<00:02:04.750> else<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.620> table<00:02:06.120> in<00:02:07.120> order<00:02:07.390> to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
something else to the table in order to

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.730 
something else to the table in order to
be<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:07.960> champion<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.860> so<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.820> think<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.510> if<00:02:11.380> it

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
be a champion and so I think that if it

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.850 
be a champion and so I think that if it
continues<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.550> way<00:02:13.020> we<00:02:14.020> will<00:02:14.230> have<00:02:14.260> more<00:02:14.709> and

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
continues this way we will have more and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.040 
continues this way we will have more and
more<00:02:14.950> people<00:02:15.250> shy<00:02:16.030> away<00:02:16.060> from<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.020> say

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
more people shy away from that and say

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.690 
more people shy away from that and say
and<00:02:17.290> say<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:17.680> don't<00:02:17.890> want<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.250> look<00:02:18.370> like<00:02:18.430> that

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
and say I don't want to look like that

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.300 
and say I don't want to look like that
and<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:20.230> more<00:02:20.440> we<00:02:20.590> go<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.860> other<00:02:20.890> way<00:02:21.160> and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
and the more we go the other way and
