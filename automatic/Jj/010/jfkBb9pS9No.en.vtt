00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.420
 here in iron since 1988 now 25 years 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.150
 bioland cultivation fresh vegetables for 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.720
 Customers directly from the farm week market 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.340
 supply of organic food and to the course 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.949
 In addition , we also have two 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.499
 trading company next to our own 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.169
 we also have vegetables produced 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:26.300
 30 farmers were growing for us 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.189
 Agreed different varieties 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.980
 we produce and bundle here for 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.890
 to prepare wholesale organic food and 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.290
 In addition, we trade cereals 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.570
 nationwide the decor is in the reason 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.970
 a two-year culture that's me 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.660
 have in the first growing year I make the 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:48.500
 Grown cultivation that the seed is there 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.680
 seeded in mid-May growing up in the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.170
 late autumn into the end of october 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.540
 then the chicory root is cleared 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.600
 and comes to the cold house and the cold house 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.250
 is basically for the Curia root 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.579
 the winter rest took place and we pick 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.640
 In portions always so much you go 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:09.409
 also can market the chicorÃ©e the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.030
 busseln out of the cold store and 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.390
 Put everyone in the driver 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.460
 crates is a departure from the water 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.580
 was and the water runs through, so to speak 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.880
 looking for the green hose in the season 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.740
 crates and then runs in from a cyst 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.830
 the next so that all plant in the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.200
 water stand and our last again 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.810
 out but such a return before again in 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.479
 So the pool, the plant form 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.210
 This travel root is fresh 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.460
 size also for natural 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.610
 in the earth image would be about the over 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.460
 this was the lazy pro 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.409
 train crate are somewhere between 30 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.990
 and increased 40 kilos at the nine cms 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.520
 varieties go up to the yield 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.850
 twice as high in the German 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.600
 farming associations we are living was the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.259
 cms there good because it is in the breeding 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.649
 a form of genetic engineering use it 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:14.100
 gives bio in the eu and after eu 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.760
 ordinarily authorized varieties the over 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.049
 the cms breeding are increased 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.299
 Breeding progress happens almost exclusively 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.940
 still over so at the col especially now 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.970
 but also chicory about these cms 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.760
 for there are also so Europe 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.349
 also in holland and belgium france 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.670
 larger plants are very much chicoree 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.019
 also produce the fancier 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.670
 produce because of the advantage in 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.280
 quotes of these varieties 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.130
 that they have higher productivity 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.579
 so i can do per root or per 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.709
 area unit so ready in the 3 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:49.049
 say carinthia up to double the amount 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.810
 the better safer 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.370
 optical quality in any case 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.609
 and of course that has one 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.920
 affect the price so this 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.049
 companies employing such varieties 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.650
 can produce cheaper than us 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.780
 produce and then it can be too 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.930
 lead to a price pressure on the market 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.930
 if now, for example, a wholesaler 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.870
 Naturkost wholesaler I offer but 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.560
 Also such goods parallel to the bandage 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.019
 ware on 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.900
 and there's just one saying 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.010
 euro or euro 50 per kilo 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.139
 Price difference and the customer judges 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.750
 Only after the price then for the 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.010
 lead in the long term that 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.660
 want to be displaced from the market 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.730
 simply are no longer competitive 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.200
 a problem is that these were you saying 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.700
 but it does not have to be marked 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.200
 it is not the breeder now 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.570
 not marked with guests 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.850
 genetic engineering as we see it here 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.260
 that neither on the label there you can 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.500
 of course realize that it is bio 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.730
 Ware acts but one does not recognize the 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.110
 variety and also where there is no 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.090
 so there it is even for the 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.890
 professional not possible of the word police 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.330
 to recognize from which one then deduce 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.930
 could whether it is good or cms rad 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.360
 possibly the only way away 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.570
 to leverage or get ahead 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.940
 that in the cultivation agreement with the 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.280
 Producers abroad even more detailed 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.910
 specifies which varieties are cultivated 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.290
 likely 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.260
 there are negative lists in the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.720
 farming associations like demeter where these 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.250
 varieties are listed and just for 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.250
 we are not allowed
