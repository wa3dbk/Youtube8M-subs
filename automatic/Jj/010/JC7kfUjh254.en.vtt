00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
you've been in the forest before abort

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.129 
you've been in the forest before abort
you<00:04:01.730> literally<00:04:01.970> go<00:04:02.180> north<00:04:02.480> three<00:04:02.840> or<00:04:02.959> four

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
times and then you get to this part

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.080 
times and then you get to this part
where<00:04:05.690> there's<00:04:05.870> this<00:04:06.519> really<00:04:07.519> weird<00:04:07.639> Canadian

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
like that but after that you literally

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.370 
like that but after that you literally
could<00:04:22.490> talk<00:04:22.760> to<00:04:22.940> him<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.360> know<00:04:23.480> what<00:04:23.780> I<00:04:24.200> said

the forest to go out the forest you

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.740 
the forest to go out the forest you
don't<00:04:51.560> just<00:04:51.770> go<00:04:51.980> like<00:04:52.250> in<00:04:52.670> the<00:04:53.330> opposite

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
don't just go like in the opposite

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.970 
don't just go like in the opposite
direction<00:04:53.840> which<00:04:54.320> you<00:04:54.470> came<00:04:54.650> through

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
direction which you came through

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.260 
direction which you came through
I<00:04:55.190> don't<00:04:55.460> think<00:04:55.550> so<00:04:55.880> anyway

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
I don't think so anyway

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.330 
I don't think so anyway
see<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.300> suppose<00:04:59.050> that<00:04:59.290> might<00:04:59.470> work<00:04:59.680> for<00:04:59.920> its

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
see I suppose that might work for its

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.930 
see I suppose that might work for its
it's<00:05:00.550> best<00:05:00.790> to<00:05:00.880> just<00:05:00.940> go<00:05:01.240> down<00:05:01.480> three<00:05:01.870> times

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
it's best to just go down three times

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.670 
it's best to just go down three times
yeah<00:05:03.940> you<00:05:04.000> go<00:05:04.180> down<00:05:04.390> and<00:05:04.990> you<00:05:05.080> end<00:05:05.260> up<00:05:05.380> in<00:05:05.560> the

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
yeah you go down and you end up in the

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.000 
yeah you go down and you end up in the
