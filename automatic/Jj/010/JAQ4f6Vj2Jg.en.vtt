know once you've heard that so we just

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.550 
know once you've heard that so we just
won<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.420> game<00:02:46.599> calling<00:02:46.959> off<00:02:47.140> there<00:02:47.349> and<00:02:47.500> then

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
won the game calling off there and then

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.830 
won the game calling off there and then
the<00:02:48.160> fortune<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:48.730> we<00:02:48.760> made<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.269> tackle

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
the fortune that we made the tackle

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.740
