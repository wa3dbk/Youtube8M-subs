halo<00:02:51.770> I<00:02:52.190> don't<00:02:52.400> play<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:52.610> much<00:02:52.880> just<00:02:53.260> even

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
halo I don't play that much just even

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.190

though<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.740> a<00:02:54.950> great<00:02:55.430> game<00:02:55.700> um<00:02:56.210> I<00:02:56.810> think

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
though it is a great game um I think

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.640 
though it is a great game um I think
it's<00:02:57.320> like<00:02:57.500> on<00:02:57.740> the<00:02:57.860> greater<00:02:58.100> games<00:02:58.400> but<00:02:59.650> it's

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
it's like on the greater games but it's

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.100 
it's like on the greater games but it's
just<00:03:00.980> kind<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.400> slow<00:03:01.730> pace<00:03:01.970> for<00:03:02.240> me<00:03:02.360> I<00:03:02.600> don't

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
just kind of to slow pace for me I don't

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.480 
just kind of to slow pace for me I don't
want<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.410> fact<00:03:03.620> that<00:03:03.710> you<00:03:03.890> have<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.100> film<00:03:04.250> like

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
want the fact that you have to film like

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.730 
want the fact that you have to film like
16<00:03:04.970> bullets<00:03:05.240> to<00:03:05.600> kill<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.990> like<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.350> faster

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
but the only problem about cod being the

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.120 
but the only problem about cod being the
snipers<00:03:30.880> like<00:03:31.880> Rach<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:33.200> crap<00:03:33.500> out<00:03:33.710> of<00:03:33.740> me<00:03:33.980> I

about 40 hey commenting but it takes
skill<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.230> be<00:03:39.380> a<00:03:39.500> sniper<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.340> I<00:03:41.240> will<00:03:41.540> admit<00:03:41.780> it

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
skill to be a sniper and I will admit it

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.350 
skill to be a sniper and I will admit it
takes<00:03:42.350> some<00:03:43.010> guts<00:03:43.220> like<00:03:43.550> you<00:03:43.730> can't<00:03:43.910> just<00:03:44.120> pick

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
takes some guts like you can't just pick

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.620 
takes some guts like you can't just pick
up<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:44.770> be<00:03:45.770> able<00:03:45.860> to<00:03:46.070> quickscope<00:03:46.610> it<00:03:47.300> actually

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
up and be able to quickscope it actually

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.960 
up and be able to quickscope it actually
does<00:03:47.810> take<00:03:48.050> skill<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.590> quickscope<00:03:49.070> but<00:03:49.760> once

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
does take skill to quickscope but once

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.700 
does take skill to quickscope but once
you<00:03:50.060> learn<00:03:50.270> how<00:03:50.300> a<00:03:50.450> quick<00:03:50.720> scope<00:03:50.990> it<00:03:51.170> takes<00:03:51.350> no

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
you learn how a quick scope it takes no

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.280 
you learn how a quick scope it takes no
skill<00:03:51.770> in<00:03:52.400> order<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.850> actually<00:03:53.270> win<00:03:53.720> gunfights

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
skill in order to actually win gunfights

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.100 
skill in order to actually win gunfights
