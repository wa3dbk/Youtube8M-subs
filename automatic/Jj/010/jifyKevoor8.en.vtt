surprising<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:22.920> was<00:00:23.310> expecting<00:00:23.789> something

surprising I was expecting something

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820 
surprising I was expecting something
different<00:00:24.150> but<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.869> does<00:00:25.019> resemble<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.619> lot

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
different but it does resemble a lot

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.920 
different but it does resemble a lot
like<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.130> enmity<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> three<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:27.630> thing<00:00:27.840> I

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
like the enmity to a three one thing I

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.720 
like the enmity to a three one thing I
really<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> magazine<00:00:29.070> design<00:00:29.490> and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
really like is the magazine design and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.439 
really like is the magazine design and
the<00:00:29.789> way<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.060> looks

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
the way it looks

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.089 
the way it looks
whenever<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.109> reload<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.619> actually<00:00:31.890> get<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
whenever you reload you actually get to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.650 
whenever you reload you actually get to
see<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> bullets<00:00:32.640> inside<00:00:32.940> which<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.480> thought

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
see the bullets inside which I thought

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.690 
see the bullets inside which I thought
was<00:00:33.840> pretty<00:00:34.050> cool<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:35.040> sound<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.340> makes<00:00:35.489> is

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700

was pretty cool the sound that makes is
pretty<00:00:35.910> awesome<00:00:36.000> -<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.600> definitely<00:00:37.020> does

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
pretty awesome - it definitely does

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.049 
pretty awesome - it definitely does
sound<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> threatening<00:00:38.100> weapon<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
sound like a threatening weapon the

a<00:00:41.280> unique<00:00:41.640> one<00:00:41.879> Theoretical<00:00:42.870> itself<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.379> not

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
a unique one Theoretical itself is not

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.560 
a unique one Theoretical itself is not
the<00:00:43.649> exclusive<00:00:43.890> part<00:00:44.489> it's<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.000> zoom<00:00:45.300> factor

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the exclusive part it's the zoom factor

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.930 
the exclusive part it's the zoom factor
this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.620> first<00:00:47.010> default<00:00:47.250> sight<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.820> the

game that can zoom in at different
levels<00:00:49.680> which<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.219> pretty<00:00:50.399> awesome<00:00:50.610> this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
levels which is pretty awesome this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.119 
levels which is pretty awesome this
weapon<00:00:51.930> has<00:00:52.050> four<00:00:52.350> levels<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.800> magnification

there<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> huge<00:00:54.690> difference<00:00:55.079> between

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
there is not a huge difference between

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.139 
there is not a huge difference between
all<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.680> them<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.399> still<00:00:56.670> provides<00:00:57.030> an

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
all of them but it still provides an

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.660 
all of them but it still provides an
additional<00:00:57.360> zoom<00:00:57.870> over<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.980> was<00:00:59.340> standing

the hipfire accuracy is not the most

the hipfire accuracy is not the most

point of any sniper rifle but I found

shots<00:02:30.510> with<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.870> thing<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.320> don't<00:02:31.770> know<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:31.950> I

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
shots with this thing I don't know if I

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.320 
shots with this thing I don't know if I
was<00:02:32.190> luck<00:02:32.430> or<00:02:32.550> not<00:02:32.700> but<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.060> felt<00:02:33.270> very

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
was luck or not but it felt very

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.960 
was luck or not but it felt very
rewarding<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.290> fact<00:02:34.800> my<00:02:35.070> first<00:02:35.310> ever<00:02:35.610> kill

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
rewarding in fact my first ever kill

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.270 
rewarding in fact my first ever kill
with<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.210> gun<00:02:36.420> was<00:02:36.600> an<00:02:36.720> L<00:02:36.870> scope<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.920> weapon

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
with this gun was an L scope this weapon

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.680 
with this gun was an L scope this weapon
is<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.400> very<00:02:38.640> interesting<00:02:39.060> one<00:02:39.210> because<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
is a very interesting one because of the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.420 
is a very interesting one because of the
fact<00:02:39.960> that<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.410> medium<00:02:40.770> bolt-action

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
fact that it is a medium bolt-action

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.940 
fact that it is a medium bolt-action
it's<00:02:41.940> not<00:02:42.120> really<00:02:42.360> fast<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.840> be<00:02:42.960> too<00:02:43.140> close<00:02:43.410> but

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
it's not really fast to be too close but

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.100 
it's not really fast to be too close but
not<00:02:44.100> too<00:02:44.340> slow<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.730> be<00:02:44.850> too<00:02:45.030> far<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:45.990> be

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
not too slow to be too far it can be

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.300 
not too slow to be too far it can be
used<00:02:46.290> anywhere<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:46.980> would<00:02:47.130> suggest

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
used anywhere but I would suggest

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.010 
used anywhere but I would suggest
sticking<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.970> medium<00:02:48.240> range<00:02:48.390> because<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.960> the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
sticking a medium range because of the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.600 
sticking a medium range because of the
fact<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.320> being<00:02:49.530> too<00:02:49.740> close<00:02:49.950> more<00:02:50.250> really<00:02:50.490> be

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
fact that being too close more really be

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.190 
fact that being too close more really be
good<00:02:50.850> unless<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.240> can<00:02:51.450> get<00:02:51.600> your<00:02:51.720> first<00:02:51.930> shot

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
good unless you can get your first shot

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.440 
good unless you can get your first shot
then<00:02:52.620> pistol<00:02:53.070> with<00:02:53.190> them<00:02:53.340> staying<00:02:54.000> too<00:02:54.210> far

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
then pistol with them staying too far

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.790 
then pistol with them staying too far
isn't<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.780> best<00:02:54.960> because<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.440> damage

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
isn't the best because of the damage

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.800 
isn't the best because of the damage
that<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:56.040> very<00:02:56.310> low<00:02:56.520> at<00:02:56.670> extreme<00:02:57.000> ranges<00:02:57.390> so

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
that is very low at extreme ranges so

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.330 
that is very low at extreme ranges so
for<00:02:57.960> that<00:02:58.050> reason<00:02:58.110> stick<00:02:58.740> at<00:02:58.860> medium<00:02:59.130> range

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
for that reason stick at medium range

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.830 
for that reason stick at medium range
don't<00:02:59.730> be<00:02:59.790> too<00:02:59.940> aggressive<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.510> would<00:03:00.690> also

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
don't be too aggressive I would also

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.780 
don't be too aggressive I would also
suggest<00:03:01.140> sticking<00:03:01.500> with<00:03:01.800> one<00:03:01.980> magnification

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
suggest sticking with one magnification

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.370 
suggest sticking with one magnification
level<00:03:03.060> because<00:03:03.570> switching<00:03:03.900> between<00:03:04.050> all<00:03:04.350> of

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
level because switching between all of

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.440 
level because switching between all of
them<00:03:04.620> will<00:03:04.830> confuse<00:03:05.220> your<00:03:05.340> bullet<00:03:05.640> drop<00:03:05.850> for

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
them will confuse your bullet drop for

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.880 
them will confuse your bullet drop for
attachments<00:03:06.960> I<00:03:07.050> would<00:03:07.200> go<00:03:07.350> for<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.560> precision

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
attachments I would go for the precision

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.920 
attachments I would go for the precision
barrel<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.670> less<00:03:08.850> bullet<00:03:09.150> drop<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:09.630> the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
barrel the less bullet drop you have the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.110 
barrel the less bullet drop you have the
better<00:03:10.080> range<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.130> not<00:03:11.280> really<00:03:11.550> an<00:03:11.610> issue<00:03:11.790> here

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
better range is not really an issue here

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.670 
better range is not really an issue here
and<00:03:12.240> there's<00:03:12.420> not<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.690> be<00:03:12.810> augmented<00:03:12.990> so

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
and there's not to be augmented so

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.350 
and there's not to be augmented so
lowering<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.130> bullet<00:03:14.370> job<00:03:14.550> is<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.910> way<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.090> go

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
lowering the bullet job is the way to go

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.410 
lowering the bullet job is the way to go
Viper<00:03:16.020> max<00:03:16.380> CQC<00:03:17.040> max<00:03:17.280> high-power<00:03:17.910> ammo<00:03:18.330> and

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
Viper max CQC max high-power ammo and

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.970 
Viper max CQC max high-power ammo and
even<00:03:18.660> piranha<00:03:18.930> mags<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.530> way<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.680> go<00:03:19.860> as

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
even piranha mags is the way to go as

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.860 
even piranha mags is the way to go as
well<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.400> would<00:03:20.820> suggest<00:03:20.970> using<00:03:21.270> Viper<00:03:21.600> mags

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
well I would suggest using Viper mags

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.390 
well I would suggest using Viper mags
though<00:03:22.050> because<00:03:22.200> adding<00:03:22.620> more<00:03:22.830> ammo<00:03:23.070> is

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
though because adding more ammo is

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.140 
though because adding more ammo is
always<00:03:23.790> better

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
always better

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.790 
always better
finally<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.870> stock<00:03:25.080> does<00:03:25.260> not<00:03:25.290> even<00:03:25.560> matter

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
finally the stock does not even matter

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.680 
finally the stock does not even matter
so<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.130> don't<00:03:26.370> even<00:03:26.490> need<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.670> use<00:03:27.000> one<00:03:27.240> the

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
so you don't even need to use one the

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.420 
so you don't even need to use one the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
this weapon more as it's not the fastest

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.130 
this weapon more as it's not the fastest
and<00:03:41.790> will<00:03:41.910> not<00:03:42.060> satisfy<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.630> aggressive

out of the ordinary and stunning weapons

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.000 
out of the ordinary and stunning weapons
but<00:03:51.690> with<00:03:51.780> attachments<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.590> does<00:03:52.860> achieve

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
but with attachments it does achieve

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.520 
but with attachments it does achieve
what<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.459> m95<00:03:53.880> can<00:03:54.239> do<00:03:54.390> but<00:03:54.810> with<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.020> faster
