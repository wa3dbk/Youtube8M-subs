tourniquet<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:15.450> way<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.630> know<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.110> you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
tourniquet that way you know that you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.259 
tourniquet that way you know that you
get<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.950> extremity<00:02:17.400> covered<00:02:17.790> because<00:02:18.060> you

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
get the extremity covered because you

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.850 
get the extremity covered because you
want<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.569> go<00:02:18.660> closer<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.290> body<00:02:19.470> from<00:02:19.769> the

three inches above the injury so but and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.310 
three inches above the injury so but and
that's<00:02:26.459> such<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.790> debate<00:02:27.299> on<00:02:27.510> when<00:02:28.049> and<00:02:28.200> where

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
that's such a debate on when and where

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.289 
that's such a debate on when and where
you're<00:02:28.470> applying<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.920> tourniquet<00:02:29.400> if<00:02:30.150> you're

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
you're applying the tourniquet if you're

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.870 
you're applying the tourniquet if you're
under<00:02:30.450> high<00:02:30.600> pressure<00:02:30.920> sometimes<00:02:31.920> high<00:02:32.730> and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
under high pressure sometimes high and

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.099 
under high pressure sometimes high and
tight<00:02:33.000> it's<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.299> easiest<00:02:33.630> way<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.750> apply<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
tight it's just easiest way to apply the

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.340 
tight it's just easiest way to apply the
tourniquet<00:02:35.630> typically<00:02:36.630> when<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:36.989> go<00:02:37.109> through

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
tourniquet typically when you go through

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.680 
tourniquet typically when you go through
an<00:02:37.769> extremity<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.880> lower<00:02:39.090> extremity<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.570> the

leg you want to go through both sides of
the<00:02:42.000> buckle<00:02:42.359> there<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:42.989> kind<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.170> hard<00:02:43.320> to

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
the buckle there it's kind of hard to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
child's leg so small you can just go

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.330 
child's leg so small you can just go
through<00:02:49.019> this<00:02:49.109> first<00:02:49.350> loop<00:02:51.829> you<00:02:52.829> can<00:02:52.980> see<00:02:53.100> even

lower extremity one of the problems you
may<00:03:01.380> run<00:03:01.709> into<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.160> when<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.340> go<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.519> apply

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
may run into is when you go to apply

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.729 
may run into is when you go to apply
this<00:03:02.820> tourniquet<00:03:03.299> to<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.450> child<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:04.049> getting

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
this tourniquet to a child is getting

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.759 
this tourniquet to a child is getting
this<00:03:05.130> part<00:03:05.459> here<00:03:06.109> because<00:03:07.109> this<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.470> hard

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
this part here because this is a hard

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.800 
this part here because this is a hard
plastic<00:03:07.980> here<00:03:08.549> just<00:03:09.090> getting<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.450> actually

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
plastic here just getting it actually

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.680 
plastic here just getting it actually
wrap<00:03:09.989> around<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:11.130> child's<00:03:11.519> arm<00:03:11.730> or<00:03:12.030> leg<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:12.540> if

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
wrap around the child's arm or leg so if

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.949 
wrap around the child's arm or leg so if
they<00:03:13.290> are<00:03:13.470> smaller<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.730> may<00:03:15.030> not<00:03:15.209> get<00:03:15.420> the

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
they are smaller it may not get the

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.770 
they are smaller it may not get the
pressure<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.650> needs<00:03:17.269> this<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.569> part

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
pressure that it needs this is the part

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.599 
pressure that it needs this is the part
here<00:03:18.930> where<00:03:19.049> I<00:03:19.079> was<00:03:19.170> talking<00:03:19.410> about<00:03:19.440> on<00:03:20.040> an

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
here where I was talking about on an

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.840 
here where I was talking about on an
adult<00:03:21.269> when<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.660> go<00:03:21.780> through<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.079> leg<00:03:22.850> you

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
adult when you go through the leg you

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.750 
adult when you go through the leg you
typically<00:03:24.209> run<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.630> through<00:03:24.870> both<00:03:25.760> sections

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
typically run it through both sections

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.979 
typically run it through both sections
because<00:03:26.880> there's<00:03:27.150> not<00:03:27.269> as<00:03:27.359> much<00:03:27.480> velcro<00:03:27.930> to

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
because there's not as much velcro to

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.949 
because there's not as much velcro to
hold<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:29.129> typically<00:03:29.970> they're<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:30.780> on<00:03:30.870> a

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
hold to so typically they're but on a

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.100 
hold to so typically they're but on a
child's<00:03:31.470> arm

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
child's arm

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.440 
child's arm
legs<00:03:32.290> are<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:32.590> small<00:03:33.000> but<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.120> don't<00:03:34.270> have<00:03:34.330> to

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
legs are so small but you don't have to

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.170 
legs are so small but you don't have to
do<00:03:34.570> that<00:03:35.520> come<00:03:36.520> run<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:36.760> through<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.000> first

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
do that come run it through the first

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.410 
do that come run it through the first
one<00:03:37.420> here<00:03:38.370> pull<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:39.520> as<00:03:39.700> tight<00:03:39.970> as<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.180> could

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
one here pull this as tight as you could

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.330 
one here pull this as tight as you could
possibly<00:03:40.570> get<00:03:40.960> it<00:03:41.110> as<00:03:41.230> if<00:03:41.710> you<00:03:41.860> were<00:03:41.890> trying<00:03:42.160> to

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
possibly get it as if you were trying to

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.640 
possibly get it as if you were trying to
cut<00:03:42.520> off<00:03:42.640> blood<00:03:42.910> flow<00:03:43.110> just<00:03:44.110> by<00:03:44.260> putting<00:03:44.440> this

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
cut off blood flow just by putting this

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.210 
cut off blood flow just by putting this
velcro<00:03:44.830> on<00:03:46.110> here<00:03:47.880> spin<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:49.060> around

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
velcro on here spin this around

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.890 
velcro on here spin this around
typically<00:03:51.220> three<00:03:51.490> or<00:03:51.610> four<00:03:51.790> times<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.750> what

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
typically three or four times is what

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.940 
typically three or four times is what
you're<00:03:53.020> gonna<00:03:53.110> have<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.290> do<00:03:53.410> to<00:03:53.500> get<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.740> blood

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
you're gonna have to do to get the blood

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.290 
you're gonna have to do to get the blood
flow<00:03:54.100> to<00:03:54.160> stop<00:03:56.610> have<00:03:57.610> you<00:03:57.670> had<00:03:57.820> this<00:03:57.940> extra

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
flow to stop have you had this extra

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.230 
flow to stop have you had this extra
you'd<00:03:58.450> wrap<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:58.780> around<00:03:59.190> put<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.220> on<00:04:00.430> market

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
you'd wrap it around put it on market

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.430 
you'd wrap it around put it on market
