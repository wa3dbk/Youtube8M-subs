00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.579
 contributed that 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.869
 how to cope only you have 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.089
 the question is just starting 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.210

 for lessons not also the sun 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
 and is in such 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.090
 both of my hands are not pressed, they are clamped 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.500
 something like this because many adjustment 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.910
 Olersky girl 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.650

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.490
 major mistakes come to this 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.350
 fingers left 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.760
 not bad here 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.780
 in principle should 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.250
 be 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.150
 family guitarist should be

 that is, it should not prevent this 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.140
 so here it is not so 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.840
 there is a policy here 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.360

 typical hand positions should be 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.990
 it is always convenient the question should not be 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.920

 hand she is not allocated 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:14.249
 It is very comfortable and does not need that same 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:15.519
 constantly maintained 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.310
 specially under the arrangement of persons
