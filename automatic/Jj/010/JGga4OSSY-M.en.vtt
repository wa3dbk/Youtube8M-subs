00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 at this stage the internet and mobile 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.710
 networks we are at the company booth 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.140
 fujitsu 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.639
 this is a japanese company and there it is very 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.670
 respects parents for 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.280
 to their older relatives and therefore 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.680
 very concerned about the state of the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.720
 how old people can get lost in 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.789
 city ​​and generally what they are easy to live and 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.750
 especially if the company is alone therefore 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.449
 fujitsu made such a cane such 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.240
 digital canes digital which opinion 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.980
 while the name is a prototype she can 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.410
 help people navigate the city 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.570
 there is a small display here 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.280
 dot which shows arrows 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.489
 I hope to convey the direction of your path 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.329
 or by signs now i will simulate 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.180
 so to speak old gait in the city 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.280
 so a little flood and we see that on 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.350
 this little screen 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.770
 there is my movement here this 100 m 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.250
 m, I flooded the flood and here we come to 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.320
 crossroads as you can see she woke up but in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.930
 The gums on the little screen caught fire red such 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.560
 that block was to become unaware for what hey 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.140
 dude it's time to turn and here we are 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.700
 already turned right stomping on 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.760
 and actually every intersection will 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.080
 happen the same story with the help 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.920
 Wi-Fi or bluetooth can be 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.619
 synchronize 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.200
 this device with a computer and actually 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.670
 drive a route there so it will do 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.990
 not quite clear not sure everything 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.369
 old men will be capable of such manipulation 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.590
 design looks pretty cool 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.130
 futuristic possible if desired 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.100
 to register someone in the face if 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.500
 It is very necessary of course and another cool 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.020
 the little things that are built in this pulse measure 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.210
 I will be there is a normal pulse amer 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.420
 you lean your finger and measure the remote 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.990
 Yes, but since this is Dima, everything works, he 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.539
 just got on the other cane caught fire 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:00.759
 heart green hope boys 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:03.550
 green little bye and now we'll find out everything 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:07.090
 vibrates so well inside well for now 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.890
 measured 79 up too I'm excited 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.899
 from new products that are on this 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.880
 stand and 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.860
 In general, I really like the device 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.269
 I really like the idea of ​​hope Russian 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.920
 authorities Russian medical companies 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.690
 will be at home to introduce this 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.640
 great gadget for oldies 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.260
 hipsters but we turn next 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.560
 part of this steel thank you lovely 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.720
 spanish home 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.180
 let's go faster 2 and 2 gadget which i 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.360
 I want to show you he should be the same 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.420
 concepts too is a device for 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.970
 older people and this is sorry please 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:48.880
 This is a smartphone for oldies 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.680
 and well, I do not know that to many and not old 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.340
 people, too, it is useful, I think because 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.970
 which in fact it is designed to 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.280
 That management was implemented on it 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.170
 just in general it's such a grandmother 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.000
 smartphone if you can express what 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.480
 main idea is gadget on android 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.880
 called he and fujitsu 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.950
 stylistic 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.210
 the abode here is completely reworked 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.040
 android interface is here android 4.0 and 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.800
 the menu is divided into different items each 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.570
 of them has a big button to start 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.160
 and a special color you did everything for 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.810
 so that a person can quickly 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.580
 navigate and navigate 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.950
 The potential of the main feature is 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.470
 tom that you can't just click here 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.680
 for example on the phone app and call 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.120
 dialer for this you need to touch and 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.580
 then even more pressure only after 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.900
 This starts the dialer and every time 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.250
 so well, respectively, the idea is that 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.520
 some older people very often 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.410
 poke on the screen 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.960
 incomprehensible chaotic way to 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.890
 avoid this successfully implemented such 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.230
 technology seems to me very 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.960
 cool let's see what is there 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.590
 here we are all cool in this interface 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.050
 message mail 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.580
 phone books have three buttons 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.750
 which can be programmed to 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.700
 contacts you need 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.040
 some kind of widget even present 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.290
 further necessary application 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.900
 Internet some forum incomprehensible card 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.440
 camera general everything here has a common list 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.900
 There are also applications here. 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.220
 what is preinstalled and also has a partition 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.590
 which is called the downloaded application 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.090
 Of course, you can go to google play 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.800
 store install something here 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.390
 characteristics naturally enough 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.770
 simple but win and everything works 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.140
 smoothly at least in this 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.590
 the interface is smart 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.240
 font 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:39.060
 Everything works fast and cool body 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.380
 well, the usual body looks like just cover up 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.170
 smartphone naturally this is not some 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.210
 flagship or something just there and device 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.070
 for your loved ones your loved ones here 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.370
 there are two cameras another cool 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.050
 chip yes here there is this lever he 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.560
 it is intended in case it happens 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.630
 some kind 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.350
 incomprehensible unpleasant situation you can 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.510
 pull and in this case the operators 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.640
 employees apparently fujitsu or 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.560
 which carrier you are 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.360
 connected will contact your 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.450
 relatives stream these contacts 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.330
 which are scored here too cool thing 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.660
 but what happens from the problems 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.730
 with health or with others 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.100
 people in russia know this too sometimes 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.720
 happens in general do not start this 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.270
 approach like concept like 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.360
 this idea is looking forward to 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.790
 fujitsu will come to our country and 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.020
 will give your devices advance 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.120
