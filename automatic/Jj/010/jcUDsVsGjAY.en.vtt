00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.549
 simple ways than you can 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.190
 to repair the windows 7 registry 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.730
 you can repair the registry 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.100
 such as files such as a USB flash drive or 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.189
 hd partitions makes no difference you 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.970
 can do this repair well 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.619
 simple 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.360
 the first module is by cm in two 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.809
 modules and we arrive m d 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.050
 in the case of the command plane click on the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.370
 start menu in all programs 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.149
 looking here are front accessories of 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.969
 command 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:53.329
 window the second module is typing 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:59.059
 cmdm start menu in search bar 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:03.440
 you put cm longer open a again 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.630
 thing you have to have and which one 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.280
 manage me, you're using the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.369
 computer if you have your eyes on 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:17.420
 that you will not be able to use oo 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:21.319
 command here the command shk tsk siaca dsk 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.429
 in case at the moment I do not have admin 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:28.159
 have to have access to this 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.979
 command to wait for this is denied access 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.850
 You do not have enough privileges. 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.860
 I have to perform this task with the 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.590
 cattle and not admit the computer 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.990
 In case you do not know, without any regrets, you have 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:47.240
 to do the second as follows: 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:51.350
 knows ncm reads cm tried with second 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.689
 button run as administrator 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.100
 you can see that even the system that already 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.850
 changed the name of you 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.430
 windows system32 in case was yours 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.579
 windows octave than it was a login that 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.600
 was using it on the computer 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:14.329
 here you put cm 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.640
 chk dsk of the enter it automatically goes 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.920
 recognize the file 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.690
 the parameter that will start to 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.940
 check the registry after it 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.740
 starts after checked it starts to 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.319
 perform registry repair 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.510
 you could also be using this 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.200
 example process I'm doing in my 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.170
 place is the repair in the where it is 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.300
 installed in the root file 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.220
 if you were connected a pendrive 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.170
 on the money type computer here in case 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.170
 I have nothing to connect here anymore. 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:57.070
 let's try the one here partition 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.660
 part only imagine who that is local 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.060
 if I wanted to repair this 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.880
 place that if it were a map are the pen 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:11.640
 drive for that command would be done 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:15.510
 The next time I came here, he gave it to me. 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.680
 execute as administrator 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.670
 here I was going to put two points and the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.360
 enter 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.440
 You can see that it has changed the place and already 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:32.930
 Now I type command clings kahn 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:36.900
 dsk and in having access to it 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.510
 he will recognize here is not 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.520
 available because it has no drive 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.760
 it's just with that but it 's a 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.709
 boot up toys observer 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.280
 so the command will not go 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:54.330
 if this case were a pen 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.690
 drive a file that had a folder one 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.500
 file that had partitioned parts 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.670
 he says that normally 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.410
 like any other 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.510
 The second way you can do the 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:13.170
 root repair or a page one 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:18.419
 your windows file is 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:21.209
 By the manager you go on the computer 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:26.580
 in case I want to make the repair in 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:28.680
 local if you come property 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.080
 according to the top button of the place if 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:37.440
 my local disk is a property 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:42.810
 on property you on sailing sail through 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:45.090
 here new tools here 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.080
 this option can check for errors in the 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.090
 unity 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.090
 you click check now 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.229
 How can you see here? 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.649
 corrected the file system 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:02.800
 automatically than looking for 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:07.419
 defective and try to recover it marks 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.069
 two options, and then click to start this 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.279
 process and schedule verification 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:14.110
 probably the next time you 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:15.939
 restart the computer it will start the 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.679
 verification process 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:22.179
 Do you want to schedule verification and 

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:24.659
 restart the computer in case I do not 

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:27.129
 I'll do it now 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.649
 When he resigns, just wait for the 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:31.360
 process will start automatically is 

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:32.439
 just wait for the end of the 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.509
 process 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:39.300
 I hope you liked the viola. 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.300
