00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.940 
connective tissues that cover the brain
so<00:00:05.940> their<00:00:06.299> meninges<00:00:06.839> so<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.589> one<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:07.919> goes

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
so their meninges so this one that goes

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.250 
so their meninges so this one that goes

web-like looking is the middle MINIX and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.000 
web-like looking is the middle MINIX and
it's<00:00:17.820> called<00:00:18.060> arachnoid<00:00:18.810> then<00:00:19.590> if<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:19.830> roll

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
it's called arachnoid then if we roll

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.640 
it's called arachnoid then if we roll
over<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:23.640> outer<00:00:23.880> toughest<00:00:24.539> mother<00:00:24.869> would<00:00:25.500> be

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
over the outer toughest mother would be

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.380 
over the outer toughest mother would be
a<00:00:25.680> continuation<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:26.880> over<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> top

a continuation of this one over the top
of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.660> arachnoid<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.349> that's<00:00:28.470> dura<00:00:28.830> mater

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
of the arachnoid and that's dura mater

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.359 
of the arachnoid and that's dura mater
but<00:00:30.210> notice<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.929> dura<00:00:31.109> mater<00:00:31.320> makes<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
but notice that the dura mater makes a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.340 
but notice that the dura mater makes a
double<00:00:32.610> fold<00:00:33.030> right<00:00:33.450> here<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.140> great

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and in a similar way

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.389 
and in a similar way
there's<00:00:42.390> dura<00:00:42.660> mater<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.350> makes<00:00:43.710> comes<00:00:44.250> in
