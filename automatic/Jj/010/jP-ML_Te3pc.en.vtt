a modest gain it get zone coverage it is

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.309 
a modest gain it get zone coverage it is
very<00:02:06.990> useful<00:02:07.500> very<00:02:07.920> useful<00:02:08.340> tool<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.060> do

very useful very useful tool to do

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.380 
very useful very useful tool to do
he<00:02:10.409> can<00:02:10.739> really<00:02:11.099> make<00:02:11.340> your<00:02:11.489> opponent<00:02:11.939> have

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
he can really make your opponent have

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.280 
he can really make your opponent have
serious<00:02:13.609> considerations<00:02:14.609> about<00:02:14.909> if<00:02:15.689> he<00:02:15.989> wants

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
serious considerations about if he wants

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.199 
serious considerations about if he wants
to<00:02:16.349> continue<00:02:16.560> dropping<00:02:17.370> everyone<00:02:17.609> back<00:02:17.939> it

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
to continue dropping everyone back it

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.289 
to continue dropping everyone back it
was<00:02:18.450> seriously<00:02:18.930> making<00:02:19.379> debate<00:02:20.069> because<00:02:20.879> if

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
was seriously making debate because if

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.179 
was seriously making debate because if
you<00:02:21.510> keep<00:02:21.810> doing<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.620> will<00:02:22.889> keep

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
you keep doing this you will keep

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.759 
you keep doing this you will keep
picking<00:02:23.579> up<00:02:23.700> huge<00:02:24.150> chunks<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.629> yards<00:02:25.200> but<00:02:25.620> like

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
picking up huge chunks of yards but like

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.860 
picking up huge chunks of yards but like
I<00:02:25.950> said<00:02:26.010> with<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.000> way<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.329> works<00:02:27.599> is<00:02:27.840> you

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
I said with the way it works is you

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.800 
I said with the way it works is you
playmaker<00:02:28.439> your<00:02:28.739> closest<00:02:29.250> receiver<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.540> you

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
playmaker your closest receiver to you

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.990 
playmaker your closest receiver to you
so<00:02:31.019> if<00:02:31.290> you're<00:02:31.469> on<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.650> left<00:02:31.920> field<00:02:32.159> you<00:02:32.819> will

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
so if you're on the left field you will

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.089 
so if you're on the left field you will
play<00:02:33.329> maybe<00:02:33.540> probably<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.319> on<00:02:34.439> the<00:02:34.650> left<00:02:34.920> side

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
play maybe probably so on the left side

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.069 
play maybe probably so on the left side
of<00:02:35.310> field<00:02:35.609> so<00:02:35.939> I<00:02:35.969> really<00:02:36.299> hope<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.719> helps<00:02:37.049> you

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
of field so I really hope this helps you

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.959 
of field so I really hope this helps you
