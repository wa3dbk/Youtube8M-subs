let's<00:00:39.090> move<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> number<00:00:39.840> 9

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
let's move on to number 9

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.260 
let's move on to number 9
okay<00:00:42.559> now<00:00:42.739> number<00:00:43.039> nine<00:00:43.219> is<00:00:43.430> probably<00:00:43.910> one<00:00:44.239> of

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
okay now number nine is probably one of

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.790 
okay now number nine is probably one of
the<00:00:44.420> best<00:00:44.629> plunge<00:00:44.930> attacks<00:00:45.260> on<00:00:45.440> this<00:00:45.620> whole

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
the best plunge attacks on this whole

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.319 
the best plunge attacks on this whole
counter<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:46.430> it's<00:00:46.670> in<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:46.879> broom<00:00:47.090> tower

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
counter and it's in the broom tower

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.670 
counter and it's in the broom tower
which<00:00:47.570> is<00:00:47.600> great<00:00:47.960> because<00:00:48.140> I<00:00:48.350> was<00:00:48.440> really

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
which is great because I was really

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.080 
which is great because I was really
hoping<00:00:48.949> someone<00:00:49.250> would<00:00:49.399> get<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.550> plunge<00:00:49.789> kilt

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
hoping someone would get a plunge kilt

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.369 
hoping someone would get a plunge kilt
in<00:00:50.210> this<00:00:50.329> level<00:00:50.510> because<00:00:50.750> it's<00:00:51.079> one<00:00:51.230> of<00:00:51.320> the

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
in this level because it's one of the

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.590 
in this level because it's one of the
best<00:00:51.559> areas<00:00:51.769> for<00:00:52.280> vertical<00:00:52.699> variety<00:00:53.239> anyway

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
best areas for vertical variety anyway

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.970 
best areas for vertical variety anyway
the<00:00:53.719> reason<00:00:53.870> this<00:00:54.110> clip<00:00:54.290> is<00:00:54.440> at<00:00:54.589> number<00:00:54.800> nine

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
the reason this clip is at number nine

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.040 
the reason this clip is at number nine
is<00:00:55.160> because<00:00:55.489> he<00:00:55.610> kills<00:00:55.850> his<00:00:56.059> friend<00:00:56.420> basically

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
is because he kills his friend basically

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.719 
is because he kills his friend basically
he<00:00:57.260> played<00:00:57.469> a<00:00:57.500> little<00:00:57.710> trick<00:00:58.010> on<00:00:58.070> his<00:00:58.250> friend<00:00:58.519> I

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
he played a little trick on his friend I

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:00.130 
he played a little trick on his friend I
asked<00:00:58.970> him<00:00:59.239> to<00:00:59.329> come<00:00:59.449> and<00:00:59.629> meet<00:00:59.750> him<00:00:59.930> at<00:01:00.050> the

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
asked him to come and meet him at the

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.780 
asked him to come and meet him at the
bonfire<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:00.890> he<00:01:01.100> knew<00:01:01.250> that<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.519> invasion

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
bonfire and he knew that the invasion

bonfire and he knew that the invasion
spot<00:01:02.210> was<00:01:02.420> far<00:01:02.659> enough<00:01:02.809> away<00:01:02.960> that<00:01:03.110> his<00:01:03.409> friend

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
spot was far enough away that his friend

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.020 
spot was far enough away that his friend
would<00:01:03.860> have<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:04.159> come<00:01:04.309> up<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.489> elevators

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030

relatively<00:02:06.670> low<00:02:06.880> health<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.390> then<00:02:07.750> this

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
relatively low health and then this

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.660 
relatively low health and then this
summon<00:02:08.229> will<00:02:08.380> swoop<00:02:08.649> in<00:02:08.860> for<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.100> kill<00:02:09.310> so

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
summon will swoop in for the kill so

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.280 
summon will swoop in for the kill so
