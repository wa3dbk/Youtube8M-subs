00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.830
 ae 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.100
 The people she was going to have today are 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.430
 on the way and jessé series and civil do not 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.610
 part of what has the serial is that at 23 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.100
 10 and if you look it is used a lot by 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.460
 personnel from the backland that the people use 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.460
 this block burn your dvd s 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.050
 I also use the holy line faith and such said 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.229
 which is a line so obviously but 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.750
 I think it's a bit expensive for our 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.770
 national reality 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.420
 but a guitar that has the right team 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.780
 well organized and at the same time with a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.649
 Japanese quality of the walk is that 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:48.509
 everybody already knows joão 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:52.470
 he has a solo time says prowse é 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:56.100
 the holsworthy easel his talent that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:09.239
 It is easier okay and his body is 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:12.799
 fla and mail from the province and the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:16.049
 also arm is Flemish and mail 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:21.829
 nice detail 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:26.310
 in a move that reminded that court that 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:31.079
 they use the marking scale 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:36.930
 most beautiful and abalone here in the center and 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:42.320
 It was pretty nice, cool and I have and we have 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:51.989
 as personal and keep or do not speak shield 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:55.170
 and cool toy and have a 42 bust 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.810
 boys that leaves the arm a little smaller 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.970
 and it's more comfortable for you to 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:08.870
 chords open here using strings 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:13.340
 is that the pre-salt is to produce 40 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:18.049
 the very way and he has is to win 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.629
 sharpest tuner is account control 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.970
 and it has a button that 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.819
 interesting that Iraq will ps that 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.379
 You want to see how your sound to come out 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.700
 direct that not online without going through 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:36.319
 regular recording medium that 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.980
 you tighten it passes straight through sound and god 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:43.640
 north filter and you can place 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:48.099
 enter or exit the sound 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.099
 that's up to you 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.400
 Hey 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.750
 when I took control of medium and I'm going 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.750
 put equalization by pass 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:45.910
 the button to place our filter on 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.910
 70% and I'll put it on the way out 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:04.469
 ah 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.670
 so at first only these functions then 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.260
 drama world you regulate according to 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.690
 your taste is not 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.490
 and now only the sound picked up by 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.490
 placed more in the middle than 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.350
 Hey 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.330
 Is it personal to me, is it a guitar? 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.480
 great 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.640
 here it reminisces very uneven 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.020
 that we use on the bridge of luís i poco 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.820
 huh 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.720
 the back carts of such 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:09.450
 study to improve the relationship of 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:14.610
 in the instrument and which is a 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:18.780
 excellent local little case of the internet the 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:23.130
 year of 2011 us 3 thousand 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.850
 thus stealing the money it is very 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.330
 feather 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:30.480
 but I think it violated laws that have the 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:34.430
 sound very similar to a value more in 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:38.190
 I like it, but I do not like it 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:42.380
 I do not think it particularly 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:46.200
 I'm very fan of June I think it's very wide 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:49.320
 very thick from the south adding this 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.930
 It was the underdog that neither arm hurt much. 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.300
 if you stay more than half an hour playing 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.780
 direct right 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:01.200
 so it goes there at the customer's discretion
