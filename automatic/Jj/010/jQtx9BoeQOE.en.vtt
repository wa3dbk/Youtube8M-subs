00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hi all today i will let you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.000
 see how to make this makeup look 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.529
 because I placed a photo on instagram 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.599
 a while ago and I got one 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.010
 lots of nice reactions from you 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.049
 so I thought maybe I can again 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.730
 you don't have a makeup look film it again 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.690
 are for this look I use 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.090
 made from many different ones 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.220
 leave your eyeshadow palettes there 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.080
 don't suffer too much because you have or 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.560
 other brands that have something on it 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.820
 seems 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.189
 and then I wish you a lot of fun with 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.960
 look well national can see i have mine 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.789
 basically done if you are curious 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.859
 to my basic facial makeup routine 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.899
 and that owns about the same every day 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.390
 and I have recorded a video of it 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.110
 so here is also a link below and in 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.149
 statue 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.890
 I'm going to start my eye shadow base 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.600

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.989

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.989

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.110
 I also got a little bit the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.340
 lower eyelash edge must go there I go 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.340
 also apply to make-up 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.870
 I'm going to use a flat eye shadow brush 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.580
 use from the urban decay naked 3 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.350
 namely this palette 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.600
 and then from this light cream 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.760
 color from the to face shop the bar palette 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.740
 and I will also divide the entire eyelid as 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.360
 Last but not least that I am somewhat lighter 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.070

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.700
 beautiful rosé golden hue with a lot 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.899
 shimmer in and I recap on the eyelid 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.899
 actually about a colored person 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.470
 then I grab this crease brush this is from 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.830

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.930

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.400
 matte color is this one that I will be careful with 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.400
 place in the arcade arch 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.810

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.810
 eyes looks just like big ones 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.790

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.660
 dark brown tinted and bring in the 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.660
 outer over done 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.060
 now that I still have my eyes slightly 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.850
 lighter so that just a little fresher 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.400
 glimpse so I will also go 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.569
 yellowish color with this yellow poem 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.569

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.330

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.660
 colour 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.700

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.710
 a slanted cut also slanted brush 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.790
 on the outside of the bottom 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.790
 apply eyelash edge 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.099
 and in the middle part of the lower one 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.640
 Eyelash Edge I asked more and glittering 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.640
 do color 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.569
 this filters with all-share about the crisis 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.010
 highly recommended is really a super 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.269
 nice highlighter 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.269

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.030
 on the upper water layers 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.390
 today this catrice uses the liquid 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.390
 ink eyeliner 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:04.480
 continue with the mascara and I use 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.480
 the max factor false lash effect 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.599
 the eyes are collar and far with the family 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.239
 I used an x ​​plus in the color 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.549
 taupe and to contour and you do that with 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.070
 this a wider fluffy eye shadow brush 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.910
 want a little pointed and then really 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.910

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.880
 this is a very nice cool color and that 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.780
 stands very naturally with contours 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.150

 needed is unwise pigmented as well 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:48.880
 quite dark but I think it's very 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.380
 nice to stand with the eye shadow team and 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.729
 because my face is pretty good again 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.919

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.560
 matting powder coming there is already a 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.560
 loose eye shadow and I do n't know what 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.960
 I can still see this below 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.030

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:17.470

 pretty neutral with a lot of things 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.610
