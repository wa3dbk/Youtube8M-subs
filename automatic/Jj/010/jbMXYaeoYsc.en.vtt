realistic so all you see are robot parts

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.640 
realistic so all you see are robot parts
but<00:01:02.309> luckily<00:01:03.270> luckily<00:01:04.260> they<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:05.070> stolen<00:01:06.260> so<00:01:07.260> I

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
only thing that is really knocking down

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.570 
only thing that is really knocking down
the<00:01:15.689> score<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.619> tile<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.189> doesn't

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the score is this one tile that doesn't

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.260 
the score is this one tile that doesn't
seem<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.939> move<00:01:18.210> when<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> push<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.500> along<00:01:20.270> but

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
seem to move when I push it along but

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.990 
seem to move when I push it along but
online<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.530> great<00:01:22.710> figure<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.400> I'll<00:01:23.549> go<00:01:23.850> on

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
online it's a great figure so I'll go on

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.570 
online it's a great figure so I'll go on
by<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.759> I'll<00:01:26.759> go<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> transformation

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
by so I'll go to the transformation

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.680 
by so I'll go to the transformation

roof panels and stuff up there
and<00:01:38.150> that<00:01:39.140> knocks<00:01:39.500> out<00:01:39.650> is<00:01:39.800> going<00:01:40.040> Sol<00:01:40.280> put

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
and that knocks out is going Sol put

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.530 
and that knocks out is going Sol put
that<00:01:40.640> inside<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:43.070> better<00:01:43.370> be

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540
