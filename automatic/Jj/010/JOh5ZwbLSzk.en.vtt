00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
th one four to seven I don't know what

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.889 
th one four to seven I don't know what
that<00:00:35.219> stands<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.700> little<00:00:35.969> bit<00:00:36.059> I'll<00:00:36.600> show<00:00:36.870> that

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.069 
that stands a little bit I'll show that
D<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.460> another<00:00:38.640> ultra<00:00:39.030> vague<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.840> one

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
D and it's another ultra vague this one

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.190 
D and it's another ultra vague this one
I've<00:00:40.320> also<00:00:40.590> had<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> year<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.719> could

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
I've also had for a year and I could

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.350 
I've also had for a year and I could
still<00:00:43.649> probably<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.579> some<00:00:44.789> more<00:00:44.969> wear<00:00:45.149> out<00:00:45.180> of

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
still probably get some more wear out of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.229 
still probably get some more wear out of
this<00:00:45.570> one<00:00:45.840> but<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.370> think<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.489> time<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.910> retire

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
this one but I think it's time to retire

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.119 
this one but I think it's time to retire
it<00:00:48.570> because<00:00:49.110> if<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.320> look<00:00:49.469> right<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
it because if you look right here it's a

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.150 
it because if you look right here it's a
little<00:00:50.309> matted<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.510> know<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.590> um<00:00:52.770> I

wearing this yet but I also put on the
old<00:02:36.860> one<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.490> let<00:02:37.580> you<00:02:37.700> see<00:02:37.850> how<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.030> looks

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
old one and let you see how it looks

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.660 
old one and let you see how it looks
once<00:02:39.050> it<00:02:39.200> gets<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.380> little<00:02:39.500> bit<00:02:39.650> tattered<00:02:40.070> and

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
once it gets a little bit tattered and

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.370 
once it gets a little bit tattered and
once<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.090> really<00:02:41.330> like<00:02:41.480> pick<00:02:41.720> out<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.050> curls

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
and I think maybe that's why these have

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.450 
and I think maybe that's why these have
lasted<00:02:44.900> me<00:02:44.960> so<00:02:45.140> long<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:46.210> purchased<00:02:47.210> them

around March April of last year so and

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.000 
around March April of last year so and
that's<00:02:56.750> how<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:56.990> can<00:02:57.260> do<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.440> if<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:57.560> want<00:02:57.920> to
