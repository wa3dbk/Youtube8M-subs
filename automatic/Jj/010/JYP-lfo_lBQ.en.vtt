00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.900
 [Arlene Shechet: New look of old paintings] 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.940
 Dieu Donné Paper Studio, New York 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.040
 I have an urge to get a whole piece of color on the wood. 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.980
 Ok 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.040
 Sometimes, compared to what people want you to see 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.750
 Those things that are invisible are more interesting 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.880
 It’s like watching a construction site 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.880
 Some things you can't see 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.800
 These are skeletons 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.930
 They can be beautiful 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.180
 All these molds were made in the remote corners of my studio. 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:24.109
 And these molds are my studio 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:25.950
 Found when making clay 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.930
 Like, here, my clay finger prints 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.639
 I happen to have bricks that have been thrown away. 

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.649
 So this is the glaze 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.249
 See no, that is refractory brick 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.420
 In fact, there is a written record that specifically records this clay process. 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.039
 At the end, I will say 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.849
 "Oh, this looks so beautiful." 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:03.509
 Or "I like the tool to make a mark" 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:11.009
 These show the original process of making my sculpture. 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.960
 I really like the color and the idea of ​​one. 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.980
 This is not me because I have painted on paper. 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.610
 This is because the color is paper 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.350
 It can also go a little deeper 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.940
 We want to make a yellow paste 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.480
 This, there is a little yellow inside 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.440
 Or just 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.500
 Just yellow 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.660
 That brightness 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.450
 In this case, it is actually similar to clay. 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.300
 When the glaze and the clay fuse together 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.980
 Everything is one 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.820
 So funny 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.240
 The creation of paper is the most direct part of the process. 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.100
 I like to see the response of things. 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.980
 I think this position is a bit biased... 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.520
 My assistant said that I made the decision very fast. 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.319
 Chelsea, I think we should put cotton on it. 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.260
 I like this feeling 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.920
 For me, like in a strip 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.430
 Telling, "Let it go with the flow" 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.450
 It’s like grabbing this opportunity, there is another chance there. 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.630
 So this is why I will do five or six works at the same time. 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.270
 I still want to see if we can 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.490
 Use these spells to make sculptures 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.540
 And tear them off 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.880
 look here 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.840
 I always say that it’s like an athletic event. 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:18.000
 Just like before the game, you always have to think about a lot of things. 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.680
 You basically started preparing a month ago. 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.240
 24 carat gold! 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.860
 The cost of doing this is too high. 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.870
 It is very high! 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.090
 We need to integrate and use our time 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.819
 The interesting part is that when everything is ready, you lose your way. 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.740
 Oh, there are some holes in our side. 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.320
 Naturally formed hole 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.499
 Sometimes when you create on a specified layer, the effect is not satisfactory. 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:59.389
 You will never know its existence 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.699
 However, I firmly believe in the energy lurking under the surface 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.560
 This kind of subtle attraction really fascinates me. 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.160
 This may be better 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.840
 Yes 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.640
 Auburn is beautiful! 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.660
 Another way is similar to making pottery 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.549
 That is, it is never as beautiful as it is wet. 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.479
 Very good color 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.020
 You really like the color when you mix. 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.820
 However, when it is dry, it will be a little brighter than before. 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.249
 I always want the color to be the same as when it is wet. 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:05.409
 This is closer to the vitality of the actual creative process. 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.120
 So, in terms of pottery, you love it wet. 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.719
 When it does, it looks bad. 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:15.979
 When you burn the first pottery, it looks bad. 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.519
 Then you have to polish it 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.840
 [Boston Modern Art Center] 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.880
 I received a letter saying, "Come to our school, we will teach you how to make paper." 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:39.759
 This is a place 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:44.519
 A symposium that only provides mutual discussion and will not give you any answers. 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:52.520
 It provides a way to know where it will go without knowing where it will go. 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:56.099
 Designing a horizontal extension of the artwork 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:58.259
 I am full of expectations for this. 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.960
 I fear those who only focus on one thing in their lives. 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.900
 However, in any case, it is still inappropriate for me. 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:19.260
 My heart is making me want to explore a wider field.
