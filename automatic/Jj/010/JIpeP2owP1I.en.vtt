00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:46.069 
they were always embrace him at least

he do then but i think he did well do
you<00:00:50.329> think<00:00:50.539> we<00:00:50.600> should<00:00:50.629> get<00:00:50.839> a<00:00:50.899> rematch<00:00:51.139> out<00:00:51.499> of

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
you think we should get a rematch out of

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.049 
you think we should get a rematch out of
gonzales<00:00:52.069> and<00:00:52.100> pascal<00:00:52.639> because<00:00:52.909> of<00:00:52.999> the

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
gonzales and pascal because of the

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.239 
gonzales and pascal because of the
controversy<00:00:53.389> I<00:00:53.839> don't<00:00:54.319> think<00:00:54.379> John<00:00:54.739> Pascal

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:55.249 
controversy I don't think John Pascal

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:56.889 
controversy I don't think John Pascal
people<00:00:55.609> would<00:00:56.030> have<00:00:56.209> to<00:00:56.299> take<00:00:56.510> that<00:00:56.539> fight

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
people would have to take that fight

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.160 
people would have to take that fight
before<00:00:57.139> because<00:00:57.739> that's<00:00:57.920> too<00:00:58.129> there<00:00:58.699> will<00:00:58.819> be

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
before because that's too there will be

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.549 
before because that's too there will be
two<00:01:00.249> fights<00:01:01.249> of<00:01:01.969> that<00:01:02.569> magnitude<00:01:02.959> that<00:01:03.379> would

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
two fights of that magnitude that would

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.219 
two fights of that magnitude that would
take<00:01:03.709> a<00:01:03.739> lot<00:01:03.949> out<00:01:04.010> of<00:01:04.190> John<00:01:04.909> Pascal<00:01:05.420> they<00:01:06.110> was

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
take a lot out of John Pascal they was

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.980 
take a lot out of John Pascal they was
given<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:06.620> taken<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.420> punches<00:01:08.420> rather<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:08.900> I

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
given and taken and punches rather and I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.080 
given and taken and punches rather and I
think<00:01:09.200> they<00:01:09.320> would<00:01:09.530> be<00:01:09.560> really<00:01:10.340> taxing<00:01:10.700> on<00:01:10.970> him

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
think they would be really taxing on him

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.420 
think they would be really taxing on him
to<00:01:11.240> go<00:01:11.390> through<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:11.720> again<00:01:11.900> and<00:01:12.890> not<00:01:13.070> just<00:01:13.100> go

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
to go through that again and not just go

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.870 
to go through that again and not just go
straight<00:01:13.760> to<00:01:14.650> Sergey<00:01:15.650> Kovalev<00:01:15.800> is<00:01:16.580> Jean

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
straight to Sergey Kovalev is Jean

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.090 
straight to Sergey Kovalev is Jean
slowing<00:01:17.390> down<00:01:17.540> to<00:01:17.690> 32<00:01:18.020> or<00:01:18.380> is<00:01:18.470> he<00:01:18.650> as<00:01:18.770> good<00:01:18.830> as

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
slowing down to 32 or is he as good as

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.130 
slowing down to 32 or is he as good as
when<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.730> defeated<00:01:20.150> him<00:01:20.270> in<00:01:20.420> his<00:01:20.570> 20s<00:01:20.900> for<00:01:21.020> the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
when you defeated him in his 20s for the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.930 
when you defeated him in his 20s for the
light<00:01:21.380> heavyweight<00:01:21.530> championship<00:01:22.220> I<00:01:22.460> think

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
light heavyweight championship I think

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.760 
light heavyweight championship I think
it's<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.150> combination<00:01:23.450> of<00:01:23.840> both<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.410> don't<00:01:24.560> think

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
it's a combination of both I don't think

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.560 
it's a combination of both I don't think
he<00:01:24.890> looked<00:01:25.100> old<00:01:25.370> tonight<00:01:25.910> I<00:01:25.940> just<00:01:26.270> think<00:01:26.480> that

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
he looked old tonight I just think that

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.770 
he looked old tonight I just think that
his<00:01:26.810> style<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.350> way<00:01:27.470> he<00:01:27.590> fights<00:01:27.800> in<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.190> way<00:01:28.780> he

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
his style the way he fights in a way he

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.530 
his style the way he fights in a way he
leads<00:01:29.960> herself<00:01:30.380> um<00:01:30.650> I'm<00:01:31.280> vulnerable<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:32.390> get

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
leads herself um I'm vulnerable to get

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.050 
leads herself um I'm vulnerable to get
hit<00:01:32.720> because<00:01:33.410> of<00:01:33.740> his<00:01:33.860> wild<00:01:34.400> swings<00:01:34.730> and

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
hit because of his wild swings and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.940 
hit because of his wild swings and
ducking<00:01:35.720> down<00:01:35.900> and<00:01:36.290> not<00:01:36.380> really<00:01:36.530> looking<00:01:36.890> at

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
ducking down and not really looking at
