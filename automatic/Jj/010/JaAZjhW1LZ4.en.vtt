00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.379
 hello again that's right 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:04.900
 graduation kravets 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.200
 The first thing I would like to say is 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.379
 I was surprised how fast you are 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.650
 scored eight months fingers total 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.789
 in 5 6 days man 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.130
 what hours ago that is on the record 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.199
 90 until I write down 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.150
 up to 8 Spaniards are now a majority 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.109
 and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.380
 because it is 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.739
 today will be our will be divided into two 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.610
 parts 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.790
 this is 7 upr 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.960
 regards to them 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.610
 simply 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.560
 talk about what you can send stones 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.810
 the question of what interests you 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.890
 rattan kravets 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.490
 the Cabinet also pass in the past but they 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.530
 quite rare 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.809
 one of the last five years of the subject 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.090
 long years 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.719
 purchase 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.710
 there are tanks near the walls 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.140
 like this 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.170
 percentage of whether it is possible 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.620
 the reasons 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.650
 then at the end of August 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.410
 not 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.930
 on Thursday harvest 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.530
 prim 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.630
 tenge and a whole year 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.780
 weather 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.470
 3 5 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.909
 sq 360 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.950
 ap 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.620
 and 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.030
 the problem is how to build them and 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.620
 orchids 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.420
 on the way to the project 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.900
 on this matter after i when 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.050
 lost 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.490
 Why did the developers decide to do so? 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.090
 The fact is that a developer is 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.380
 principle 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.710
 pankratov this game 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.869
 and where is your creativity flight 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.179
 the only moment which 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.579
 so how do we say 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.369
 strongly connected with reality 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.369
 opportunity edge 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.249
 cube 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:19.349
 possibly 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.129
 but it is possible to save lives and 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.660
 start all over again question and there are resources 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.319
 and detox result 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.719
 d 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.879
 for him so they did though in reality 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.879
 I donâ€™t have rubles 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.219
 you 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:54.249
 So 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.229
 not 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.529
 here 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.429
 five 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:08.289
 otherwise 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:09.659
 Doll 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.659
 this account 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.469
 ciudad real 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.959
 so i have 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.639
 oh well we are here we take 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.679
 m 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.289
 can not say ass 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.089
 why him in general 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:34.289
 go wool happens miracle 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:36.309
 black items 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:38.669
 what did they do to him 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.669
 put such a white wig 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.109
 ed 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.359
 like this 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.180
 so every time you have 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.859
 questions you can send semenenko 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.859
 sending but it will not work 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.559
 personal message of course in the end I'm on 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:07.109
 I will answer them with pleasure I think 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.909
 the next issue is dedicated first 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.909
 multiplayer in the second city 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.439
 questions that made me famous 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.120
 not just turned off the services at the time because 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.090
 what 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.090
 something that hinders a lot 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:24.789
 she is 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.069
 I will tell you that I agreed to create 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.439
 about my kravets 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:31.870
 percentage only to play 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.010
 contract on the Internet the height we need 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.509
 necessarily season version 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.539
 that 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.240
 how can i play 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.199
 we will visit but here 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.229
 yet I will not talk like Putin 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.229
 Unfortunately so far it is impossible 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.279
 this 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:58.210
 Shostka my straight saw then 5 point 6.6 5.40 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.490
 this is not the first year however 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.710
 he may not always go but 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.840
 I think we will agree on time 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.580
 hatch games 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.639
 Echo of Moscow 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.389
 at the same time in the near future and then I will say 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.849
 there is no construction 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:15.150
 excluded plant 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.659
 so I'm playing now 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:17.860
 into account 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.939
 actually 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:22.029
 but one because nobody is here 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.870
 so those who have a license 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.349
 second version 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.680
 pankratova guests to come 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.860

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.289
 as we agree time meeting i 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:36.039
 I think 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.469
 first emergency category 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.469
 who can go who we are with him 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.939
 what else god is he on this 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:45.500
 server you see fire 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.680
 being thrown out at 5 will finally enter 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.460
 in year 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.729
 slides 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:54.259

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:07.789
