00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hey people today back out of one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.460
 completely different environment in the garden because 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.019
 it 's hot and the sun is banging and in 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.160
 My room has become so warm 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.809
 I think I really have to have one 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.460
 ceiling fan want that is really 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.029
 the best you can get 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.680
 and then I thought I was doing 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.090
 Just a video today in the garden and 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.949
 my douglas box arrived today 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.789
 and then I wanted to show you something in there 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.070
 was and I have to say in advance I am 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.140
 really really excited since you 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.370
 the products themselves can choose 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.829
 Of course you can continue 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.790
 surprise the box costs ten 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.660
 euro a month 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.539
 that subscriptions cancellable at any time and yes me 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.690
 think that's really cool 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.070
 First, this is a small gate from 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.640
 hope and glory 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.640
 that's what she looks like and that's it 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.170
 I think it's just like that 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.110
 Body lotion, but I'm not sure 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:12.060
 capable of serum okay that's a face it 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.030
 made my skin look small beautiful yes so 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.490
 a small tube is seven millimeters 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.600
 I'm curious in there too 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.470
 on it but it sounds itself very 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.720
 good at that glowing and sassy hears 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.009
 Have a good time 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.330
 I hope it is right now with the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.210
 wind but I am very happy that 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.070
 it just came so wind was then 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.159
 again a product in there what everyone 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.579
 that's the bju lipgloss 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.540
 he looks a little darker 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.540
 colour 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.530
 is not in it but it is on everyone 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.679
 case of a phase where normal everyday 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.700
 color then from estÃ©e lauder day where 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.590
 antioxidant cream I think that has 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:05.009
 that's a very small one 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.640
 tube looks like that on the tube is like that 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.369
 small 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.269
 So I think 45 times used afterwards 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.640
 she is empty too 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:15.720
 but most of them are really like this 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.170

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.480

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.019
 behind me but I could not get into it 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.970
 Look in the sun purely because I'm watching 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.220
 a bit as if I'm an acid 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.009
