00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
freaked me out but when lighting a

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.480 
freaked me out but when lighting a
smudge<00:00:43.510> thick<00:00:43.900> it<00:00:44.170> actually<00:00:44.860> is<00:00:44.920> only<00:00:45.250> gonna

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
smudge thick it actually is only gonna

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.300 
smudge thick it actually is only gonna
flame<00:00:45.880> for<00:00:46.210> a<00:00:46.240> second<00:00:46.810> it<00:00:46.960> is<00:00:47.440> then<00:00:47.950> going<00:00:48.190> to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
flame for a second it is then going to

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.910 
flame for a second it is then going to
smolder<00:00:48.910> so<00:00:49.540> I<00:00:49.810> have<00:00:49.990> a<00:00:50.020> smudge<00:00:50.290> thick<00:00:50.620> here

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
smolder so I have a smudge thick here

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.290 
smolder so I have a smudge thick here
and<00:00:51.100> as<00:00:51.190> you<00:00:51.310> can<00:00:51.430> see<00:00:51.490> this<00:00:51.790> is<00:00:51.970> a<00:00:52.000> pretty

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
and as you can see this is a pretty

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.990 
and as you can see this is a pretty
small<00:00:52.720> smudge<00:00:53.200> thick<00:00:53.560> I<00:00:53.770> mean<00:00:54.220> lately<00:00:54.700> I've

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
small smudge thick I mean lately I've

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.960 
small smudge thick I mean lately I've
seen<00:00:55.270> a<00:00:55.329> huge<00:00:55.870> smudge<00:00:56.380> because<00:00:56.739> I<00:00:56.770> look<00:00:56.920> like

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
seen a huge smudge because I look like

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.960 
seen a huge smudge because I look like
like<00:00:57.970> baseball<00:00:58.570> bats<00:00:58.840> and<00:00:59.489> people<00:01:00.489> think<00:01:00.760> if

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
like baseball bats and people think if

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.490 
like baseball bats and people think if
they<00:01:01.090> get<00:01:01.239> large<00:01:01.570> or<00:01:01.810> smudge<00:01:02.050> thick<00:01:02.350> that

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
they get large or smudge thick that

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.350 
they get large or smudge thick that
that's<00:01:02.770> actually<00:01:03.310> going<00:01:03.460> to<00:01:03.520> be<00:01:03.579> beneficial

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
that's actually going to be beneficial

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.380 
that's actually going to be beneficial
but<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:05.259> small<00:01:05.680> smudge<00:01:06.399> sticks<00:01:06.790> are<00:01:06.939> actually

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
but the small smudge sticks are actually

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.999 
but the small smudge sticks are actually
easier<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:07.869> use<00:01:08.170> when<00:01:08.380> you<00:01:08.470> have<00:01:08.500> a<00:01:08.619> really

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
easier to use when you have a really

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.889 
easier to use when you have a really
large<00:01:09.250> stick<00:01:09.729> what<00:01:09.939> happens<00:01:10.299> is<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.600> fire

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
large stick what happens is the fire

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.950 
large stick what happens is the fire
gets<00:01:11.259> inside<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.579> it's<00:01:12.970> very<00:01:13.329> hard<00:01:13.659> to<00:01:13.750> put

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
gets inside and it's very hard to put

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.620 
gets inside and it's very hard to put
out<00:01:14.020> later<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:14.890> we're<00:01:15.429> using<00:01:15.609> a<00:01:15.939> very<00:01:16.509> small

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
out later so we're using a very small

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.529 
out later so we're using a very small
little<00:01:17.409> smudge<00:01:17.859> stick<00:01:18.189> now<00:01:18.759> I'm<00:01:19.149> an

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539
