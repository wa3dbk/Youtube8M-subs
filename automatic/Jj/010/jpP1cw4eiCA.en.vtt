00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
come out within the next decade because

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.170 
come out within the next decade because
they're<00:02:39.060> doing<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.629> really<00:02:39.840> bad<00:02:39.959> job<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.859> it<00:02:41.730> so

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
they're doing a really bad job of it so

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.420 
they're doing a really bad job of it so
far<00:02:42.409> um<00:02:43.579> like<00:02:44.579> they<00:02:45.359> need<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.689> really<00:02:46.280> set<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
far um like they need to really set a

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.069 
far um like they need to really set a
release<00:02:47.640> date<00:02:47.819> and<00:02:48.269> then<00:02:48.359> stick<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.720> it

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
release date and then stick to it

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.780 
release date and then stick to it
