00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.420
 ninja gaiden 2 and hiv in two no 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.070
 reinvents the wheel and does not change what already 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.800
 it was good in the previous 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.010
 it is actually a kind of rerun 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.350
 of its predecessor with new scenarios 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.510
 weapons blows bosses and everything else that is 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.300
 I was expecting a game from the series 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.300
 the news are merely cosmetic 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 [Music] 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.619
 one of the best characteristics of 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:08.259
 series the setting has never been so good 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.750
 explored contains a gaiden 2 day 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.100
 however much history exists, it does not 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.080
 makes a lot of sense 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.960
 works just as an excuse to 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.659
 Take a Ninja to Exotic Scenes 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.210
 still the game is full of scenes 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:43.420
 animated in real time of quality and 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:45.490
 direction but what 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.950
 matter what is visceral action 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.720
 so there is no need to worry about 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.390
 mechanics has not changed much 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.259
 besides the much more bloody fights there are 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.819
 platform exploration elements 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.100
 alias prince of persia and acrobatics 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.740
 battles against bosses sent 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.530
 initially there are two levels of 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.200
 difficulty being the first ideal for 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.869
 newcomers but already has a good 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.140
 level of challenge and the second to 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.910
 really hardcore trio players are 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.930
 even more deadly with its arsenal of 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.930
 Swords and blades 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.940
 besides the traditional shurikens there is a 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.530
 variety of small arms and 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.750
 special powers 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.690
 the player never feels devoid of 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.850
 options to kill with your progress 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.489
 you acquire new skills and 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.280
 points that can be exchanged for items 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.680
 energy or magic updates to the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.500
 weapons and extra points of health that the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.230
 makes it stronger agile and resistant 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.120
 The more difficult the game can be the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.130
 battles are extremely fluid without 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.769
 major complications 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.530
 combining the attacks you create combos 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.989
 unique and highly devastating and do 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.819
 stay ahead of your enemies 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.700
 literally every weapon has its own 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.140
 own series of strokes each player 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.600
 identify and develop 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.550
 the favorite fighting style as the 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.980
 dismemberment and mutilation are 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.560
 common struggles turns into a 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.020
 true bloody ballet with jets of 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.230
 blood from the air and stains that 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.090
 ting the guru scenario is practically 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.150
 impossible to flee from the same enemies 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.150
 mutilated who pursue it attack without 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.430
 rest until you finish with everyone 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.120
 or they with you the intelligence 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.040
 of them even impresses the 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.950
 The following paths are always very 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.959
 clear and you will rarely get stuck in 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.010
 a place without knowing what to do in 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.440
 followed 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.290
 Each phase lasts for half an hour and 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.630
 depending on your performance is possible 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.330
 finish the game in less than 10 hours 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.850
 may seem little but there is a 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.550
 Significant extras to unlock 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.830
 that work as a good incentive to 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.720
 start the adventure from scratch 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.360
 the camera is not a problem 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.580
 because during the battles the 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.200
 player's vision and broad and rarely she 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.260
 it coils in the scene 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.000
 the focus of action but during the 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.299
 moments of exploration 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.690
 she may bother the graphics are very 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.340
 good with the beautiful scenery 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.440
 incredibly wide and detailed 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.020
 the frame rate is generally well 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.810
 fluid and constant but falls 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.600
 substances at more chaotic times 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.880
 the soundtrack usually accompanies a lot 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.010
 and the climate scenario and action with 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.440
 heavier songs in moments of 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.800
 great tension and calmer during the 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.169
 exploitation of hiv in 2 brings exactly 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.150
 what we would expect the 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.020
 continuation of the excellent game for the 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.150
 xbox original the visceral action 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.039
 incredibly fast and fun that 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.470
 always kept interesting due to the 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.970
 profusion of weapons scams blows 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.830
 flashy and boss battles 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.840
 challenging 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.450
 he may not invent the series as the 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.030
 first game made but maintains a level of 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.830
 politeness if quality of the original 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.680
 presenting a gaming experience 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.419
 incredibly satisfying at least 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.419
 for the most hardcore audience 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.890
