00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello i am the worst about mensalistas well 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.660
 come back the guidu survivor I 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.940
 I'm a potato and I'm going to say a little today. 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.250
 For you of the gloves I 'm wearing 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:18.330
 mechanical 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:21.340
 [Music] 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.300
 good staff who know the company I 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.010
 I am extremely supportive of the use of epi 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.220
 practically every activity is 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.830
 from a simple walk in the bush to 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.460
 You try to make your knife at home because 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.830
 good 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.140
 among these teams one that I use 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.180
 much that you see there in the videos are 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.059
 asking where does everything else come from? 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.489
 are these are the new mechanics 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.600
 Well, this one is original if you are 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.720
 view and channel 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.250
 You will see that I made her moxi and 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.150
 everything else I used it in several 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.040
 activities 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.420
 she is already wearing this glove that has more 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.200
 or less one year of use 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.120
 It's okay because I wear this glove idea. 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.070
 still continuous it still continues 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.600
 working for me I want to show you the 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.100
 you exactly how is the condition 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.690
 This is a resin that 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.030
 leaves firewood 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.410
 I'm just going to change one 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.780
 history of position during the 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.369
 camp and pie full of lace 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.159
 hot down there 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.170
 It never came out of the glove yet. 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.240
 could never go out of my hand 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.940
 the main feature of this glove 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.299
 which is the fact that she breathes a lot in her hand 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.630
 and she maintains a great sensitivity 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:38.400
 I can handle almost everything 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.170
 type of small work tool 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.970
 detail whatever it is that you can 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.700
 imagine you can do with this 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.430
 glove here are you going to see a lot of police 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.479
 wearing this glove because he can 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.549
 make the personal journal on the suspect is 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.790
 stick a hand in his pocket for example he 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.759
 can get rid of the cuts 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.460
 blood is a small blades that the 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.350
 training approaches in the pocket at last goes 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.100
 be protected from all this and he 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.399
 can maintain sensitivity at hand 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.860
 perfectly 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.610
 just to have an idea I can 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.520
 Recarte feel the gun cable're the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.250
 part of the screw the internal screws 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.650
 I can feel it until I get scared. 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.110
 educational, then I can feel 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.350
 that all the details the glove does not 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.840
 gets in the way of absolutely nothing 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.640
 raising the level of protection we have 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.200
 here mp foot is the one that is already the model 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.970
 2015 it is sold in brazil 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.650
 that's exactly why I came to do 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.440
 this video looks only 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.530
 is the protective book of this glove will be 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.710
 much larger than the original one of you 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.290
 will lose a little bit of sensitivity 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.140
 but in compensation you will gain a lot 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.970
 more protection this glove model that already 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.010
 has protection in the palm of the hand 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.620
 so if you put your hand 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.720
 on a wall and a hawthorn on 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.940
 something is going to be much harder 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.490
 that these things can interfere 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.900
 it also has a grip system 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.970
 here o 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.300
 in these three fingers you can see that 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.780
 literally cave is then for example 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.730
 If you pick something, it's smoother. 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.280
 when the gun barrel comes off the 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.350
 gun it sticks it sticks in the free hand 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.320
 he could slip and everything else 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.600
 In this case, it does not happen with the emitter. 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.800
 so you'll get to blush 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.190
 she also has a special project 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.160
 Can the trigger be you too? 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.140
 Can you feel it here, Ben? 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.370
 can do all the movements 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.680
 usually support it as it should. 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.110
 it is also reinforced here in the 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.570
 up then you will also have here a 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.440
 some protection that I liked 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.160
 much of it is mainly this part 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.740
 here o 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.730
 if you go see exactly where the 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.470
 arrow runs for people who like archery 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.780
 for example wanted to follow with 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.410
 the classic one where the arrow runs over 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.600
 of the hand 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.090
 she has a rigid protection here in 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.830
 top of the two there you can 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.470
 hold the bow you will have a 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.480
 extra layer of protection exactly 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.140
 where the arrow runs over your hand 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:26.080
 it's as if it comes with subtracted 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.930
 It's just one more example. 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.759
 Sometimes you're using your knife and 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.800
 time you'll make a hand cut 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.150
 pick up some cutting boards 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.039
 thing does not pick up the wood 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.110
 you simply with this system of 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.389
 cushioning of this long you do not feel 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.520
 this effect came from the activities 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.919
 of survival 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.669
 will mess with tool will it tinker 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.430
 with weapons 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.400
 he will practice loom wanted to go camping 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.780
 It's camp and you have wood there 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.879
 thorn is the trees is finally a series of 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.509
 things that can cause minor damage 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:01.900
 in hand 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:04.330
 Knitting of knives, for example, is 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.520
 from any other parts up to and including 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.590
 domestic is you have to many times 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.539
 have some things in your house and 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.520
 you would need to have a glove to 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.430
 To protect your hand, what happens is 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.069
 next you go there today spend 12 13 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.690
 gloves on the leather gloves and welder 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.909
 you will not have sensitivity in the hand 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.770
 will end up abandoning the glove because it 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:26.860
 more hinders than help 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.430
 It's time to do some homework and 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.129
 there is no reason for you not to have a 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.460
 glove as this one today you think 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:39.340
 best glove in the world in brazil for 76 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.550
 more freight then probably 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.190
 there is no reason for you not to have 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.129
 your soul from the best protections of the world 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:52.659
 Of course there are other models of it. 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:54.879
 pet with camouflage at last with a desert 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:57.219
 everything else that should have another price I 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.960
 I know it's semi pec want to see that I am 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:01.990
 using today is being sold in brazil 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.020
 for 76 reais worth 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.020
 no doubt you should not even think if 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.690
 You have conditions now, you should go there. 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.659
 and do this experimental test this 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.150
 hence why you honestly do not think 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:18.339
 material that better protects your 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.430
 hand and this is my opinion 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:23.110
