that on and repeat that step every 10
minutes<00:01:13.950> or<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.430> because<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.880> towel<00:01:15.119> will

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
minutes or so because the towel will

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.719 
minutes or so because the towel will
cool<00:01:15.689> down<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> hooded<00:01:17.040> dryer<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.670> I

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
in the hot water so that the coconut oil

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.330 
in the hot water so that the coconut oil
can<00:01:39.630> melt<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.409> blend<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.009> oils

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.340 
can melt and I can blend the oils
together<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.070> am<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.600> put

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
together and then I am going to be put

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.480 
together and then I am going to be put
in<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.710> oils<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.399> my<00:01:47.670> hair<00:01:50.180> some<00:01:52.009> ladies<00:01:53.009> put

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
in the oils on my hair some ladies put

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.770 
in the oils on my hair some ladies put
the<00:01:53.640> oil<00:01:54.380> before<00:01:55.430> they<00:01:56.430> steam<00:01:56.820> that's<00:01:57.570> an

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the oil before they steam that's an

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.380 
the oil before they steam that's an
option<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.560> do<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.070> after<00:01:59.280> because<00:02:00.240> my

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
option but I do it after because my

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.330 
option but I do it after because my
cuticles<00:02:00.960> are<00:02:01.110> lifted<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.860> believe<00:02:02.310> that

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
cuticles are lifted and I believe that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.310 
cuticles are lifted and I believe that
the<00:02:02.610> oil<00:02:02.820> will<00:02:03.750> go<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.759> my<00:02:05.939> shafts<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:07.049> little

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
the oil will go in to my shafts a little

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.520 
the oil will go in to my shafts a little
bit<00:02:07.439> better<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:07.920> that's<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.369> my<00:02:08.640> thinking

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.059 

but<00:02:12.490> I<00:02:13.120> mean<00:02:13.630> whatever<00:02:13.900> works<00:02:14.350> for<00:02:14.800> an

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
but I mean whatever works for an

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.710 
but I mean whatever works for an
individual<00:02:15.850> but<00:02:15.880> this<00:02:16.590> seems<00:02:17.590> logically

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
individual but this seems logically

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.550 
individual but this seems logically
better<00:02:19.720> for<00:02:20.200> me<00:02:20.410> so<00:02:20.800> this<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.010> how<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.400> do<00:02:21.610> it

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
better for me so this is how I do it

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.340 
better for me so this is how I do it
and<00:02:23.560> then<00:02:23.890> after<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:24.370> put<00:02:24.610> my<00:02:24.640> oils<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.420> as<00:02:25.840> you

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
and then after I put my oils on as you

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.620 
and then after I put my oils on as you
can<00:02:26.500> see<00:02:26.680> I'm<00:02:26.830> dumping<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.400> on<00:02:27.550> there<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.090> just

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
can see I'm dumping it on there I just

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.309 
can see I'm dumping it on there I just
