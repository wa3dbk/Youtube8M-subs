Vince<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.100> whether<00:03:03.400> they're<00:03:03.640> from<00:03:03.790> this

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
Vince is whether they're from this

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.449 
Vince is whether they're from this
generation<00:03:04.270> or<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.540> one<00:03:04.660> before<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.459> the

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
generation or the one before and the

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.070 
generation or the one before and the

I'm not saying like I'm still holding a
grudge<00:04:16.150> name<00:04:16.480> because<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:16.900> know<00:04:16.989> it's<00:04:17.140> a<00:04:17.230> long

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
grudge name because you know it's a long

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.930 
grudge name because you know it's a long
time<00:04:17.440> ago<00:04:17.859> but<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.370> think<00:04:18.519> we<00:04:18.579> got<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.730> kind<00:04:18.850> of

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
time ago but I think we got to kind of

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.069 
time ago but I think we got to kind of
put<00:04:19.030> that<00:04:19.150> in<00:04:19.239> context<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.660> mean<00:04:19.780> he<00:04:19.840> had<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.959> lot

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
put that in context I mean he had a lot

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.240 
put that in context I mean he had a lot
of<00:04:20.109> great<00:04:20.260> things<00:04:20.350> but<00:04:20.470> he<00:04:20.590> went<00:04:20.769> out<00:04:20.859> in<00:04:21.040> a<00:04:21.100> bad

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
of great things but he went out in a bad

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.630 
of great things but he went out in a bad
way

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
way

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.670 
way
Tariq<00:04:21.940> is<00:04:22.060> it<00:04:22.180> unforgivable<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:22.930> think<00:04:23.560> it's

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
Tariq is it unforgivable I think it's

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.710 
Tariq is it unforgivable I think it's
unforgivable<00:04:24.370> do<00:04:24.880> it<00:04:25.000> like<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.450> way<00:04:25.570> he

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
unforgivable do it like it the way he

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.820 
unforgivable do it like it the way he
went<00:04:25.870> out<00:04:26.160> he<00:04:27.160> ultimately<00:04:27.630> on<00:04:28.630> it<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.530> fact

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
went out he ultimately on it the fact
