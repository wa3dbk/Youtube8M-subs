00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
a new partition table on that and then

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.289 
a new partition table on that and then
that<00:01:52.500> all<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.100> space<00:01:53.310> becomes<00:01:53.670> free<00:01:53.970> space

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
that all the space becomes free space

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.510 
that all the space becomes free space
then<00:01:54.630> ok<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> click<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:59.280> free

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
then ok so in the click on the free

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.069 
then ok so in the click on the free
space<00:02:01.130> new<00:02:02.130> we're<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> ensure<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
space new we're going to ensure that the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.459 
space new we're going to ensure that the
bootloader<00:02:04.680> goes<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.840> disk<00:02:07.200> yet

bootloader goes to the to that disk yet

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.869 
bootloader goes to the to that disk yet
so<00:02:07.710> we<00:02:07.799> don't<00:02:07.829> want<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.250> put<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> bootloader

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
so we don't want to put the bootloader

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.300 
so we don't want to put the bootloader

you click on xdc we can see that we've

now this time we must make ensure that
logical<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:13.860> active<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.959> then<00:03:16.890> we<00:03:17.430> make<00:03:17.870> the

flush that's re the swap partition okay

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.430 
flush that's re the swap partition okay
we<00:03:25.260> go<00:03:25.500> down<00:03:25.739> click<00:03:26.310> on<00:03:26.489> swap

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
we go down click on swap

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.229 
we go down click on swap
there's<00:03:28.440> nothing<00:03:28.769> if<00:03:28.920> they're<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.700> select

click ok and now you see other in SD see

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.629 
click ok and now you see other in SD see
we've<00:03:37.799> got<00:03:38.569> one<00:03:39.569> partition<00:03:40.079> on<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.290> left<00:03:40.639> and

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
we've got one partition on the left and

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.360 
we've got one partition on the left and
we've<00:03:41.790> got<00:03:41.910> one<00:03:42.030> partition<00:03:42.569> on<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.690> right

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
so will you still go back down to SDC to

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.100 
so will you still go back down to SDC to
the<00:03:48.140> cholesky<00:03:48.440> see<00:03:48.710> you<00:03:48.830> again<00:03:52.480> free<00:03:53.480> space<00:03:53.750> as

you see left and right we're going to

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.630 
you see left and right we're going to
add<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:56.030> path<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.050> shine<00:03:57.230> again<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.890> logical

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
add a path to shine again a logical

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.600 
add a path to shine again a logical
partition<00:03:59.600> and<00:04:00.020> we<00:04:00.170> just<00:04:00.320> going<00:04:00.470> to<00:04:00.560> use<00:04:00.770> the

partition and we just going to use the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.610 
partition and we just going to use the
rest<00:04:01.820> of<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.060> space<00:04:02.330> okay<00:04:03.170> unless<00:04:03.470> that

OK<00:04:12.610> and<00:04:13.610> then<00:04:13.760> lo<00:04:13.940> give<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:14.570> your<00:04:14.780> three

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
OK and then lo give you your three

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.300 
OK and then lo give you your three
partitions<00:04:17.690> now<00:04:18.680> if<00:04:18.799> you<00:04:18.890> were<00:04:18.980> to<00:04:19.070> look<00:04:19.190> at

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
partitions now if you were to look at

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.039 
partitions now if you were to look at
this<00:04:19.459> in<00:04:19.609> gparted<00:04:20.030> you'd<00:04:20.359> see<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.900> one

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
this in gparted you'd see that the one

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.980 
this in gparted you'd see that the one
on<00:04:21.080> the<00:04:21.230> left<00:04:21.500> is<00:04:21.739> a<00:04:21.769> primary<00:04:22.280> partition<00:04:22.990> the

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
on the left is a primary partition the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.360 
on the left is a primary partition the
one<00:04:24.140> in<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.350> middle<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:24.890> the<00:04:25.010> one<00:04:25.130> on<00:04:25.250> the

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
one in the middle and the one on the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.540 
one in the middle and the one on the
right<00:04:25.690> are<00:04:26.690> in<00:04:26.720> an<00:04:27.230> extended<00:04:27.860> partition<00:04:28.220> their

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
right are in an extended partition their

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.340 
right are in an extended partition their
partitions<00:04:29.210> within<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:29.600> padishah<00:04:32.290> so<00:04:33.290> you

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
partitions within the padishah so you

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.160 
partitions within the padishah so you
can<00:04:33.500> see<00:04:33.650> our<00:04:33.800> three<00:04:34.100> partitions<00:04:34.670> there<00:04:37.030> okay

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
can see our three partitions there okay

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.800 
can see our three partitions there okay
and<00:04:39.170> we've<00:04:39.350> ensured<00:04:39.830> that<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.850> boot<00:04:41.060> device

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
and we've ensured that the boot device

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.090 
and we've ensured that the boot device
or<00:04:42.620> bootloader<00:04:43.160> is<00:04:43.460> our<00:04:43.960> external<00:04:45.100> drive

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
or bootloader is our external drive

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.700 
or bootloader is our external drive
whether<00:04:46.520> it's<00:04:46.730> a<00:04:46.790> flash<00:04:47.290> drive<00:04:48.290> or<00:04:48.560> an

whether it's a flash drive or an

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.040 
whether it's a flash drive or an

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
external hard drive

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.659 
external hard drive
obviously<00:04:51.050> I<00:04:51.080> like<00:04:51.860> sitting<00:04:52.100> hard<00:04:52.460> right

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
obviously I like sitting hard right

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.820 
obviously I like sitting hard right
would<00:04:52.820> always<00:04:52.970> be<00:04:53.360> always<00:04:53.810> run<00:04:54.050> quicker<00:04:54.500> than

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
would always be always run quicker than

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.650 
would always be always run quicker than
a<00:04:54.919> flash<00:04:55.190> drive<00:04:55.490> I<00:04:57.880> would<00:04:58.880> just<00:04:59.120> start<00:04:59.390> the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
a flash drive I would just start the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.120 
a flash drive I would just start the
install<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.710> that's<00:05:01.010> pretty<00:05:01.610> much<00:05:01.760> it
