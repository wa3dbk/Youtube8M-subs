the<00:02:07.500> new<00:02:07.740> wop<00:02:08.429> dot<00:02:08.940> singular<00:02:09.479> APN<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.470> get<00:02:10.679> rid

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the new wop dot singular APN to get rid

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.760 
the new wop dot singular APN to get rid
of<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.130> LTE<00:02:11.520> network<00:02:12.060> indicator<00:02:12.600> here<00:02:13.020> on<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
does take a while for HSPA+ to load on

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.229 
does take a while for HSPA+ to load on
the<00:02:24.810> device<00:02:25.110> however<00:02:26.040> when<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.700> searching

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
the device however when it's searching

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.170

for the HSPA+ mobile data point right

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.330 
for the HSPA+ mobile data point right
now<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.810> do<00:02:31.050> have<00:02:31.260> signal<00:02:31.739> for<00:02:31.920> incoming

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
now you so do have signal for incoming

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.130 
now you so do have signal for incoming
and<00:02:32.550> outgoing<00:02:32.760> call<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.600> can<00:02:33.750> still<00:02:33.989> make

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
and outgoing call so you can still make

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.110 
and outgoing call so you can still make
calls<00:02:34.410> at<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.709> time<00:02:34.769> you<00:02:35.640> just<00:02:35.820> won't<00:02:36.000> have

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
calls at this time you just won't have

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.900 
calls at this time you just won't have
access<00:02:36.720> data<00:02:37.440> access<00:02:37.980> while<00:02:38.310> it's<00:02:38.610> still

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
access data access while it's still

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:49.250 
access data access while it's still
searching<00:02:39.330> for<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.780> 4G<00:02:40.340> HSPA+<00:02:41.340> signal<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:49.140> now

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
searching for a 4G HSPA+ signal so now

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.340 
searching for a 4G HSPA+ signal so now
we're<00:02:49.470> connected<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:50.040> 4G<00:02:50.450> HSPA+<00:02:51.450> let's<00:02:52.200> go

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
we're connected to 4G HSPA+ let's go

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.229 
we're connected to 4G HSPA+ let's go
ahead<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.680> run<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:53.010> speed<00:02:53.430> test<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.910> see<00:02:54.090> how

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
ahead and run a speed test to see how

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:13.080 
ahead and run a speed test to see how
fast<00:02:54.540> AT&amp;T<00:02:55.350> s<00:02:55.410> 4g<00:02:55.940> HSPA+<00:02:56.940> speeds<00:02:57.269> are

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.600 

so<00:03:14.080> as<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.290> can<00:03:14.380> see<00:03:14.440> here<00:03:14.890> latency<00:03:15.430> is<00:03:15.489> a

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
so as you can see here latency is a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.460 
so as you can see here latency is a
little<00:03:15.880> bit<00:03:15.970> higher<00:03:16.270> than<00:03:16.569> our<00:03:16.690> earlier<00:03:17.080> speed

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470
