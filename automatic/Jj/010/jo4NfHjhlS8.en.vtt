 good yellow increase an increase and a 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.100
 implant what is the difference 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:06.619
 exactly an increase consists of 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.070
 using some tissues to inject a 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.920
 fill the tissues or the substance more 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.470
 recommended to me is the grace of his 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.549
 same body because you can not refuse it 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.270

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.390
 American silicone graft 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.709
 like the breast grafts that 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.030

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:37.189
 the shape of the glutes 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.500
 when we know for example that 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.990
 the final product or rather when it 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.689
 the surgery that remains 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.799
 perfect as we should be and is 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.709
 very difficult 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.840
 nobody can process perfection 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:53.780

 with teaching yourself with the photos from before 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.940

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.300
 complications in this procedure by 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.120
