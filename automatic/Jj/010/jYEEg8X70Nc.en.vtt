00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
45 minutes to hours whatever maybe it's

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.470 
45 minutes to hours whatever maybe it's
going<00:00:18.890> to<00:00:18.980> be<00:00:19.039> something<00:00:19.130> that's<00:00:19.250> new<00:00:19.460> pit<00:00:19.670> and

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
going to be something that's new pit and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.380 
going to be something that's new pit and
certainly<00:00:21.140> do<00:00:21.410> that<00:00:21.789> at<00:00:22.789> a<00:00:22.849> very<00:00:23.119> very<00:00:23.269> high

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
certainly do that at a very very high

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.480 
certainly do that at a very very high
level<00:00:23.929> multiple<00:00:24.529> times<00:00:24.769> in<00:00:25.099> a<00:00:25.250> very<00:00:25.429> short

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
level multiple times in a very short

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.279 
level multiple times in a very short
window<00:00:25.849> so<00:00:26.359> it's<00:00:26.570> it's<00:00:27.019> going<00:00:27.140> to<00:00:27.230> be

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
window so it's it's going to be

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.300 
window so it's it's going to be
interesting<00:00:27.410> to<00:00:27.650> see<00:00:27.740> how<00:00:27.769> they<00:00:27.920> handle<00:00:28.070> it

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
interesting to see how they handle it

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.919 
interesting to see how they handle it

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
different a lot of different ranges and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.080 
different a lot of different ranges and
he<00:01:35.960> can<00:01:36.110> be<00:01:36.140> competitive<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:37.340> those<00:01:37.670> ranges

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
he can be competitive in those ranges

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.719 
he can be competitive in those ranges
not<00:01:38.299> only<00:01:38.509> stroke<00:01:38.840> ranges<00:01:39.320> but<00:01:39.649> also<00:01:40.100> distance

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
not only stroke ranges but also distance

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.090 
not only stroke ranges but also distance
ranges<00:01:41.149> and<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:41.390> it's<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.290> nice<00:01:42.470> thing<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.950> have

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.600 
get a little feedback on you know how
that<00:02:14.720> particular<00:02:14.840> stroke<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.680> looking<00:02:16.100> or<00:02:16.520> how

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
that particular stroke is looking or how

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.590 
that particular stroke is looking or how
that<00:02:16.760> particular

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
that particular

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.520 
that particular
they're<00:02:17.720> handling<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.200> particular

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
they're handling that particular

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.620 
they're handling that particular
distance<00:02:19.130> so<00:02:19.730> we're<00:02:19.910> going<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.120> do<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> lot

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
distance so we're going to do that a lot

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.810 
distance so we're going to do that a lot
kind<00:02:21.410> of<00:02:21.470> throughout<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.890> fall<00:02:22.160> not<00:02:22.700> only
