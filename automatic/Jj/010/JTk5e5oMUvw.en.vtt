00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
that's how you change loss takes a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.929 
that's how you change loss takes a
little<00:01:49.409> more<00:01:49.530> practice<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.430> am<00:01:50.549> doing<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
little more practice and I am doing it

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.490 
little more practice and I am doing it
you<00:01:51.090> need<00:01:51.240> at<00:01:51.390> least<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.869> cage<00:01:52.110> banging

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
off bigger than 7x7 otherwise it'll feel

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.080 
off bigger than 7x7 otherwise it'll feel
threatened<00:01:55.350> trapped<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.189> will<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.850> tamed

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
so much more difficult because you have

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.210 
so much more difficult because you have
to<00:02:09.149> find<00:02:09.360> them<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
creative mode it's a little bit easier

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.410 
creative mode it's a little bit easier
that<00:02:16.430> way<00:02:16.520> we<00:02:16.730> love<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.030> will<00:02:17.120> pack<00:02:17.270> system
