00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hi folks, has there been a question? 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.540
 Frequent many people come to me 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.910
 asking me then I decided to make a video 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.070
 about empty houses since you 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.150
 understand that there is no 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.790
 empty house 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.410
 I already talked about it in other videos 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.600
 I think I said 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.060
 probably on almost all videos 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.760
 I should have mentioned about the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 empty houses that no empty house is 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.330
 actually empty 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.029
 it may be that the empty house does not have a 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.369
 important prominence in the person's life 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.620
 usually where we have external 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.440
 are several planets a cluster of 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.829
 planets in a house is where the house 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.160
 highlight on the map this is logical even 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.350
 huh 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.530
 one more empty house does not cease to have 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.570
 importance and also never be empty. 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.969
 in fact I'll explain this to you 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.949
 here now even has a map of john 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.829
 lennon who is a great example of this he 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.379
 had four empty house but we see 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.680
 the mother so that the family 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.019
 and influenced the person and his life is 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.909
 so much so that that sector there was 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.420
 powerful for him mainly with 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.210
 that moon in the 11th house is not receiving 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.430
 several aspects then it is important to look 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.189
 this for you to have an idea like a 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.320
 Empty house had great importance 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.810
 just look at johnny's map then let's go 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.330
 there I have house 1 and house 10 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.280
 empty here in our example then zinho 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.170
 we have to do we see that 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.780
 The house has no planet but has one 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.090
 sign at the cost and a sign that's here 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.220
 It's the pound sign so we get the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.470
 pound information that balances 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.470
 means within astrology what is the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.070
 archetype of this energy that sign 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.299
 express wedding art beauty and 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.840
 balance diplomacy enemy alliances 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.509
 and if it is included in the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.180
 society begins to put itself in the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.070
 society then we take all these 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.530
 information and play for that first 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.240
 house that needs a tooth then 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.060
 How is this person going to express himself? 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.550
 because this house and expression is like 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.709
 this person dresses and is characterized 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.440
 to show off for society is 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.570
 identity that it will show 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.940
 people so she has shown herself to be 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.770
 It's just that it's not enough just to look at 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.560
 the sign that is on the course that people 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.180
 have to look at the ruler of the sign to 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.280
 to be able to bring more 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.500
 complete for this house then it is logical 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.720
 that we have to look for the planet 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.180
 that rules the sign that is in the cut of the house 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.970
 empty and what is the planet that governs pound 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.690
 The planet that rules pound is Venus and Venus. 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.900
 is here in the ninth house is 29 degrees 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.220
 twins and has the aspects here next 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.710
 for this venus 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.560
 then all this information the fact 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.570
 of this Venus is in twins the fact of it 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.150
 it's at 29 degrees 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.120
 the fact that she is in the ninth house the fact 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.300
 of it having an opposing aspect, another 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.630
 opposition contest aspect for the moon 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.630
 and that the impulse to the saturn all this 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.720
 they are information that we put 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.380
 this venus and plays to enjoy the house an 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.900
 So this house is empty, not this house. 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.600
 he's pounded with all the information 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.910
 with all the archetype that this bell 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.550
 expressed in here and we are 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.900
 all this information from your regent 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.390
 which is Venus 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.790
 then this person shows up for the 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.550
 the world in what form it shows itself 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.239
 a very educated person very cortez 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.160
 very diplomatic a very fair person 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.140
 likely to be a list person 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.170
 very well you're always fine 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.670
 dressed for society to people 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.230
 and then we start looking for the 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.610
 information that is here 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.610
 She is also a very 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.550
 communicative communication it a 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.100
 very philosophical communication is a 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.410
 communication of deep knowledge 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.510
 what she's talking about is a person 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.000
 extremely cultured probably 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.880
 enough traveled person can be a person who 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.940
 participate in events where there is 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.340
 arts exhibition and so on then it is 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.860
 just for you to understand that even this 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.769
 house that being empty looks at both 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.810
 information that this regent brings 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.769
 to this house and here the same thing in the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.470
 house 10 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.660
 We have cancer here in house 10 a 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.060
 house is empty and what we have to 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.800
 do if you have an empty house go pro 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.770
 It's pure to know which sign is 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.380
 seeking regent of the sign here in the case 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.990
 people have cancer then cancer regent 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.389
 It's the moon, we take this moon and it analyzes 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.060
 no then this moon is in house three in the 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:45.120
 brothers home communication house 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.450
 of commerce this house has much to do 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.360
 with the youth with the collegiate tend 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.430
 with the brothers tb with the relatives 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.650
 this house which also shows many 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.930
 activities a person who has several 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.510
 activities during the day and this is not 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.330
 certain degree of capricorn then we 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.970
 takes all this information and plays to 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.070
 house 10 just like I did with Venus here 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.070
 to marry then just to reinforce more 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.220
 once a house is never empty she 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.380
 always brings information and of course it is 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.389
 it is very likely that a house that has not 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.910
 no planet inside it has not 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.850
 so much prominence in your life will not be the 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.430
 focus of your life is probably the focus 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.720
 be where you have a stereo but this 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.450
 it's not rule 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.479
 It's good, the important people are in it. 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:36.210
 of astrology does not exist a fixed rule 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:38.669
 there are no laws everything is possible inside 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.410
 astrology the astrologer the person who 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.539
 is analyzing the map he has to be 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.130
 open to several 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.380
 itapira to all possibilities 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.770
 then I hope I have clarified 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.410
 for you about empty houses and we 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.830
