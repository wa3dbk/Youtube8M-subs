00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:02.060
 Brazil still has 1 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.260
 long way to go to ensure equality between men and chile 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.260
 according to the report prepared by the world economic forum 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.429
 the situation of the country has worsened 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.969
 in addition to having fewer job opportunities received by minors 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.670
 still have to live with the difficulty of access to education 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.829
 and limited to political participation 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.380
 because of this we fall in the ranking of gender inequality 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.989
 among 134 countries analyzed, we are now only a few hours away from the 5th position 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.920
 the difference is that men and women occur in several sectors of society 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.250
 Brazilian 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.120
 in education, for example, the country registers 93% of girls in education 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.400
 primary 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.400
 the proportion of boys is 95% 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.250
 in the labor market the difference is even greater 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.820
 the female participation is 64% while the male participation is 85% 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.540
 in addition their income lives in two-thirds of their lives 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.500
 already in politics, women represent only 9% of 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.920
 parliamentarians 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.779
 and occupy only 7% of ministerial-level positions 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.580
 due to differences such as these, Brazil fell four positions in the ranking of 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.110
 gender inequality and went from the utah jazz in the first place of the year 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.100
 passed to roth to gesmo fifth 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.560
 the study was conducted in 134 countries by the world economic forum 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.250
 in relation to Latin American countries, Brazil is behind countries 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.250
 like cuba argentina and with dori chile 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.430
 the difference is smaller in Iceland and Norway 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.820
 already the last places of the ranking are par that are in the Asia Chad in 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.520
 and he in the Arabian peninsula 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.760
 how would this report be elaborated today by the economic forum 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.480
 world 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.340
 in 86% of the 114 countries that were analyzed during the last five 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.670
 years there was a reduction of inequality 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.250
 inequality between the sexes 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.329
 but how do we see there? 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:14.420
 Brazil is on the other side of the line among the 14% in which there was an increase in 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:15.350
 inequality 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.160
 here with us to analyze these cases the sociologist eliana magalhÃ£es the advisor 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.089
 of the institute of socio-economic studies 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:23.619
 Good day to day band 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:27.339
 why is this difficulty of Brazil in reducing gender inequality 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.909
 we have a fairly complete and quite society. 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:33.619
 centered 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.359
 restructured 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.529
 finally enem issues 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.269
 patriarch of lisbon 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.139
 our dominant elites, right? 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.519
 are the same we had little spared change 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.069
 novelty in this sense 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.069
 they are white men with 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.019
 my position is that you have money that pays 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.729
 or at least is in Haiti quoted if journalist 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.309
 of income distribution 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:04.769
 So we have a very concentrated work in Luanda. 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.429
 and then very divided 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.589
 in India, although they are the majority of the population 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:11.730
 the majority of the elect 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.709
 neither the voters nor the country are women 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.379
 they suffer greatly from prejudice against discrimination against 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.360
 this domination 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.610
 however the night domination inside the mine is of the selic would say said how much 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.150
 time 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.319
 now are the instruments of domination that are used to 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.959
 keep 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.079
 the wealthy women bc could take advantage of colon 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:37.369
 internet speed mainly the issue 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:40.549
 business 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.579
 the issue of education seeing on 21 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.099
 in the news 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.099
 here women still have less access to education 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.999
 and prejudice that saw a structural issue 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.999
 woman's place is at home or notice that in the kitchen 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:00.689
 despite the theme we have faith, however, we advance there 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.199
 the lipsticks that the club has some barriers 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.919
 but still remains in the campaign for the mother's remuneration 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.109
 but try to see now we are behind in Latin America from countries 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.060
 with the trade a tampa bay cuba costa rica 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.579
 argentina nicaragua panama with the ecuador chile or seedlings colombia 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.959
 the uruguay peru venezuela 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.590
 Dominican republic and bolivia 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.440
 Wait for the recharge to shoot. 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.009
 and we believe we said 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.500
 people who have not been able since the arrival of these women 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.330
 in relation to that country is in front of us 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.449
 I think we have bigger cities bid more complete 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.229
 hehehehe we have this stronger question - could understand 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.099
 as much as women have 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.099
 grandson is a fight that involves 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.159
 in a big battle you can not with a pin only managed 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.719
 understand these established barriers 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:57.719
 thing that has happened in other countries can be patented 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.479
 from the moment that you wired 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.789
 has been able to pass a law 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.469
 erick that predicts the party list with alternating sex 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:11.439
 She got sugar from Brazil. 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.080
 there is today and maybe even a little behind 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.580
 and has advanced a lot 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.059
 I do not make an alliance until then the note 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:22.509
 then it means that it will really change really alter the fact that the 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:23.360
 site 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.180
 vis the women in space is that that vibe political participation in the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.270
 last day 3 and everyone had elections 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.099
 and there was a slight reduction in the Chamber of Deputies the number of 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:37.030
 participation of women elected was 45 2006 and now against 44 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.550
 this proves that the quota system that was created in 97 and improved year 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.009
 passed with the obligatory nature of the pcb per cent life did not have 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.009
 success then the economy is wrong that 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.919
 entitled T-shirt and radio 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.180
 on this day the proof laws of sainte devote 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.939
 but until there is 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.520
 an understanding on the part of 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.939
 but that women have to be compared to party life 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:07.260
 they have to do penance and have every time that they 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.369
 to participate 

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:11.699
 davi of the daily departure of the parties that can aim 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.139
 power within one's own 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:20.060
 It's childish, yes, it's not a team that's set in the mentality. 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.629
 to manifest 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:25.770
 and our own institutions of the judiciary also found 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.740
 normal for example the poor if the quotas 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.259
 now in these elections 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.259
 parties did not comply with the quotas were not 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:38.509
 so today we have institutions 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:42.020
 he incorporates in the event by marcanni zago 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.689
 in this decade 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:46.689
 this macho patriarchal culture 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:50.849
 before any changes in legislation are required 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:52.710
 stop being a sexist country 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.699
 and average patriarchal look at boi upps not women 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.289
 with having very difficult to reach and Brazil stay in that position 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:01.409
 shameful 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:04.780
 which eliana thank you for your participation of a brazilian reporter
