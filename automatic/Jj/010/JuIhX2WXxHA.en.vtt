00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 Federal Migration Service 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.980
 Russian Federation Ministry of Economic Development 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.020
 have developed a new bill according to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.420
 which any entrepreneur who 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.400
 invests in the country's economy more than 10 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.660
 million rubles will receive Russian 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.969
 citizenship the same will 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.369
 apply to students from other 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.560
 countries that graduate in the Russian 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.080
 federations of universities and various educational 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.949
 institutions and will be able to work on 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.840
 the country for at least three years, 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.060
 This new law has as 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.579
 some critics and supporters already 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.440
 expressed the assumption that each 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.149
 new citizen of the russian federation about 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.550
 This case involves more than 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.230
 two million students who can 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.250
 total if this bill becomes 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.590
 obtain Russian citizenship by law 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.600
 will cost the Russian treasury in 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.969
 a greater amount than he can bring 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.980
 to the Russian treasury the same skepticism 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.930
 caused its own and the situation with 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.489
 entrepreneurs because not much 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.460
 many entrepreneurs will really 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.180
 ready to invest in the country's economy 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.250
 money for getting Russian 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.750
 citizenship and here we are talking about low 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.180
 there are literally thousands of people 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.049
 According to those who criticize these 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.049
 bills 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.010
 these ideas but nonetheless are also 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.280
 supporters here for example 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.590
 the head of the society of migrants of Russia said 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.110
 already that this is a very important bill he 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.600
 will allow the Russian authorities much 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.979
 more clearly regulate the work of those who 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.420
 used to be migrants accordingly 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.880
 then they will receive Russian citizenship 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.830
 in Russia it will also help 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.320
 reduce possible crime among 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.150
 migrants and in general it will be very 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.450
 useful for the economy and investment 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.240
 climate 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.790
 will be able to improve but while 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.780
 not clear will be the bill years 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.670
 full law it will only 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.220
 submitted to the Duma next week already 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.780
 it is quite clear that this is an attempt 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.000
 approach in some way to 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.409
 European standards because as in 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.640
 some European countries in many yes 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.680
 in almost all EU countries 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.869
 such practice exists enough 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.439
 long at the same time, experts have noted 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.310
 that an investment of 10 million rubles is 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.350
 should occur throughout 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.909
 several years over three years and 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.490
 only then can a person get 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.750
 citizenship in this way the total price 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.130
 if I may say so Russian 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.020
 Citizenship will be 30 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.860
 million rubles and this is 2 times more expensive 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.360
 than, for example to get green card in the US 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.140
 anyway this draft bill 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.150
 there will be 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.650
 in the State Duma it will be possible 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.590
 make some changes because 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.000
 this figure itself is 10 million by many 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.730
 criticized say it is not 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.440
 big enough for 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.880
 seriously investing in russian 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.110
 economy and surely we can expect 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.380
 any other changes in this 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.380
 the bill
