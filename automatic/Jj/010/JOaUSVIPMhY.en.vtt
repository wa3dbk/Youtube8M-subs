00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.659
 but a day like this on the web 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:15.849
 I wanted to find 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.690
 in answer to the last question I was asking myself how is it possible 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:20.759
 for me 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.029
 I am able to play the piano of the economic crisis 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.460
 carry it sandra of oath with the help of a professional mover 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.460
 because I'm still pretty 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.900
 talent 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.960
 I was pretty surprised carrying her husband his son 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.360
 I came across an ad - Dichilian-sidec released Thursday 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.100
 the Alsatian engineer who had put his employees fifteen years to 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.060
 his son who presumably did the same 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.450
 in a few months 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 the Swiss giant 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.230
 the bank 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.520
 the, the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.520
 % 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.870
 long time that even provides 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.610
 % 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.360
 we imagine 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.240
 when she talks about 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.500
 the machine that carries the piano 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.400
 I am super fassi 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.620
 all those who wish 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.040
 obviously this is not the case 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.369
 I still have a tension 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.740
 in the room 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.740
 I will say when I'm in shape I can do in three quarters of an hour 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.440
 nothing 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.440
 because 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.270
 play in summer on a public square in a small Romanesque church in the 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.689
 South of France 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.370
 he played in a meeting room 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.469
 click here 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.709
 it may seem 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.099
 mentally very far 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.010
 our Kenyan troops but it was too important it's part of the 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.010
 flexibility 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.139
 project as a whole 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.999
 to know so well 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:32.779
 I knew 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.939
 is there really cultural festivals of the 103 victims 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.629
 it could be a service I will play my game 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.739
 Pyramid suite date but I wanted to overtake 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.509
 the same 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:51.509
 on the way 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.479
 he 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.559
 business world during working hours 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.559
 the door 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.359
 very quickly 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.639
 more serenity and musical 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.639
 within the company 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.559
 eu 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.599
 the 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.599
 walker 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.669
 here 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:40.970
 he went away 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.299
 it is done 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.299
 in a salad bowl 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:47.549
 the man
