so<00:00:43.309> all<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.820> all<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:44.120> indications<00:00:45.019> are<00:00:45.530> that

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
so all the all the indications are that

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.349 
so all the all the indications are that
this<00:00:45.890> is<00:00:46.100> becoming<00:00:46.550> is<00:00:46.789> I<00:00:46.879> wouldn't<00:00:47.089> say<00:00:47.239> it's

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
this is becoming is I wouldn't say it's

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:48.910 
this is becoming is I wouldn't say it's
mainstream<00:00:47.539> yet<00:00:47.929> but<00:00:48.260> it's<00:00:48.440> headed<00:00:48.769> in<00:00:48.890> that

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
mainstream yet but it's headed in that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.829 
mainstream yet but it's headed in that
direction<00:00:49.070> all<00:00:49.640> right<00:00:49.879> but<00:00:50.089> now<00:00:50.359> by

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
direction all right but now by

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.810 
direction all right but now by
definition<00:00:51.109> I<00:00:51.559> mean<00:00:51.739> there's<00:00:51.920> no<00:00:52.160> sovereignty

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
definition I mean there's no sovereignty

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.970 
definition I mean there's no sovereignty
controlling<00:00:53.539> it<00:00:53.660> there's<00:00:53.899> no<00:00:54.079> central<00:00:54.469> bank<00:00:54.829> i

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
controlling it there's no central bank i

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.560 
controlling it there's no central bank i
mean<00:00:55.100> it<00:00:55.219> is<00:00:55.339> functioning<00:00:55.940> outside<00:00:56.390> the

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
mean it is functioning outside the

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.930 
mean it is functioning outside the
system<00:00:56.780> that<00:00:57.170> we<00:00:57.499> know<00:00:57.679> right<00:00:58.160> which<00:00:58.789> of

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
system that we know right which of

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.369 
system that we know right which of
course<00:00:58.969> for<00:00:59.359> some<00:00:59.510> people<00:00:59.809> was<00:00:59.960> perfect

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
course for some people was perfect

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.079 
course for some people was perfect
that's<00:01:00.559> okay<00:01:00.920> that's<00:01:01.219> exactly<00:01:01.640> what<00:01:01.789> makes<00:01:01.969> it

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
that's okay that's exactly what makes it

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.970 
that's okay that's exactly what makes it
attractive<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.600> them<00:01:02.870> but<00:01:03.499> you<00:01:03.649> know<00:01:03.739> one<00:01:03.890> of

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
attractive to them but you know one of

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.140 
attractive to them but you know one of
the<00:01:04.040> most<00:01:04.250> interesting<00:01:04.730> things<00:01:04.940> that<00:01:05.059> they

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
the most interesting things that they

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.220 
the most interesting things that they
were<00:01:05.210> talking<00:01:05.480> about<00:01:05.570> in<00:01:05.750> that<00:01:05.780> good<00:01:06.020> wife

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
were talking about in that good wife

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.200 
were talking about in that good wife
clip<00:01:06.530> is<00:01:06.680> how<00:01:06.980> the<00:01:07.040> money<00:01:07.340> gets<00:01:07.550> created<00:01:08.030> like

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
clip is how the money gets created like

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.610 
clip is how the money gets created like
if<00:01:08.360> there's<00:01:08.540> no<00:01:08.660> central<00:01:08.960> bank<00:01:09.230> who's<00:01:09.470> in

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
if there's no central bank who's in

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.560 
if there's no central bank who's in
charge<00:01:09.650> of<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.100> money<00:01:10.310> supply<00:01:10.550> like<00:01:11.060> what

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
charge of the money supply like what

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.840 
charge of the money supply like what
happens<00:01:12.050> here<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:13.040> answer<00:01:13.370> is<00:01:13.400> it<00:01:13.730> was

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
happens here and the answer is it was

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.110 
happens here and the answer is it was
programmed<00:01:14.140> initially<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.650> have<00:01:16.070> a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
programmed initially to have a

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.430 
programmed initially to have a
increasing<00:01:17.120> money<00:01:17.300> supply<00:01:17.750> but<00:01:18.050> a<00:01:18.080> very

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
increasing money supply but a very

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.610 
increasing money supply but a very
controlled<00:01:18.890> money<00:01:19.610> supply<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:20.420> there's<00:01:21.410> not

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
controlled money supply so there's not

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.830 
controlled money supply so there's not
an<00:01:21.770> infinite<00:01:22.250> number<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:22.550> bitcoins<00:01:23.270> that<00:01:23.690> can

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
an infinite number of bitcoins that can

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.950 
an infinite number of bitcoins that can
be<00:01:23.960> created<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:24.590> as<00:01:25.190> you<00:01:25.310> go<00:01:25.460> over<00:01:25.640> time<00:01:26.060> they

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
be created and as you go over time they

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.960 
be created and as you go over time they
become<00:01:27.230> harder<00:01:27.620> and<00:01:27.650> harder<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.130> manufacture

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
become harder and harder to manufacture

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.690 
become harder and harder to manufacture
and<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:30.010> manufacture<00:01:31.010> them<00:01:31.220> as<00:01:31.430> was

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
and you manufacture them as was

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.880 
and you manufacture them as was
indicated<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:32.420> clip<00:01:32.720> by<00:01:33.170> actually

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
indicated in that clip by actually

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.920 
indicated in that clip by actually
having<00:01:34.130> some<00:01:34.580> very<00:01:34.610> intensive<00:01:35.300> compute<00:01:35.750> power

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
having some very intensive compute power

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.630 
having some very intensive compute power
solving<00:01:36.530> very<00:01:36.710> difficult<00:01:37.130> problems<00:01:37.460> when<00:01:37.580> you

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
solving very difficult problems when you

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.280 
solving very difficult problems when you
solve<00:01:37.910> that<00:01:38.030> problem<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:38.870> get<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.110> few

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
solve that problem you get a few

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.990 
solve that problem you get a few
bitcoins<00:01:39.740> for<00:01:39.980> all<00:01:40.220> right<00:01:40.370> then<00:01:40.610> what<00:01:40.850> about

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
bitcoins for all right then what about

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.780 
bitcoins for all right then what about
concerns<00:01:41.600> about<00:01:41.860> being<00:01:42.860> authentic<00:01:43.550> for

concerns about being authentic for

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.640 
concerns about being authentic for
example<00:01:44.240> yeah<00:01:44.570> there's<00:01:44.900> something<00:01:45.260> called<00:01:45.410> a

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
example yeah there's something called a

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.610 
example yeah there's something called a
chain<00:01:46.160> block<00:01:46.460> which<00:01:46.850> is<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:47.120> way<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:50.620> authoring

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
chain block which is a way of authoring

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.370 
chain block which is a way of authoring
bitcoins<00:01:52.580> that<00:01:52.820> are<00:01:52.940> in<00:01:53.090> circulation<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.110> any

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
computer that is presented that on in

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.630 
computer that is presented that on in
the<00:01:56.900> in<00:01:57.110> any<00:01:57.320> node<00:01:57.680> of<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.130> Bitcoin<00:01:58.580> network

the in any node of the Bitcoin network
that's<00:01:59.420> presented<00:01:59.840> with<00:02:00.200> bitcoins<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:01.220> can

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
that's presented with bitcoins it can

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.700 
that's presented with bitcoins it can
instantly<00:02:01.850> verify<00:02:02.600> whether<00:02:02.900> or<00:02:03.200> not<00:02:03.410> they
