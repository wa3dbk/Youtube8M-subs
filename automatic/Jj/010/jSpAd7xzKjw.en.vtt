00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.540 
right now is 28 26 22 and it I love it
it's<00:02:30.910> very<00:02:31.300> very<00:02:31.960> very<00:02:32.590> thick

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
it's very very very thick

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.280 
it's very very very thick
I<00:02:33.580> wanted<00:02:34.240> my<00:02:34.390> hair<00:02:34.630> kind<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.990> skin<00:02:35.440> straight<00:02:35.890> I

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
I wanted my hair kind of skin straight I

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.600 
I wanted my hair kind of skin straight I
wanted<00:02:38.290> my<00:02:38.440> hair<00:02:38.650> trying<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.980> skin<00:02:39.250> straight

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
wanted my hair trying to skin straight

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.410 
wanted my hair trying to skin straight
so<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.330> just<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:40.810> know<00:02:40.960> um<00:02:41.970> flat<00:02:42.970> ironed<00:02:43.300> it

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
so I just you know um flat ironed it

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.580 
so I just you know um flat ironed it
because<00:02:43.570> if<00:02:43.690> they<00:02:43.810> come<00:02:43.930> in<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.140> body<00:02:44.320> leave

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
because if they come in the body leave

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.710 
because if they come in the body leave
and<00:02:45.400> when<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.850> wash<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.270> their<00:02:46.390> body<00:02:46.540> weight

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
and when you wash it their body weight

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.290 
and when you wash it their body weight
does<00:02:47.080> come<00:02:47.590> back<00:02:47.830> maybe<00:02:48.160> not<00:02:48.430> as<00:02:48.580> definite<00:02:49.120> but

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
does come back maybe not as definite but

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.090 
does come back maybe not as definite but
it<00:02:49.390> definitely<00:02:49.840> does<00:02:50.020> come<00:02:50.320> back<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.800> I<00:02:50.860> would

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
it definitely does come back and I would

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.510 
it definitely does come back and I would
say<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:52.210> far<00:02:52.630> within<00:02:53.380> straightening<00:02:54.280> and

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520

it um separating the tracks from the
actual<00:04:11.680> roll<00:04:12.040> it<00:04:12.430> took<00:04:12.730> some<00:04:13.030> of<00:04:13.210> the<00:04:13.360> brass

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
actual roll it took some of the brass

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.610 
actual roll it took some of the brass
away<00:04:13.960> from<00:04:14.140> it<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:14.560> but<00:04:15.630> you<00:04:16.630> got<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:17.140> not<00:04:17.350> a

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
away from it to you but you got it not a

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.220 
away from it to you but you got it not a
deal-breaker<00:04:18.580> to<00:04:19.359> me<00:04:19.540> honest

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
deal-breaker to me honest

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.620 
deal-breaker to me honest
because<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:21.790> quality<00:04:21.970> of<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.300> hair<00:04:22.510> is

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
because the quality of the hair is

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.700 
because the quality of the hair is
really<00:04:22.930> good

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
really good

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.690 
really good
