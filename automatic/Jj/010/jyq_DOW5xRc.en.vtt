00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
is the image we'll be working with

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.819 
is the image we'll be working with
most<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> image<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.600> nicely<00:00:33.840> exposed<00:00:34.530> for

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.950 
most of the image is nicely exposed for
apart<00:00:35.340> from<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.760> area<00:00:36.210> around<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.660> sky

apart from this area around the sky
which<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.230> overexposed<00:00:38.510> now<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.540> have<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> darker

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
which is overexposed now I have a darker

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.410 
which is overexposed now I have a darker
exposure<00:00:40.890> where<00:00:41.730> we're<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> restore

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
exposure where we're going to restore

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.380 
exposure where we're going to restore
much<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.020> overexposed<00:00:43.800> sky<00:00:44.180> now<00:00:45.180> there

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
much of that overexposed sky now there

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.270 
much of that overexposed sky now there
are<00:00:45.510> many<00:00:45.629> different<00:00:45.780> ways<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.350> do<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.739> but

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
are many different ways to do this but

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.529 
are many different ways to do this but
we're<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.850> very<00:00:47.879> quickly<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
we're going to do it very quickly and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.799 
we're going to do it very quickly and
very<00:00:48.750> easily<00:00:48.870> using<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.950> color<00:00:50.250> range<00:00:50.399> tool

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
very easily using the color range tool

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.569 
very easily using the color range tool
so<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.870> begin<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.379> we'll<00:00:52.590> go<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> select<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
so to begin with we'll go to select and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.090 
so to begin with we'll go to select and
color<00:00:54.570> range<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.140> because<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.829> want<00:00:56.010> to

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
color range and because we want to

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.799 
color range and because we want to
target<00:00:56.280> highlights<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.390> pull<00:00:57.629> down

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
target highlights we have to pull down

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.810 
target highlights we have to pull down
this<00:00:57.989> drop-down<00:00:58.260> box<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.980> go<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> highlights

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
this drop-down box and go to highlights

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.939 
this drop-down box and go to highlights
with<00:01:02.820> these<00:01:03.030> two<00:01:03.239> sliders<00:01:03.680> range<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
with these two sliders range and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.440 
with these two sliders range and
fuzziness<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.519> depends<00:01:05.909> really<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.210> what

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
fuzziness it depends really on what

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.450 
fuzziness it depends really on what
you're<00:01:06.600> selecting<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.130> leave<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you're selecting if we just leave the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.090 
you're selecting if we just leave the
range<00:01:08.700> right<00:01:08.970> now<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.270> 190<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.680> bring<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
range right now at 190 but bring the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.370 
range right now at 190 but bring the
fuzziness<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.229> we're

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
fuzziness up we can see that we're

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.520 
fuzziness up we can see that we're
extending<00:01:13.770> our<00:01:14.750> selection<00:01:15.750> we're<00:01:16.110> making<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.359 
we've blended our two exposures but it
doesn't<00:01:48.960> look<00:01:49.079> particularly<00:01:49.470> natural<00:01:49.890> yet

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
doesn't look particularly natural yet

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.520 
doesn't look particularly natural yet
all<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:51.180> need<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.840> bring<00:01:52.110> down<00:01:52.170> our

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
all we need to do is bring down our

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.039 
all we need to do is bring down our
opacity<00:01:52.860> until<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.939> two<00:01:54.090> exposures<00:01:54.509> fit

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
opacity until the two exposures fit

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.480 
opacity until the two exposures fit
nicely<00:01:55.259> together<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.549> smooth<00:01:57.000> way<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:58.490> that

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
nicely together in a smooth way and that

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.490 
nicely together in a smooth way and that
looks<00:01:59.670> good<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.750> look<00:02:00.930> at<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> before<00:02:01.469> and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
looks good so to look at the before and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.260 
looks good so to look at the before and
after<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.610> see<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:02.939> heavily

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
after you can see it's heavily

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.569 
after you can see it's heavily
overexposed<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.290> sky<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.799> now<00:02:05.520> we

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
overexposed in the sky and now we

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.510 
overexposed in the sky and now we
restored<00:02:06.210> some<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.600> those<00:02:06.689> highlights<00:02:07.069> and<00:02:08.069> if

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
restored some of those highlights and if

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.080 
restored some of those highlights and if
we<00:02:08.640> zoom<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.300> see<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.929> lot<00:02:10.679> better

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
we zoom in we can see this a lot better

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.350 
we zoom in we can see this a lot better
there<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.180> go<00:02:12.330> that's<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.690> before<00:02:12.840> and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
there you go that's the before and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.010 
there you go that's the before and
today<00:02:14.250> another<00:02:15.250> way<00:02:15.490> of<00:02:15.610> doing<00:02:15.880> this<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.240> we

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
today another way of doing this is we

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.680 
today another way of doing this is we
have<00:02:17.170> two<00:02:17.290> exposures<00:02:17.860> here<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:19.510> have<00:02:19.660> some

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
have two exposures here and we have some

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.300 
have two exposures here and we have some
bright<00:02:20.080> lights<00:02:20.350> which<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.710> want<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:20.950> try<00:02:21.160> and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
bright lights which I want to try and

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.590 
bright lights which I want to try and
bring<00:02:21.520> down<00:02:21.730> because<00:02:22.060> they're<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.210> little<00:02:22.390> bit

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
bring down because they're a little bit

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.840 
bring down because they're a little bit
distracting<00:02:23.230> again<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:24.160> have<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> darker

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
distracting again I have a darker

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.360 
distracting again I have a darker
exposure<00:02:25.240> here<00:02:25.660> which<00:02:25.810> are<00:02:25.960> ideal<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.530> all<00:02:27.340> I

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
exposure here which are ideal and all I

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.580 
exposure here which are ideal and all I
need<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.730> do<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.060> on<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.630> base<00:02:28.870> exposure<00:02:29.320> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
need to do is on the base exposure the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.860 
need to do is on the base exposure the
brighter<00:02:29.890> exposure<00:02:30.490> is<00:02:30.850> place<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> layer<00:02:31.840> mask

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
brighter exposure is place a layer mask

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.360 
brighter exposure is place a layer mask
and<00:02:32.320> go<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.040> select<00:02:33.960> color<00:02:34.960> range<00:02:35.020> and<00:02:35.530> this

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
and go to select color range and this

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.570 
and go to select color range and this

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
just paint in the exposure here and if I

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.300 
just paint in the exposure here and if I
just<00:03:17.739> zoom<00:03:18.160> in<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:19.470> can<00:03:20.470> paint<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:20.950> little<00:03:21.130> bit

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
just zoom in I can paint it a little bit

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.910 
just zoom in I can paint it a little bit
more<00:03:22.320> this<00:03:23.320> is<00:03:23.380> what<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.650> look<00:03:23.739> like<00:03:23.800> before

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
more this is what it look like before

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.810 
more this is what it look like before
and<00:03:24.459> this<00:03:25.330> is<00:03:25.390> after<00:03:26.100> so<00:03:27.100> as<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.340> can<00:03:27.459> see<00:03:27.640> it's
