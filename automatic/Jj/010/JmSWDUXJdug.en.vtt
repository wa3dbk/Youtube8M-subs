 snowden in the plane is not clear only in 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.170
 what and when and if you look at the face 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.970

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.369

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.409

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.240
 know where now Mr. Snowden he 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.740
 safe place but because of threats in his 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.600
 address from the american 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.909
 Administration, we can not yet inform 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.900
 no details even name the country 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.119
 where is he 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.189
 what does not hide the wikileaks manual 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.630
 the fact that they help snowden in every possible way 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.149
 as it turns out now a former employee 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.369
 the security services did not make a noise 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.990
 precisely spontaneous outburst leaking from 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.090

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.840
 well back in hong kong he himself 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.549
 told this to Chinese journalists 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.040

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.020
 about 3 months ago 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.960
 I did not disclose information before 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.430
 because I didn't want time 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.830
 dump a huge amount 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.630
 documents regardless of their content 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.070
 I had to check everything before 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.880
 spread information among 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.740
 of journalists 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.450

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.700
 on these frames, it is finally the wikileaks 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.830
 helped snowden and get from 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.720
 governments of ecuador whose protection is already 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.000
 use asange refugee documents 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.740

 passport canceled by american 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.310
 Ecuadorian authorities respectively 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.230
 the only state in which can 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.820
 go snowed and before that he can 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.160
 stay only in transit zones 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.110
 airports just such a zone all the same 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.640
 in Sheremetyevo he is about it 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.650
 told Vladimir Putin he is now with 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.840
 the visit of finland the head of state 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.770
 dotted i in the position of Russia 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.380
 about this question 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.410
 mister snowden really arrived at 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.600
 Moscow for us is a complete surprise 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.120
 he came as a transit passenger 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.569
 he does not need a visa not others 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.989
 of documents 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.999
 he so transit passengers has the right 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.379
 buy a ticket and fly wherever he wants 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:21.629
 does not cross state borders 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.579
 so he does not need any visa 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.310
 accusations against Russia this nonsense and 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.049
 bullshit he's like a transit passenger so 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.209
 transit hall and is still 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.189
 our special services never with 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.469
 mister did not work at home again and did not 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.510
 work today as far as possible 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:39.379
 issue 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.250
 wherever we can issue 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.319
 some foreign nationals 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.969
 only in the state with which we have 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.239
 there are relevant international 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:49.290
 extradition agreements with 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.120
 green regular place we have such 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.349
 there is no agreement in the Russian 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.299
 federation mister based 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.609

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.669
 did another if the whole rand 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.709
 mister assange which also requires to 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.329
 extradition also consider this criminal he 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.180
 also to mister snowden 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.730
 consider themselves human rights activists and fight 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.680
 for information distribution ask 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.989
 yourself you need to give these people 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.760
 to go to jail or not to 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.039
 anyway i personally would prefer not 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.769
 deal with similar questions because 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:24.409
 that's all what 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.409
 Piggy shave a little wool 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.919
 Mr. MÃ¼ller and Mr. Bortnikov 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.199
 let him do it 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.539
 I hope all this does not affect 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.470
 the nature of our relationship with 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:39.120
 Young something and hope our partners this 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.949
 will understand mister stone free man 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.120
 the faster he chooses the end point 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.639
 his stay will be the best and 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.949
 for us and for him so for today everything 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.229
 seemingly clear but snowden is known for his 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.720

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.669
