ingots and tinkers construct will do

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.499 
ingots and tinkers construct will do
that<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.460> know<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.200> do<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:26.360> but<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
that I know that you can do that but I

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.340 
that I know that you can do that but I
made<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.770> quick<00:01:28.950> mod<00:01:29.930> I've<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.200> released

made a very quick mod I've just released

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.219 
made a very quick mod I've just released
it<00:01:31.770> very<00:01:32.070> short<00:01:32.460> very<00:01:32.970> quick<00:01:33.360> utility<00:01:33.990> mud

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it very short very quick utility mud

TMG<00:01:39.210> do<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:40.110> sure<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:41.520> when<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.729> actually

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
TMG do for sure and when it actually

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.370 
TMG do for sure and when it actually
does<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.360> rather<00:01:42.479> than<00:01:42.659> replace<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.259> so

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
does is rather than replace of like so

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.870 
does is rather than replace of like so
you<00:01:43.439> see<00:01:43.560> here<00:01:43.740> we've<00:01:43.890> got<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.250> think<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.700> kind

mind<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.850> block<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.750> will<00:02:06.960> give<00:02:07.140> me<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
mind that block it will give me the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.859 
mind that block it will give me the
industrialcraft<00:02:08.009> versions<00:02:08.759> they'll<00:02:09.720> show

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
industrialcraft versions they'll show

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.369 
industrialcraft versions they'll show
you<00:02:09.929> an<00:02:10.020> example<00:02:10.280> this<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.550> tinkers<00:02:12.239> construct

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
you an example this is tinkers construct

you an example this is tinkers construct
copper

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
copper

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.110 
copper
it<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.489> now<00:02:14.870> district<00:02:15.870> craft<00:02:16.080> copper<00:02:17.030> look<00:02:18.030> at

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
it is now district craft copper look at

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.030 
it is now district craft copper look at
the<00:02:18.180> tin<00:02:18.420> know<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:18.900> it's<00:02:19.020> change<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.590> textures

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
the tin know so it's change the textures

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.890 
the tin know so it's change the textures
change<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:21.000> now<00:02:21.180> got<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.480> white<00:02:21.660> bit

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
change it's it's now got the white bit

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.640 
change it's it's now got the white bit
and<00:02:22.110> now<00:02:22.349> this<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.739> industrial<00:02:23.220> craft<00:02:23.540> and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
and now this is the industrial craft and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.190 
and now this is the industrial craft and
look<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:25.920> just<00:02:26.160> nicely<00:02:26.489> joined<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.810> stacks

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
look it's just nicely joined the stacks

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.250 
look it's just nicely joined the stacks
and<00:02:29.180> there<00:02:30.180> was<00:02:30.300> an<00:02:30.390> issue<00:02:30.510> we'll<00:02:31.140> have

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
and there was an issue we'll have

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.720 
and there was an issue we'll have
originally<00:02:31.680> trying<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.950> record<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.370> video<00:02:32.519> I

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
originally trying to record this video I

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.430 
originally trying to record this video I
found<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.150> tinkers<00:02:33.510> construct<00:02:33.540> actually

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
found that tinkers construct actually

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.199 
found that tinkers construct actually
broke<00:02:34.680> my<00:02:34.830> mind<00:02:35.040> because<00:02:35.340> things<00:02:35.519> in<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.970> bit<00:02:36.120> of

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
broke my mind because things in a bit of

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.750 
broke my mind because things in a bit of
a<00:02:36.269> peculiar<00:02:36.810> way<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.709> also<00:02:37.860> adds<00:02:38.099> in<00:02:38.340> gravel

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
a peculiar way it also adds in gravel

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.360 
a peculiar way it also adds in gravel
law<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.599> had<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.140> release<00:02:40.349> one<00:02:40.830> point<00:02:41.069> one

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
law so I had to release one point one

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.020 
law so I had to release one point one
like<00:02:41.849> two<00:02:42.840> hours<00:02:43.170> after<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.739> even<00:02:44.430> created<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
like two hours after I even created the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.050 
like two hours after I even created the
initial<00:02:45.480> thing<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:47.370> what<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.549> actually<00:02:47.700> does

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
initial thing and what it actually does

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.880 
initial thing and what it actually does
is<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.510> allows<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:48.959> exclude<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:49.739> I've

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
is this allows you to exclude it so I've

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.300 
is this allows you to exclude it so I've
told<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.610> for<00:02:51.269> copper<00:02:51.750> ore<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.230> tin<00:02:52.440> ore<00:02:52.620> to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
told it so for copper ore and tin ore to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.970 
told it so for copper ore and tin ore to
exclude<00:02:54.200> anything<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.350> matches<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.739> name

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
exclude anything that matches a name

exclude anything that matches a name
tinkers<00:02:56.430> construct<00:02:56.459> gravel<00:02:57.360> or<00:02:57.620> I'll<00:02:58.620> add<00:02:58.860> a

actually see an example of the

exclusions<00:03:05.580> but<00:03:06.269> see<00:03:06.420> if<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.780> mind<00:03:07.049> this<00:03:07.260> you'd

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
exclusions but see if I mind this you'd

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.160 
exclusions but see if I mind this you'd
expect<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.819> since<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.299> belongs<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.049> or

expect that since that belongs to the or

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.960 
expect that since that belongs to the or
dictionary<00:03:10.680> for<00:03:10.890> all<00:03:11.010> copper<00:03:11.459> you'd<00:03:11.610> expect

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
dictionary for all copper you'd expect

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.580 
dictionary for all copper you'd expect
that<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.269> give<00:03:12.390> me<00:03:12.540> industrial<00:03:13.019> craft<00:03:13.200> copper

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
that to give me industrial craft copper

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.780 
that to give me industrial craft copper
but<00:03:14.099> now<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.519> stays<00:03:14.940> as<00:03:15.269> gravel<00:03:15.599> ore<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.790> there

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
but now it stays as gravel ore and there

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.910 
but now it stays as gravel ore and there
you<00:03:17.880> go<00:03:18.060> if<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.930> was<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.230> then<00:03:19.380> switch<00:03:19.620> this

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
you go if I was to then switch this

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.050 
you go if I was to then switch this
around<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:21.290> all<00:03:22.290> copper<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.100> tin<00:03:23.250> ore<00:03:23.430> gave<00:03:23.730> me

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
around so all copper and tin ore gave me

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.180 
around so all copper and tin ore gave me

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.699

allow you to do it plus if you only have

the option of disabling or generation in
a<00:04:11.010> particular<00:04:11.310> mod<00:04:11.819> I<00:04:12.090> would<00:04:12.359> recommend<00:04:12.900> not

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
a particular mod I would recommend not

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.509 
a particular mod I would recommend not
doing<00:04:13.410> it<00:04:13.560> because<00:04:13.950> if<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.160> have<00:04:14.340> multiple

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
doing it because if you have multiple

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.490 
doing it because if you have multiple
months<00:04:14.940> needing<00:04:15.329> the<00:04:15.450> same<00:04:15.630> thing<00:04:15.900> then<00:04:16.380> you

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
months needing the same thing then you

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.870 
months needing the same thing then you
probably<00:04:16.769> need<00:04:17.190> that<00:04:18.120> amount<00:04:18.539> of<00:04:18.840> copper<00:04:19.229> you

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
probably need that amount of copper you

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.250 
probably need that amount of copper you
obviously<00:04:20.880> just<00:04:20.910> don't<00:04:21.269> want<00:04:21.479> it<00:04:21.570> taking<00:04:21.930> up<00:04:22.080> a

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
obviously just don't want it taking up a

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.080 
obviously just don't want it taking up a
 ton<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.800> space<00:04:23.039> in<00:04:23.099> the<00:04:23.370> inventory<00:04:23.789> so

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
 ton of space in the inventory so

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.690 
 ton of space in the inventory so
just<00:04:24.390> pick<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.810> generic<00:04:25.320> type<00:04:25.550> configure<00:04:26.550> it

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
just pick a generic type configure it

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.260 
just pick a generic type configure it
use<00:04:26.970> the

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
use the

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.360 
use the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
or dictionary name equals and then the

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.339 
or dictionary name equals and then the
mud<00:04:29.520> ID<00:04:29.729> and<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:30.300> will<00:04:30.449> replace<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.900> with<00:04:31.229> that

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
mud ID and it will replace it with that

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.110 
mud ID and it will replace it with that
muds<00:04:31.620> equivalent<00:04:32.129> again<00:04:32.490> there'll<00:04:32.789> be<00:04:32.819> a<00:04:32.910> link
