like a badass program but I noticed
there's<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.250> lot<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.700> volume<00:00:48.120> with<00:00:49.050> the

core lift is there any reason that on

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
on the dynamic work to increase your

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.859 
on the dynamic work to increase your

some mac set for work so anyone from a
125<00:01:43.380> rep<00:01:43.619> max<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:45.119> reason<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.689> don't

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
125 rep max and the reason we don't

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.960 
125 rep max and the reason we don't
really<00:01:46.380> want<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.860> focus<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.460> doing<00:01:47.729> a

repetitive ever work is because the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.249 
repetitive ever work is because the
number<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:50.579> reason<00:01:50.850> we<00:01:51.210> do<00:01:51.570> repetitive<00:01:51.960> ever

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
number one reason we do repetitive ever

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.490 
number one reason we do repetitive ever
work<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.490> swole<00:01:54.000> system<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.689> because<00:01:55.470> a

work in the swole system is because a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.039 
work in the swole system is because a
lot<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.009> people<00:01:56.189> when<00:01:57.060> doing<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.540> they<00:01:57.750> want

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
lot of people when doing that they want

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.249 
lot of people when doing that they want
to<00:01:58.229> induce<00:01:58.590> some<00:01:59.399> mom<00:01:59.670> some<00:02:00.119> growth<00:02:00.360> they<00:02:00.960> want

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.840 
to induce some mom some growth they want
some<00:02:01.439> hypertrophy<00:02:02.159> that's<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.520> number<00:02:02.759> one

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
some hypertrophy that's the number one

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.179 
some hypertrophy that's the number one
reason<00:02:03.119> really<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.439> add<00:02:04.590> repetitive

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
reason really that we add repetitive

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.140 
reason really that we add repetitive
ever<00:02:05.399> work<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.939> swole<00:02:06.210> system

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
ever work to the swole system

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.889 
ever work to the swole system
now<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.810> said<00:02:08.229> if<00:02:08.470> your<00:02:08.979> number<00:02:09.640> one<00:02:10.060> goal<00:02:10.570> is

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
now that said if your number one goal is

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.310 
now that said if your number one goal is
just<00:02:10.960> to<00:02:11.790> explode<00:02:12.790> with<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.120> bench<00:02:13.510> put<00:02:14.290> a

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
just to explode with the bench put a

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.140 
just to explode with the bench put a
bunch<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.980> weight<00:02:15.100> up<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.520> that's<00:02:15.670> all<00:02:15.940> you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
bunch of weight up and that's all you

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.480 
bunch of weight up and that's all you
care<00:02:16.390> about<00:02:16.450> then<00:02:17.290> we're<00:02:17.500> gonna<00:02:17.710> pretty<00:02:18.400> much

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
care about then we're gonna pretty much

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.910 
care about then we're gonna pretty much
just<00:02:18.850> push<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:19.870> repetitive<00:02:20.260> effort<00:02:20.710> work

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
just push that repetitive effort work

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.220 
just push that repetitive effort work
away<00:02:21.310> because<00:02:21.610> that's<00:02:22.060> not<00:02:22.270> our<00:02:22.450> goal<00:02:22.690> it's

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
away because that's not our goal it's

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.900 
away because that's not our goal it's
not<00:02:23.440> really<00:02:23.710> going<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.010> be<00:02:24.250> what<00:02:24.580> we're<00:02:24.730> trying

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
not really going to be what we're trying

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.610 
not really going to be what we're trying
to<00:02:25.030> focus<00:02:25.240> on<00:02:25.540> we're<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:26.020> trying<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.440> focus

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
to focus on we're just trying to focus

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.750 
to focus on we're just trying to focus
on<00:02:26.920> building<00:02:27.790> as<00:02:28.150> much<00:02:28.510> on<00:02:28.870> no<00:02:29.800> putting<00:02:30.490> on<00:02:30.640> as

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
on building as much on no putting on as

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.150 
on building as much on no putting on as
much<00:02:30.970> weight<00:02:31.030> as<00:02:31.300> possible<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:32.020> that<00:02:32.200> bitch<00:02:32.470> so

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
much weight as possible on that bitch so

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.860 
much weight as possible on that bitch so
you<00:02:33.670> need<00:02:33.820> to<00:02:33.910> learn<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.090> separate<00:02:34.630> those<00:02:34.810> two

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
you need to learn to separate those two

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.260 
you need to learn to separate those two
goals<00:02:35.380> if<00:02:35.710> your<00:02:36.160> goal<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.640> put<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.030> some

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
goals if your goal is to put on some

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.080 
goals if your goal is to put on some
size<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.840> yeah<00:02:38.020> add<00:02:38.320> some<00:02:39.160> repetitive<00:02:39.610> F<00:02:39.940> for

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
size and yeah add some repetitive F for

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.240 
size and yeah add some repetitive F for
work<00:02:40.270> but<00:02:40.600> if<00:02:40.720> it's<00:02:40.870> not<00:02:41.080> if<00:02:41.350> it's<00:02:41.440> truly<00:02:41.920> just

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
work but if it's not if it's truly just

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.790 
work but if it's not if it's truly just
to<00:02:42.400> get<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:43.090> big<00:02:43.570> bench<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.350> will<00:02:44.500> let<00:02:44.650> you

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
to get that big bench that will let you

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.220 
to get that big bench that will let you
embarrass<00:02:44.920> all<00:02:45.580> those<00:02:45.730> douchebags<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.660> give

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
embarrass all those douchebags that give

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.949 
embarrass all those douchebags that give
bench-pressing<00:02:47.770> a<00:02:48.130> bad<00:02:48.370> name<00:02:48.760> then<00:02:49.300> yes<00:02:49.660> all

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
bench-pressing a bad name then yes all

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.810 
bench-pressing a bad name then yes all
you<00:02:50.230> need<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.410> really<00:02:50.590> focus<00:02:50.830> on<00:02:51.160> is<00:02:51.400> the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
you need to really focus on is the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.330 
you need to really focus on is the
dynamic<00:02:52.120> effort<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.140> mac<00:02:53.680> set<00:02:53.950> for<00:02:54.130> work

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
dynamic effort and the mac set for work

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.160 
dynamic effort and the mac set for work
now<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.820> told<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.330> I<00:02:55.390> was<00:02:55.480> going<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.690> talk<00:02:55.990> about

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
now I told you I was going to talk about

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.710 
now I told you I was going to talk about
on<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.620> difference<00:02:57.610> between<00:02:57.670> beginners<00:02:58.450> and

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
on the difference between beginners and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.720 
on the difference between beginners and
kind<00:02:59.050> of<00:02:59.140> seasoned<00:02:59.470> veterans<00:02:59.890> with<00:03:00.130> with

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
kind of seasoned veterans with with

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.690 
kind of seasoned veterans with with
lifting<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.420> benching<00:03:02.320> for<00:03:02.620> for<00:03:03.220> maximal

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
lifting and benching for for maximal

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.610 
lifting and benching for for maximal
weight<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.120> then<00:03:04.600> what<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.290> want<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.530> talk

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
weight and then what I want to talk

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.910 
weight and then what I want to talk
about<00:03:05.680> is<00:03:05.920> this<00:03:06.160> if<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:07.270> are<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.660> beginner<00:03:08.080> I'm

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
about is this if you are a beginner I'm

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.080 
about is this if you are a beginner I'm
going<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.280> actually<00:03:09.430> tell<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:09.970> do<00:03:10.060> a

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
going to actually tell you to do a

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.430 
going to actually tell you to do a
little<00:03:10.300> bit<00:03:10.420> differently<00:03:10.750> than<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:10.990> just<00:03:11.260> said

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
little bit differently than I just said

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.009 
little bit differently than I just said
I'm<00:03:11.890> going<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.190> tell<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.550> get<00:03:12.790> rid<00:03:13.209> of<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
I'm going to tell you to get rid of the

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.410 
I'm going to tell you to get rid of the
dynamic<00:03:14.620> effort<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.070> instead<00:03:15.610> put

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
dynamic effort and instead put

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.600 
dynamic effort and instead put
repetitive<00:03:17.170> effort<00:03:17.470> in<00:03:17.650> its<00:03:17.830> place<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.489> the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
repetitive effort in its place and the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.940 
repetitive effort in its place and the
reason<00:03:18.850> being<00:03:19.060> is<00:03:19.420> we<00:03:19.930> need<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.260> build<00:03:20.650> some

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
reason being is we need to build some

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.610 
reason being is we need to build some
mom<00:03:21.670> some<00:03:22.030> work<00:03:22.239> capacity<00:03:22.480> for<00:03:23.080> you<00:03:23.170> so<00:03:23.350> you're

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
mom some work capacity for you so you're

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.170 
mom some work capacity for you so you're
just<00:03:23.739> going<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.070> basically<00:03:24.190> take<00:03:24.760> out<00:03:25.000> that

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
just going to basically take out that

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.530 
just going to basically take out that
dynamic<00:03:25.690> work<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.140> put<00:03:27.040> in<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.540> repetitive

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
dynamic work and put in the repetitive

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.300 
dynamic work and put in the repetitive
that<00:03:28.630> for<00:03:28.810> work<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.530> can<00:03:29.739> build<00:03:30.010> that<00:03:30.130> work

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
that for work so you can build that work

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.790 
that for work so you can build that work
capacity<00:03:30.489> but<00:03:30.940> also<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:32.019> know<00:03:32.110> get<00:03:32.350> some<00:03:32.560> some

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
capacity but also you know get some some

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.500 
capacity but also you know get some some
max<00:03:33.010> effort<00:03:33.340> working<00:03:33.489> there<00:03:33.760> as<00:03:33.850> well<00:03:34.030> as<00:03:34.209> long

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
max effort working there as well as long

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.050 
max effort working there as well as long
as<00:03:34.720> their<00:03:34.870> form<00:03:35.140> is<00:03:35.350> good<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:36.489> know<00:03:36.580> once

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
as their form is good so you know once

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.240 
as their form is good so you know once
you<00:03:37.180> do<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.300> um<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.650> build<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:38.950> work

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
you do that um you build that work

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.130 
you do that um you build that work
capacity<00:03:39.400> then<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.060> can<00:03:40.180> kind<00:03:40.300> of<00:03:40.450> shift<00:03:40.690> into

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
capacity then you can kind of shift into

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.979 
capacity then you can kind of shift into
just<00:03:41.590> sticking<00:03:42.489> with<00:03:42.519> dynamic<00:03:43.330> and<00:03:43.540> Mac<00:03:43.720> set

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
just sticking with dynamic and Mac set

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.680 
just sticking with dynamic and Mac set

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
you're just focusing on those dynamic

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.979 
you're just focusing on those dynamic
effort<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.680> maximal<00:03:57.459> up<00:03:57.580> their<00:03:57.760> days<00:03:58.030> does

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
effort and maximal up their days does

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.990 
effort and maximal up their days does
not<00:03:59.320> mean<00:03:59.680> you're<00:03:59.920> not<00:04:00.070> going<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.519> have<00:04:00.700> some

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
not mean you're not going to have some

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.810 
not mean you're not going to have some
residual<00:04:01.799> hypertrophy<00:04:02.799> some<00:04:03.250> residual

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
residual hypertrophy some residual

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.390 
residual hypertrophy some residual
muscular<00:04:04.540> growth<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.019> reason<00:04:05.920> being<00:04:05.950> is

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
muscular growth and the reason being is

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.570 
muscular growth and the reason being is
this<00:04:06.610> number<00:04:07.150> one<00:04:07.390> with<00:04:07.660> Mac<00:04:07.900> set<00:04:08.170> for<00:04:08.320> work

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
this number one with Mac set for work

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.280 
this number one with Mac set for work
you're<00:04:09.580> going<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.120> stimulate<00:04:10.450> some<00:04:11.019> growth

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
you're going to stimulate some growth

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.830 
you're going to stimulate some growth
hormone<00:04:11.709> testosterone<00:04:12.480> which<00:04:13.480> will<00:04:13.720> allow

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
hormone testosterone which will allow

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.520 
hormone testosterone which will allow
you<00:04:14.110> to<00:04:14.820> get<00:04:15.820> big<00:04:16.060> get<00:04:16.389> jacked<00:04:16.720> all<00:04:17.139> right<00:04:17.320> not

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
you to get big get jacked all right not

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.069 
you to get big get jacked all right not
only<00:04:17.560> that<00:04:18.120> afterwards<00:04:19.120> when<00:04:19.420> we're<00:04:19.600> filling

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
only that afterwards when we're filling

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:20.920 
only that afterwards when we're filling
in<00:04:20.170> the<00:04:20.260> gaps

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
in the gaps

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.620 
in the gaps
when<00:04:21.229> we're<00:04:21.470> on<00:04:21.699> basically<00:04:22.699> you<00:04:23.419> know

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
when we're on basically you know

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.110 
when we're on basically you know
patching<00:04:24.470> up<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.889> leaks<00:04:25.160> so<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.520> say<00:04:25.759> with<00:04:26.000> our

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
patching up the leaks so to say with our

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.150 
patching up the leaks so to say with our
weak<00:04:26.360> points<00:04:26.810> our<00:04:26.960> supplemental<00:04:27.500> work<00:04:27.860> it's

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
weak points our supplemental work it's

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.050 
weak points our supplemental work it's
going<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:29.060> be<00:04:29.150> higher<00:04:29.620> volume<00:04:30.620> okay<00:04:31.100> so<00:04:31.160> what

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
going to be higher volume okay so what

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.670 
going to be higher volume okay so what
will<00:04:32.240> that<00:04:32.270> do<00:04:32.630> when<00:04:33.259> the<00:04:33.410> type<00:04:33.650> of

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
will that do when the type of

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.100 
will that do when the type of
supplemental<00:04:34.400> work<00:04:34.550> we<00:04:34.759> do<00:04:35.060> multi<00:04:35.840> joint

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
supplemental work we do multi joint

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.110 
supplemental work we do multi joint
movements<00:04:36.770> high<00:04:37.039> volume<00:04:37.580> what<00:04:37.789> is<00:04:37.880> that<00:04:37.970> going

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
movements high volume what is that going

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.779 
movements high volume what is that going
to<00:04:38.330> do<00:04:38.449> it's<00:04:38.930> going<00:04:39.080> to<00:04:39.530> induce<00:04:39.860> hypertrophy

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
to do it's going to induce hypertrophy

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.879 
to do it's going to induce hypertrophy
so<00:04:41.449> it's<00:04:41.960> not<00:04:42.229> going<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.560> have<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.860> same

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
so it's not going to have the same

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.040 
so it's not going to have the same
effect<00:04:43.430> as<00:04:43.820> doing<00:04:44.180> repetitive<00:04:44.449> effort<00:04:44.840> days

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
effect as doing repetitive effort days

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.499 
effect as doing repetitive effort days
but<00:04:45.710> you'll<00:04:45.919> still<00:04:46.160> get<00:04:46.520> some<00:04:46.699> hypertrophy<00:04:47.300> if

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
but you'll still get some hypertrophy if

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.020 
but you'll still get some hypertrophy if
you're<00:04:47.960> just<00:04:48.350> doing<00:04:48.800> bench<00:04:49.430> like<00:04:49.699> a<00:04:49.729> badass

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
you're just doing bench like a badass

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.200 
you're just doing bench like a badass
program<00:04:50.720> so<00:04:51.020> hopefully<00:04:51.770> that<00:04:51.949> helps<00:04:51.979> on<00:04:52.610> if

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
program so hopefully that helps on if

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.719 
program so hopefully that helps on if
