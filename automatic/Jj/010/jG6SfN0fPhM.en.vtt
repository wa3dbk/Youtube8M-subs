in<00:00:00.329> this<00:00:00.719> clip<00:00:00.989> we're<00:00:01.140> going<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.290> talk<00:00:01.500> about

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
in this clip we're going to talk about

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.070 
in this clip we're going to talk about
staining<00:00:02.190> wood<00:00:02.550> with<00:00:02.879> gel<00:00:03.389> stain

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
staining wood with gel stain

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.110 
staining wood with gel stain
we've<00:00:04.529> talked<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.920> little<00:00:05.009> bit<00:00:05.250> already<00:00:06.000> about

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
we've talked a little bit already about

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.150 
we've talked a little bit already about
oil<00:00:06.480> oil<00:00:06.839> based<00:00:07.109> stains<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.859> water-based

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
oil oil based stains and water-based

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.790 
oil oil based stains and water-based
stains<00:00:08.730> now<00:00:08.970> gel<00:00:09.300> stain<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.870> an<00:00:10.469> oil-based

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
stains now gel stain is an oil-based

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.370 
stains now gel stain is an oil-based
stain<00:00:11.219> but<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.639> differs<00:00:11.849> from<00:00:12.330> your<00:00:12.900> standard

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380

too much into the technical reasons of

too much into the technical reasons of
why<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.460> does<00:00:23.670> what<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.970> does<00:00:24.150> but<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.810> suffice

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
why it does what it does but it suffice

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.500 
why it does what it does but it suffice
to<00:00:25.320> say<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.740> general<00:00:26.070> terms<00:00:26.580> gel<00:00:27.180> stain

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
to say in general terms gel stain

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.900 
to say in general terms gel stain
doesn't<00:00:27.750> penetrate<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.590> deeply<00:00:29.519> into<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
doesn't penetrate is deeply into the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.630 
doesn't penetrate is deeply into the
wood<00:00:30.119> as<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> regular<00:00:30.949> oil-based<00:00:31.949> stain<00:00:32.189> does

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
wood as a regular oil-based stain does

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.180 
wood as a regular oil-based stain does
but<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:34.020> should<00:00:34.230> experiment<00:00:34.649> with<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.160> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
but you should experiment with it and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.830 
but you should experiment with it and
see<00:00:35.280> how<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.730> works<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.300> let's<00:00:36.570> let's

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
see how it works for you let's let's

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.470 
see how it works for you let's let's
take<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> look<00:00:37.290> at<00:00:37.380> how<00:00:37.559> gel<00:00:38.550> stain<00:00:38.910> works<00:00:39.239> with

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
take a look at how gel stain works with

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.190 
take a look at how gel stain works with
various<00:00:39.870> woods<00:00:41.390> first<00:00:42.390> things<00:00:42.660> first<00:00:42.750> you're

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
various woods first things first you're

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.380 
various woods first things first you're
going<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> want<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.770> stir<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.430> gel<00:00:45.090> stain

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
going to want to stir your gel stain

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.740 
going to want to stir your gel stain
very<00:00:45.440> thoroughly<00:00:46.610> because<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:48.000> will<00:00:48.180> separate

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
very thoroughly because it will separate

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
very thoroughly because it will separate
even<00:00:49.050> even<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:50.780> extremely<00:00:51.780> than<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.170> regular

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
even even more extremely than a regular

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.779 
even even more extremely than a regular
oil<00:00:53.219> stain<00:00:53.610> will<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> give<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> good<00:00:55.739> stir<00:00:56.309> up

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.910 

and<00:00:59.789> well<00:01:00.030> let's<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.420> look-see<00:01:01.260> at<00:01:01.590> how<00:01:01.739> it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and well let's have a look-see at how it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.740 
and well let's have a look-see at how it
applies<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.370> different<00:01:03.149> species<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.690> wood

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
applies to different species of wood

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.450 
applies to different species of wood
here<00:01:06.750> we're<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> apply<00:01:07.380> some<00:01:07.409> gel<00:01:07.740> stain

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
here we're going to apply some gel stain

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.700 
here we're going to apply some gel stain
to<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> piece<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.600> pine<00:01:09.900> again<00:01:10.799> using<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
to a piece of pine again using the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.200 
to a piece of pine again using the
circular<00:01:13.729> motion<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.259> rub<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.409> across<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
circular motion to rub it across the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.160 
circular motion to rub it across the
grain<00:01:19.790> as<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> gel<00:01:21.720> stain<00:01:22.020> is

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
grain as you can see the gel stain is

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.840 
grain as you can see the gel stain is
much<00:01:22.350> thicker<00:01:22.680> than<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.159> regular<00:01:24.140> stain<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
much thicker than the regular stain and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.240 
much thicker than the regular stain and
just<00:01:26.850> clings<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.720> surface<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:29.189> you

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
just clings to the surface so you

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.920 
just clings to the surface so you
definitely<00:01:29.490> want<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> make<00:01:30.240> sure<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
definitely want to make sure that you

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
definitely want to make sure that you
wipe<00:01:31.680> off<00:01:32.540> as<00:01:33.540> much<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.170> excess<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
wipe off as much of that excess as you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.810 
wipe off as much of that excess as you
possibly<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.729> now<00:01:36.979> some<00:01:37.979> folks<00:01:38.189> find<00:01:38.549> that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
possibly can now some folks find that

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.730 
possibly can now some folks find that
the<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.750> gel<00:01:40.049> stain<00:01:41.720> sort<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.840> similarly<00:01:43.500> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the the gel stain sort of similarly to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.289 
the the gel stain sort of similarly to
the<00:01:44.390> water-based<00:01:45.390> stain<00:01:45.780> does<00:01:46.079> not<00:01:47.299> creates

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the water-based stain does not creates

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.600 
the water-based stain does not creates
quite<00:01:48.659> as<00:01:48.810> much<00:01:48.990> blotching<00:01:49.710> with<00:01:49.979> soft<00:01:50.310> woods

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
quite as much blotching with soft woods

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.469 
quite as much blotching with soft woods
such<00:01:50.820> as<00:01:51.000> pine<00:01:52.700> as<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.180> that's<00:01:54.329> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
such as pine as you can see that's a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.830 
such as pine as you can see that's a
pretty<00:01:54.720> pretty<00:01:55.140> even<00:01:55.530> consistent<00:01:56.600> stain<00:01:57.600> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
pretty pretty even consistent stain and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.130 
pretty pretty even consistent stain and
I<00:01:57.899> did<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.259> condition<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.860> wood
