00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.820 

now<00:01:49.720> we're<00:01:49.870> going<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.050> place<00:01:50.260> this<00:01:50.440> under<00:01:50.620> the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
now we're going to place this under the

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.370 
now we're going to place this under the
broiler<00:01:51.070> let<00:01:52.060> it<00:01:52.180> brown<00:01:52.450> take<00:01:53.080> it<00:01:53.230> out<00:01:53.350> and

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
broiler let it brown take it out and

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.510 
broiler let it brown take it out and
then<00:01:53.560> brush<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:55.290> well<00:01:56.290> guess<00:01:56.470> what<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.980> changed

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
then brush it well guess what I changed

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.490 
then brush it well guess what I changed
my<00:01:57.580> mind<00:01:57.820> about<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.180> broiler<00:01:58.570> this<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.290> going

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
my mind about the broiler this is going

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.470 
my mind about the broiler this is going
to<00:01:59.560> fit<00:01:59.740> into<00:01:59.920> my<00:02:00.160> toaster<00:02:00.640> which<00:02:01.210> is<00:02:01.360> the

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
to fit into my toaster which is the

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.410 
to fit into my toaster which is the
easiest<00:02:01.960> way<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.260> go<00:02:02.790> when<00:02:03.790> I<00:02:03.970> have<00:02:04.120> a<00:02:04.150> piece<00:02:04.390> of

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
easiest way to go when I have a piece of

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.350 
easiest way to go when I have a piece of
bread<00:02:05.350> that's<00:02:05.470> nicely<00:02:05.920> toast<00:02:06.400> nice<00:02:06.730> color<00:02:07.090> and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
bread that's nicely toast nice color and

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.320 
bread that's nicely toast nice color and
all<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.200> have<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.530> do<00:02:08.679> now<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.130> add<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:09.910> flavor

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
all you have to do now is add the flavor

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.440 
all you have to do now is add the flavor
then<00:02:10.990> why<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.290> salt<00:02:12.000> because<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.210> slope

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
then why the salt because the slope

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.980 
then why the salt because the slope
brings<00:02:13.720> out<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.020> flavor<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.700> everything
