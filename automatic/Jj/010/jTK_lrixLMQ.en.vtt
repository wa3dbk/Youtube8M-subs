however<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.290> want<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.439> say<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.979> then

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
however you want to say that and then

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.840 
however you want to say that and then
going<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.689> depth<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.020> 99<00:01:34.860> firemaking<00:01:35.130> is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
going in depth with 99 firemaking is

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.580 
going in depth with 99 firemaking is
obviously<00:01:36.390> significant<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> me<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.200> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
obviously significant to me because it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.670 
obviously significant to me because it
was<00:01:37.619> my<00:01:37.799> first<00:01:38.040> 99<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.000> ever<00:01:39.180> got<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.810> so

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
was my first 99 that I ever got and so

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.350 
was my first 99 that I ever got and so
that's<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.369> reason<00:01:41.610> why<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.759> went<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.180> depth

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
that's the reason why I went so in depth

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.740 
that's the reason why I went so in depth
with<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.869> then<00:01:42.990> um<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.790> got<00:01:44.790> mining<00:01:45.630> which

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
with that and then um I got mining which

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.270 
with that and then um I got mining which
I<00:01:45.869> meant<00:01:46.020> pretty<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.290> depth<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.560> which<00:01:47.009> is

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
I meant pretty in depth with which is

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.920 
I meant pretty in depth with which is
because<00:01:47.700> that's<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.149> first<00:01:48.390> skill<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> ever

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
because that's the first skill I ever

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.499 
because that's the first skill I ever
started<00:01:49.259> training<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.770> runescape<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.640> so

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
started training on runescape and so

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.230 
started training on runescape and so
obviously<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.110> one's<00:01:52.290> gonna<00:01:52.409> be<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> bit<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.860> a

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
obviously that one's gonna be a bit of a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.609 
obviously that one's gonna be a bit of a
significance<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:54.600> also<00:01:54.750> runecrafting

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
significance and then also runecrafting

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.280 
significance and then also runecrafting
I<00:01:56.210> kinda<00:01:57.210> went<00:01:57.299> in-depth<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.780> not<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.140> much

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
I kinda went in-depth with not so much

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.219 
I kinda went in-depth with not so much
because<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.250> uh<00:01:59.460> it<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.630> was<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> great

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
because it's just uh it it was a great

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.780 
because it's just uh it it was a great
skill<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.950> my<00:02:02.009> favorite<00:02:02.340> skills<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.759> I

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
skill is one of my favorite skills and I

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.190 
skill is one of my favorite skills and I
trade<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:03.659> at<00:02:04.140> least<00:02:04.170> uh<00:02:05.750> six<00:02:06.750> months

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
trade it for like at least uh six months

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.400 
trade it for like at least uh six months
or<00:02:07.590> something<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.539> I<00:02:09.539> was<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.869> grinding<00:02:10.140> it

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
or something and I was just grinding it

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.140 
or something and I was just grinding it
out<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.009> was<00:02:11.160> one<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.459> those<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.940> like

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
out and so it was one of those that like

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.700 
out and so it was one of those that like
took<00:02:12.330> up<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.540> lot<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.810> time

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
took up a lot of time

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.270 
took up a lot of time
as<00:02:13.800> far<00:02:14.190> as<00:02:14.220> me<00:02:14.970> playing<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.600> game<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:16.980> solely

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
as far as me playing a game just solely

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.160 
as far as me playing a game just solely
for<00:02:17.550> runecrafting<00:02:17.850> like<00:02:18.540> i<00:02:18.660> said<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.020> reason

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
for runecrafting like i said the reason

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.350 
for runecrafting like i said the reason
why<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.710> was<00:02:20.040> kind<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.490> felt<00:02:21.000> like<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.270> was

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
why it was kind of felt like it was

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.600 
why it was kind of felt like it was
rushed<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.750> kind<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.140> short<00:02:22.440> one<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.040> because

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
rushed to kind of a short one is because

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.430 
rushed to kind of a short one is because
like<00:02:23.880> i<00:02:24.000> said<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.480> everything<00:02:25.050> eventually

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
like i said just everything eventually

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.140 
like i said just everything eventually
just<00:02:25.890> gets<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.460> point<00:02:26.580> where<00:02:26.880> it's<00:02:27.030> like

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
just gets to the point where it's like

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.700 
just gets to the point where it's like
everything<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:27.930> kind<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.290> same<00:02:28.440> there's

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
everything is kind of the same there's

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.320 
everything is kind of the same there's
not<00:02:28.830> really<00:02:28.980> nothing<00:02:29.340> important<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.760> tell<00:02:30.060> and

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
not really nothing important to tell and

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.000 
not really nothing important to tell and
it's<00:02:30.900> kind<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.080> hard<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.290> make<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.470> story<00:02:31.800> out<00:02:31.920> of

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
it's kind of hard to make a story out of

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.570 
it's kind of hard to make a story out of
something<00:02:32.280> like<00:02:32.610> herb<00:02:33.300> or<00:02:33.600> like<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.370> don't<00:02:35.370> know

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
something like herb or like I don't know

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.220 
something like herb or like I don't know
hunter<00:02:36.090> where<00:02:36.300> you're<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.450> doing<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.110> same

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
hunter where you're just doing the same

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.960 
hunter where you're just doing the same
thing<00:02:37.500> over<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.830> over<00:02:37.980> for<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.580> month<00:02:38.820> or

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
thing over and over for like a month or

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.690 
thing over and over for like a month or
two<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.900> being<00:02:40.050> said<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.950> am

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
two but that being said I am

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.420 
two but that being said I am
transitioning<00:02:42.570> into<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.170> combat<00:02:43.620> phase<00:02:44.220> of

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
transitioning into the combat phase of

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.760 
transitioning into the combat phase of
the<00:02:44.490> story<00:02:44.730> which<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.810> great<00:02:46.050> because<00:02:46.260> there's

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
the story which is great because there's

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.260 
the story which is great because there's
a<00:02:46.830> lot<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.130> things<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.520> can<00:02:47.670> do<00:02:47.790> with<00:02:47.880> combat

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
a lot of things you can do with combat

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.300 
a lot of things you can do with combat
as<00:02:48.450> far<00:02:48.660> as<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.230> can<00:02:49.380> go<00:02:49.500> bossing<00:02:50.130> you

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
as far as like you can go bossing you

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.310 
as far as like you can go bossing you
can<00:02:50.520> train<00:02:51.060> Slayer<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.750> know<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.930> can<00:02:52.110> train

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
can train Slayer you know you can train

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.130 
can train Slayer you know you can train
all<00:02:52.470> these<00:02:52.620> other<00:02:52.740> stats<00:02:53.100> do<00:02:53.610> um<00:02:54.140> minigames

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
all these other stats do um minigames

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.160 
all these other stats do um minigames
everything<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.300> kind<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.840> gives<00:02:57.960> me

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
everything and so it kind of gives me

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.700 
everything and so it kind of gives me
another<00:02:59.330> another<00:03:00.330> couple<00:03:00.990> stories<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.530> tell

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
another another couple stories to tell

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.650 
another another couple stories to tell
and<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.280> can<00:03:02.490> sort<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:02.850> progress<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.600> story

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
and I can sort of progress the story

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.530 
and I can sort of progress the story
further<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:05.070> also<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.610> top<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.120> the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
further but also on top of that the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.690 
further but also on top of that the
stories<00:03:06.930> are<00:03:06.960> a<00:03:07.530> little<00:03:07.590> bit<00:03:08.070> of<00:03:08.190> losing<00:03:08.580> their

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
stories are a little bit of losing their

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.900 
stories are a little bit of losing their
novelty<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:09.360> me<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:10.200> was<00:03:10.470> fun<00:03:10.800> at<00:03:11.100> first<00:03:11.160> but

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
novelty on me it was fun at first but

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.220 
novelty on me it was fun at first but
now<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.390> just<00:03:12.420> kind<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.780> feels<00:03:12.930> like<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.170> chore

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
now it just kind of feels like a chore

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.860 
now it just kind of feels like a chore
to<00:03:13.560> me<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.920> uh<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:14.970> know<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.120> still<00:03:15.540> enjoyed

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
to me and uh you know I still enjoyed

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.380 
to me and uh you know I still enjoyed
doing<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.380> it's<00:03:16.670> just<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.730> whole<00:03:17.910> pictures

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
doing it it's just the whole pictures

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.090 
doing it it's just the whole pictures
part<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.870> because<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.440> takes<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.740> really

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
part of it because it takes a really
