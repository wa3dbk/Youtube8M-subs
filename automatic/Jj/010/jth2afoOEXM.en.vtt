here's the K clean cozy the KT clean and
cozy<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:22.979> paper<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.119> Aspen<00:01:24.420> which<00:01:24.570> he

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
cozy is paper and the Aspen which he

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.289 
cozy is paper and the Aspen which he
needs<00:01:24.869> obviously<00:01:25.110> wood<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:27.270> wood

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
needs obviously wood and the wood

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.390 
needs obviously wood and the wood
shavings<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> lot<00:01:28.229> rougher<00:01:28.500> than<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
shavings are a lot rougher than the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.249 
shavings are a lot rougher than the
Canadian<00:01:29.880> color<00:01:30.090> which<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.570> soft<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
Canadian color which is really soft and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469 
Canadian color which is really soft and
the<00:01:31.740> teeny<00:01:31.950> clean<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.340> cozy<00:01:32.640> does<00:01:32.820> expand<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
the teeny clean and cozy does expand a

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.330 
the teeny clean and cozy does expand a
lot<00:01:33.780> more<00:01:33.990> than<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> Aspen<00:01:34.590> wood<00:01:34.710> shavings<00:01:35.130> do

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
lot more than the Aspen wood shavings do

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.109 
lot more than the Aspen wood shavings do
so<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:35.970> would<00:01:36.119> recommend<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:38.119> paper

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
so I would recommend that the paper

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.170 
so I would recommend that the paper
bedding<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.869> hamster<00:01:40.259> loves<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.740> burrow

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
bedding if your hamster loves to burrow

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.030 
bedding if your hamster loves to burrow
and<00:01:42.180> then<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.899> Asamoah<00:01:43.409> cheating's<00:01:43.829> I

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
and then the Asamoah cheating's I

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.010 
and then the Asamoah cheating's I
wouldn't<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.399> recommend<00:01:44.509> putting<00:01:45.509> Aspen

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
wouldn't really recommend putting Aspen

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.999 
wouldn't really recommend putting Aspen
wood<00:01:46.110> shavings<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:46.649> throughout<00:01:46.890> your

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
hamsters whole entire cage I would

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
hamsters whole entire cage I would
recommend<00:01:49.320> doing<00:01:49.409> half<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> KT<00:01:50.430> clean<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
recommend doing half of the KT clean and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.760 
recommend doing half of the KT clean and
cozy<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.509> setting<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.869> your<00:01:52.049> hamsters

chew<00:02:01.259> toy<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.829> chew<00:02:02.040> toys<00:02:02.250> don't<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:02.670> all

burrowed<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.390> your<00:02:03.509> hipster<00:02:03.780> burrows

burrowed up on your hipster burrows

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.319 
burrowed up on your hipster burrows
because<00:02:04.890> most<00:02:05.130> likely<00:02:05.280> your<00:02:05.670> hamster<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.210> you

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
because most likely your hamster if you

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.330 
because most likely your hamster if you
do<00:02:06.540> happen<00:02:06.689> half<00:02:07.020> will<00:02:07.229> choose<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.039> Katy

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
do happen half will choose the Katy

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.520 
do happen half will choose the Katy
clean<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.670> cozy<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> burrow<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:10.410> that's

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
clean and cozy to burrow in so that's

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.290 
clean and cozy to burrow in so that's
why<00:02:10.830> it'd<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:11.129> good<00:02:11.250> idea

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
why it'd be good idea

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.330 
why it'd be good idea
but<00:02:12.390> your<00:02:12.540> food<00:02:12.720> ball<00:02:12.960> and<00:02:13.170> chew<00:02:13.560> toys<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:14.070> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
but your food ball and chew toys on the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.370 
but your food ball and chew toys on the
aspen<00:02:14.670> wood<00:02:14.760> sheathing<00:02:15.000> side<00:02:15.390> but<00:02:15.960> using<00:02:16.260> your

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
aspen wood sheathing side but using your

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.000 
aspen wood sheathing side but using your
hamster<00:02:16.680> burrows<00:02:17.420> she<00:02:18.420> kicks<00:02:18.720> bedding<00:02:19.320> into

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
hamster burrows she kicks bedding into

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.400 
hamster burrows she kicks bedding into
the<00:02:20.400> food<00:02:20.970> bolt<00:02:21.240> which<00:02:21.390> isn't<00:02:21.540> good<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.020> also

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
the food bolt which isn't good and also

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.860 
the food bolt which isn't good and also
she<00:02:23.130> will<00:02:23.400> most<00:02:23.730> likely<00:02:23.850> burrow<00:02:24.300> her<00:02:24.600> chew

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
she will most likely burrow her chew

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.740 
she will most likely burrow her chew
toys<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.920> that's<00:02:26.250> why<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.910> really<00:02:27.300> do<00:02:27.540> recommend

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
toys so that's why I really do recommend

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.570 
toys so that's why I really do recommend
doing<00:02:28.140> half<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.560> half<00:02:28.740> it<00:02:28.890> just<00:02:29.100> works<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.430> lot

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
doing half and half it just works a lot

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.000 
doing half and half it just works a lot
better<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.210> I<00:02:30.450> think<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.810> does<00:02:31.080> like<00:02:31.560> actually

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
better and I think it does like actually

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.530 
better and I think it does like actually
will<00:02:32.160> look<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.490> lot<00:02:32.670> better<00:02:32.730> than<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.420> one

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
will look a lot better than just one

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.050 
will look a lot better than just one
full<00:02:34.440> kind<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.920> bedding<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.430> your<00:02:35.700> hamsters

inches and it expands to 1,700 cubic

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.390 
inches and it expands to 1,700 cubic
inches<00:04:51.500> which<00:04:51.740> is<00:04:51.770> really<00:04:52.189> good<00:04:52.340> so<00:04:54.189> yeah<00:04:55.189> and

1,200 cubic inches this one I see you

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.290 
1,200 cubic inches this one I see you
can<00:05:06.169> obviously<00:05:06.530> tell<00:05:06.740> by<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.250> numbers<00:05:08.120> this

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
can obviously tell by the numbers this

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.180 
can obviously tell by the numbers this
one<00:05:08.449> expands<00:05:08.900> a<00:05:08.990> lot<00:05:09.199> more<00:05:09.409> than<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.830> s<00:05:09.949> and

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
one expands a lot more than the s and

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.459 
one expands a lot more than the s and
what<00:05:10.310> she<00:05:10.460> thinks<00:05:10.610> so<00:05:11.509> basically<00:05:11.900> that<00:05:12.139> is<00:05:12.349> the
