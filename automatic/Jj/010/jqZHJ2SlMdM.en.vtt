00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
central nervous system so as you can see

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.210 
central nervous system so as you can see
here<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.930> stormtroopers<00:02:32.500> if<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.829> pick<00:02:33.040> them

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:34.780 
up and throw them across the room they
will<00:02:34.480> act

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
will act

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.789 
will act
we<00:02:34.939> act<00:02:35.090> like<00:02:35.299> a<00:02:35.450> human<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.049> try<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.650> stop

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
we act like a human and try and stop

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.979 
we act like a human and try and stop
themselves<00:02:37.400> actually<00:02:37.670> tries<00:02:38.329> to<00:02:38.480> grab<00:02:38.719> hold

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
themselves actually tries to grab hold

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.750 
themselves actually tries to grab hold
of<00:02:39.200> things<00:02:39.439> as<00:02:39.769> it's<00:02:39.920> flying<00:02:40.189> across<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.640> room

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
so that it you know to stop itself from

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.860 
so that it you know to stop itself from
falling<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.250> each<00:02:43.879> time<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.269> play<00:02:44.569> it's

falling so each time you play it's
completely<00:02:45.379> different<00:02:45.739> you<00:02:46.069> know<00:02:46.189> they<00:02:46.400> react

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
completely different you know they react

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.099 
completely different you know they react
in<00:02:46.969> different<00:02:47.000> ways<00:02:47.390> it's<00:02:47.629> not<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.930> same

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
in different ways it's not the same

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.559 
in different ways it's not the same
generic<00:02:48.500> reaction<00:02:48.650> each<00:02:48.980> time<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.549> you<00:02:50.480> know

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
generic reaction each time and you know

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.750 
generic reaction each time and you know
the<00:02:50.719> technology<00:02:51.349> also<00:02:51.470> has<00:02:51.709> things<00:02:51.980> like<00:02:52.189> you

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
the technology also has things like you

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.880 
the technology also has things like you
know<00:02:52.849> metal<00:02:53.090> bends<00:02:53.480> as<00:02:53.870> metal<00:02:54.319> would<00:02:54.500> Bend<00:02:54.739> in

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
know metal bends as metal would Bend in

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.280 
know metal bends as metal would Bend in
real<00:02:55.040> life<00:02:55.280> wood<00:02:56.090> splinters<00:02:56.569> like<00:02:56.780> woods<00:02:57.019> so
