00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.090
 we always talk so much about flour not even 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.920
 for in the case of petra very often yes 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.809
 speaks of things stones compared to others 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.430
 flour those not ground to stone in 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.590
 Actually we should talk about wheat here 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.340
 we are in the countryside a short distance from the 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.899
 river po are campaigns between the 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.879
 province of ferrara of milito we are 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.920
 come today to see how they are 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.969
 growing the ears that will become 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.969
 weight in the next season 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.700
 It is important to know where the 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.339
 grain from which seed as it comes 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.980
 cultivated and important to understand which ones 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.570
 substances we can from nature 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.390
 of the soil in our diet 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.490
 with indian and for this we are 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.830
 following a growth of these ears 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.840
 from here to the next future that 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.020
 roughly it will be in the middle of the month of 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.020
 June 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.370
 and then here we have different ears of 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.200
 wheat have different colors but why 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.170
 these colors are different what it wants 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.330
 say first we have the ears of 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.010
 healthy wheat that at this time are 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.610
 yet which are we are in the phase of 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.860
 ulcerative milk maturation and are healthy 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.050
 they are not sick and therefore they are 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.729
 still enough greens will continue to 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.880
 stay green for some time yet 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.790
 until the grains fill and mature 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.910
 completely from the beginning from 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.890
 base up to the apex of our spending e 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.780
 then instead we have some bad luck 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.000
 which have different colors because in 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.759
 these cases we have spirits are 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.369
 I'm sick the vintage rain has 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.850
 meant that the pressure of the presence 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.410
 of fungal pathogen diseases 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:18.090
 above all it was very widespread and 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.220
 the environment has favored its own 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.050
 merge with the strong presence of 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.150
 moisture and rain these these 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.410
 diseases and therefore we have different stages 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.780
 of development of our disease 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.880
 where the rain and humidity have 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.940
 favored the development of these 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.070
 pathogens that have come through 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.860
 inflorescence and went to action 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.890
 on the basis of our of our flower and 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.170
 so this area of ​​the ear is one 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.590
 area lost because it will not produce e 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.540
 others will even be developed 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.420
 buffet with production consequences of 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.890
 toxins that are poisons produced 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.299
 of mushrooms 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.400
 ends is a passage that we recommend from 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.730
 eat all these features of 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.370
 illness indeed the diseases indeed 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.200
 taken on the ear we bring them to us 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.810
 inside the bean and then inside the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.750
 flour that we will then use 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.840
 for power supply and power supply 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.720
 human that we do not start animal to cruz 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.970
 because then the poison produced that in 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.730
 Technical jargon is called micro-toxins 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.250
 in a general sense of which there are 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.890
 many more or less specific types 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.720
 for each type of mushroom it is charged 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.730
 of every 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:43.300
 plant species these poisons are 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.750
 poisons that have toxic effects 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.510
 on animal health but 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.240
 we all say the living that you tell me about it 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:57.580
 cibano and these substances do not come 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.240
 destroyed through a process 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.000
 chemical through a process 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.950
 thermal so it is better to avoid 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.950
 take the field already 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.580
 you have verified all that is 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.290
 preparation for the product first 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.750
 of the harvest then with the agronomists 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.440
 you have seen what is there in the whole 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.690
 Preparation 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.980
 from that moment we take care of the 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.500
 withdrawal of the product and its product 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.080
 conservation to be able to give it to ours 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.280
 customers in optimal conditions 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.320
 so all the products we have 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.300
 applied in Campania allow us to 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.620
 have a better qualification of the 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.620
 mental product 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.339
 the product is withdrawn comes 

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:55.919
 cataloged enters a structure of 

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:58.439
 stuck that for 99 percent are 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:02.899
 of the vertical silos these year silos 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:05.459
 they are loaded in the loading phase 

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:07.709
 they are practically cooled then 

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:09.449
 we have the cold storage 

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:11.039
 refrigeration system that we 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.819
 allow to bring in a period 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.069
 very hot 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:17.249
 the temperature of the grain mass from 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:20.219
 30 35 or 40 degrees outside 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.989
 at 18 20 degrees that block the hatching 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:23.159
 some eggs 

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:25.079
 therefore we must prevent the 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:28.549
 insects that can develop because 

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:28.549
 berto grounds are developed 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.169
 being on the mill can't be like reliving 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.370
 the kind of life that the ancients did 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.530
 millers 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.530
 we talk about before the second war 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.790
 world when the power of water 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.370
 could move these maxims of 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.110
 natural stone that at the time was a 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.880
 single tool to be able to produce the 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.250
 flour a very rich very pretty 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.960
 coarse where the grain of wheat was 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.870
 all present inside the bag 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.610
 what we are saying today 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.050
 through the product of the mill and that 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.530
 the tradition that of the ingredients 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.020
 therefore rediscover a great over a degree 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.580
 nourishing innovation is to 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.070
 reformulate the recipes in a modern key 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.750
 to adapt them to the lifestyle 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.729
 today I believe that this mill 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.350
 representing the effort is the image 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.630
 that we carry inside when 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.150
 we think of a product as petra or i 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.070
 brics of petra products that are born for 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.380
 bring back the tradition of the 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.979
 ingredients in a very modern way of 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.979
 help
