00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:03.690
 hello to all a guitar the sense a song he will not come out if 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.959
 long 5% director of the isf called hideous collimator 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:10.919
 the game offered what it can give 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.919
 because current agreements without exception 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.009
 mbour 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.009
 at the end 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.929
 we never thought so high 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.330
 thanks to send their children to revise their stock prices of 21 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
 april 2002 athenes upside down the mayor of puy-en-velay 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.140
 the government now has 17 April 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 again we eat less harm 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.920
 so that's actually 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.799
 this song so you have the intro of the coupler and the chorus so the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.720
 scared put the halak index in st pierre 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.720
 so 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.180
 pawlak to 5 forgive me either fifth string 4th place 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.200
 then with this would be the sixth body second place 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
 no no it works by two time ports one by two by two 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.710
 it's offbeat just left out of ivory is still on 5th place 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.660
 a fifth body fourth place 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.660
 shifted to dax at the sixth body first box 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.180
 sixteen of these among them 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.050
 so after that you actually have to continue until the 30th 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.390
 and over you have a 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.990
 the bass line that in my opinion this day and the bass and the guitar 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.990
 electric because it's electrical sense 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.489
 you have a perpetual motion at the level of the first rope in the 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.679
 first box butt 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:21.329
 why make a m 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.769
 three ranges 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.550
 2 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.529
 ten others still had 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.749
 eight-string one the six-year-old 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:36.069
 on the first body needs three or four twelfth body 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.069
 like to say what 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.379
 no one under 15 years old the first time 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.689
 October 2 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.029
 second corner castrated 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:48.849
 second body only six points 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.329
 second body box people 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.489
 on the first cohort a 12-4 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.729
 more surprising still 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:00.449
 and then when we come back 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.449
 on the first time we can do anyway 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.569
 just before the strong euro 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.059
 so that makes 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:14.059
 at the end 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.079
 hames-boucres 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.669
 Saturday 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.449
 m 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.449
 I do not want anymore 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.879
 so it will work by set 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.839
 seven years ago but it is not everything 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:44.049
 the city 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.049
 why did not it work 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.069
 heitz 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.069
 Friday to Saturday 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.849
 and this stop late it works by set 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.209
 so the first chord is 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.929
 second rope second 400 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.149
 third string fourth place 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:08.149
 and 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:16.789
 then finally to make 6 ie6 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.870
 then in fact not the third agreement we will do 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.349
 bakou 3 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.550
 so in fact this agreement is not because 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.400
 as I am at a single guitar 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.069
 I play the base note 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.409
 with this one gbagbo 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.409
 it is not acceptable 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.949
 in tests but the two in fact so that's the third agreement 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.719
 fourth agreement this is going to give us 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.629
 second part is 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:08.629
 the chorus at all the same 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:17.219
 difference instead of the 3rd of the fourth agreement the normans suicide 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:20.909
 we will do this 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.059
 so the safety four 4 4 14 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:27.059
 6 hours 7 4 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.139
 so on acoustic limit is how I play com 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.270
 if you have a current version 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.780
 a small meter I would like to have a little bit of what it gives
