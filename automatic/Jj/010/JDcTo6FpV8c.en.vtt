John<00:00:29.760> sauce<00:00:30.029> with<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> walkthrough

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:53.020 

okay<00:00:44.230> android<00:00:45.250> for<00:00:46.250> dot<00:00:46.640> one<00:00:46.970> dot<00:00:47.000> to<00:00:50.950> and<00:00:52.030> what

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
okay android for dot one dot to and what

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.370 
okay android for dot one dot to and what
I've<00:00:53.150> seen<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:53.420> far<00:00:53.720> I<00:00:53.990> think<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.350> only

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
I've seen so far I think the only

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:02.340 
I've seen so far I think the only
difference<00:00:55.070> is<00:00:56.470> the<00:00:57.470> multi<00:00:57.710> window<00:01:01.300> which

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
difference is the multi window which

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.600 
difference is the multi window which
sucks<00:01:03.350> because<00:01:03.559> you<00:01:03.770> can't<00:01:04.040> do<00:01:04.280> thought<00:01:04.489> of

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
sucks because you can't do thought of

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.160 
sucks because you can't do thought of
apps<00:01:04.790> I<00:01:05.120> had<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.780> but<00:01:06.400> root<00:01:07.510> really<00:01:09.080> the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
apps I had it but root really the

mode<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:56.870> easy<00:02:57.870> mode<00:02:58.170> which<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:59.420> thought<00:03:00.420> easy

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
mode and easy mode which I thought easy

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
mode and easy mode which I thought easy
mode<00:03:01.080> was<00:03:01.590> all<00:03:02.420> already<00:03:03.420> there<00:03:03.630> we<00:03:04.410> are<00:03:04.530> had

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
mode was all already there we are had

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.010 
mode was all already there we are had
that<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.490> doesn't<00:03:05.760> really<00:03:05.790> make<00:03:06.060> sense

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.960 

and<00:03:10.020> also<00:03:10.290> block<00:03:10.590> him<00:03:10.770> i<00:03:10.890> guess<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.310> updated

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
and also block him i guess is updated

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.390 
and also block him i guess is updated
which<00:03:14.970> i<00:03:15.180> usually<00:03:15.420> don't<00:03:15.750> use<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:15.960> or<00:03:16.950> easy

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
which i usually don't use that or easy

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.720 
which i usually don't use that or easy
mode

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.119 

that's<00:03:23.360> really<00:03:23.659> about<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:24.769> can<00:03:24.950> see

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
that's really about it you can see

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:39.710 
that's really about it you can see
updates<00:03:25.700> right<00:03:26.120> here
