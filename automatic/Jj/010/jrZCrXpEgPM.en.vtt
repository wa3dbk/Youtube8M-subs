 endurance 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.070
 I am a faithful old motorcycles 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.390
 because I like it I like 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.740
 see in the stock market and coins 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.750
 old because I always restores 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.050
 even though now I'm doing it a little 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.880
 little less because I 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.470
 I came back in the competition I 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.360
 am xavier maugendre who was the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.880
 creator of the kawasaki import into 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.010
 form gave me the passion of this 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.870
 Mark 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.850
 and I liked this brand so much and 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.080
 I did so much with him 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.740
 for you said one time that 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.740
 I had green blood 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.970
 triumph who has unique patterns and 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.730
 previews even in France we try 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.500
 also to show what can be done on 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.060
 old motorbike bases 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.370
 then you will find stands where 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.260
 we transform the motorcycles and for example 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.360
 here at blitz motorcycle are 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.610
 pretty marked products was very nice 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.440
 and which allow to finally personalize 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.150
 an old bike with this kind of gear 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.010
 we stand out even more than a month that 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.650
 the good of looking for these two things to 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.120
 see the friends because it's the big 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.830
 meeting the big mass of the motorcycle 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.870
 old to paris in France 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.820
 firstly secondly I also come 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.270
 look for spare parts for my 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.610
 old motorcycles 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.860
 because it's like one of the most 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.140
 large existing scholarships and I come 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.190
 also feel a little bit the trends know 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.190
 exactly where are we going 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.099
 I love the bike it's true that I saw 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.240

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.900
 really good as always 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.200
 it's good favorite salon 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.200
 we can say 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.190
 no 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.540
 I come out we know how bad it is 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.550
 happens to haggle so we have another 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.690
 another piece of rice that will be able to roll 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.210
 Safely grip 975 motobecane z 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.930
 of c 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.930
 1951 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.170
 I have a dtn x brushed derby for the 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.069
 road I'm looking at my pen what is said 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.090
 no because I'm looking for a 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.090
 and perfecto 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.930
 I had around me friends who who 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.180
 have not had my chance and who are 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.730
 today handicapped 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.079
 I thought all the luck that I have 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.689
 had to turn to this cause 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.980
 spinal cord 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.170
 I decided to assign all this 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.870
 donation to this association for 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.940
 continue to invest with this hope of 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.750
 find solutions 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.750
