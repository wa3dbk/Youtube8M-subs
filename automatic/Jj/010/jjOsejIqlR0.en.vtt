honest<00:00:25.400> with<00:00:25.430> you<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:25.759> difference<00:00:26.149> is<00:00:26.300> very

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
honest with you the difference is very

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.290 
honest with you the difference is very
very<00:00:27.320> subtle<00:00:27.919> the<00:00:28.369> main<00:00:28.610> difference<00:00:29.029> in<00:00:29.149> this

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
very subtle the main difference in this

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.209 
very subtle the main difference in this
is<00:00:29.509> how<00:00:29.750> you<00:00:29.809> apply<00:00:30.079> the<00:00:30.410> products<00:00:30.980> that<00:00:31.099> you

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
is how you apply the products that you

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.760 
is how you apply the products that you
are<00:00:31.460> applying<00:00:31.780> strobing<00:00:32.780> is<00:00:32.930> also<00:00:33.320> not<00:00:33.559> really

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
have to say that I think I like more of

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.550 
have to say that I think I like more of
the<00:06:36.100> bronzy<00:06:36.580> and<00:06:36.760> glowy<00:06:37.180> side<00:06:37.540> I<00:06:37.870> kind<00:06:38.320> of<00:06:38.380> like

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
the bronzy and glowy side I kind of like

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.440 
the bronzy and glowy side I kind of like
the<00:06:38.680> way<00:06:38.800> strobing<00:06:39.190> looks<00:06:39.370> on<00:06:39.490> me<00:06:39.610> but<00:06:39.940> I<00:06:39.970> like

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.450 
the way strobing looks on me but I like

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.320 
the way strobing looks on me but I like
how<00:06:41.140> the<00:06:41.560> contour<00:06:42.130> and<00:06:42.220> highlight<00:06:42.550> adds<00:06:42.790> color

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
how the contour and highlight adds color

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.740 
how the contour and highlight adds color
back<00:06:43.840> into<00:06:44.350> my<00:06:44.530> skin<00:06:45.240> because<00:06:46.240> when<00:06:46.390> I<00:06:46.420> put

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
back into my skin because when I put

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.920 
back into my skin because when I put
foundation<00:06:46.990> it<00:06:47.470> kind<00:06:47.680> of<00:06:47.710> just<00:06:47.950> creates<00:06:48.430> this

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
foundation it kind of just creates this

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.200 
foundation it kind of just creates this
flat<00:06:49.930> canvas<00:06:50.650> and<00:06:50.980> then<00:06:51.280> of<00:06:51.430> my<00:06:51.610> color<00:06:51.940> is

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
flat canvas and then of my color is

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.700 
flat canvas and then of my color is
there<00:06:52.600> it's<00:06:52.840> just<00:06:53.080> the<00:06:53.200> color<00:06:53.440> of<00:06:53.620> the

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
there it's just the color of the

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.830 
there it's just the color of the
foundation<00:06:53.860> so<00:06:54.400> I<00:06:54.640> do<00:06:54.910> like<00:06:55.270> that<00:06:55.300> this<00:06:55.540> adds

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
foundation so I do like that this adds

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.650 
foundation so I do like that this adds
more<00:06:56.170> color<00:06:56.830> to<00:06:56.980> my<00:06:57.340> face<00:06:57.370> because<00:06:58.030> it<00:06:58.210> kind<00:06:58.600> of

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.660 
more color to my face because it kind of

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.870 
more color to my face because it kind of
starts<00:06:58.930> to<00:06:59.110> match<00:06:59.290> my<00:06:59.530> body<00:06:59.770> that<00:07:00.040> way<00:07:00.220> this

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
starts to match my body that way this

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.970 
starts to match my body that way this
side<00:07:01.090> it's<00:07:01.330> just<00:07:01.720> highlight<00:07:02.170> I<00:07:02.410> think<00:07:02.830> the

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980 
side it's just highlight I think the

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.130 
side it's just highlight I think the
main<00:07:03.280> reason<00:07:03.520> why<00:07:03.970> strobing<00:07:04.570> is<00:07:04.690> becoming

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.140 
main reason why strobing is becoming

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.920 
main reason why strobing is becoming
like<00:07:05.410> a<00:07:05.440> thing<00:07:05.740> is<00:07:05.950> because<00:07:06.660> contouring<00:07:07.660> can

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
like a thing is because contouring can

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.020 
like a thing is because contouring can
kind<00:07:08.140> of<00:07:08.200> take<00:07:08.350> a<00:07:08.380> while<00:07:08.830> sometimes<00:07:09.700> so<00:07:10.000> I

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
kind of take a while sometimes so I

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.650 
kind of take a while sometimes so I
think<00:07:10.450> that<00:07:10.810> this<00:07:11.140> strobing<00:07:11.980> thing<00:07:12.940> is<00:07:13.210> just

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:13.660 
think that this strobing thing is just

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.800 
think that this strobing thing is just
an<00:07:13.990> easier<00:07:14.650> way<00:07:15.190> to<00:07:15.550> get<00:07:16.060> a<00:07:16.090> glow<00:07:16.450> without

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
an easier way to get a glow without

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.720 
an easier way to get a glow without
having<00:07:17.170> to<00:07:17.320> highlight<00:07:17.680> and<00:07:17.890> contour<00:07:18.310> but<00:07:18.610> if

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:18.730 
having to highlight and contour but if

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.370 
having to highlight and contour but if
you<00:07:18.880> guys<00:07:19.000> found<00:07:19.210> this<00:07:19.330> a<00:07:19.420> video<00:07:19.810> helpful<00:07:20.260> in
