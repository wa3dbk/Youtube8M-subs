 not studio monitors 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.820
 but I like the way speakers transmit 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:34.150
 their sound they have a very very deep bass 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.950
 purely transmit and not sound until I can 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.520
 afford studio monitors 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.480
