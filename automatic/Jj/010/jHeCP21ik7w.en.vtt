00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
Cupertino California and he writes when

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.540 
Cupertino California and he writes when
making<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.230> threaded<00:00:10.679> plumbing<00:00:11.010> connection

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
making a threaded plumbing connection

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.270 
making a threaded plumbing connection
when<00:00:12.120> should<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.420> use<00:00:12.540> teflon<00:00:13.320> tape<00:00:13.679> pipe

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
when should you use teflon tape pipe

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.980 
when should you use teflon tape pipe
dope<00:00:14.549> something<00:00:15.030> else<00:00:15.210> or<00:00:15.389> nothing<00:00:15.750> at<00:00:15.870> all

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
dope something else or nothing at all

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.779 
dope something else or nothing at all
well<00:00:16.410> it's<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.560> good<00:00:16.680> question<00:00:16.890> when<00:00:17.609> most

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
well it's a good question when most

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.460 
well it's a good question when most
people<00:00:17.940> think<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.480> threads<00:00:18.900> they<00:00:19.170> think<00:00:19.380> of

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
people think of threads they think of

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.929 
people think of threads they think of
this<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.920> machine<00:00:20.310> thread<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:20.850> a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
this it's a machine thread it's a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.700 
this it's a machine thread it's a
straight<00:00:21.270> thread<00:00:21.570> most<00:00:21.840> nuts<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.320> bolts<00:00:22.560> have

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
straight thread most nuts and bolts have

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.740 
straight thread most nuts and bolts have
it<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.550> make<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.970> nut<00:00:24.269> go<00:00:24.420> up<00:00:24.570> and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
it and you can make that nut go up and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.810 
it and you can make that nut go up and
down<00:00:24.869> because<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.650> straight<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.670> is

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
down because this is straight this is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.460 
down because this is straight this is
not<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.150> type<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.449> thread<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:27.779> use<00:00:27.960> normally

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
not the type of thread we use normally

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.099 
not the type of thread we use normally
in<00:00:28.619> plumbing<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:29.849> use<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.300> called<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.660> tapered

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
in plumbing we use one called a tapered

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.900 
in plumbing we use one called a tapered
thread<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.009> if<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.160> look<00:00:32.309> at<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.489> piece<00:00:32.700> of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
thread so if you look at this piece of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.610 
thread so if you look at this piece of
pipe<00:00:33.090> there<00:00:33.420> was<00:00:33.600> material<00:00:33.750> right<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:34.410> and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
pipe there was material right here and

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.250 
pipe there was material right here and
someone<00:00:34.980> took<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> pipe<00:00:35.610> dye<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.480> cut<00:00:36.870> threads

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
someone took a pipe dye and cut threads

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.479 
someone took a pipe dye and cut threads
and<00:00:37.440> you'll<00:00:37.559> notice<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.129> look<00:00:38.219> carefully

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
and you'll notice if you look carefully

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.729 
and you'll notice if you look carefully
that<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.510> thread<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.750> smaller<00:00:40.230> right<00:00:40.440> here

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
that the thread is smaller right here

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.500 
that the thread is smaller right here
and<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.070> gets<00:00:41.219> bigger<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.730> goes<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.270> never

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and it gets bigger as it goes up I never

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.200 
and it gets bigger as it goes up I never
noticed<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.899> before<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.680> now<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.219> take<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
noticed that before so now as you take a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.200 
noticed that before so now as you take a
tighten<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.980> taper<00:00:47.309> gets<00:00:47.700> tighter

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
tighten that in the taper gets tighter

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.600 
tighten that in the taper gets tighter
huh<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:49.200> right<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> stray<00:00:50.100> thread<00:00:50.399> as

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
huh all right so on a stray thread as

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.639 
huh all right so on a stray thread as
this<00:00:50.879> nut<00:00:51.210> moves<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.989> never<00:00:52.199> gets<00:00:52.350> tighter

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
this nut moves it never gets tighter

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.020 
this nut moves it never gets tighter
until<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.010> hits<00:00:53.160> something<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.670> right<00:00:53.820> but

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
until it hits something it's right but

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.700 
until it hits something it's right but
as<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.300> thread<00:00:54.600> travels<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.289> tightens<00:00:55.649> up

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
as that thread travels it tightens up

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.319 
as that thread travels it tightens up
that's<00:00:55.890> right<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.430> even<00:00:56.610> when<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.910> tighten<00:00:57.120> up

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
that's right so even when you tighten up

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.060 
that's right so even when you tighten up
though<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.750> still<00:00:58.140> would<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.620> liquid

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
though it still would not be liquid

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.860 
though it still would not be liquid
tight<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.399> still<00:00:59.609> need<00:00:59.760> some<00:01:00.030> form<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.570> thread

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
tight you still need some form of thread

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.270 
tight you still need some form of thread
sealing<00:01:01.260> all<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.559> what's<00:01:01.770> sealant<00:01:02.219> to

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
sealing all right so what's sealant to

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.310 
sealing all right so what's sealant to
do<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.520> use<00:01:02.760> well<00:01:03.090> nowadays<00:01:03.390> people<00:01:03.899> use<00:01:04.199> in

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
do you use well nowadays people use in

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.200 
do you use well nowadays people use in
plastic<00:01:04.799> for<00:01:04.949> everything<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
plastic for everything so the the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.940 
plastic for everything so the the
popular<00:01:06.689> thread<00:01:06.900> sealant<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.680> called

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
popular thread sealant is this is called

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.640 
popular thread sealant is this is called
teflon<00:01:08.430> tape<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.880> comes<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.299> rolls<00:01:09.630> yeah<00:01:10.110> the

best<00:01:10.830> way<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.040> apply<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> hold<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
best way to apply this is to hold the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
best way to apply this is to hold the
work<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.290> your<00:01:13.439> left<00:01:13.650> hand<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.189> now<00:01:14.790> you'll

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
work in your left hand and now you'll

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.090 
work in your left hand and now you'll
notice<00:01:15.210> I'm<00:01:15.420> going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.630> go<00:01:15.720> around<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.619> Teflon

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
notice I'm going to go around the Teflon

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.070 
notice I'm going to go around the Teflon
does<00:01:17.369> not<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.970> any<00:01:18.180> adhesion<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.930> have

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
does not have any adhesion so you have

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.320 
does not have any adhesion so you have
to<00:01:19.200> pull<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.470> tight<00:01:19.860> enough<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.490> seals<00:01:20.939> onto

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
to pull it tight enough so it seals onto

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.600 
to pull it tight enough so it seals onto
itself<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:22.259> almost<00:01:22.470> filling<00:01:23.040> those<00:01:23.189> threads

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
itself it's almost filling those threads

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.340 
itself it's almost filling those threads
its<00:01:23.909> retaining<00:01:24.270> its<00:01:24.509> ruin<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.960> got<00:01:25.049> two<00:01:25.229> or

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
its retaining its ruin so you got two or

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.539 
its retaining its ruin so you got two or
three<00:01:25.380> times<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:26.040> when<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.220> get<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.430> this

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
three times and now when you get to this

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.160 
three times and now when you get to this
point<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.299> important<00:01:27.570> thing<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.780> pull<00:01:28.049> it

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
point the important thing is to pull it

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.190 
point the important thing is to pull it
tight<00:01:28.710> enough<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.310> seals<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.659> itself

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
tight enough so it seals on to itself

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.319 
tight enough so it seals on to itself
okay<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:32.850> tighten<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.210> in

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
okay and then you just tighten it in

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.660 
okay and then you just tighten it in
great<00:01:33.780> all<00:01:34.290> right<00:01:34.470> now<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.340> what's<00:01:35.520> used

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
great all right now this is what's used

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.359 
great all right now this is what's used
nowadays<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.869> still<00:01:37.470> am<00:01:37.680> partial<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.250> this

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
nowadays but I still am partial to this

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.490 
nowadays but I still am partial to this
some<00:01:38.670> sort<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.970> pipe<00:01:39.180> sealant<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.930> would<00:01:40.290> pipe

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
some sort of pipe sealant it would pipe

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.590 
some sort of pipe sealant it would pipe
dope<00:01:40.770> they<00:01:40.979> call<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.450> two

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
dope they call it this is this two

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.280 
dope they call it this is this two
different<00:01:42.750> brands<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.680> use<00:01:45.020> when<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.259> go

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
different brands that we use when we go

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.350 
different brands that we use when we go
on<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.860> with<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> threads<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.180> kind

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
on here with the threads so this is kind

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.819 
on here with the threads so this is kind

of a liquid I mean is this a is this a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.499 
of a liquid I mean is this a is this a
permanent<00:01:50.159> seal<00:01:50.579> that's<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> set<00:01:51.360> up

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
permanent seal that's going to set up

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.120 
permanent seal that's going to set up
well<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.720> nice<00:01:51.869> thing<00:01:51.899> it'll<00:01:52.409> fill<00:01:52.680> between

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
well the nice thing it'll fill between

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.950 
well the nice thing it'll fill between
the<00:01:53.220> threads<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:53.790> it'll<00:01:53.970> never<00:01:54.180> set<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.659> so

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the threads but it'll never set up so

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.389 
the threads but it'll never set up so
hard<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> can't<00:01:55.439> take<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> apart<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.189> always

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
hard you can't take it apart you always

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.889 
hard you can't take it apart you always
want<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:56.909> able<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.420> able<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.600> take<00:01:57.780> the

all<00:01:59.280> right<00:01:59.490> good<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.210> would<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.540> thread

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
all right good so that would just thread

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.039 
all right good so that would just thread
right<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.079> right<00:02:01.229> here<00:02:01.530> okay<00:02:02.520> yeah<00:02:03.149> and

right in right here okay yeah and

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.170 
right in right here okay yeah and
tighten<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.439> up<00:02:04.619> now<00:02:05.549> when<00:02:05.670> I'm<00:02:05.759> connecting<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
tighten it up now when I'm connecting to

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.330 
tighten it up now when I'm connecting to
old<00:02:06.450> work<00:02:06.840> like<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.320> radiator<00:02:07.799> connection

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
old work like this radiator connection

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.249 
old work like this radiator connection
I'm<00:02:08.459> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> use<00:02:08.819> wicking<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.959> I'll<00:02:10.020> still

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
I'm going to use wicking so I'll still

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.410 
I'm going to use wicking so I'll still
use<00:02:10.289> pipe<00:02:10.770> dope<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.700> when<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.910> say<00:02:12.090> wicking

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
use pipe dope and when you say wicking

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.910 
use pipe dope and when you say wicking
are<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.569> talking<00:02:12.959> about<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.379> sort<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.650> ball

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
are you talking about this sort of ball

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.350 
are you talking about this sort of ball
thread<00:02:14.220> here<00:02:14.490> that's<00:02:14.760> right<00:02:14.940> once<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.150> pull

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
thread here that's right once you pull

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.820 
thread here that's right once you pull
out<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.480> single<00:02:15.840> piece<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.230> working<00:02:16.410> just

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
out a single piece of that working just

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.150 
out a single piece of that working just
one<00:02:17.130> strand<00:02:17.520> yep<00:02:18.020> okay<00:02:19.020> that's<00:02:19.290> for<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.620> just

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
one strand yep okay that's for you just

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.800 
one strand yep okay that's for you just
snap<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.580> off<00:02:20.700> for<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.330> now<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.660> this

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
snap that off for you so now in this

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.510 
snap that off for you so now in this
case<00:02:22.110> I'm<00:02:22.410> actually<00:02:22.470> going<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.040> put<00:02:23.280> this

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
case I'm actually going to put this

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.000 
case I'm actually going to put this
wicking<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.690> lays<00:02:25.260> right<00:02:25.290> into<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
wicking so it lays right into the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.260 
wicking so it lays right into the
threads<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.730> what<00:02:26.940> do<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.060> know<00:02:27.120> you're

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
threads so what do you know you're

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.780 
threads so what do you know you're
filling<00:02:27.660> up<00:02:27.810> those<00:02:28.020> absolute<00:02:28.739> or<00:02:28.980> absolutely

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
filling up those absolute or absolutely

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.300 
filling up those absolute or absolutely
so<00:02:29.970> now<00:02:30.150> what<00:02:30.330> happens<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:31.020> as<00:02:31.200> liquid<00:02:32.130> touches

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
so now what happens is as liquid touches

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.610 
so now what happens is as liquid touches
it<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.270> string<00:02:33.810> or<00:02:33.989> wicking<00:02:34.319> will<00:02:34.440> just

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
it that string or wicking will just

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.050 
it that string or wicking will just
expand<00:02:35.100> slightly<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.610> will<00:02:35.700> act<00:02:35.819> like<00:02:35.910> a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
expand slightly so will act like a

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.490 
expand slightly so will act like a
cocking<00:02:36.480> oh<00:02:36.600> very<00:02:37.080> clever

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
cocking oh very clever

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.350 
cocking oh very clever
so<00:02:37.709> in<00:02:37.860> plumbing<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.400> sounds<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:38.819> anytime

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
so in plumbing it sounds like anytime

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.240 
so in plumbing it sounds like anytime
you<00:02:39.600> have<00:02:39.780> threads<00:02:40.200> you're<00:02:40.709> sealing<00:02:41.160> them

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
you have threads you're sealing them

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.500 
you have threads you're sealing them
well<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.700> have<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:41.970> seal<00:02:42.180> them<00:02:42.330> but<00:02:42.480> I

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
well you have to seal them but I

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.059 
well you have to seal them but I
actually<00:02:42.720> won't<00:02:43.050> use<00:02:43.290> thread<00:02:43.590> sealant<00:02:43.890> on

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
actually won't use thread sealant on

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.589 
actually won't use thread sealant on
every<00:02:44.310> thread<00:02:44.640> let<00:02:44.940> me<00:02:45.000> show<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.239> what<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.390> mean

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
every thread let me show you what I mean

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.170 
every thread let me show you what I mean
this<00:02:46.260> is<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.530> radiative<00:02:47.160> valve<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:48.060> know

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
radio is right here the pipe comes up

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.199 
radio is right here the pipe comes up
here<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.010> let's<00:02:50.790> talk<00:02:50.910> about<00:02:51.000> this

here and let's talk about this

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.400 
here and let's talk about this
connection<00:02:51.420> it's<00:02:51.690> actually<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:51.989> union

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410

faucets these connections right here
again<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.530> straight<00:03:28.859> connection<00:03:29.370> this

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
again this is a straight connection this

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.039 
again this is a straight connection this
is<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.609> water<00:03:29.880> supply<00:03:30.150> going<00:03:30.600> up<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.930> bottom

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049

of a lavatory and in this case I don't

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.940 
of a lavatory and in this case I don't
need<00:03:33.510> any<00:03:33.750> pipe<00:03:34.140> dope<00:03:34.380> right<00:03:34.590> here<00:03:34.739> there's<00:03:34.920> a

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
need any pipe dope right here there's a

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.860 
need any pipe dope right here there's a
rubber<00:03:35.160> gasket<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:36.299> we<00:03:36.390> just<00:03:36.540> want<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.720> make

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.180 
rubber gasket and we just want to make
this<00:03:37.019> tight<00:03:37.320> enough<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.739> compress<00:03:38.160> that

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
this tight enough to compress that

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.530 
this tight enough to compress that
rubber<00:03:38.519> gasket<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.090> bottom<00:03:39.390> of<00:03:39.480> the

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
think that is the straight dope on

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.640 
think that is the straight dope on
making<00:03:43.859> plumbing<00:03:44.190> seals

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650
