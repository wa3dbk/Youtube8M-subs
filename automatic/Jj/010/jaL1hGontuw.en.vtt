like<00:05:19.220> Rama<00:05:19.520> in<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:20.000> book<00:05:20.180> it's<00:05:20.539> a<00:05:21.520> it's<00:05:22.520> a

like Rama in the book it's a it's a

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
like Rama in the book it's a it's a
spain<00:05:23.930> in<00:05:24.139> spacecraft<00:05:24.820> now<00:05:25.820> he's<00:05:26.780> only

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
spain in spacecraft now he's only

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.300 
spain in spacecraft now he's only
evidence<00:05:27.410> for<00:05:27.590> that<00:05:27.620> is<00:05:28.570> the<00:05:30.220> numerology<00:05:31.220> and

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
evidence for that is the numerology and

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.909 
evidence for that is the numerology and
timing<00:05:31.760> of<00:05:31.820> it<00:05:31.940> all<00:05:32.090> good<00:05:32.360> so<00:05:33.349> I'm<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:33.800> bit

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
timing of it all good so I'm a bit

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.950 
timing of it all good so I'm a bit
dubious<00:05:34.310> about<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.700> now<00:05:35.030> he<00:05:35.539> also<00:05:35.660> says

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
dubious about that now he also says

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.080 
dubious about that now he also says
maybe<00:05:36.169> blue<00:05:36.500> cucina<00:05:37.010> which<00:05:37.370> is<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.700> hook<00:05:37.880> in

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
maybe blue cucina which is the hook in

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.610 
maybe blue cucina which is the hook in
the<00:05:38.270> Hopi<00:05:38.720> prophecy<00:05:40.930> this<00:05:41.930> star<00:05:42.229> which<00:05:42.500> would

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
the Hopi prophecy this star which would

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.650 
the Hopi prophecy this star which would
appear<00:05:42.979> at<00:05:43.490> the<00:05:43.729> end<00:05:43.849> of<00:05:44.030> the<00:05:44.120> fourth<00:05:44.389> Sun

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
appear at the end of the fourth Sun

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.589 
appear at the end of the fourth Sun
which<00:05:44.840> of<00:05:45.080> course<00:05:45.110> is<00:05:45.410> coming<00:05:46.010> up<00:05:46.130> the<00:05:46.599> mayan

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
which of course is coming up the mayan

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.659 
which of course is coming up the mayan
calendar<00:05:47.919> which<00:05:48.919> the<00:05:49.070> hood<00:05:49.220> you<00:05:49.250> know<00:05:49.430> and<00:05:49.610> the

calendar which the hood you know and the
Hopi<00:05:49.970> to<00:05:50.180> believe<00:05:50.660> that<00:05:50.870> they<00:05:51.020> that<00:05:51.620> we're

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
Hopi to believe that they that we're

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.680 
Hopi to believe that they that we're
coming<00:05:52.070> to<00:05:52.160> the<00:05:52.190> end<00:05:52.280> of<00:05:52.460> the<00:05:52.550> four<00:05:53.180> thousand

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
coming to the end of the four thousand

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.960 
coming to the end of the four thousand
we<00:05:53.750> begin<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:54.110> fifth<00:05:54.289> age<00:05:54.590> so<00:05:55.340> I'm<00:05:55.430> too<00:05:55.760> tired

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
we begin the fifth age so I'm too tired

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.180 
we begin the fifth age so I'm too tired
to<00:05:56.180> think<00:05:56.210> about<00:05:56.630> things<00:05:56.840> like<00:05:57.020> this<00:05:57.169> so<00:05:57.380> it's

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
to think about things like this so it's

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.270 
to think about things like this so it's
really<00:05:58.370> explain<00:05:58.699> it<00:05:58.729> properly<00:05:58.940> um<00:06:00.280> but

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
really explain it properly um but

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.189 
really explain it properly um but
basically<00:06:01.729> and<00:06:02.150> he<00:06:02.750> says<00:06:02.960> that<00:06:03.110> on<00:06:03.169> the

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
basically and he says that on the

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.500 
basically and he says that on the
morning<00:06:03.470> of<00:06:03.949> the<00:06:04.580> day<00:06:04.610> when<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:05.330> Mayan

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
morning of the day when the Mayan

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.650 
morning of the day when the Mayan
calendar<00:06:05.720> ends<00:06:06.110> which<00:06:06.320> calling<00:06:06.650> to<00:06:06.710> him

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
calendar ends which calling to him

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.900 
calendar ends which calling to him
twenty-second<00:06:08.660> of<00:06:08.720> November<00:06:09.229> because<00:06:09.349> it's

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
twenty-second of November because it's
