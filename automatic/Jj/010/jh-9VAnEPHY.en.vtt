hey<00:00:00.329> folks<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.050> Kalani<00:00:01.469> we're<00:00:01.890> going<00:00:02.070> to

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hey folks this is Kalani we're going to

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.710 
hey folks this is Kalani we're going to
be<00:00:02.220> having<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.520> look<00:00:02.610> at<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:03.060> naval<00:00:03.540> missions

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
be having a look at how naval missions

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.470 
be having a look at how naval missions
are<00:00:04.170> shaping<00:00:04.680> up<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.190> it's<00:00:05.670> actually<00:00:05.790> pretty

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
are shaping up and it's actually pretty

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.450 
are shaping up and it's actually pretty
good<00:00:06.779> now<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.799> things<00:00:08.040> that's<00:00:08.220> still<00:00:08.429> a

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
good now the things that's still a

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.589 
good now the things that's still a
little<00:00:08.670> different<00:00:09.059> between<00:00:09.240> horde<00:00:09.540> and

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
little different between horde and

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.810 
little different between horde and
alliance<00:00:09.960> or<00:00:10.230> mon<00:00:10.349> alliance<00:00:10.740> for<00:00:10.950> now<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.280> it

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
alliance or mon alliance for now and it

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.980 
alliance or mon alliance for now and it
seems<00:00:12.000> as<00:00:12.150> though<00:00:12.210> everything's<00:00:12.690> working

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
seems as though everything's working

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.470 
seems as though everything's working
nicely<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.710> percentage<00:00:14.549> chances<00:00:15.059> seem<00:00:15.330> to

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
nicely the percentage chances seem to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.580 
nicely the percentage chances seem to
have<00:00:15.570> gone<00:00:15.690> up<00:00:15.839> which<00:00:16.020> means<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.320> can<00:00:16.470> actually

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
have gone up which means we can actually

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.410 
have gone up which means we can actually
get<00:00:16.859> our<00:00:17.039> blueprints<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> first<00:00:18.000> ship

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
get our blueprints for the first ship

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.300 
get our blueprints for the first ship
you<00:00:18.690> start<00:00:18.990> out<00:00:19.109> with<00:00:19.230> your<00:00:19.380> transport<00:00:20.070> ship

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
you start out with your transport ship

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.859 
you start out with your transport ship
but<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.640> quest<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.060> then<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.660> get<00:00:21.840> your

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
but the quest and then you get your

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.080 
but the quest and then you get your
destroyer<00:00:22.529> ship<00:00:22.890> blueprint<00:00:23.580> from<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.820> very

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
destroyer ship blueprint from the very

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.820 
destroyer ship blueprint from the very
first<00:00:24.180> mission<00:00:24.720> now<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.230> only<00:00:25.350> takes<00:00:25.619> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
first mission now that only takes a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.609 
first mission now that only takes a
little<00:00:25.859> bit<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.490> we'll<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.910> done<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
little bit so we'll get that done and

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.720 
little bit so we'll get that done and
then<00:00:28.619> when<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.859> got<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> blueprint<00:00:29.460> take

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
then when you got the blueprint take

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.490 
then when you got the blueprint take
that<00:00:29.849> over<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.150> your<00:00:30.330> ship<00:00:30.599> right<00:00:30.810> things<00:00:31.349> have

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
that over to your ship right things have

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.749 
that over to your ship right things have
changed<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> little<00:00:31.920> bit<00:00:32.070> over<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.579> well

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
changed a little bit over here as well

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.520 
changed a little bit over here as well
the<00:00:33.120> iron<00:00:33.390> ship<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:33.780> doesn't<00:00:33.989> seem<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.440> be

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the iron ship right doesn't seem to be

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.740 
the iron ship right doesn't seem to be
making<00:00:34.680> our<00:00:34.920> boats<00:00:35.130> anymore<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.790> whenever<00:00:36.360> we

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
making our boats anymore but whenever we

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.049 
making our boats anymore but whenever we
can<00:00:36.870> put<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.410> work<00:00:37.950> order<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.610> brand

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
can put in a work order for this brand

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.780 
can put in a work order for this brand
new<00:00:39.329> destroyer<00:00:40.140> model<00:00:40.620> seems<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.640> that

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
new destroyer model seems to be that

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.610 
new destroyer model seems to be that
there's<00:00:42.059> quite<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> few<00:00:42.690> different<00:00:43.050> models<00:00:43.530> of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
there's quite a few different models of

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.990 
there's quite a few different models of
ship<00:00:43.860> which<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:44.460> cool<00:00:44.670> I'm<00:00:44.910> not

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
ship which is really cool I'm not

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.700 
ship which is really cool I'm not
entirely<00:00:45.329> sure<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.110> model<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.469> ship

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
entirely sure if the model of ship

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.069 
entirely sure if the model of ship
immediately<00:00:47.489> dictates<00:00:48.270> what<00:00:48.450> abilities<00:00:48.899> they

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
immediately dictates what abilities they

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.680 
immediately dictates what abilities they
have<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.440> therefore<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:50.550> threats<00:00:51.390> that

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
have and therefore what threats that

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.060 
have and therefore what threats that
they<00:00:51.809> counter<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.289> missions<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:52.800> whatever

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
they counter on missions but whatever

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.639 
they counter on missions but whatever
we'll<00:00:53.340> get<00:00:53.550> our<00:00:53.699> ship<00:00:54.000> from<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.510> dry<00:00:55.379> docks

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
we'll get our ship from the dry docks

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.520 
we'll get our ship from the dry docks
here<00:00:55.980> pop<00:00:56.820> back<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.539> naval<00:00:58.109> mission

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
here pop back up to the naval mission

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.410 
here pop back up to the naval mission
board<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.489> send<00:00:59.699> these<00:00:59.910> two<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.270> as

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
board and we can send these two out as

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.200 
board and we can send these two out as
well<00:01:00.780> everything<00:01:01.649> seems<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.949> be<00:01:02.039> exactly<00:01:03.000> how

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
well everything seems to be exactly how

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.850 
well everything seems to be exactly how
it<00:01:03.329> would<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> follower<00:01:04.199> system<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
it would be with the follower system and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.539 
it would be with the follower system and
that<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.670> counter<00:01:06.420> threats<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.400> then<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that you counter threats and then you

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.850 
that you counter threats and then you
send<00:01:08.790> them<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:08.970> missions<00:01:09.290> that<00:01:10.290> basically

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
send them on missions that basically

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.710 
send them on missions that basically
seems<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.460> right<00:01:11.729> now<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.299> capped

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
seems to be it right now you are capped

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.260 
seems to be it right now you are capped
at<00:01:12.930> five<00:01:13.350> boats<00:01:13.710> no<00:01:14.490> idea<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:14.880> that's<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
at five boats no idea if that's going to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.490 
at five boats no idea if that's going to
change<00:01:15.420> no<00:01:15.689> idea<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.229> build<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
change no idea if you can build a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.020 
change no idea if you can build a
building<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.890> change<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.400> I'll<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:17.759> anything

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
building to change that I'll do anything

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.050 
building to change that I'll do anything
up<00:01:18.630> Grady<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.650> change<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.400> five<00:01:20.729> boats

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
up Grady to change that but five boats

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.390 
up Grady to change that but five boats
and<00:01:21.360> there's<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.229> lot<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.470> threats<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.040> counter

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and there's a lot of threats to counter

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.010 
and there's a lot of threats to counter
there<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.939> I'm<00:01:24.060> not<00:01:24.210> entirely<00:01:24.479> sure<00:01:24.630> if<00:01:24.810> you're

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
there so I'm not entirely sure if you're

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.499 
there so I'm not entirely sure if you're
going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.259> almost<00:01:25.830> rely<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.610> boats<00:01:27.240> being

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
going to almost rely on boats being

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.020 
going to almost rely on boats being
destroyed<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.200> getting<00:01:28.860> them<00:01:29.040> from<00:01:29.430> blue<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
destroyed but getting them from blue to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.760 
destroyed but getting them from blue to
epics<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.720> should<00:01:30.869> take<00:01:31.020> quite<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.290> while<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
epics you should take quite a while the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.319 
epics you should take quite a while the
experience<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.310> got<00:01:32.460> from<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.790> mission<00:01:33.000> only

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
experience I got from this mission only

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.140 
experience I got from this mission only
bumped<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.409> teeny-weeny<00:01:35.100> bit<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.729> from

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
bumped it up a teeny-weeny bit but from

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.789 
bumped it up a teeny-weeny bit but from
green<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.600> blue<00:01:36.630> does<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.259> seem<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.710> be

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
green to blue does actually seem to be

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.649 
green to blue does actually seem to be
relatively<00:01:38.220> easy<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:39.210> mission<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.509> I

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
relatively easy the mission that I

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.230 
relatively easy the mission that I
completed<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> later<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.680> gave<00:01:41.040> me<00:01:41.250> almost

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
completed the later on gave me almost

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.289 
completed the later on gave me almost
blew<00:01:42.570> from<00:01:42.990> one<00:01:43.590> mission<00:01:43.920> which<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.610> pretty

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
blew from one mission which is pretty

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.840 
blew from one mission which is pretty
awesome<00:01:45.420> considering<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.619> equip<00:01:47.430> ship

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
awesome considering you can equip ship

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.660 
awesome considering you can equip ship
equipment<00:01:48.329> until<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.920> actually<00:01:50.070> get<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.399> blue

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
equipment until you actually get to blue

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.270 
equipment until you actually get to blue
so<00:01:50.970> ship<00:01:51.540> equipment<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.079> interesting<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:52.950> well

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
so ship equipment is interesting as well

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.249 
so ship equipment is interesting as well
these<00:01:53.759> are<00:01:53.939> unlocked<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.479> blueprints<00:01:54.899> from

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
these are unlocked with blueprints from

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.080 
these are unlocked with blueprints from
specific<00:01:56.070> missions<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.670> you'll<00:01:56.880> get<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
specific missions so you'll get the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.600 
specific missions so you'll get the
mission<00:01:57.420> you'll<00:01:57.630> go<00:01:57.810> out<00:01:57.840> you'll<00:01:58.229> get<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
mission you'll go out you'll get the

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.400 
mission you'll go out you'll get the
blueprint<00:01:58.970> come<00:01:59.180> back<00:01:59.390> give<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.290> guy

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
blueprint come back give it to the guy

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.140 
blueprint come back give it to the guy
who<00:02:00.470> sells<00:02:00.890> your<00:02:01.040> equipment<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.610> then<00:02:02.030> you

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
who sells your equipment and then you

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.660 
who sells your equipment and then you
can<00:02:02.300> buy<00:02:02.510> that<00:02:03.140> equipment<00:02:03.710> that<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.070> have<00:02:04.340> the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
can buy that equipment that you have the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.920 
can buy that equipment that you have the
blueprint<00:02:05.090> for<00:02:05.300> if<00:02:05.480> you<00:02:05.570> don't<00:02:05.720> have<00:02:05.840> the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
blueprint for if you don't have the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.120 
blueprint for if you don't have the
blueprint<00:02:06.290> you're<00:02:06.500> not<00:02:06.650> going<00:02:06.800> to<00:02:06.860> be<00:02:06.920> able<00:02:06.980> to

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
blueprint you're not going to be able to

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.980 
blueprint you're not going to be able to
buy<00:02:07.310> anything<00:02:07.610> but<00:02:07.880> basically<00:02:08.450> what<00:02:08.630> this<00:02:08.810> is

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
buy anything but basically what this is

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.470 
buy anything but basically what this is
you<00:02:09.560> equip<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.130> equipment<00:02:10.729> onto<00:02:10.910> your<00:02:11.180> ship

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
you equip the equipment onto your ship

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.080 
you equip the equipment onto your ship
and<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.780> gives<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.290> another<00:02:12.710> ability<00:02:13.010> more<00:02:14.000> or

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
and it gives you another ability more or

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.700 
and it gives you another ability more or
less<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.450> seems<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.720> be<00:02:14.780> helping<00:02:14.900> these<00:02:15.530> are

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
less that seems to be helping these are

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.380 
less that seems to be helping these are
working<00:02:16.070> you<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.460> can<00:02:16.730> counter<00:02:17.270> an

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
working you you can counter an

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.570 
working you you can counter an
additional<00:02:17.870> threat<00:02:18.200> if<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:19.130> have<00:02:19.400> that

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
additional threat if you have that

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.800 
additional threat if you have that
equipment<00:02:20.060> or<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.270> can<00:02:20.420> increase<00:02:20.690> your

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
equipment or you can increase your

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.840 
equipment or you can increase your
chance<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.290> success<00:02:21.350> if<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.580> have<00:02:22.730> that

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
chance of success if you have that

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.240 
chance of success if you have that
equipment<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:23.360> that's<00:02:23.540> really<00:02:23.720> cool<00:02:24.250> it's

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
equipment so that's really cool it's

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.610 
equipment so that's really cool it's
kind<00:02:25.490> of<00:02:25.640> like<00:02:25.900> temporary<00:02:26.900> item<00:02:27.410> level

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
kind of like temporary item level

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.680 
kind of like temporary item level
increase<00:02:28.130> which<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.060> an<00:02:29.180> interesting<00:02:29.420> way<00:02:29.660> to

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
increase which is an interesting way to

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.540 
increase which is an interesting way to
do<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.050> but<00:02:30.200> either<00:02:30.620> way<00:02:30.860> that's<00:02:31.040> how<00:02:31.280> things

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
do it but either way that's how things

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.330 
do it but either way that's how things
are<00:02:31.880> now<00:02:32.150> when<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.050> completed<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.530> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
are now when you completed the the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.100 
are now when you completed the the
introduction<00:02:35.150> missions<00:02:35.480> you'll<00:02:35.720> get<00:02:35.930> your

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
introduction missions you'll get your

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.840 
introduction missions you'll get your
map<00:02:36.350> looking<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.800> little<00:02:37.010> bit<00:02:37.220> like<00:02:37.370> this<00:02:37.550> so

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
map looking a little bit like this so

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.790 
map looking a little bit like this so
there's<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.420> lot<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.600> things<00:02:38.930> here<00:02:39.290> you've<00:02:39.560> got

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
there's a lot of things here you've got

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.949 
there's a lot of things here you've got
experience<00:02:39.950> you've<00:02:40.760> got<00:02:40.970> treasure<00:02:41.510> missions

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
experience you've got treasure missions

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.900 
experience you've got treasure missions
we<00:02:42.140> even<00:02:42.380> have<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.860> cash<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.430> mission<00:02:43.760> already

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
we even have the cash a mission already

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.510 
we even have the cash a mission already
so<00:02:44.690> that's<00:02:44.900> cool<00:02:45.230> caching<00:02:45.770> mission<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.250> going

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
so that's cool caching mission is going

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.400 
so that's cool caching mission is going
to<00:02:46.640> be<00:02:46.760> on<00:02:46.970> your<00:02:47.150> naval<00:02:47.600> missions<00:02:47.780> by<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.200> way

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
to be on your naval missions by the way

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.310 
to be on your naval missions by the way
so<00:02:48.470> no<00:02:49.370> point<00:02:49.670> in<00:02:49.910> trying<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.300> get<00:02:50.420> your<00:02:50.720> your

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
so no point in trying to get your your

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.979 
so no point in trying to get your your
ground<00:02:51.650> followers<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.370> guess<00:02:52.750> up<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:53.959> point

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
ground followers I guess up to a point

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.050 
ground followers I guess up to a point
where<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:54.440> can<00:02:54.620> potentially<00:02:55.340> get<00:02:55.520> healthier

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
where you can potentially get healthier

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.760 
where you can potentially get healthier
cash<00:02:56.360> age<00:02:56.600> that's<00:02:56.810> not<00:02:57.020> going<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.230> happen<00:02:57.350> it's

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
cash age that's not going to happen it's

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.400 
cash age that's not going to happen it's
from<00:02:58.160> your<00:02:58.310> naval<00:02:58.700> missions<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.209> sadly<00:02:59.900> if<00:03:00.230> you

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
from your naval missions so sadly if you

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.260 
from your naval missions so sadly if you
want<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.770> free<00:03:00.980> gear<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.400> will<00:03:01.670> have<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.150> do

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
want that free gear you will have to do

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.520 
want that free gear you will have to do
your<00:03:02.420> shipyard<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.019> all<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.290> good<00:03:03.470> stuff

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
your shipyard and all that good stuff

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.039 
your shipyard and all that good stuff
too<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.700> get<00:03:04.850> these<00:03:05.030> ships<00:03:05.360> up<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.780> running

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
too to get these ships up and running

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.080 
too to get these ships up and running
and<00:03:06.230> eventually<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.580> point<00:03:07.850> where<00:03:08.000> you

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
and eventually to the point where you

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.479 
and eventually to the point where you
can<00:03:08.209> get<00:03:08.330> some<00:03:08.570> some<00:03:09.110> tasty<00:03:09.560> loop<00:03:09.769> so<00:03:10.190> I'm<00:03:10.340> not

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
can get some some tasty loop so I'm not

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.770 
can get some some tasty loop so I'm not
entirely<00:03:10.730> sure<00:03:10.880> how<00:03:11.180> hard<00:03:11.420> that's<00:03:11.540> going<00:03:11.720> to

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
entirely sure how hard that's going to

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.440 
entirely sure how hard that's going to
be<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.900> lot<00:03:12.170> of<00:03:12.230> these<00:03:12.410> have<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:13.220> lot<00:03:14.120> of<00:03:14.150> threats

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
be a lot of these have a lot of threats

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.509 
be a lot of these have a lot of threats
I<00:03:14.720> don't<00:03:15.440> really<00:03:15.590> see<00:03:15.709> how<00:03:15.920> you're<00:03:16.280> going<00:03:16.400> to

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
I don't really see how you're going to

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.830 
I don't really see how you're going to
be<00:03:16.640> able<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.880> counter<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.209> lot<00:03:17.360> of<00:03:17.480> them<00:03:17.570> unless

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
be able to counter a lot of them unless

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.250 
be able to counter a lot of them unless
you<00:03:17.989> have<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.910> lot<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:19.940> boats<00:03:20.510> which<00:03:20.780> are<00:03:20.900> epic

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
you have a lot of boats which are epic

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.100 
you have a lot of boats which are epic
and<00:03:21.489> ship<00:03:22.489> equipment<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.150> this<00:03:23.780> is<00:03:23.930> probably

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
and ship equipment so this is probably

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.990 
and ship equipment so this is probably
going<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.350> be<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.739> little<00:03:25.010> bit<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.489> ramp<00:03:25.760> up

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
going to be a little bit of a ramp up

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.580 
going to be a little bit of a ramp up
but<00:03:26.360> as<00:03:26.450> soon<00:03:26.540> as<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:26.750> get<00:03:26.900> there<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.260> don't

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
but as soon as you get there I don't

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.920 
but as soon as you get there I don't
really<00:03:27.950> see<00:03:28.190> anything<00:03:29.090> standing<00:03:29.630> in<00:03:29.780> your<00:03:29.870> way

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
really see anything standing in your way

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.250 
really see anything standing in your way
so<00:03:30.760> i<00:03:31.760> don't<00:03:32.330> know<00:03:32.390> we'll<00:03:32.600> have<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.840> see<00:03:32.989> either

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
so i don't know we'll have to see either

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.170 
so i don't know we'll have to see either
way<00:03:33.440> these<00:03:33.620> are<00:03:33.680> shaping<00:03:33.980> up<00:03:34.220> beautifully<00:03:34.910> and

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
way these are shaping up beautifully and

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.660 
way these are shaping up beautifully and
this<00:03:35.390> is<00:03:35.540> once<00:03:36.500> again<00:03:36.590> it's<00:03:36.920> it's<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.250> copy<00:03:37.489> of

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
this is once again it's it's a copy of

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.550 
this is once again it's it's a copy of
the<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.180> follower<00:03:38.480> stuff<00:03:38.870> but<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.170> mean<00:03:39.260> we're

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
the the follower stuff but I mean we're

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.840 
the the follower stuff but I mean we're
starting<00:03:39.890> from<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.160> start<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:40.640> there's

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
starting from the start so there's

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.250 
starting from the start so there's
there's<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.360> little<00:03:41.510> bit<00:03:41.630> of<00:03:41.690> reset<00:03:42.080> there

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
there's a little bit of reset there

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.930 
there's a little bit of reset there
which<00:03:42.380> makes<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.709> a<00:03:42.860> little<00:03:43.130> more<00:03:43.280> enjoyable

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
which makes it a little more enjoyable

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.479 
which makes it a little more enjoyable
in<00:03:44.150> my<00:03:44.299> opinion<00:03:44.570> but<00:03:45.110> either<00:03:45.350> way<00:03:45.590> these<00:03:46.220> are

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
in my opinion but either way these are

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.180 
in my opinion but either way these are
these<00:03:47.090> are<00:03:47.150> panning<00:03:48.049> out<00:03:48.170> really<00:03:48.560> nicely<00:03:48.769> and

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
these are panning out really nicely and

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.509 
these are panning out really nicely and
a<00:03:49.880> lot<00:03:50.239> of<00:03:50.390> neuro<00:03:50.989> wards<00:03:51.470> current<00:03:52.100> missions<00:03:52.370> as

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
a lot of neuro wards current missions as

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.640 
a lot of neuro wards current missions as
well<00:03:52.549> which<00:03:52.880> is<00:03:53.030> fantastic<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:53.870> see<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:54.200> lot<00:03:54.620> of

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
well which is fantastic to see a lot of

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.009 
well which is fantastic to see a lot of
the<00:03:54.799> data<00:03:54.950> mind<00:03:55.310> wants<00:03:55.670> incoming<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.390> a<00:03:56.540> pretty

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
the data mind wants incoming a a pretty

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.750 
the data mind wants incoming a a pretty
cool<00:03:57.230> as<00:03:57.410> well<00:03:57.440> a<00:03:57.769> three<00:03:58.100> hundred<00:03:58.220> percent

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
cool as well a three hundred percent

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.080 
cool as well a three hundred percent
experience<00:03:59.570> potion<00:04:00.530> only<00:04:01.190> lasts<00:04:01.549> for<00:04:01.579> 15

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
experience potion only lasts for 15

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.479 
experience potion only lasts for 15
minutes<00:04:02.299> but<00:04:02.570> you<00:04:02.630> can<00:04:02.900> use<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.200> up<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.980> level

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
minutes but you can use it up to level

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.300 
minutes but you can use it up to level
100<00:04:04.989> so<00:04:05.989> that's<00:04:06.230> kind<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:06.620> cool<00:04:06.830> then<00:04:07.160> I'll

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
100 so that's kind of cool then I'll

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.700 
100 so that's kind of cool then I'll
have<00:04:07.489> a<00:04:07.930> bet<00:04:08.930> that's<00:04:09.170> gonna<00:04:09.319> be<00:04:09.590> really<00:04:09.800> rare

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
have a bet that's gonna be really rare

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.100 
have a bet that's gonna be really rare
but<00:04:11.220> either<00:04:11.370> way<00:04:11.580> that's<00:04:12.090> that's<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.810> naval

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
but either way that's that's the naval

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.900
