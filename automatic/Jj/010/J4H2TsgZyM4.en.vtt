00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 of the few is called the new 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.460
 mayor of ulm we know 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.680
 still not exactly when he the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.139
 followed by alexander Wetzig competes 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.150
 elected by the Ulm council of 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.770
 Winning her first comment on this are 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.130
 two themes in my chest are that 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.340
 One is that I do not like to go out 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.800
 tübingen go away and at the same time 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.750
 a quite large respectfully before 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.900
 but at the same time feel the task 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.840
 a great pleasure and in this 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.149
 city ​​the big tasks have quite one 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.750
 It has a great story too 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.270
 Act 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.410
 in development and themes 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.879
 to participate with all 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.160
 Employees employees with the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.390
 colleagues mayor mayor 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.149
 and the mayor and the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.559
 town council I find very exciting is 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.329
 a great job and I 'm happy 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.829
 themselves what are the big issues 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.989
 and the big tasks in the next 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.210
 The first one lasts for eight years 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.480
 Office time I say now 44 are still 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.100
 young enough the second lot of that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.350
 first term will certainly be of the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.909
 projects that are already on the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.500
 I have gone believe that is correct is 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.930
 to focus on the station and 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.460
 I also believe that it is right that 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.650
 to think big and not in small 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.700
 units 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.450
 that will certainly be both the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.430
 financial strength as well as planning the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.640
 Planning the planning resources 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.729
 what to tie over a longer period of time 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.310
 I'm also interested in the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.070
 question of living in the city and the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.920
 ask how do you get it that way 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.350
 living in a city so in structures 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.220
 the urban are opposite the living 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.899
 more attractive in the surrounding communities 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.729
 because I believe that 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.369
 particularity of watches must take place 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.140
 in the region has a great centrality 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.700
 and their quality in the same 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.790
 urban in the urban 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.380
 owns particularity and I think so 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.909
 It is important to work out that quickly 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.770
 When will you become mayor? 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.079
 be in Ulm 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.450
 So I have in one of the last round 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.340
 was in the mayor said that me 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.110
 believe that it is more difficult for ulm 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.200
 to renounce a mayor 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.640
 as for tübingen on 1 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.260
 planning director therefore I believe 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.879
 that a very early date of the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.930
 right is when that will be accurate 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.110
 I assume that he is the first one 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.930
 So, half of June happens june or july 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.420
 will be the correct date of the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.069
 they follow as one through outer ones 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.720
 standardized mayor in the country 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.670
 do not be afraid of big shoes 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.050
 but very much afraid of big school 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.370
 applies to me as one of the 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.080
 renowned in the country and my only one 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.069
 Calm it would have met everyone 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.890
 these big shoes 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.390
 one must maybe I can do 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.390
 at least to put me off
