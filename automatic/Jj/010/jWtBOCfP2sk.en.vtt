00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
figure on it but I've had a look at some

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:02.599 
figure on it but I've had a look at some
of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> statements<00:02:01.770> from<00:02:02.069> clubs<00:02:02.429> who<00:02:02.549> were

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
relegated in recent years he's certainly

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:05.630 
relegated in recent years he's certainly
talking<00:02:04.259> millions<00:02:04.619> probably<00:02:05.069> tens<00:02:05.399> of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
talking millions probably tens of

millions of pounds if they come straight
back<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.700> there<00:02:08.910> will<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.119> some<00:02:09.720> softening<00:02:10.290> of

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
back out there will be some softening of

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.990 
back out there will be some softening of
the<00:02:10.440> blow<00:02:10.680> because<00:02:11.400> they<00:02:11.580> do<00:02:11.640> get<00:02:11.850> what's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
the blow because they do get what's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.370 
the blow because they do get what's
