00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.300 
these two air defenses that we really

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.280 
these two air defenses that we really
have<00:00:13.420> to<00:00:13.450> worry<00:00:13.719> about<00:00:13.809> so<00:00:14.019> we're<00:00:14.110> going<00:00:14.200> to

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
have to worry about so we're going to

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.010 
have to worry about so we're going to
send<00:00:14.559> in<00:00:14.920> to<00:00:15.580> wall<00:00:15.790> breakers<00:00:16.240> one<00:00:16.570> on<00:00:16.779> either

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
send in to wall breakers one on either

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.560 
send in to wall breakers one on either
side<00:00:17.170> and<00:00:17.800> you<00:00:18.310> just<00:00:18.490> send<00:00:18.670> it<00:00:18.760> in<00:00:18.880> those

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
side and you just send it in those

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.150 
side and you just send it in those
obviously<00:00:20.230> those<00:00:20.380> mortars<00:00:20.740> aren't<00:00:21.010> quick

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
obviously those mortars aren't quick

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.410 
obviously those mortars aren't quick
enough<00:00:21.400> to<00:00:21.550> fire<00:00:21.730> on<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:21.970> wall<00:00:22.119> breaker

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
enough to fire on the wall breaker

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.689 
enough to fire on the wall breaker
before<00:00:22.750> he<00:00:22.869> explodes<00:00:23.140> and<00:00:23.710> destroys<00:00:24.160> the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
before he explodes and destroys the

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.240 
before he explodes and destroys the
walls<00:00:24.910> and<00:00:25.269> then<00:00:25.600> we're<00:00:26.199> going<00:00:26.380> to<00:00:26.500> spam<00:00:26.949> some

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
walls and then we're going to spam some

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.000 
walls and then we're going to spam some
barbarians<00:00:27.880> in<00:00:28.029> here<00:00:28.269> to<00:00:28.480> take<00:00:28.840> out<00:00:29.080> those<00:00:29.619> air

further out just one on each side have

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.279 
further out just one on each side have
the<00:00:48.550> mortar<00:00:48.850> fire<00:00:49.149> before<00:00:49.510> you<00:00:49.899> bring<00:00:50.079> in<00:00:50.260> your

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
the mortar fire before you bring in your

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.410 
the mortar fire before you bring in your
other<00:00:50.649> group<00:00:50.920> of<00:00:51.070> barbarians<00:00:51.520> so<00:00:51.700> then<00:00:51.879> we

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
other group of barbarians so then we

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.750 
other group of barbarians so then we
bring<00:00:52.719> in<00:00:52.989> a<00:00:53.289> balloon<00:00:53.739> on<00:00:54.039> either<00:00:54.370> side

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
bring in a balloon on either side

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.920 
bring in a balloon on either side
unfortunately<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.480> balloon<00:00:55.629> on<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:55.780> right

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
unfortunately the balloon on the right

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.750 
unfortunately the balloon on the right
hand<00:00:56.050> side<00:00:56.170> didn't<00:00:56.500> go<00:00:56.590> directly<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.399> the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
hand side didn't go directly to the

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.930 
hand side didn't go directly to the
wizard<00:00:58.270> tower<00:00:58.600> but<00:00:58.960> he's<00:00:59.710> still<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.760> know<00:01:00.820> the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
wizard tower but he's still you know the

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.810 
wizard tower but he's still you know the
wizard<00:01:01.180> tower<00:01:01.359> isn't<00:01:02.489> really<00:01:03.489> upgrade<00:01:03.789> a

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
wizard tower isn't really upgrade a

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.130 
wizard tower isn't really upgrade a
thing<00:01:04.030> I<00:01:04.089> don't<00:01:04.270> know<00:01:04.330> what<00:01:04.479> level<00:01:04.720> it<00:01:04.839> is<00:01:04.869> it's

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
thing I don't know what level it is it's

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.050 
thing I don't know what level it is it's
a<00:01:05.199> lower<00:01:05.379> level<00:01:05.590> wizard<00:01:05.890> tower<00:01:06.190> so<00:01:06.490> it<00:01:06.820> really

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
a lower level wizard tower so it really

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.240 
a lower level wizard tower so it really
wasn't<00:01:07.390> an<00:01:07.659> issue<00:01:07.900> it<00:01:08.530> didn't<00:01:08.979> take<00:01:09.130> the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
wasn't an issue it didn't take the

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.310 
wasn't an issue it didn't take the
balloon<00:01:09.369> down<00:01:09.640> before<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.119> was<00:01:10.180> able<00:01:10.420> to<00:01:10.689> go<00:01:11.080> in

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
balloon down before it was able to go in

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.770 
balloon down before it was able to go in
and<00:01:11.680> take<00:01:12.400> down<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.820> wizard<00:01:13.030> tower<00:01:13.180> alright

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
and take down the wizard tower alright

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.950 
and take down the wizard tower alright
so<00:01:14.049> two<00:01:14.260> balloons<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:15.340> wall<00:01:15.549> breakers<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.420> two

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
so two balloons to wall breakers and two

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.840 
so two balloons to wall breakers and two
groups<00:01:17.350> of<00:01:18.689> barbarians<00:01:19.689> and<00:01:19.869> we're<00:01:19.990> still<00:01:20.259> at

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
groups of barbarians and we're still at

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.719 
groups of barbarians and we're still at
30,000<00:01:21.850> gold<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.299> 30,000<00:01:22.960> elixir<00:01:23.530> for<00:01:24.250> chimp

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
30,000 gold and 30,000 elixir for chimp

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.450 
30,000 gold and 30,000 elixir for chimp
and<00:01:24.880> armor<00:01:25.270> here<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:26.740> think<00:01:26.830> we<00:01:27.159> ended<00:01:27.250> up

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
and armor here so I think we ended up

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.539 
and armor here so I think we ended up
spending<00:01:27.880> we<00:01:28.270> probably<00:01:28.479> spent<00:01:28.990> close<00:01:29.409> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
spending we probably spent close to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.050 
spending we probably spent close to
20,000<00:01:30.549> elixir<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:32.680> know<00:01:32.799> it<00:01:33.100> all<00:01:33.790> depends

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
20,000 elixir so you know it all depends

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.080 
20,000 elixir so you know it all depends
as<00:01:34.240> we<00:01:34.390> go<00:01:34.509> further<00:01:34.750> in<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:36.310> return

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
as we go further in the the return

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.149 
as we go further in the the return
scales<00:01:37.509> right<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:38.259> we<00:01:38.380> have<00:01:38.409> a<00:01:38.560> bunch<00:01:38.860> of<00:01:38.950> maps

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
scales right so we have a bunch of maps

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.710 
scales right so we have a bunch of maps
that<00:01:39.280> are<00:01:39.400> thirty<00:01:39.640> thousand<00:01:40.060> thirty<00:01:40.090> thousand

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
that are thirty thousand thirty thousand

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.289 
that are thirty thousand thirty thousand
before<00:01:41.470> we<00:01:41.560> had<00:01:41.680> 20,000<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.729> it's<00:01:42.970> going<00:01:43.180> to

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
before we had 20,000 and it's going to

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.330 
before we had 20,000 and it's going to
jump<00:01:43.630> up<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:44.020> think<00:01:44.350> in<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.530> couple<00:01:44.560> of<00:01:44.890> maps<00:01:45.040> to

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
jump up I think in a couple of maps to

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.810 
jump up I think in a couple of maps to
50,000<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.409> think<00:01:47.920> as<00:01:48.369> you<00:01:48.399> progress

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
50,000 so I think as you progress

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.160 
50,000 so I think as you progress
further<00:01:49.360> within<00:01:50.320> that<00:01:51.030> grouping<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.299> whatever

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
further within that grouping of whatever
