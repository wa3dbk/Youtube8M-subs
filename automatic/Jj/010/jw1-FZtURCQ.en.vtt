 of the villagers are common 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.209

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.370

 back has a garden no 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.950
 a very, very big advantage when the 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.870
 I saw I was blown here 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.120
 a house full of book shelves and 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.590
 It also has plates made with chairs and 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.430

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.680
 I used 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.170
 As you can see here, the other house has a well 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.130
 I settled in this house because I see it 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.150
 It's the biggest and I do not know and it's very 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.340

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.450
 excellence within when they are in the 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.380
 village be attentive go forwards 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.380
 for here it's worth 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.140
 I thought a long time ago and if I

 and when they get here they watch TV 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:41.000
 here and you will say this 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.740
 Well, here you will see that there are four 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.490
 little squares I discovered this without 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.710
 want to pick ice 4 and you will chop again and 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.280
 you will find a dungeon 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.280
 skeletons 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:00.680
 the dungeon has a frame grains of 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.540
 cocoa wheat a bucket and ingots like good 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.420

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.319
 and nothing a 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.239
 a 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.830
 skeleton dungeon where they can 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.020
 get your things and all 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.670
 he will be the secret that I discovered that what 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.620
 I discovered without you are pretty the stones 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.560
 and this square I started to apply and 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.640
 when I saw it I was blown away now if 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.980
 they are going to make this seed a 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.170
 survival I will tell you where there is 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.350
 a good mine is worth and where can they get 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:34.540
 of all this is the town as they continue 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.139
 straight is still in straight 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.960
 around here pretty much 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.979
 around here and where you have to make them 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.909
 attentive here they will see I thought that what 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.909
 find that I'm disoriented 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.530
 is where there are pigs worth 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.530
 I thought that I do not place myself 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.590
 here but they go this way they go here I 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.010
 I'm taking from the beginning to 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.290
 that sees the town does not jump and this 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.210
 mountain that is here keep going straight and 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.580
 climb this mountain rounds it and what 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.360
 you want and where there is pork I did not kill it 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.570
 that's why you 'll see here a hole for forgiveness 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.570
 here 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.900
 this hole leads to an infinite mine 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.840
 Come on, it 's incredibly big, as you can see 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.100
 Look, it has lava and everything and it's full 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.660
 minerals 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.340
 here there is gold 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.290
 is that I already know him because he has 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:37.270
 chopped almost whole out there I think not 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:39.430
 there's nothing here iron out there like that because 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.070
 there was emerald iron today there was no 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:46.150
 seen then I come to chop it here there 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.040
 Esmeralda also wait, ah, do not walk 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.849
 I thought the minerals came out the same 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.659
 in all the more 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:56.669
 and there are mushrooms in my world here 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:59.669
 they came out four but good out there no longer 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:03.589
 there is nothing and good is a very large mine 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.589
 because on top it's still here 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.270
 it follows here the truth that there are many 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.510
 clips and I found quite 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.270
 look at a cascade of truth this 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.240
 waterfall leaves the air but good 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:23.010
 and nothing then go down here down to 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.010
 iron and will continue to go down 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.340
 and I do not know already you are looking for more 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.280
 safe exit that I imagine that I now 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:36.500
 I do not see them and well that was all it was for 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.540
 that they saw this peculiar seed 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.710
 until another do not forget to subscribe to 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.710
 channel and up to another
