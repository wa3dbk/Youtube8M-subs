 hilum voting as a bright hdi and was 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.540
 a display that breaks nothing that 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:43.060
 take care of with the display of the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.020

 the camera key the volume key 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.920
 input for the micro sd so we know 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.210
 which is expandable 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.930
 as we can see a monoblock is not 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.549
 openable it is built very well indeed 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.960
 rear 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.210
 to me it seems I really see the display 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.259
 very nice and bright we try to see 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.300
 an image that its as bad as you can 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.940
 see excellent definition and display 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.070
 really very beautiful and bright like 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.630
 we can see from the image we go out 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.390
 let's see if there is 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.610
 they are something we see in the gallery 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.250

 Here we have this robot 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.110
 it is not clear we live because those 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.110
 state 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.320
 feelings 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.320
 some have come what 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.940
 it turned out that life 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.800
 to ask good in mind 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.590
 a great product and this goes to 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.470
 fill the gaps of the precise interjet a 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.080
 1 now we don't have the official price 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.910
 because they presented it recently 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.710
 we were somewhere else 21 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.720
 however, there is nothing to say 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.850
 really very nice very fast 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.910
 the interface as you can see is 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.210
 always the same may like it or not 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.600
 pleasure very very simple and fast from 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.160
 use with four customizations 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.040
 we say we have ours 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.269
 power framework was a good one 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.500
 truth we have the various applications here 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.650
 and we can dispose 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.799
 good alphabetical like 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.799
 Hello 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.210
 we expected it all came 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.370
 display resolution remained a 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.640
 full hd but on the other hand I don't know 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.080
 I don't see the utility of going further and going 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.000
 well then we'll try as usual 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.549
 having it at home therefore useful to do tests 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.530
 various because so much is a presentation 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.120
 so it 's okay with the present 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.190
 when can I tell you how the battery is going 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.470
 doubt think from with this windy 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.900
