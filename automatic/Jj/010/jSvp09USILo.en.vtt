00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
we are in the fire render engine and we

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.379 
we are in the fire render engine and we
know<00:00:09.190> that<00:00:09.370> we<00:00:09.459> are<00:00:09.610> because<00:00:09.910> right<00:00:10.150> now<00:00:10.180> we

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:10.389 
know that we are because right now we

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.420 
know that we are because right now we
have<00:00:10.690> this<00:00:10.900> red<00:00:11.230> button<00:00:11.410> that<00:00:11.680> says<00:00:11.889> stop<00:00:12.219> and

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
have this red button that says stop and

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.209 
have this red button that says stop and
if<00:00:12.490> we<00:00:12.549> cook<00:00:12.699> that<00:00:12.879> this<00:00:13.590> interactive<00:00:14.590> render

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
if we cook that this interactive render

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.519 
if we cook that this interactive render
settings<00:00:15.760> will<00:00:15.969> stop<00:00:16.390> and<00:00:16.690> it<00:00:17.230> will<00:00:17.350> no<00:00:17.500> longer

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
settings will stop and it will no longer

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.070 
settings will stop and it will no longer
be<00:00:18.039> interactive<00:00:18.730> however<00:00:19.449> as<00:00:19.630> long<00:00:19.810> as<00:00:19.960> this

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
be interactive however as long as this

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.900 
be interactive however as long as this
is<00:00:20.140> interactive<00:00:20.740> we<00:00:20.830> can<00:00:21.009> do<00:00:21.099> things<00:00:21.310> like<00:00:21.429> for

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
is interactive we can do things like for

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.269 
is interactive we can do things like for
instance<00:00:21.939> change<00:00:22.570> our<00:00:22.839> car<00:00:23.080> paint<00:00:23.320> color<00:00:23.529> so

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
instance change our car paint color so

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.640 
instance change our car paint color so
I'll<00:00:24.429> do<00:00:24.580> that<00:00:24.730> now<00:00:25.300> notice<00:00:25.509> that<00:00:25.660> having<00:00:26.169> HDR

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
I'll do that now notice that having HDR

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.460 
I'll do that now notice that having HDR
StudioLive<00:00:27.279> open<00:00:27.910> does<00:00:28.269> not<00:00:28.449> impact<00:00:28.929> that<00:00:29.289> at

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
StudioLive open does not impact that at

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.569 
StudioLive open does not impact that at
all<00:00:29.560> as<00:00:29.769> a<00:00:29.800> matter<00:00:29.859> of<00:00:30.039> fact<00:00:30.099> if<00:00:30.310> we<00:00:30.369> make<00:00:30.550> a

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
all as a matter of fact if we make a

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.970 
all as a matter of fact if we make a
change<00:00:30.880> here<00:00:31.089> in<00:00:31.119> HDR<00:00:31.480> StudioLive<00:00:32.079> it<00:00:32.770> will

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
change here in HDR StudioLive it will

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.270 
change here in HDR StudioLive it will
also<00:00:33.160> give<00:00:33.550> us<00:00:33.700> live<00:00:34.090> feedback<00:00:34.660> as<00:00:35.080> well<00:00:35.280> now

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
also give us live feedback as well now

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.950 
also give us live feedback as well now
by<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.520> way<00:00:36.610> what<00:00:37.090> you<00:00:37.120> just<00:00:37.360> saw<00:00:37.540> me<00:00:37.570> do<00:00:37.840> is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
by the way what you just saw me do is

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.720 
by the way what you just saw me do is
probably<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.530> single<00:00:38.860> most<00:00:38.890> important<00:00:39.550> thing

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
probably the single most important thing

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.310 
probably the single most important thing
that<00:00:39.760> you<00:00:39.970> can<00:00:40.090> understand<00:00:40.540> to<00:00:40.870> begin<00:00:41.020> with

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
that you can understand to begin with

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.140 
that you can understand to begin with
when<00:00:41.500> working<00:00:41.710> with<00:00:41.860> HDR<00:00:42.340> lights<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:42.790> do<00:00:42.940> and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
when working with HDR lights to do and

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.510 
when working with HDR lights to do and
that<00:00:43.780> is<00:00:43.810> this<00:00:44.320> background<00:00:44.620> button<00:00:45.370> right

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
that is this background button right

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.190 
that is this background button right
here<00:00:45.550> this<00:00:46.300> background<00:00:46.570> button<00:00:47.050> right<00:00:47.170> here

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
here this background button right here

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.320 
here this background button right here
enables<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.250> background<00:00:48.670> by<00:00:48.820> default<00:00:49.120> the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
enables the background by default the

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.390 
enables the background by default the
background<00:00:49.720> will<00:00:49.810> be<00:00:49.900> turned<00:00:50.230> on<00:00:50.470> now<00:00:50.800> this

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
background will be turned on now this

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.770 
background will be turned on now this
appear<00:00:51.760> allows<00:00:51.970> you<00:00:52.150> to<00:00:52.240> set<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.600> background

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
appear allows you to set the background

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.630 
appear allows you to set the background
we<00:00:53.110> can<00:00:53.290> change<00:00:53.530> those<00:00:53.980> background<00:00:54.430> settings

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
we can change those background settings

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.320 
we can change those background settings
but<00:00:54.970> by<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:55.660> large<00:00:55.990> I<00:00:56.770> would<00:00:57.070> say<00:00:57.280> turn<00:00:58.120> off

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
but by and large I would say turn off

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.990 
but by and large I would say turn off
the<00:00:58.780> background<00:00:59.290> when<00:00:59.710> you<00:00:59.860> first<00:01:00.130> open<00:01:00.550> HTR

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
the background when you first open HTR

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.950 
the background when you first open HTR
live<00:01:01.150> studio<00:01:01.420> and<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.660> reason<00:01:01.840> why<00:01:01.930> is

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
live studio and the reason why is

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.990 
live studio and the reason why is
because<00:01:02.050> it's<00:01:02.890> going<00:01:03.010> to<00:01:03.100> give<00:01:03.250> you<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.460> harder

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
because it's going to give you a harder

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.820 
because it's going to give you a harder
time<00:01:04.210> at<00:01:04.449> judging<00:01:04.900> what's<00:01:05.080> really<00:01:05.409> going<00:01:05.680> on

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
time at judging what's really going on

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.919 
time at judging what's really going on
with<00:01:06.250> your<00:01:06.549> light<00:01:06.850> sources<00:01:07.359> which<00:01:07.570> is<00:01:07.719> really

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:07.929 
with your light sources which is really

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:09.950 
with your light sources which is really
the<00:01:08.079> point<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.920> software<00:01:09.280> in<00:01:09.490> my<00:01:09.640> opinion

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the point of the software in my opinion

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.480 
the point of the software in my opinion
so<00:01:10.960> like<00:01:11.289> I<00:01:11.409> said<00:01:11.469> we<00:01:11.710> can<00:01:11.890> go<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:12.340> we<00:01:12.460> can

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
so like I said we can go and we can

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.459 
so like I said we can go and we can
change<00:01:12.880> our<00:01:13.240> materials<00:01:13.689> until<00:01:13.840> we<00:01:13.990> find<00:01:14.259> one

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
change our materials until we find one

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:15.840 
change our materials until we find one
that<00:01:14.619> we're<00:01:14.740> happy<00:01:15.009> with<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:15.399> think<00:01:15.609> that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
that we're happy with and I think that

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.809 
that we're happy with and I think that
sort<00:01:16.600> of<00:01:16.659> kopi<00:01:17.170> gold<00:01:17.530> looks<00:01:18.100> really<00:01:18.399> nice<00:01:18.520> it's

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
sort of kopi gold looks really nice it's

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:20.999 
sort of kopi gold looks really nice it's
a<00:01:18.880> good<00:01:19.060> car<00:01:19.359> paint<00:01:19.630> color<00:01:19.840> so<00:01:20.560> we'll<00:01:20.770> settle

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
a good car paint color so we'll settle

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.609 
a good car paint color so we'll settle
for<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:21.399> for<00:01:21.640> right<00:01:21.789> now<00:01:22.049> now<00:01:23.049> I<00:01:23.289> told<00:01:23.499> you

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
for that for right now now I told you

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.760 
for that for right now now I told you
before<00:01:23.829> that<00:01:23.859> we<00:01:24.009> can<00:01:24.189> switch<00:01:24.579> to<00:01:24.909> different

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
before that we can switch to different

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.200 
before that we can switch to different
layouts<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.039> so<00:01:27.189> I'm<00:01:27.249> going<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:27.429> go<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.700> one<00:01:28.149> of

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
layouts and so I'm going to go to one of

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.789 
layouts and so I'm going to go to one of
my<00:01:28.299> layouts<00:01:28.600> that<00:01:28.719> I<00:01:28.810> have<00:01:29.020> here<00:01:29.200> which<00:01:29.409> is<00:01:29.590> my

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
my layouts that I have here which is my

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.190 
my layouts that I have here which is my
environmental<00:01:30.340> work<00:01:30.700> space<00:01:30.999> and<00:01:31.200> this

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
environmental work space and this

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.520 
environmental work space and this
environment<00:01:32.829> work<00:01:32.950> space<00:01:33.329> allows<00:01:34.329> us<00:01:34.659> to<00:01:34.929> be

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
environment work space allows us to be

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.529 
environment work space allows us to be
in<00:01:35.799> our<00:01:36.219> interactive<00:01:36.609> preview<00:01:37.060> but<00:01:37.210> at<00:01:37.299> a<00:01:37.329> much

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
in our interactive preview but at a much

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.239 
in our interactive preview but at a much
larger<00:01:38.109> size<00:01:38.289> which<00:01:38.499> is<00:01:38.530> reason<00:01:38.859> why<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:38.979> set<00:01:39.159> it

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:39.249 
larger size which is reason why I set it

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:40.709 
larger size which is reason why I set it
up<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.429> way<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.579> set<00:01:39.850> it<00:01:39.939> up<00:01:39.969> it<00:01:40.569> currently

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
up the way I set it up it currently

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.389 
up the way I set it up it currently
doesn't<00:01:41.049> allow<00:01:41.289> me<00:01:41.439> to<00:01:41.530> change<00:01:41.799> anything<00:01:42.100> like

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
doesn't allow me to change anything like

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:43.950 
doesn't allow me to change anything like
my<00:01:42.700> materials<00:01:43.240> or<00:01:43.450> any<00:01:43.569> of<00:01:43.659> that<00:01:43.689> kind<00:01:43.869> of

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
my materials or any of that kind of

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.239 
my materials or any of that kind of
stuff<00:01:44.170> but<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.499> allows<00:01:44.649> me<00:01:44.679> to<00:01:44.920> get<00:01:45.039> a<00:01:45.069> much

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249 
stuff but it allows me to get a much

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:48.569 
stuff but it allows me to get a much
larger<00:01:45.819> preview<00:01:46.299> of<00:01:46.450> my<00:01:47.319> render<00:01:47.859> plus<00:01:48.100> I<00:01:48.280> can

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
larger preview of my render plus I can

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.940 
larger preview of my render plus I can
leave<00:01:49.389> a<00:01:49.420> little<00:01:49.509> bit<00:01:49.689> more<00:01:49.869> room<00:01:50.049> for<00:01:50.439> my<00:01:50.590> HD

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
leave a little bit more room for my HD

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.449 
leave a little bit more room for my HD
our<00:01:51.039> live<00:01:51.249> studio<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:51.909> like<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.079> so<00:01:53.439> the<00:01:54.310> other

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
our live studio I like that so the other

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.459 
our live studio I like that so the other
thing<00:01:54.490> here<00:01:55.030> about<00:01:55.359> how<00:01:55.600> fireworks<00:01:55.959> let's

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
thing here about how fireworks let's

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.020 
thing here about how fireworks let's
talk<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.770> little<00:01:56.859> bit<00:01:57.069> about<00:01:57.219> these<00:01:57.429> options

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
talk a little bit about these options

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.100 
talk a little bit about these options
for<00:01:58.270> fire

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
for fire

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.380 
for fire
if<00:02:00.770> we<00:02:00.890> go<00:02:01.010> to<00:02:01.100> settings<00:02:01.760> which<00:02:02.060> is<00:02:02.210> under

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
if we go to settings which is under

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.680 
if we go to settings which is under
options<00:02:03.070> we're<00:02:04.070> using<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:04.550> sample<00:02:04.760> level<00:02:05.150> of<00:02:05.240> 7

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
options we're using a sample level of 7

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.180 
options we're using a sample level of 7
and<00:02:05.810> we're<00:02:05.960> using<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.230> quality<00:02:06.710> of<00:02:06.800> two<00:02:06.950> well

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
and we're using a quality of two well

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.460 
and we're using a quality of two well
what<00:02:07.340> is<00:02:07.490> this<00:02:07.670> quality<00:02:08.300> mean<00:02:08.600> this<00:02:08.899> is<00:02:09.200> the

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
what is this quality mean this is the

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.490 
what is this quality mean this is the
resolution<00:02:09.950> of<00:02:10.450> this<00:02:11.450> preview<00:02:11.960> render<00:02:12.110> engine

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
resolution of this preview render engine

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.200 
resolution of this preview render engine
so<00:02:12.650> if<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:12.860> boost<00:02:13.250> up<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:15.280> resolution<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.670> I

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
so if I boost up this resolution and I

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.570 
so if I boost up this resolution and I
boost<00:02:17.510> up<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.690> sampling<00:02:18.200> level<00:02:18.500> like<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:18.950> and

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
boost up the sampling level like so and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.880 
boost up the sampling level like so and
I<00:02:19.640> hit<00:02:19.760> ok<00:02:20.260> we're<00:02:21.260> going<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.440> see<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.650> much

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
I hit ok we're going to see a much

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.560 
I hit ok we're going to see a much
sharper<00:02:22.400> image<00:02:22.970> something<00:02:23.270> that's<00:02:23.390> going<00:02:23.510> to

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
sharper image something that's going to

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.330 
sharper image something that's going to
give<00:02:23.690> us<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.900> much<00:02:24.050> more<00:02:24.230> true<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.040> finished

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
give us a much more true to the finished

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.210 
give us a much more true to the finished
Maxwell<00:02:26.000> output<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.890> it's<00:02:27.890> going<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.100> take

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
Maxwell output and it's going to take

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.830 
Maxwell output and it's going to take
longer<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.760> course<00:02:28.970> but<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.420> flipside<00:02:29.660> is

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
longer of course but the flipside is

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.060 
longer of course but the flipside is
that<00:02:29.990> we're<00:02:30.320> going<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.500> get<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.620> much<00:02:30.830> better

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
that we're going to get a much better

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.710 
that we're going to get a much better
idea<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.459> what's<00:02:31.790> really<00:02:32.120> going<00:02:32.360> on<00:02:32.450> with<00:02:32.600> this

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
idea of what's really going on with this

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.140 
idea of what's really going on with this
image<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.920> let's<00:02:34.130> go<00:02:34.280> back<00:02:34.310> over<00:02:34.640> here<00:02:34.910> while

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
image so let's go back over here while

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.250 
image so let's go back over here while
we're<00:02:35.360> working<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.840> let's<00:02:35.959> talk<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.170> little

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
we're working and let's talk a little

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.710 
we're working and let's talk a little
bit<00:02:36.560> about<00:02:36.800> this<00:02:37.370> HDR<00:02:38.090> light<00:02:38.300> studio

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
bit about this HDR light studio

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.310 
bit about this HDR light studio
interface<00:02:39.230> what's<00:02:39.650> really<00:02:40.400> going<00:02:40.850> on<00:02:40.970> here

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
interface what's really going on here

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.210 
interface what's really going on here
well<00:02:42.320> this<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.310> HDR<00:02:44.350> canvas<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.560> what

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
well this is the HDR canvas and what

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.360 
well this is the HDR canvas and what
this<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.610> this<00:02:46.820> is<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.180> latitude<00:02:47.720> longitude

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
this is is this is a latitude longitude

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.600 
this is is this is a latitude longitude
format<00:02:49.370> spherical<00:02:50.180> mapping<00:02:50.720> type<00:02:51.050> HDR<00:02:51.739> so<00:02:52.550> you

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
format spherical mapping type HDR so you

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.120 
format spherical mapping type HDR so you
may<00:02:52.910> be<00:02:52.970> familiar<00:02:53.330> with<00:02:53.570> other<00:02:53.840> types<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.350> hrs

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
may be familiar with other types of hrs

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.949 
may be familiar with other types of hrs
but<00:02:55.310> all<00:02:55.550> of<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.209> HDR<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:56.690> you'll<00:02:56.870> be<00:02:56.930> working

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
but all of the HDR so you'll be working

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.620 
but all of the HDR so you'll be working
with<00:02:57.350> in<00:02:57.590> HDR<00:02:57.980> light<00:02:58.160> StudioLive<00:02:58.730> are<00:02:58.970> going

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
with in HDR light StudioLive are going

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.680 
with in HDR light StudioLive are going
to<00:02:59.750> be<00:02:59.930> set<00:03:00.410> up<00:03:00.530> in<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.770> latitude<00:03:01.400> longitude

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
to be set up in the latitude longitude

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.300 
to be set up in the latitude longitude
format<00:03:02.690> now<00:03:03.380> what<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:03.680> basically<00:03:03.860> means<00:03:04.040> is

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
format now what that basically means is

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.009 
format now what that basically means is
that<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:04.519> twice<00:03:04.760> as<00:03:04.820> wide<00:03:05.120> as<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.660> tall<00:03:05.959> and

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
that is twice as wide as it is tall and

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.620 
that is twice as wide as it is tall and
it's<00:03:06.350> wrapped<00:03:06.590> in<00:03:06.799> a<00:03:06.920> sphere<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.239> right

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
it's wrapped in a sphere so the right

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.120 
it's wrapped in a sphere so the right
here<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:08.930> orange<00:03:09.350> line<00:03:09.530> represents<00:03:09.560> the

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
here this orange line represents the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.820 
here this orange line represents the
horizon<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:10.790> then<00:03:11.600> we<00:03:12.019> have<00:03:12.260> different<00:03:12.680> lines

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
horizon and then we have different lines

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.460 
horizon and then we have different lines
here<00:03:13.070> representing<00:03:13.640> our<00:03:13.880> different<00:03:14.470> points

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
here representing our different points

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.850 
here representing our different points
in<00:03:15.590> space<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:16.760> this<00:03:17.720> can<00:03:17.930> be<00:03:18.049> useful<00:03:18.230> way<00:03:18.830> of

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
in space so this can be useful way of

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.250 
in space so this can be useful way of
aligning<00:03:19.489> your<00:03:20.060> light<00:03:20.450> objects<00:03:20.870> as<00:03:21.019> you're

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
aligning your light objects as you're

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.170 
aligning your light objects as you're
moving<00:03:21.380> them<00:03:21.680> around<00:03:21.739> on<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.190> canvas<00:03:22.549> however

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
moving them around on the canvas however

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.870 
moving them around on the canvas however
you<00:03:23.420> also<00:03:23.450> have<00:03:23.780> this<00:03:23.900> cubic<00:03:24.440> method<00:03:25.070> and<00:03:25.250> this

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
you also have this cubic method and this

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.100 
you also have this cubic method and this
just<00:03:26.239> gives<00:03:26.299> us<00:03:26.570> a<00:03:26.600> different<00:03:26.780> way<00:03:27.080> of

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
just gives us a different way of

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.860 
just gives us a different way of
aligning<00:03:27.920> our<00:03:28.340> options<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:29.000> let<00:03:29.630> me<00:03:29.690> grab<00:03:29.840> a

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
aligning our options so let me grab a

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.910 
aligning our options so let me grab a
square<00:03:30.200> here<00:03:30.350> and<00:03:30.440> you'll<00:03:30.530> see<00:03:30.680> what<00:03:30.799> I<00:03:30.830> mean

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
square here and you'll see what I mean

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.970 
square here and you'll see what I mean
so<00:03:32.550> this<00:03:32.970> is<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.180> square<00:03:33.690> sort<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.709> primitive

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
so this is a square sort of primitive

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.800 
so this is a square sort of primitive
shape<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:36.120> we<00:03:36.209> were<00:03:36.300> going<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.480> work<00:03:36.630> with

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
shape that we were going to work with

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.270 
shape that we were going to work with
and<00:03:37.349> I'm<00:03:37.440> just<00:03:37.500> going<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.770> set<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.010> for

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
and I'm just going to set this for

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.839 
and I'm just going to set this for
something<00:03:38.730> like<00:03:38.880> 50<00:03:39.300> and<00:03:39.980> 50<00:03:40.980> on<00:03:41.160> our<00:03:41.520> width

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
something like 50 and 50 on our width

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.010 
something like 50 and 50 on our width
and<00:03:42.090> height<00:03:42.239> then<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.480> can<00:03:42.599> see<00:03:42.690> that<00:03:42.720> fits

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
and height then you can see that fits

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.770 
and height then you can see that fits
perfectly<00:03:43.530> within<00:03:44.400> one<00:03:44.880> of<00:03:44.910> these<00:03:45.180> cubic

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
perfectly within one of these cubic

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.660 
perfectly within one of these cubic
guides<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.500> for<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:46.800> matter<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.190> also<00:03:47.520> fits

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
guides and for that matter it also fits

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.750 
guides and for that matter it also fits
perfectly<00:03:48.170> down<00:03:49.170> here<00:03:49.530> at<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.620> bottom<00:03:49.730> so<00:03:50.730> you

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
perfectly down here at the bottom so you

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.210 
perfectly down here at the bottom so you
can<00:03:51.030> see<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.360> can<00:03:51.540> build<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:52.080> room<00:03:52.530> by

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
can see that you can build a room by

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.610 
can see that you can build a room by
using<00:03:53.520> these<00:03:53.790> cubic<00:03:54.209> guides<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.690> using<00:03:55.350> these

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
using these cubic guides and using these

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.809 
using these cubic guides and using these
square<00:03:56.420> primitive<00:03:57.560> synthetic<00:03:58.560> lights<00:03:59.010> but

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
square primitive synthetic lights but

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.280 
square primitive synthetic lights but
I'm<00:03:59.940> going<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.120> primarily<00:04:00.450> stick<00:04:00.989> with<00:04:01.140> this

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
I'm going to primarily stick with this

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.720 
I'm going to primarily stick with this
spherical<00:04:01.620> mapping<00:04:02.069> because<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.340> find<00:04:02.580> it<00:04:02.670> to

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
spherical mapping because I find it to

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.070 
spherical mapping because I find it to
be<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.910> little<00:04:02.970> bit<00:04:03.180> more<00:04:03.420> useful<00:04:03.780> however

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
be a little bit more useful however

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.809 
be a little bit more useful however
you're<00:04:04.650> free<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:04.980> switch<00:04:05.160> between<00:04:05.310> these<00:04:05.640> two

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
you're free to switch between these two

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.300 
you're free to switch between these two
at<00:04:05.970> any<00:04:06.090> point<00:04:06.269> in<00:04:06.420> time<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.600> you<00:04:06.870> like<00:04:07.310> also

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
at any point in time that you like also

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.100 
at any point in time that you like also
notice<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:08.730> we<00:04:08.910> have<00:04:08.940> an<00:04:09.120> undo<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.720> redo

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
notice that we have an undo and a redo

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.259 
notice that we have an undo and a redo

with<00:05:01.550> our<00:05:01.730> not<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.230> I<00:05:03.230> can<00:05:03.470> duplicate<00:05:03.860> that<00:05:04.130> by

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
with our not and I can duplicate that by

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.920 
with our not and I can duplicate that by
clicking<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.970> second<00:05:05.270> little<00:05:05.420> icon<00:05:05.660> next<00:05:05.840> to

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
clicking the second little icon next to

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.900 
clicking the second little icon next to
the<00:05:05.990> trash<00:05:06.260> can<00:05:06.490> what<00:05:07.490> that's<00:05:07.640> going<00:05:07.730> to<00:05:07.790> let

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
the trash can what that's going to let

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.190 
the trash can what that's going to let
me<00:05:08.030> to<00:05:08.090> do<00:05:08.240> is<00:05:08.390> it's<00:05:08.570> going<00:05:08.720> to<00:05:08.840> allow<00:05:08.900> me<00:05:09.170> to

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
me to do is it's going to allow me to

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.270 
me to do is it's going to allow me to
have<00:05:09.470> a<00:05:09.740> second

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
have a second

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.820 
have a second
primitive<00:05:12.240> created<00:05:12.600> from<00:05:13.260> whatever<00:05:13.530> the

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
primitive created from whatever the

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.170 
primitive created from whatever the
settings<00:05:14.130> were<00:05:14.310> at<00:05:14.400> this<00:05:14.520> time<00:05:14.760> so<00:05:15.000> if<00:05:15.090> I

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
settings were at this time so if I

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.540 
settings were at this time so if I
change<00:05:15.570> for<00:05:15.930> instance<00:05:16.710> if<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:16.950> go<00:05:17.100> back<00:05:17.130> to<00:05:17.430> this

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
change for instance if I go back to this

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.010 
change for instance if I go back to this
one<00:05:17.760> and<00:05:17.790> I<00:05:17.910> change<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.510> settings<00:05:18.840> to

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
one and I change the settings to

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.010 
one and I change the settings to
something<00:05:19.380> like<00:05:19.530> 200<00:05:20.400> watts<00:05:20.880> and<00:05:21.210> instead<00:05:21.930> of

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
something like 200 watts and instead of

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.650 
something like 200 watts and instead of
500<00:05:22.500> watts<00:05:23.000> you'll<00:05:24.000> see<00:05:24.150> that<00:05:24.270> not<00:05:24.419> only<00:05:24.510> is

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
500 watts you'll see that not only is

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.879 
500 watts you'll see that not only is
that<00:05:24.690> change<00:05:25.080> made<00:05:25.380> but<00:05:25.560> when<00:05:25.650> I<00:05:25.680> make<00:05:25.860> a

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
that change made but when I make a

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.920 
that change made but when I make a
duplicate<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:27.090> duplicate<00:05:27.570> will<00:05:27.720> come

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
duplicate the duplicate will come

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.980 
duplicate the duplicate will come
through<00:05:28.260> at<00:05:28.470> 200<00:05:29.100> watts<00:05:29.280> as<00:05:29.520> well<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:30.270> I<00:05:30.660> can

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
through at 200 watts as well so I can

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.860 
through at 200 watts as well so I can
have<00:05:31.610> various<00:05:32.610> different<00:05:33.000> duplicates<00:05:33.510> made

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
have various different duplicates made

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.960 
have various different duplicates made
from<00:05:34.380> lights<00:05:34.860> that<00:05:35.130> have<00:05:35.280> all<00:05:35.610> kinds<00:05:35.940> of

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
from lights that have all kinds of

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.460 
from lights that have all kinds of
properties<00:05:36.180> whether<00:05:36.450> they<00:05:36.570> be<00:05:36.690> colors<00:05:37.110> or

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
properties whether they be colors or

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.040 
properties whether they be colors or
wattage<00:05:37.980> and<00:05:38.250> we'll<00:05:39.210> get<00:05:39.330> into<00:05:39.540> all<00:05:39.660> of<00:05:39.690> these

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
wattage and we'll get into all of these

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.900 
wattage and we'll get into all of these
different<00:05:40.230> settings<00:05:40.740> but<00:05:40.950> for<00:05:41.100> right<00:05:41.220> now<00:05:41.250> the

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
different settings but for right now the

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.460 
different settings but for right now the
most<00:05:42.060> important<00:05:42.510> thing<00:05:42.540> to<00:05:42.720> know<00:05:42.840> is<00:05:42.870> that<00:05:43.080> we

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
most important thing to know is that we

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.440 
most important thing to know is that we
can<00:05:43.680> create<00:05:44.250> these<00:05:44.460> lights<00:05:44.730> from<00:05:45.150> these

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
can create these lights from these

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.610 
can create these lights from these
primitives<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:46.020> we<00:05:46.140> see<00:05:46.260> up<00:05:46.350> here<00:05:46.380> and<00:05:46.500> will

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
primitives that we see up here and will

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.320 
primitives that we see up here and will
primarily<00:05:46.800> focus<00:05:47.010> on<00:05:47.430> these<00:05:47.669> first<00:05:47.940> three

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
primarily focus on these first three

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.880 
primarily focus on these first three
primitives<00:05:49.230> you<00:05:49.320> see<00:05:49.440> that<00:05:49.590> we<00:05:49.650> have<00:05:49.680> the

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
primitives you see that we have the

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.210 
primitives you see that we have the
square<00:05:50.130> the<00:05:50.970> circle<00:05:51.180> and<00:05:51.600> our<00:05:52.470> sort<00:05:52.710> polygon

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
square the circle and our sort polygon

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.700 
square the circle and our sort polygon
shape<00:05:53.250> and<00:05:53.730> these<00:05:54.270> will<00:05:54.600> all<00:05:54.840> be<00:05:55.200> what<00:05:55.560> we<00:05:55.680> call

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
shape and these will all be what we call

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.909 
shape and these will all be what we call
synthetic<00:05:56.610> lights<00:05:57.060> so<00:05:57.900> we<00:05:57.930> can<00:05:58.230> do<00:05:58.620> the<00:05:58.650> same

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
synthetic lights so we can do the same

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.350 
synthetic lights so we can do the same
thing<00:05:59.130> with<00:05:59.250> any<00:05:59.400> of<00:05:59.550> these<00:05:59.640> any<00:06:00.030> shape<00:06:00.210> we

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
thing with any of these any shape we

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.670 
thing with any of these any shape we
want<00:06:00.390> to<00:06:00.720> which<00:06:00.840> is<00:06:00.930> created<00:06:01.290> in<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.470> canvas

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
want to which is created in the canvas

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.270 
want to which is created in the canvas
like<00:06:01.980> so<00:06:02.250> we<00:06:02.880> can<00:06:03.090> change<00:06:03.300> our<00:06:04.190> wattage<00:06:05.190> to

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
like so we can change our wattage to

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.700 
like so we can change our wattage to
something<00:06:05.550> like<00:06:05.640> 60<00:06:05.970> watts<00:06:06.290> we<00:06:07.290> can<00:06:07.440> create<00:06:07.680> a

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
something like 60 watts we can create a

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.520 
something like 60 watts we can create a
duplicate<00:06:07.890> of<00:06:08.160> that<00:06:08.600> move<00:06:09.600> it<00:06:09.720> up<00:06:09.840> if<00:06:10.290> we<00:06:10.440> don't

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
duplicate of that move it up if we don't

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.770 
duplicate of that move it up if we don't
like<00:06:10.770> it<00:06:10.800> we<00:06:11.010> can<00:06:11.130> delete<00:06:11.490> it<00:06:11.550> and<00:06:12.419> of<00:06:12.750> course

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
like it we can delete it and of course

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.520 
like it we can delete it and of course
we<00:06:13.139> can<00:06:13.290> undo<00:06:13.680> and<00:06:13.950> redo<00:06:14.150> all<00:06:15.150> those<00:06:16.020> changes

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
we can undo and redo all those changes

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.460 
we can undo and redo all those changes
so<00:06:17.250> we'll<00:06:17.729> pick<00:06:17.880> this<00:06:18.030> up<00:06:18.090> again<00:06:18.419> in<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.320> next

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
so we'll pick this up again in the next

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.040 
so we'll pick this up again in the next
video<00:06:20.130> to<00:06:20.550> carry<00:06:20.790> on<00:06:21.000> with<00:06:21.240> the<00:06:21.570> rest<00:06:21.750> of<00:06:21.870> the

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
video to carry on with the rest of the

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.440 
video to carry on with the rest of the
user<00:06:22.229> interface
