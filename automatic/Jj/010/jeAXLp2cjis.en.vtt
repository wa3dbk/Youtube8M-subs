back all this into this vacuum packed
bag

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
bag

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.860 
bag
I've<00:03:21.160> already<00:03:21.340> sealed<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:23.709> bag<00:03:23.859> at<00:03:24.040> one<00:03:24.250> end

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
I've already sealed the bag at one end

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.470 
I've already sealed the bag at one end
with<00:03:25.870> about<00:03:26.079> three<00:03:26.500> seals<00:03:27.190> just<00:03:27.609> to<00:03:27.700> make<00:03:28.450> sure

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
with about three seals just to make sure

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.640 
with about three seals just to make sure
it's<00:03:28.750> tight<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:30.549> also<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:30.970> other<00:03:31.060> end<00:03:31.299> is

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
it's tight and also the other end is

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.960 
it's tight and also the other end is
empty<00:03:32.650> ready<00:03:32.859> to<00:03:33.010> go<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:34.150> put<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.359> food<00:03:34.510> in<00:03:35.970> so

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
empty ready to go to put the food in so

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.010 
empty ready to go to put the food in so
we'll<00:03:37.090> just<00:03:37.239> pack<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.600> up

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.220 

and<00:03:42.830> I<00:03:42.860> guess<00:03:43.010> this<00:03:43.460> is<00:03:43.580> going<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.790> weigh

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
and I guess this is going to weigh

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.110 
and I guess this is going to weigh
probably<00:03:45.230> about<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.650> pound<00:03:46.640> just<00:03:47.480> over<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.750> pound

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
probably about a pound just over a pound

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.440 
probably about a pound just over a pound
and<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.690> balance<00:03:51.050> is<00:03:51.140> getting<00:03:51.350> a<00:03:52.450> swelling

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
and the balance is getting a swelling

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.730 
and the balance is getting a swelling
tails<00:03:53.810> getting<00:03:54.610> enough<00:03:55.610> calories<00:03:56.740> enough

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
tails getting enough calories enough

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.130 
tails getting enough calories enough
choice<00:03:58.070> and<00:03:58.460> then<00:03:59.210> using<00:03:59.510> stuff<00:03:59.750> obviously

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
choice and then using stuff obviously

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.760 
choice and then using stuff obviously
that's<00:04:00.290> not<00:04:00.350> going<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.680> degrade<00:04:01.960> over<00:04:02.960> any

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
that's not going to degrade over any

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.530 
that's not going to degrade over any
length<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.070> time<00:04:04.130> and<00:04:04.880> I<00:04:06.160> imagine<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:08.180> weakest

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
length of time and I imagine the weakest

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.910 
length of time and I imagine the weakest
link<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:08.900> going<00:04:09.020> to<00:04:09.080> be<00:04:09.230> anything<00:04:09.680> in<00:04:09.830> here

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
link is going to be anything in here

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.270 
link is going to be anything in here
that's<00:04:10.040> gonna<00:04:11.140> go<00:04:12.140> back<00:04:12.350> with<00:04:12.650> quickly<00:04:13.160> I

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
that's gonna go back with quickly I

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.510 
that's gonna go back with quickly I
guess<00:04:13.550> and<00:04:14.300> I<00:04:14.390> say<00:04:14.540> quickly<00:04:14.720> is<00:04:15.050> probably

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
guess and I say quickly is probably

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.350 
guess and I say quickly is probably
American<00:04:16.520> everything<00:04:16.880> in<00:04:16.970> here<00:04:17.120> is<00:04:17.150> pretty

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
American everything in here is pretty

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.199 
American everything in here is pretty
good<00:04:17.660> for<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:17.900> year<00:04:18.140> a<00:04:18.380> year<00:04:19.160> minimum<00:04:19.430> and<00:04:19.880> then

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
good for a year a year minimum and then

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.810 
good for a year a year minimum and then
probably<00:04:20.450> anything<00:04:20.840> up<00:04:21.020> to<00:04:21.400> two<00:04:22.400> years<00:04:22.430> I

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
probably anything up to two years I

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.470 
probably anything up to two years I
reckon<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:25.340> I<00:04:25.430> need<00:04:25.610> obviously<00:04:25.940> then<00:04:26.620> rotate

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
reckon and I need obviously then rotate

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.720 
reckon and I need obviously then rotate
any<00:04:29.480> MREs<00:04:30.080> you've<00:04:30.260> got<00:04:30.470> that<00:04:31.370> I'm<00:04:31.460> going<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.610> go

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
any MREs you've got that I'm going to go

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.480 
any MREs you've got that I'm going to go
make<00:04:31.940> probably<00:04:32.480> half<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.840> dozen<00:04:32.870> of<00:04:33.170> these<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:34.460> I

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
make probably half a dozen of these so I

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.350 
make probably half a dozen of these so I
don't<00:04:34.790> enter<00:04:35.240> a<00:04:35.450> one<00:04:35.870> for<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.080> date<00:04:36.320> too<00:04:36.950> quick

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
don't enter a one for a date too quick

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.140 
don't enter a one for a date too quick
I'll<00:04:38.360> probably<00:04:38.600> even<00:04:38.870> before<00:04:38.990> I<00:04:39.200> get<00:04:39.470> used<00:04:40.150> for

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
I'll probably even before I get used for

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.450 
I'll probably even before I get used for
the<00:04:41.240> dates<00:04:41.480> go<00:04:42.790> okay<00:04:43.790> so<00:04:43.850> everything<00:04:44.480> you<00:04:44.570> know

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
the dates go okay so everything you know
