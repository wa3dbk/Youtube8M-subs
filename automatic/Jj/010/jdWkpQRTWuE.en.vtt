it<00:01:42.049> works<00:01:42.499> and<00:01:42.829> just<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.609> kind<00:01:43.789> of<00:01:43.819> let<00:01:43.939> you

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:43.999 
it works and just to kind of let you

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:47.379 
it works and just to kind of let you
know<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.479> concentrate<00:01:45.439> on<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.799> edges<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.639> and

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:47.389 
know I concentrate on the edges and and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:50.109 
know I concentrate on the edges and and
we're<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.869> natural<00:01:48.859> wear<00:01:49.130> pattern<00:01:49.549> would<00:01:49.700> be<00:01:49.909> in

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
we're a natural wear pattern would be in

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.819 
we're a natural wear pattern would be in
a<00:01:50.209> furniture<00:01:50.719> you<00:01:51.200> want<00:01:51.319> this<00:01:51.469> to<00:01:51.649> look

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
a furniture you want this to look

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.589 
a furniture you want this to look
authentic<00:01:52.009> it<00:01:52.520> is<00:01:52.609> a<00:01:52.639> faux<00:01:52.939> finish<00:01:53.209> but<00:01:53.569> you

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
authentic it is a faux finish but you

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.589 
authentic it is a faux finish but you
don't<00:01:53.869> want<00:01:54.079> it<00:01:54.139> to<00:01:54.259> look<00:01:54.439> too<00:01:54.909> faux<00:01:55.909> finish<00:01:56.419> do

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599 
don't want it to look too faux finish do

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
don't want it to look too faux finish do
you<00:01:56.689> want<00:01:56.869> it<00:01:56.929> to<00:01:57.049> look<00:01:57.139> like<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.469> was

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
you want it to look like it was

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.409 
you want it to look like it was
absolutely<00:01:58.189> aged<00:01:58.520> in<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.939> very<00:01:59.149> natural

00:01:59.409 --> 00:01:59.419 
absolutely aged in a very natural

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.870 
absolutely aged in a very natural
process<00:01:59.869> over<00:02:00.499> time<00:02:00.529> so<00:02:01.459> you're<00:02:01.609> really<00:02:01.700> going

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
process over time so you're really going

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.149 
process over time so you're really going
to<00:02:01.939> concentrate<00:02:02.209> on<00:02:02.450> your<00:02:02.630> edges<00:02:03.109> and<00:02:03.349> maybe

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
to concentrate on your edges and maybe

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.859 
to concentrate on your edges and maybe
around<00:02:04.310> your<00:02:04.639> hardware<00:02:05.149> where<00:02:05.450> it'll<00:02:05.659> go

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
around your hardware where it'll go

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.559 
around your hardware where it'll go
corners<00:02:06.709> for<00:02:07.069> sure<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:08.060> one<00:02:08.270> I'm<00:02:08.360> going<00:02:08.479> to

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
corners for sure this one I'm going to

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.180 
corners for sure this one I'm going to
rough<00:02:08.750> up<00:02:08.869> quite<00:02:09.170> a<00:02:09.200> bit<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.500> want<00:02:09.830> it<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.009> look

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
rough up quite a bit I want it to look

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.120 
rough up quite a bit I want it to look
pretty<00:02:10.340> ragged<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.930> had<00:02:12.140> some<00:02:12.440> awesome

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
pretty ragged and I had some awesome

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.950 
pretty ragged and I had some awesome
issues<00:02:13.790> with<00:02:13.970> getting<00:02:14.090> complete<00:02:14.630> coverage

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
issues with getting complete coverage

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.630 
issues with getting complete coverage
with<00:02:15.080> my<00:02:15.230> red<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.010> am<00:02:16.190> going<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.370> use<00:02:16.610> a

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
with my red so I am going to use a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.780 
with my red so I am going to use a
pretty<00:02:17.000> heavy

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
pretty heavy

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.559 
pretty heavy
saturated<00:02:18.769> stain<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.189> aging<00:02:20.939> process<00:02:21.420> on

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
saturated stain and aging process on

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.390 
saturated stain and aging process on
this<00:02:21.750> one<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.140> kind<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.409> cover<00:02:23.129> up<00:02:23.250> a

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
this one just to kind of cover up a

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.759 
this one just to kind of cover up a
multitude<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.939> sins<00:02:24.209> from<00:02:24.569> this<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.530> entire

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
multitude of sins from this the entire

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:33.020 
multitude of sins from this the entire
process<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.549> here<00:02:26.730> we<00:02:26.849> go

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.490 

just<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.120> show<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.360> guys<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:35.080> is<00:02:35.230> kind<00:02:35.470> of

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
just to show you guys this is kind of

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.920 
just to show you guys this is kind of
how<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.650> works<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.790> also<00:02:37.090> have<00:02:37.420> primer<00:02:37.780> on

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
how it works and I also have primer on

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.479 
how it works and I also have primer on
this<00:02:38.079> you<00:02:38.260> can<00:02:38.349> see<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.650> white<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.069> primer

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
this you can see the white is the primer

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.699 
this you can see the white is the primer
and<00:02:39.849> then<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.390> brown<00:02:40.629> is<00:02:40.900> right<00:02:41.170> down<00:02:41.409> to<00:02:41.620> the

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
and then the brown is right down to the

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.530 
and then the brown is right down to the
wood<00:02:41.950> I'm<00:02:42.159> going<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.579> continue<00:02:42.879> doing<00:02:43.420> this

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
wood I'm going to continue doing this

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.880 
wood I'm going to continue doing this
for<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.840> little<00:02:43.930> while<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.290> get<00:02:44.379> it<00:02:44.470> all<00:02:44.590> done

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
for a little while and get it all done

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.619 
for a little while and get it all done
but<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.790> is<00:02:45.849> just<00:02:46.090> kind<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.420> how<00:02:46.569> the

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
but and this is just kind of how the

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.660 
but and this is just kind of how the
process<00:02:46.989> starts<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:47.950> you'll<00:02:48.069> just<00:02:48.220> do<00:02:48.400> again

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
process starts and you'll just do again

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.520 
process starts and you'll just do again
your<00:02:48.849> edges<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.420> your<00:02:49.540> your<00:02:49.930> places<00:02:50.319> that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
your edges and your your places that

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.410 
your edges and your your places that
your<00:02:50.650> natural<00:02:51.220> wear<00:02:51.459> would<00:02:51.940> happen<00:02:52.299> on<00:02:52.390> a

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
your natural wear would happen on a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.990 
your natural wear would happen on a
piece

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.260 

and<00:02:56.260> okay<00:02:57.260> we<00:02:57.710> have<00:02:57.950> gone<00:02:58.190> ahead<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.520> seen<00:02:59.090> it

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
and okay we have gone ahead and seen it

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.210 
and okay we have gone ahead and seen it
this<00:02:59.420> stuff<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.930> as<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:00.680> can<00:03:00.830> tell<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.070> really

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
this stuff and as you can tell I really

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.700 
this stuff and as you can tell I really
concentrated<00:03:02.060> on<00:03:02.150> my<00:03:02.300> corners<00:03:02.720> did<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.530> couple

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
concentrated on my corners did a couple

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.160 
concentrated on my corners did a couple
of<00:03:03.890> little<00:03:04.040> age<00:03:04.370> spots<00:03:04.940> where<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.870> hardware

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
of little age spots where the hardware

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.620 
of little age spots where the hardware
will<00:03:06.470> go<00:03:06.620> back<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.880> just<00:03:08.090> really<00:03:08.390> kind<00:03:08.600> of

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
will go back and just really kind of

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.050 
will go back and just really kind of
give<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.930> good<00:03:09.050> rough<00:03:09.380> up<00:03:09.560> one<00:03:10.490> thing<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.820> did

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
give it a good rough up one thing I did

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.790 
give it a good rough up one thing I did
forget<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.570> mention<00:03:11.690> earlier<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.470> when<00:03:12.620> you're

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
forget to mention earlier is when you're

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
forget to mention earlier is when you're
using<00:03:13.070> your<00:03:13.190> stander

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
using your stander

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.540 
using your stander
try<00:03:14.270> to<00:03:14.330> use<00:03:14.570> really<00:03:14.900> an<00:03:15.260> even<00:03:15.830> pressure<00:03:16.070> or

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
try to use really an even pressure or

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.270 
try to use really an even pressure or
your<00:03:17.300> paint<00:03:17.540> will<00:03:17.660> kind<00:03:17.960> of<00:03:18.020> ball<00:03:18.260> up<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.770> then

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
your paint will kind of ball up and then

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.500 
your paint will kind of ball up and then
you'll<00:03:19.400> have<00:03:19.520> to<00:03:19.640> stay<00:03:19.850> in<00:03:19.880> that<00:03:20.030> whole<00:03:20.270> ball

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
you'll have to stay in that whole ball

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.480 
you'll have to stay in that whole ball
of<00:03:20.690> paint<00:03:21.020> off<00:03:21.260> which<00:03:21.770> is<00:03:21.950> kind<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.250> another

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
of paint off which is kind of another

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.330 
of paint off which is kind of another
issue<00:03:23.300> that<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:23.780> can<00:03:23.930> avoid<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.530> after<00:03:25.250> you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
issue that you can avoid and after you

the look I'm kind of going for and it's

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.280 
the look I'm kind of going for and it's
just<00:05:24.400> kind<00:05:24.580> of<00:05:24.610> a<00:05:24.700> nice<00:05:24.850> look<00:05:25.270> you<00:05:25.900> can<00:05:26.050> kind<00:05:26.230> of

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
just kind of a nice look you can kind of

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.750 
just kind of a nice look you can kind of
see<00:05:26.410> what<00:05:26.530> it's<00:05:26.650> done<00:05:26.830> now<00:05:27.040> if<00:05:27.190> I'd<00:05:27.310> let<00:05:27.490> it<00:05:27.520> sit

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
see what it's done now if I'd let it sit

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.160 
see what it's done now if I'd let it sit
a<00:05:27.820> little<00:05:27.910> longer<00:05:28.300> it<00:05:28.450> would<00:05:28.540> go<00:05:28.690> even<00:05:28.960> deeper

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
a little longer it would go even deeper

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.320 
a little longer it would go even deeper
but<00:05:29.950> this<00:05:30.010> is<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.370> process<00:05:30.580> this<00:05:31.000> is<00:05:31.150> how<00:05:31.270> we

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
but this is the process this is how we

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.570 
but this is the process this is how we
do<00:05:31.630> it<00:05:31.810> you<00:05:31.990> would<00:05:32.500> finish<00:05:32.650> your<00:05:32.950> entire<00:05:33.250> piece

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
do it you would finish your entire piece

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.790 
do it you would finish your entire piece
just<00:05:33.970> like<00:05:34.150> I've<00:05:34.330> showed<00:05:34.600> you<00:05:34.780> here<00:05:35.020> and<00:05:35.230> then

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
just like I've showed you here and then

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.950 
just like I've showed you here and then
after<00:05:36.070> it's<00:05:36.250> dried<00:05:36.640> for<00:05:36.910> a<00:05:36.970> few<00:05:37.180> hours<00:05:37.210> or<00:05:37.900> even

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
after it's dried for a few hours or even

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.280 
after it's dried for a few hours or even
overnight<00:05:38.350> I<00:05:38.980> would<00:05:39.430> go<00:05:39.550> ahead<00:05:39.820> and<00:05:40.140> seal<00:05:41.140> it

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
overnight I would go ahead and seal it

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.200 
overnight I would go ahead and seal it
off<00:05:41.410> with<00:05:41.680> a<00:05:41.710> polyurethane<00:05:42.100> I<00:05:42.700> like<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:43.060> use<00:05:43.150> a

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
off with a polyurethane I like to use a

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.690 
off with a polyurethane I like to use a
satin<00:05:43.660> finish<00:05:43.840> on<00:05:44.140> line<00:05:44.350> and<00:05:44.740> but<00:05:45.400> just<00:05:45.430> give

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
satin finish on line and but just give

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.730 
satin finish on line and but just give
it<00:05:45.790> a<00:05:45.820> good<00:05:45.970> steel<00:05:46.360> to<00:05:46.600> kind<00:05:46.780> of<00:05:46.870> protect<00:05:47.290> that

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
it a good steel to kind of protect that

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.770 
it a good steel to kind of protect that
stain<00:05:48.160> because<00:05:48.370> stain<00:05:48.820> wood<00:05:49.150> is<00:05:49.390> actually

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
stain because stain wood is actually

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.280 
stain because stain wood is actually
just<00:05:49.930> raw<00:05:50.320> wood<00:05:50.830> and<00:05:51.130> it<00:05:51.910> can<00:05:52.210> still<00:05:52.570> have

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
just raw wood and it can still have

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.830 
just raw wood and it can still have
things<00:05:53.560> happen<00:05:53.920> to<00:05:54.070> it<00:05:54.250> and<00:05:55.240> just<00:05:55.300> you<00:05:55.780> just

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
things happen to it and just you just

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.750 
things happen to it and just you just
want<00:05:55.930> to<00:05:56.050> steal<00:05:56.290> it<00:05:56.320> off<00:05:56.560> to<00:05:56.770> protect<00:05:57.160> it<00:05:57.340> but

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
want to steal it off to protect it but

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.400 
want to steal it off to protect it but
this<00:05:57.850> is<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.060> process<00:05:58.330> this<00:05:58.720> is<00:05:58.780> how<00:05:58.930> it<00:05:59.170> looks
