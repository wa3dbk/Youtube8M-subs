00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.889
 So friends also the most common questions 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:17.390
 are the questions that you want to know 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.650
 machines free trade all mixed up 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.119
 I should mean that we have one 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.429
 small studio I do not have all 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.220
 devices that might be in other studios 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:29.449
 But we are so flexible in the head 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.930
 and experience that we all muscles 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.560
 which might not be machine 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.660
 have to 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.360
 can also train with free trade 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.280
 and we do that but there are 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.430
 machines that are very helpful 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.330
 good running have good angles with me 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.730
 again and again 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.740
 even if that is now cable to kiss 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.630
 Dumbbell I mean man 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.890
 yes, you can have several over all 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.960
 install exercises 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.480
 important is that the exercises you 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.730
 It also really fulfills that 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.800
 so you do not expect it 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.140
 Exercises because the others do but 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.330
 Try which variant is ideal 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.310
 this is also an insight for you 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.740
 which will take you further 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.619
 I mean, what's good for me 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.899
 not be good for you and you have to 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.740
 then I find out we are now 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:21.729
 go well together because his head is similar 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.929
 is how I go to extremes 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.939
 we have a training scheme 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.229
 meanwhile we have discovered the beginning 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.429
 also problems would have had 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.700
 inscriptions did not feel at all 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:34.549
 more precisely then out of our training 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.249
 done and now came other exercises the 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.399
 to do even better and now we have 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:42.049
 meanwhile what we want exactly when 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.719
 I now analyze our training 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.240
 say we make about 70 percent free 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:50.209
 act for other long acting 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.009
 and 30% machine and cable and there are 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.509
 Of course I can do that 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.700
 just do it on the machine 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.909
 for example, both distances or at 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.409
 Care is just machine without it 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.439
 Of course there are also muscle groups where 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.969
 more machines are needed and where 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.770
 of course now also act more freely 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.319
 I think if you have the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.670
 Free trade variation can do then 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.910
 we also tend to do that primarily 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.030
 for example, back exercises 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:55.820
 So we're actually doing the machines 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:03:01.000
 he would say so as a supplement here 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:03.770
 grab there grab what 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.090
 he immediately claimed what I said in 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.130
 try everything every training 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.320
 to bring in both angles here 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.610
 so the bunny hears horizontally above 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.150
 now with a handle variation 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.739
 you say something to eat must be here 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.090
 the game in demanding general 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.709
 is actually totally angular 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.150
 racism is here so the tension is 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.940
 yes, mostly here or here 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.030
 we now claim these parts of the 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:38.350
 back that you have lower back 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.350
 2001 is also how you see here 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:53.300
 delta muscle capitalism you with 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.610
 can use very well is the 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.700
 favorite exercise of deniz he has been 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.790
 but rather more and I have mine 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.620
 Article read about monkey monkeys hangs 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.230
 So always to the trees so 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:14.239
 Weapons have more power too 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:14.930
 So now some things are done too 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.910
 Not 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.609
 to dispense so for example cable 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.610
 what we do for chest as a first exercise 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.130
 exactly you can with dumbbells do 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.710
 not that he is this one too because 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.009
 start in Germany the nutrition 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.870
 That's why his is also the 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.320
 Repeat order again and again 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.940
 How much exercise does an exercise well 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.669
 Yes, we realized yesterday 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.289
 have made cable as a third exercise 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.360
 I think it was not like that 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.360
 he effectively believes that he does 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.099
 we as a first exercise with it of course 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.770
 thinks another important point is 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.690
 simply the anatomy of your own body 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.210
 For example, I give people too 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.550
 doreen aids said squats 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.470
 were easy for his body for that 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.810
 ratio of his two length 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.539
 access is not good and that's why he has 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.030
 always this export machine after the above 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.610
 has and the press and some 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.550
 People are simply some free trade 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.220
 exercises not so effective yes easy 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.020
 due to the body constellation 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.520
 because you just have to try out a lot 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.000
 look what will happen to me myself 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.190
 best 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.199
 I also just know people in those 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.419
 It does not matter how you do it 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.919
 is mainly about criticism and 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.539
 shoulder and have the blatant steps 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.340
 blame blame and the breast will be 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.110
 never glasses and then at the beginning would be louder 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.880
 make machines and tip machines 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.370
 and then fly comes the breast on 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.380
 that's when he starts 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.599
 free trade and adds it to others 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.789
 and see what works and we do 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:45.409
 just a good mix with focus already 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:49.669
 on free trade years 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:52.880
 we try it too i mean we have 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.710
 different training methods by and 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.870
 the better we have retained and 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.800
 we did not have that good 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.780
 sort out 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.000
 Now we are in the area even if we are 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.729
 we would always do the same 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.060
 become 100 percent intensity 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.960
 and that's the art 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.220
 and I think that's what we do 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.720
 works because I have now 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.740
 I just started paying 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:18.740
 looked at that was so with 92 5 kilo so 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.210
 almost 93 kilos and now I'm 96 one 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.490
 I think half have so a kilo 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.650
 maybe it falls down but that 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.070
 Most of the rest I was already on 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.230
 flowers 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.600
 that means saying goodbye are already so 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.720
 Online above the crowd likes to be alone 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.540
 also shoulder a shoulder even during training 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.750
 so the biceps triceps is on everyone 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.770
 case become rounder and bulkier than 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.770
 you showed up here
