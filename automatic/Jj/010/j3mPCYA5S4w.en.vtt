here to talk a little bit about the

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.460 
here to talk a little bit about the
melee<00:00:05.580> system<00:00:05.640> in<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.359> halo<00:00:06.629> Master<00:00:07.170> Chief

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
melee system in a halo Master Chief

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.930 
melee system in a halo Master Chief
collection<00:00:07.680> so<00:00:08.099> it's<00:00:08.309> been<00:00:08.429> it's<00:00:08.790> been<00:00:08.849> a

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
collection so it's been it's been a

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.280 
collection so it's been it's been a
while<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.210> I've<00:00:09.510> been<00:00:09.630> kind<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.929> watching

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
while and I've been kind of watching

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.540 
while and I've been kind of watching
some<00:00:10.410> pros<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.679> I've<00:00:11.010> been<00:00:11.130> kind<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.460> getting

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
some pros and I've been kind of getting

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.730 
some pros and I've been kind of getting
like<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.790> feel<00:00:12.059> for<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.509> was<00:00:12.630> like<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:13.620> know

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
like a feel for and I was like you know

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.460 
like a feel for and I was like you know
these<00:00:13.889> melee<00:00:14.219> systems<00:00:14.580> don't<00:00:14.790> make<00:00:15.299> sense<00:00:15.630> at

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
these melee systems don't make sense at

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.750 
these melee systems don't make sense at
least<00:00:16.770> from<00:00:17.070> what<00:00:17.220> I've<00:00:17.250> watched<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.699> I

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
least from what I've watched so I

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.670 
least from what I've watched so I
decided<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.480> know<00:00:18.510> take<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.289> into<00:00:19.470> my<00:00:19.560> own

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
decided to you know take it into my own

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.830 
decided to you know take it into my own
hands<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.130> kind<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.340> figure<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.609> out<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
hands and kind of figure it out so the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.300 
hands and kind of figure it out so the
first<00:00:22.050> thing<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.470> thought<00:00:22.650> was<00:00:22.710> maybe

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
first thing that I thought was maybe

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.259 
first thing that I thought was maybe
just<00:00:23.670> maybe<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:25.050> was<00:00:25.529> like<00:00:25.710> pre<00:00:26.070> patch<00:00:26.400> halo<00:00:27.210> 2

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
just maybe it was like pre patch halo 2

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.230 
just maybe it was like pre patch halo 2
which<00:00:28.199> would<00:00:28.470> mean<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:29.039> if<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.550> jump<00:00:29.849> male<00:00:30.060> 8

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
which would mean that if you jump male 8

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240 
which would mean that if you jump male 8
there<00:00:30.269> would<00:00:30.630> be<00:00:30.660> no<00:00:30.990> shields<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.560> sure<00:00:31.830> or<00:00:32.130> if

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
there would be no shields for sure or if

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.799 
there would be no shields for sure or if
you<00:00:32.340> mail<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.640> once<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.030> then<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.180> jump<00:00:33.420> melee

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
you mail it once and then you jump melee

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.080 
you mail it once and then you jump melee
that<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.110> would<00:00:34.200> get<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> kill<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.579> decided

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
that it would get a kill and I decided

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.520 
that it would get a kill and I decided
to<00:00:36.180> test<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> first<00:00:36.930> thing<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.260> decided

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
to test it so the first thing I decided

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.930 
to test it so the first thing I decided
to<00:00:37.680> test<00:00:37.860> was<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.340> right<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:38.640> sorry<00:00:38.879> about

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
to test was this right here sorry about

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.220 
to test was this right here sorry about
the<00:00:39.149> split<00:00:39.360> screen<00:00:39.480> by<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.750> way<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.110> like

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the split screen by the way it's like

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.410 
the split screen by the way it's like
completely<00:00:40.890> fucking<00:00:41.370> unplayable<00:00:41.760> but<00:00:42.270> you

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
completely fucking unplayable but you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.260 
know you got to do what you got to do so
without<00:00:44.610> momentum

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
without momentum

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.180 
without momentum
it<00:00:45.629> takes<00:00:46.430> three<00:00:47.570> fucking<00:00:48.570> melee<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.100> go

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
it takes three fucking melee I get to go

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.060 
it takes three fucking melee I get to go
track<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.670> asshole<00:00:51.120> down<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.770> takes

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
track this asshole down so it takes

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.130 
track this asshole down so it takes
three<00:00:53.550> Malee's<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.390> kill<00:00:54.600> someone<00:00:54.960> without

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
three Malee's to kill someone without

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.689 
three Malee's to kill someone without
momentum<00:00:55.680> at<00:00:56.340> all<00:00:56.640> okay<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.430> find

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
momentum at all okay so now as I find

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.270 
momentum at all okay so now as I find
them<00:00:59.879> there<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.840> that's<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.829> first<00:01:02.070> thing

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
them there is so that's the first thing

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.090 
them there is so that's the first thing
so<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.480> momentum<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.320> putting

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
so you have to have momentum so putting

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.609 
so you have to have momentum so putting
that<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.430> test<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.970> run<00:01:06.330> up<00:01:06.479> here<00:01:06.689> moving

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that to the test I run up here moving

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.730 
that to the test I run up here moving
forward<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:09.270> melees<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:10.049> long<00:01:10.260> as<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.530> have

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
forward to melees as long as you have

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.219 
forward to melees as long as you have
momentum<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:12.210> will<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.689> able<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.020> kill

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
momentum you will be able to kill

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.760 
momentum you will be able to kill
someone<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.939> next<00:01:15.150> step<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
someone so then the next step is the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.890 
someone so then the next step is the
Rockets<00:01:17.369> right<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> big

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
Rockets right this is this is the big

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.899 
Rockets right this is this is the big
thing<00:01:18.930> here<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> big<00:01:20.189> trick<00:01:20.610> that

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
thing here this is the big trick that

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.410 
thing here this is the big trick that
was<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.689> Halo<00:01:22.080> 2<00:01:22.350> pre<00:01:22.830> patch<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.580> kind<00:01:24.240> of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
was in Halo 2 pre patch that kind of

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.410 
was in Halo 2 pre patch that kind of
disappeared<00:01:25.170> after<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.939> initial<00:01:26.939> buff<00:01:27.150> in

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
disappeared after the initial buff in

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.600 
disappeared after the initial buff in
like<00:01:27.600> June<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.560> 2005<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> some<00:01:31.799> weapons<00:01:32.430> are

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
like June of 2005 so some weapons are

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.090 
like June of 2005 so some weapons are
based<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.240> weight<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.140> only<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.890> that's

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
based on weight and the only one that's

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.190 
based on weight and the only one that's
really<00:01:35.189> based<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.909> weight<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.600> Rockets

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
really based on weight is the Rockets

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.890 
really based on weight is the Rockets
now<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.619> Halo<00:01:37.950> 2<00:01:38.009> pre<00:01:38.579> patch<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.270> original

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
now in Halo 2 pre patch the original

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.289 
now in Halo 2 pre patch the original
right<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:41.159> jump<00:01:41.520> may<00:01:41.700> lead<00:01:41.909> someone<00:01:42.150> with

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
right if you jump may lead someone with

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.999 
right if you jump may lead someone with
the<00:01:42.390> rocket<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.869> would<00:01:42.990> get<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> kill<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.979> I

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
the rocket you would get a kill so I

melee higher I jumped in Crouch so I

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.100 
melee higher I jumped in Crouch so I
could<00:02:42.880> get<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.150> melee<00:02:43.330> at<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.600> top<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.020> was

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
could get the melee at the top so it was

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.670 
could get the melee at the top so it was
always<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.350> one-hit<00:02:44.800> kill<00:02:45.040> by<00:02:45.700> melee<00:02:46.000> once<00:02:46.239> jump

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
bit of skill I think there should be

bleed<00:03:25.930> through<00:03:26.140> for<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.440> two-shot<00:03:26.860> beat<00:03:27.040> then<00:03:27.250> I

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
bleed through for a two-shot beat then I

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.820

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
in that sense but the thing that's

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.130 
in that sense but the thing that's
