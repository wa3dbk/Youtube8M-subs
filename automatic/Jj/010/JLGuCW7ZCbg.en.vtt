00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello everyone today I bring you a 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.210
 pretty useful video for all those 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.880
 who have broken down their button 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.820
 lock and its start button in its 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.859
 iphone ipod touch or ipad as you can see 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.630
 this is going to be through jailbreak we are going to 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.330
 download a tweet which is going to 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.119
 download a virtual button that goes to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.040
 perform the functions that logically 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.930
 they make the buttons that we have in 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.149
 our iphone so good as 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.010
 you can see here I have this button 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.200
 and I already downloaded it here the tweet 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.910
 as you can see is this if I what 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.129
 pressed will perform all the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.320
 actions that the home button would perform 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.050
 normal will be able to get out of the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.129
 applications open multitasking open 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.500
 siri and others 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.050
 we have divided the screen to 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.210
 half imaginatively if 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.309
 we upload the button to the part of 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.370
 above us what we are going to get 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.289
 is that the lock button appears with 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.090
 which we will be able to block and turn off 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.159
 our device without 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.539
 problem as you can see is a great 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.359
 solution to all those buttons 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:15.210
 decomposed that we have logically and 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:17.189
 well let's see how to download it for 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.200
 be able to download this tweet only us 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.210
 let's go to cydia later we're going to 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.479
 go to the search option and we're going to 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.149
 search be home with uve and we're going to 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.920
 put in install and confirm once 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.859
 done this will already appear this 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.840
 virtual button on your screen you what 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.700
 can move in the place that you 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.789
 want is a very good alternative 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.340
 they also assist touch that we 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.409
 we have by default in our iphone 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.869
 but I love it because it's much more 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.700
 practical and how can you see what we can 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.590
 move to different parts of our 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.929
 screen so that it is not getting in the way 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.549
 so well that would be all you know 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.009
