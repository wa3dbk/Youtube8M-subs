different competitions of you know most

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.490 
different competitions of you know most
kills<00:01:25.470> or<00:01:26.450> here's<00:01:27.450> ones<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:27.810> stuck<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.470> i

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500

guess<00:01:28.740> that's<00:01:28.950> getting<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.460> getting<00:01:30.360> kills

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
guess that's getting a getting kills

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.200 
guess that's getting a getting kills
with<00:01:31.049> semtex<00:01:31.320> grenades<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.759> looks<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.119> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
with semtex grenades this looks like a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.690 
with semtex grenades this looks like a
tomahawk<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.380> go<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.650> there<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.950> do

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
tomahawk so you can go in there and do

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.640 
tomahawk so you can go in there and do
different<00:01:35.850> operations<00:01:36.750> king<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.409> hill<00:01:37.500> i

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
different operations king of the hill i

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.420 
different operations king of the hill i
think<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.100> most<00:01:39.439> kills<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.829> free<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.310> all

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
think is the most kills and free for all

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.600 
think is the most kills and free for all
i<00:01:41.700> haven't<00:01:42.570> done<00:01:42.630> any<00:01:42.869> yet<00:01:42.899> but<00:01:43.439> looks<00:01:44.369> pretty

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
i haven't done any yet but looks pretty

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.780 
i haven't done any yet but looks pretty
cool<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.840> then<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.680> improve<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.610> look

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
cool and then they improve you can look

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.609 
cool and then they improve you can look
at<00:01:47.939> all<00:01:48.090> your<00:01:48.270> stats<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.070> look<00:01:50.189> at<00:01:50.310> maps

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.410 
look at the OGG and gives all the stats
on<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.280> shows<00:02:02.579> your<00:02:02.790> performance

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420
