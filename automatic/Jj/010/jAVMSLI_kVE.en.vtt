00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
had one tank of gas run through it so it

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.450 
had one tank of gas run through it so it
is<00:01:02.070> at<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.059> think<00:01:03.570> 16<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.170> 1<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.500> 20<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.949> 1<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.339> this

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
is at I think 16 to 1 or 20 to 1 so this

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.810 
is at I think 16 to 1 or 20 to 1 so this
thing<00:01:05.700> smokes<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> devil<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:08.670> is

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820

what<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.320> 16<00:01:10.350> no<00:01:10.530> go<00:01:10.590> ahead

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
had a lot of them do that it's got a Pro

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
I'm guessing all the plastics are new as

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.120 
I'm guessing all the plastics are new as
far<00:03:13.680> as<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.860> fenders<00:03:14.250> side<00:03:14.580> covers<00:03:16.130> probably

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
far as the fenders side covers probably

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.120 
far as the fenders side covers probably
reap<00:03:17.490> opps<00:03:17.760> tough<00:03:18.650> don't<00:03:19.650> even<00:03:19.860> know<00:03:19.950> if<00:03:20.070> you

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
reap opps tough don't even know if you

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.420 
reap opps tough don't even know if you
can<00:03:20.310> buy<00:03:20.460> the<00:03:20.490> original<00:03:20.820> stuff<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:25.430> actually

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430
