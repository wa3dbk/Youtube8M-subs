00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.319
 Robic Neville is preparing to jump 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.610
 Grand Canyon 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.990
 Robbia wants to try to beat his 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.910
 previous world record for jumping 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.170
 which is sixty seven and 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.960
 nine tenths of a meter 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.320
 jumping over this gorge of depth 610 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.960
 meters 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.570
 no motorcyclist stuntman ever 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.720
 didn't even try to make it jump 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.560
 such a huge abyss and probably for 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.690
 this essay was founded 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.690
 [music] 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:48.260
 [applause] 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:52.219
 [music] 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.140
 Robbie easily overcomes the abyss he 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.519
 lands accurately but loses control 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.559
 as a result of the interaction of three 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.060
 factors of high speed complex 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.200
 relief and headwind 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.200
 [applause] 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.930
 doctors rush to him passes 5 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.470
 tense minutes 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.850
 and Robbie gets up and waves to the crowd but through 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.690
 few moments he loses consciousness 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.690
 suffocating 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.300
 medical helicopter arrives for him 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.130
 delivers hospital doctors discover 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:36.760
 legendary stuntman three broken 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:38.890
 ribs and strong ankle sprain in 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.230
 As a result, Robbie jumped at sixty 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.560
 nine and a half meters increasing its 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.210
 previous achievement by one and a half meters 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.950
 despite the fall he still 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.130
 fits bright pages in a book 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.130
 records
