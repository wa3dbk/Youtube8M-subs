okay<00:00:05.859> everybody<00:00:06.130> this<00:00:06.190> pro<00:00:06.580> analysis<00:00:07.149> lesson

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:07.509 
okay everybody this pro analysis lesson

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:08.490 
okay everybody this pro analysis lesson
we're<00:00:07.630> going<00:00:07.720> to<00:00:07.779> take<00:00:07.960> a<00:00:07.990> look<00:00:08.200> at<00:00:08.380> the

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:08.500 
we're going to take a look at the

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.990 
we're going to take a look at the
forehand<00:00:08.920> we're<00:00:09.130> going<00:00:09.250> to<00:00:09.309> check<00:00:09.460> out<00:00:09.610> Andy

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
forehand we're going to check out Andy

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.060 
forehand we're going to check out Andy
Murray's<00:00:10.389> forehand<00:00:10.930> and<00:00:11.200> when<00:00:11.710> it<00:00:11.800> comes<00:00:11.980> to

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
Murray's forehand and when it comes to

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.890 
Murray's forehand and when it comes to
the<00:00:12.190> forehand<00:00:12.639> and<00:00:12.790> it<00:00:12.940> comes<00:00:13.120> to<00:00:13.269> technique<00:00:13.690> I

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
the forehand and it comes to technique I

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.959 
the forehand and it comes to technique I
like<00:00:14.260> to<00:00:14.410> think<00:00:14.650> of<00:00:14.769> checkpoints<00:00:15.070> I<00:00:15.519> have<00:00:15.700> nine

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
like to think of checkpoints I have nine

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.760 
like to think of checkpoints I have nine
for<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:16.330> serve<00:00:16.540> I<00:00:16.840> have<00:00:17.140> six<00:00:17.500> for<00:00:17.680> the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
for the serve I have six for the

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.170 
for the serve I have six for the
groundstrokes<00:00:18.340> and<00:00:18.520> this<00:00:18.610> is<00:00:18.759> what<00:00:18.880> I<00:00:18.910> like<00:00:19.150> to

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
groundstrokes and this is what I like to

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.339 
groundstrokes and this is what I like to
call<00:00:19.330> them<00:00:19.660> these<00:00:19.810> are<00:00:19.960> mine

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
call them these are mine

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.370 
call them these are mine
so<00:00:20.829> number<00:00:21.820> one<00:00:22.000> is<00:00:22.180> the<00:00:22.329> unit<00:00:22.660> turn<00:00:22.899> so<00:00:23.259> we're

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
so number one is the unit turn so we're

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.440 
so number one is the unit turn so we're
going<00:00:23.500> to<00:00:23.560> look<00:00:23.739> and<00:00:23.890> see<00:00:24.130> what<00:00:24.820> happens<00:00:25.180> here

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
going to look and see what happens here

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.359 
going to look and see what happens here
the<00:00:25.810> role<00:00:26.020> of<00:00:26.050> left<00:00:26.410> hand<00:00:26.649> how<00:00:26.829> far<00:00:27.070> does<00:00:27.220> it

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
the role of left hand how far does it

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.310 
the role of left hand how far does it
stay<00:00:27.520> on<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:27.939> if<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.419> rack<00:00:28.599> is<00:00:28.779> up<00:00:28.960> or<00:00:29.110> down<00:00:29.290> or

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
stay on and if the rack is up or down or

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.769 
stay on and if the rack is up or down or
how<00:00:29.619> that<00:00:29.860> looks<00:00:30.099> number<00:00:30.820> two<00:00:31.059> and<00:00:31.419> the

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
is the pocket the pocket so the

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.010 
is the pocket the pocket so the
extension<00:01:33.640> part<00:01:34.090> is<00:01:34.240> maybe<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.509> little<00:01:34.570> less

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
extension part is maybe a little less

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.870 
extension part is maybe a little less
than<00:01:35.439> it<00:01:35.560> normally<00:01:35.680> is<00:01:35.950> but<00:01:36.579> it's<00:01:36.700> definitely

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
than it normally is but it's definitely

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.819 
than it normally is but it's definitely
out<00:01:37.240> there<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:37.659> then<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:37.840> comes<00:01:38.049> this<00:01:38.200> way<00:01:38.380> so

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
out there and then it comes this way so

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.039 
out there and then it comes this way so
here<00:01:38.979> it<00:01:39.070> is<00:01:39.189> okay<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:40.240> here<00:01:40.509> we<00:01:40.539> have<00:01:40.630> Andy

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
here it is okay so here we have Andy

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.149 
here it is okay so here we have Andy
Murray<00:01:41.200> I<00:01:41.350> was<00:01:41.560> going<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.770> take<00:01:41.950> us<00:01:41.979> through

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
Murray I was going to take us through

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.069 
Murray I was going to take us through
the<00:01:42.549> six<00:01:42.850> checkpoints<00:01:43.479> that<00:01:43.570> we<00:01:43.689> just<00:01:43.840> talked

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
the six checkpoints that we just talked

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.039 
the six checkpoints that we just talked
about<00:01:44.460> number<00:01:45.460> one<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.789> these<00:01:45.880> being<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.600> unit

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
about number one of these being the unit

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.539 
about number one of these being the unit
turn<00:01:47.259> so<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:47.530> can<00:01:47.680> see<00:01:47.799> right<00:01:47.979> here<00:01:48.039> Andy's

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
turn so you can see right here Andy's

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.010 
turn so you can see right here Andy's
doing<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:48.880> unit<00:01:49.180> turn<00:01:49.359> it's<00:01:49.719> doing<00:01:49.899> it

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
doing the unit turn it's doing it

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.080 
doing the unit turn it's doing it
properly<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:51.399> of<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.579> things<00:01:51.759> we'll<00:01:51.969> look

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
properly one of the things we'll look

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.149 
properly one of the things we'll look
for<00:01:52.390> is<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.659> make<00:01:52.990> sure<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.320> racket<00:01:53.740> hand<00:01:53.950> is

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
for is to make sure the racket hand is

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.800 
for is to make sure the racket hand is
still<00:01:54.369> attached<00:01:54.729> or<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.299> left<00:01:55.509> hand<00:01:55.750> the

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
still attached or the left hand the

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.959 
still attached or the left hand the
non-dominant<00:01:56.439> hand<00:01:56.649> in<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:56.920> case<00:01:57.159> to<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
non-dominant hand in this case to the

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.429 
non-dominant hand in this case to the
racket<00:01:58.210> because<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.659> assures<00:01:58.930> that<00:01:59.200> you<00:01:59.289> get

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
racket because that assures that you get

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.959 
racket because that assures that you get
a<00:01:59.469> proper<00:01:59.710> turning<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.429> the<00:02:00.549> shoulders<00:02:00.939> you

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
a proper turning of the shoulders you

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.910 
a proper turning of the shoulders you
can<00:02:01.090> see<00:02:01.329> he's<00:02:01.509> got<00:02:01.659> a<00:02:01.689> real<00:02:01.929> good<00:02:02.170> shoulder

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
can see he's got a real good shoulder

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.980 
can see he's got a real good shoulder
turn<00:02:02.950> here<00:02:03.399> so<00:02:03.909> this<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.149> a<00:02:04.179> checkpoint<00:02:04.420> one

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
turn here so this is a checkpoint one

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.560 
turn here so this is a checkpoint one
which<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.500> call<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:06.369> unit<00:02:06.729> turn<00:02:06.939> now

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
which I call the unit turn now

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.900 
which I call the unit turn now
checkpoint<00:02:08.110> two<00:02:08.350> is<00:02:08.679> interesting<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:09.670> has<00:02:09.700> to

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
checkpoint two is interesting it has to

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.850 
checkpoint two is interesting it has to
do<00:02:10.060> with<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.300> back<00:02:10.450> foot<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:11.020> call<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.530> load

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
do with the back foot I call it the load

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.400 
do with the back foot I call it the load
so<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:13.030> load<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.510> when<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.780> put<00:02:13.990> all<00:02:14.020> the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
so the load is when you put all the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.809 
so the load is when you put all the
weight<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.740> back<00:02:14.920> foot

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
weight in the back foot

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.789 
weight in the back foot
the<00:02:15.879> pros<00:02:16.090> usually<00:02:16.629> do<00:02:16.810> we<00:02:17.439> can<00:02:17.560> kind<00:02:17.739> of

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
the pros usually do we can kind of

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.580 
the pros usually do we can kind of
identify<00:02:18.519> his<00:02:19.030> back<00:02:19.239> foot<00:02:19.480> here<00:02:19.719> and<00:02:20.049> you'll

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
identify his back foot here and you'll

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.379 
identify his back foot here and you'll
see<00:02:20.799> that<00:02:21.010> when<00:02:21.430> he's<00:02:21.549> loaded<00:02:21.969> here<00:02:22.209> his

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:22.389 
see that when he's loaded here his

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:26.099 
see that when he's loaded here his
racket<00:02:22.959> or<00:02:23.530> I'm<00:02:23.650> sorry<00:02:23.889> his<00:02:24.329> leg<00:02:25.329> is<00:02:25.510> bent<00:02:25.780> so

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
racket or I'm sorry his leg is bent so

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.750 
racket or I'm sorry his leg is bent so
if<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.290> get<00:02:26.469> rid<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.829> box<00:02:27.129> and<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.489> kind<00:02:27.730> of

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
if I get rid of that box and you kind of

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.530 
if I get rid of that box and you kind of
look<00:02:27.939> at<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.560> upper<00:02:29.560> leg<00:02:30.249> and<00:02:30.579> the<00:02:30.969> lower<00:02:31.209> leg

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
look at the upper leg and the lower leg

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.080 
look at the upper leg and the lower leg
there's<00:02:31.840> definitely<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.290> bending<00:02:32.769> here<00:02:33.069> but<00:02:33.879> as

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
there's definitely a bending here but as

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.990 
there's definitely a bending here but as
he<00:02:34.299> moves<00:02:34.569> forward<00:02:34.900> you'll<00:02:35.439> see<00:02:36.000> checkpoint

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
he moves forward you'll see checkpoint

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.390 
he moves forward you'll see checkpoint
number<00:02:37.120> three<00:02:37.480> which<00:02:37.719> is<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:38.200> explode<00:02:39.010> that

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
number three which is the explode that

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.940 
number three which is the explode that
means<00:02:39.609> that<00:02:39.849> back<00:02:40.150> foot<00:02:40.389> and<00:02:41.379> leg<00:02:41.650> are<00:02:41.799> going

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
means that back foot and leg are going

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.860 
means that back foot and leg are going
to<00:02:42.010> straighten<00:02:42.340> up<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.669> this<00:02:42.819> will<00:02:43.000> kick<00:02:43.299> his

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
to straighten up and this will kick his

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.199 
to straighten up and this will kick his
body<00:02:44.169> forward<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.829> up<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.879> can<00:02:46.030> watch

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
body forward and up so you can watch

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.270 
body forward and up so you can watch
that<00:02:46.239> right<00:02:46.540> leg<00:02:46.959> watch<00:02:47.409> it<00:02:47.680> watch<00:02:47.889> it<00:02:47.950> watch

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
that right leg watch it watch it watch

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.429 
that right leg watch it watch it watch
it<00:02:48.340> now<00:02:48.639> it's<00:02:48.879> pretty<00:02:49.090> much<00:02:49.209> fully<00:02:49.840> straight

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
it now it's pretty much fully straight

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.129 
it now it's pretty much fully straight
so<00:02:51.280> if<00:02:51.430> we<00:02:51.549> just<00:02:51.730> kind<00:02:51.939> of<00:02:51.969> go<00:02:52.180> here<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.019> can

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
so if we just kind of go here you can

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.539 
so if we just kind of go here you can
see<00:02:53.349> it<00:02:53.469> straight<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:53.859> if<00:02:53.919> we<00:02:54.010> go<00:02:54.129> back<00:02:54.340> and

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
see it straight and if we go back and

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.390 
see it straight and if we go back and
forth<00:02:54.819> you<00:02:55.480> can<00:02:55.510> see<00:02:55.659> here<00:02:56.049> is<00:02:56.139> bent<00:02:56.439> here<00:02:57.280> is

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
forth you can see here is bent here is

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.629 
forth you can see here is bent here is
starting<00:02:57.669> to<00:02:57.730> straighten<00:02:58.049> here<00:02:59.049> is<00:02:59.169> bent

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
starting to straighten here is bent

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.890 
starting to straighten here is bent
right<00:03:00.639> there<00:03:00.969> and<00:03:01.239> here<00:03:01.449> is<00:03:01.540> starting<00:03:01.810> to

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
right there and here is starting to

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.929 
right there and here is starting to
straighten<00:03:02.379> and<00:03:02.620> this<00:03:02.919> is<00:03:03.099> a<00:03:03.129> huge<00:03:03.459> thing<00:03:03.730> so

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:03.939 
straighten and this is a huge thing so

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.580 
straighten and this is a huge thing so
you<00:03:04.000> can<00:03:04.150> see<00:03:04.359> his<00:03:04.569> left<00:03:04.840> side<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.139> his<00:03:05.199> body<00:03:05.409> is

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
you can see his left side of his body is

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.530 
you can see his left side of his body is
opening<00:03:05.980> up<00:03:06.159> now<00:03:06.969> we're<00:03:07.180> going<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.329> go<00:03:07.480> to

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
opening up now we're going to go to

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.599 
opening up now we're going to go to
checkpoint<00:03:07.870> number<00:03:08.290> four<00:03:08.590> which<00:03:09.040> for<00:03:09.250> me<00:03:09.370> is

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
checkpoint number four which for me is

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.939 
checkpoint number four which for me is
the<00:03:10.060> point<00:03:10.329> of<00:03:10.389> contact<00:03:10.569> which<00:03:11.079> should<00:03:11.290> be<00:03:11.500> out

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:11.949 
the point of contact which should be out

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.789 
the point of contact which should be out
in<00:03:12.010> front<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.579> the<00:03:12.669> body<00:03:12.849> and<00:03:13.780> then<00:03:14.409> depending

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
in front of the body and then depending

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.619 
in front of the body and then depending
on<00:03:14.949> what<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.790> player<00:03:15.969> wants<00:03:16.299> to<00:03:16.359> do<00:03:16.480> the

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
on what the player wants to do the

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.629 
on what the player wants to do the
finish<00:03:16.900> will<00:03:17.049> be<00:03:17.079> different<00:03:17.919> so<00:03:18.069> checkpoint

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
finish will be different so checkpoint

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.640 
finish will be different so checkpoint
number<00:03:18.730> four<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.569> point<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.900> contact<00:03:20.319> I<00:03:20.439> think

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
number four the point of contact I think

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.119 
number four the point of contact I think
is<00:03:20.769> nice<00:03:20.979> you'll<00:03:21.669> notice<00:03:22.030> Andy's<00:03:22.419> kind<00:03:22.689> of

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
is nice you'll notice Andy's kind of

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.069 
is nice you'll notice Andy's kind of
originated<00:03:24.129> close<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.239> pocket<00:03:25.540> that's

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
originated close to this pocket that's

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.589 
originated close to this pocket that's
where<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:27.280> point<00:03:27.639> of<00:03:27.729> contact<00:03:28.150> is<00:03:28.329> keep

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
where the the point of contact is keep

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.249 
where the the point of contact is keep
that<00:03:28.780> in<00:03:28.900> mind

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:29.259 
that in mind

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.069 
that in mind
and<00:03:29.500> now<00:03:30.099> extension<00:03:30.729> number<00:03:31.000> five<00:03:31.269> I'm<00:03:31.689> sorry

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
and now extension number five I'm sorry

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.990 
and now extension number five I'm sorry
checkpoint<00:03:32.919> number<00:03:33.009> five<00:03:33.340> has<00:03:33.609> to<00:03:33.669> do<00:03:33.849> with

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
checkpoint number five has to do with

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.270 
checkpoint number five has to do with
the<00:03:34.120> extension<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.169> for<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:35.829> lot<00:03:36.009> of<00:03:36.040> club

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
the extension and for a lot of club

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.679 
the extension and for a lot of club
players<00:03:36.549> this<00:03:36.790> is<00:03:36.970> really<00:03:37.239> where<00:03:37.389> they<00:03:37.509> mess

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 
players this is really where they mess

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.379 
players this is really where they mess
up<00:03:37.870> so<00:03:38.109> does<00:03:38.979> the<00:03:39.129> racket<00:03:39.489> go<00:03:39.609> forward<00:03:40.090> towards

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
up so does the racket go forward towards

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.119 
up so does the racket go forward towards
the<00:03:40.540> opponent<00:03:40.959> orders<00:03:41.109> to<00:03:41.199> come<00:03:41.379> whipping

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
the opponent orders to come whipping

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.099 
the opponent orders to come whipping
around<00:03:42.189> like<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.549> chicken<00:03:42.790> wing<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.389> I<00:03:43.900> think

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
around like a chicken wing and I think

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.830 
around like a chicken wing and I think
you'll<00:03:44.259> see<00:03:44.319> that<00:03:44.470> Andy<00:03:45.359> does<00:03:46.359> have<00:03:46.569> pretty

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
you'll see that Andy does have pretty

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.539 
you'll see that Andy does have pretty
good<00:03:47.019> extension<00:03:47.650> on<00:03:47.859> this<00:03:48.069> one<00:03:48.250> he's<00:03:48.370> trying

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
good extension on this one he's trying

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.039 
good extension on this one he's trying
to<00:03:48.609> hit<00:03:48.729> a<00:03:48.759> lot<00:03:48.909> of<00:03:48.939> topspin<00:03:49.479> so<00:03:49.659> it's<00:03:49.810> not<00:03:49.900> as

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
to hit a lot of topspin so it's not as

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.979 
to hit a lot of topspin so it's not as
much<00:03:50.079> as<00:03:50.379> normal<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:51.159> also<00:03:51.689> check<00:03:52.689> out<00:03:52.810> what

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
much as normal and also check out what

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.050 
much as normal and also check out what
he<00:03:53.079> does<00:03:53.259> on<00:03:53.439> checkpoint<00:03:53.979> number<00:03:54.310> six<00:03:54.819> which

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
he does on checkpoint number six which

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.659 
he does on checkpoint number six which
is<00:03:55.209> to<00:03:55.389> finish<00:03:55.780> he's<00:03:56.379> going<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.650> end<00:03:56.799> up<00:03:57.009> close

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
is to finish he's going to end up close

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.179 
is to finish he's going to end up close
to<00:03:57.879> his<00:03:58.060> other<00:03:58.419> pocket<00:03:58.780> so<00:03:59.680> if<00:03:59.799> we<00:03:59.919> kind<00:04:00.069> of

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:00.189 
to his other pocket so if we kind of

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.240 
to his other pocket so if we kind of
identify<00:04:00.759> this<00:04:01.479> is<00:04:01.750> one<00:04:01.989> pocket<00:04:02.469> and<00:04:02.680> then<00:04:03.129> we

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
identify this is one pocket and then we

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.099 
identify this is one pocket and then we
back<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.609> up<00:04:03.699> all<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:04.000> way<00:04:04.209> to<00:04:04.359> where<00:04:04.719> we<00:04:04.870> were

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
back it up all the way to where we were

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.280 
back it up all the way to where we were
initially<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:06.519> notice<00:04:06.790> he's<00:04:06.969> kind<00:04:07.209> of<00:04:07.329> close

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
initially and notice he's kind of close

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.399 
initially and notice he's kind of close
to<00:04:08.530> this<00:04:08.739> pocket<00:04:09.099> level<00:04:09.639> that's<00:04:10.569> a<00:04:10.750> pocket<00:04:11.259> to

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
to this pocket level that's a pocket to

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.679 
to this pocket level that's a pocket to
pocket<00:04:11.590> swing<00:04:12.099> in<00:04:12.250> my<00:04:12.400> book<00:04:12.669> and<00:04:12.909> there's<00:04:13.509> all

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
pocket swing in my book and there's all

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.390 
pocket swing in my book and there's all
kinds<00:04:14.109> of<00:04:14.169> different<00:04:14.289> finishes<00:04:14.650> people<00:04:15.069> ask

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
kinds of different finishes people ask

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.610 
kinds of different finishes people ask
us<00:04:15.579> all<00:04:15.729> the<00:04:15.789> time<00:04:16.000> about<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.359> finishes<00:04:16.840> is<00:04:17.049> it

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
us all the time about the finishes is it

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.649 
us all the time about the finishes is it
proper<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:18.009> go<00:04:18.159> around<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.549> head<00:04:18.729> or<00:04:19.150> over<00:04:19.539> the

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:19.659 
proper to go around the head or over the

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.539 
proper to go around the head or over the
shoulder<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:20.289> it<00:04:20.349> really<00:04:20.530> depends<00:04:21.159> on<00:04:21.340> what

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
shoulder and it really depends on what

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.969 
shoulder and it really depends on what
the<00:04:21.579> player<00:04:22.270> is<00:04:22.419> trying<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.780> do<00:04:22.930> when<00:04:23.650> someone

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
the player is trying to do when someone

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.830 
the player is trying to do when someone
executes<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.669> pocket<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.240> pocket<00:04:25.419> they're

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
executes the pocket to pocket they're

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.200 
executes the pocket to pocket they're
putting<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.169> lot<00:04:26.199> of<00:04:26.380> topspin<00:04:26.919> on

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
putting a lot of topspin on

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.300 
putting a lot of topspin on
maybe<00:04:27.389> trying<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.780> create<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.080> short<00:04:28.380> angle<00:04:28.770> or

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
maybe trying to create a short angle or

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.460 
maybe trying to create a short angle or
hit<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.460> short<00:04:29.789> angle<00:04:30.060> passing<00:04:30.509> shot<00:04:30.720> but

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
hit a short angle passing shot but

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.439 
hit a short angle passing shot but
that's<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.800> look<00:04:32.009> at<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.580> six<00:04:32.819> check<00:04:33.060> points

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
that's a look at the six check points

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.689 
that's a look at the six check points
and<00:04:33.539> this<00:04:33.690> particular<00:04:34.259> one<00:04:34.319> I<00:04:34.800> think<00:04:35.220> Andy

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
and this particular one I think Andy

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.850 
and this particular one I think Andy
came<00:04:35.880> up<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.120> little<00:04:36.270> short<00:04:36.419> on<00:04:36.840> his<00:04:37.169> extension

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
came up a little short on his extension

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.830 
came up a little short on his extension
but<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.610> think<00:04:38.849> that's<00:04:39.030> because<00:04:39.150> he<00:04:39.479> was<00:04:39.630> doing

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
but I think that's because he was doing

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.930 
but I think that's because he was doing
the<00:04:39.900> pocket<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.380> pocket<00:04:40.530> roller<00:04:41.039> which<00:04:41.729> would

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
the pocket the pocket roller which would

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.850 
the pocket the pocket roller which would
by<00:04:42.120> his<00:04:42.270> very<00:04:42.449> nature<00:04:42.509> have<00:04:42.960> less<00:04:43.199> extension
