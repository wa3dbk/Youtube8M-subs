Honda's<00:01:47.790> had<00:01:47.939> issues<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> past

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
Honda's had issues with this in the past

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.130 
Honda's had issues with this in the past
now<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.399> opinion<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.420> if<00:01:51.750> people<00:01:52.079> would

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
now my opinion is that if people would

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.319 
now my opinion is that if people would
just<00:01:52.200> put<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> car<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:52.950> park<00:01:52.979> before<00:01:53.909> they

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
just put the car in park before they

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.760
