00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 guys, if at all, I follow 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.920
 needy and this here is true we 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.230
 we found a day totally 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.389
 Random no guys today is Friday 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.500
 end alleluia 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.969
 and our joy for all of you 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.740
 because he loves Friday but 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.910
 also because here in the channel is a 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.410
 special day because every day 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.420
 tricks of agreements to every Friday 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.789
 you have a nice little trick here 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.740
 agreement and it's not the kind of trick of a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.510
 water tree that if I do not know that for the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.519
 zombies not 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.279
 today we double today we double today we go 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.650
 to convert from one block to another we will 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.940
 get a block of random you have to 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.890
 it's going to come out of nowhere it's worth 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.410
 spectacular the trick and before you start 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.590
 tell you what the fuck in towns we're going 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.570
 to see why I when he never played 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.570
 two blacksmiths come out and there they have to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.920
 leave two more in your face and pum 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.149
 horrible really horrible I do not want nor 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.280
 enter because surely they are cited 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.640
 has to come when we go with the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.649
 trick of agreement is this here is this worth 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.480
 what you see here you have to do this 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.149
 mechanism with which you get two repeat 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.430
 the edges two of the rest in the torch 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.290
 there is a comparator and then three pistons 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.120
 sticky or two normal 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.530
 with that you got it solved 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.370
 because the rest are blocks agreement 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.120
 good and how it works let's catch 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.760
 our diamond block that is here 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.090
 and we are going to put it here 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.280
 and we say magic 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.880
 Magic 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.520
 I'm afraid the time is cool too 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.520
 fly a lot we're going to break all this 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.110
 that I'm not interested and we can put the 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.580
 blue pile and the poor diamond 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.620
 that now has a lot used with the 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.180
 Enchantment table theme and you go 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.180
 to need good then now 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.860
 to duplicate it and taken out a little bit scratched 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.260
 with the piston theme but there we are 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.840
 that simple and we duplicate and nothing does not 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.720
 you're going to make yourself a champion or mistake there 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.670
 Sponges are any thing because 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.380
 say new is missing sponges there 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.090
 very little you can get game 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.680
 the other sponges cost a lot because 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.680
 they do not look that simple 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.370
 or you get more bookstore and you say no 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.110
 come on is that the truth that to get 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.150
 at level 30 I need a lot of leather and I do not 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.420
 I find leather and leather and leather and 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.790
 look is already here the quietly what 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.129
 you need this duplicate can not 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.840
 plead to objects that can not move 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.430
 the piston as for example a beacon 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.440
 balloon beacon that can be moved by the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.440
 piston will not be able to duplicate it 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.610
 this block here if you do not put anything 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.650
 this block has doubled according but 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.959
 if this block does not put less I'm going to 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.890
 show that you are duplicating the 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:50.190
 piston if this block we do not put it not 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.110
 it's going to work, look, you see, 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.520
 if he has also put a piston there 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.890
 sticky but imagine you say no 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.300
 Well here I put the diamond and I 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.070
 saving all the machine that is here 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.100
 laces because such because why because 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.590
 follow smarter do not look at the function of 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.040
 agreement what are you seeing it does not work no and 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.080
 although I put here another one does not work 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.550
 nothing is worth not work according to 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.450
 do not make them my attempt ok 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:20.630
 well we will not leave as it was not 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.610
 there's great come on let's go give it 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.650
 street okay let's take a block 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.600
 anyone and we're also going to try a 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.690
 little nose to play a little 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.460
 with the wool is good and I'm going to upload it to 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.080
 a decent height so you can see 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.550
 better and I can move better does not 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.970
 It is missing that we what its vice 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:44.990
 it is to your liking the structure is worth 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:46.850
 the next 2 22 well we eat another 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.020
 different block to be able to differentiate 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.020
 good things 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.190
 there we can other two us six 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.170
 seeing 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:03.070
 already there it is worth it is to say 222 it is worth as well as 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.900
 a kind of n is it not what 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.490
 it looks like the tetris block 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.240
 you see, it's the tetris block 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:13.480
 literally and then right here 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.390
 you see that I have put two and here another very 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.019
 well this is how it is going to be now 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.290
 we take a switch and we put it 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.010
 there 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.250
 perfect now we take a torch of 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.550
 Reston there 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.330
 a comparator 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.040
 Oh 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:41.110
 one of the rest of the rest 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.660
 a repeater repeater repeater rest 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.330
 it's that simple 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.630
 now the next point we turn on the 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.640
 buyer pum and one click to this repeater 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.400
 there we are 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.009
 we take sticky piston 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.210
 and this comes next to blue block worth 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.980
 there is 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.240
 right next to that 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.910
 another that goes down 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.240
 and just next to this the signal 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.220
 from the rest of the same height there we are 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.169
 we put another one would already be mounted our 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.590
 little machine you see has not been very 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:21.470
 difficult it's pretty easy to do it 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.470
 we give you there and double t please 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.740
 and friend miss the block and saying god 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.479
 the car is finished in the video there is no lack 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.760
 our slide block is mandatory 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.490
 if what you want and does not work and there 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.060
 we are now if God fits I will stay 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.540
 super scratch is worth and then ready as 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.010
 you see works very well ok we break the 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.260
 blocks that can also be broken 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:51.260
 disappear the blocks is to break them 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:55.240
 and ready it works to duplicate this 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:58.849
 You can look how you see it does not work 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.740
 so do not try it 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:02.779
 and even anything seriously guys 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.840
 we have to mentalize that this is going to 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:10.210
 work for anything you see 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.480
 it's amazing, it 's a great trick to 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.430
 duplicate objects with objects no more 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.250
 blocks if you liked the trick of the 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.230
 light subscribe how many more likes better 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.550
 because that encourages me here that I know that 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.650
 you like this kind of trick 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.810
 because if you do not put many likes I think 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.220
 that the duplicate you do not like then that 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.850
 there are many laypersons in a certain video 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.800
 means that you like that method but 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.390
 that in addition that style of tricks also 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.710
 you like it and then also a series of 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.650
 tricks every Friday you will like it 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.970
 very much before the like is worth a lot or 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.220
 a comment that I loved the 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.500
 video was that it really fills me 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.300
 so nothing yourselves if it has 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.260
 liked to the law subscribe and tomorrow more 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.260
 and better until later
