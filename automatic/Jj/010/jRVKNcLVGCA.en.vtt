00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.290 

okay<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:01.680> head-to-head<00:00:02.550> shootout

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
okay this is a head-to-head shootout

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.940 
okay this is a head-to-head shootout
between<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:04.020> Lumix<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.740> Panasonic<00:00:05.460> Lumix

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
between the Lumix the Panasonic Lumix

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.749 
between the Lumix the Panasonic Lumix
fz1000<00:00:07.950> on<00:00:08.130> my<00:00:08.400> left<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:08.960> the<00:00:09.960> Sony<00:00:10.759> rx100

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
fz1000 on my left and the Sony rx100

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.890 
fz1000 on my left and the Sony rx100
mark<00:00:12.210> four<00:00:12.480> on<00:00:12.750> my<00:00:13.049> right<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.730> got<00:00:15.690> both

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
mark four on my right and so I got both

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.170 
mark four on my right and so I got both
cameras<00:00:16.440> as<00:00:16.590> close<00:00:16.920> as<00:00:17.279> far<00:00:17.520> as<00:00:17.640> framing<00:00:18.060> as

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
cameras as close as far as framing as

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.150 
cameras as close as far as framing as
possible<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.720> think<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.080> sony's<00:00:19.410> at<00:00:19.500> about<00:00:19.710> 35

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
possible I think the sony's at about 35

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.740 
possible I think the sony's at about 35
millimeter<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.939> think<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> Lumix<00:00:21.600> is

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
millimeter and I think the Lumix is

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.380 
millimeter and I think the Lumix is
about<00:00:21.930> 37<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:23.400> very<00:00:23.580> hard<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.150> Sony

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
about 37 it's very hard to get the Sony

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.269 
about 37 it's very hard to get the Sony
exactly<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.500> number<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.800> want<00:00:25.949> when<00:00:26.189> you

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
exactly on the number you want when you

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.429 
exactly on the number you want when you
hit<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.430> zoom<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:28.019> it's<00:00:28.050> close

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
hit that zoom in and out but it's close

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.900 
hit that zoom in and out but it's close
enough<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.830> government<00:00:29.130> work<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.789> these

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
enough for government work and these

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.560 
enough for government work and these
should<00:00:30.060> both<00:00:30.240> be<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.570> about<00:00:30.660> F<00:00:30.960> 2.8<00:00:32.120> which<00:00:33.120> once

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
should both be at about F 2.8 which once

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.940 
should both be at about F 2.8 which once
you<00:00:33.690> zoom<00:00:34.280> in<00:00:35.540> with<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.750> Sony<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.440> goes<00:00:37.620> from<00:00:37.770> F

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
you zoom in with the Sony it goes from F

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.790 
you zoom in with the Sony it goes from F
1.8<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:38.879> 2.8<00:00:39.420> relatively<00:00:40.170> quickly<00:00:40.410> once

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
1.8 to have 2.8 relatively quickly once

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.010 
1.8 to have 2.8 relatively quickly once
you<00:00:41.010> start<00:00:41.399> tightening<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.570> subject

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
you start tightening in on the subject

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.040 
you start tightening in on the subject
so<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:44.040> at<00:00:44.219> F<00:00:44.340> 2.8<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> Lumix<00:00:45.840> is

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
so it's at F 2.8 and then the Lumix is

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.860 
so it's at F 2.8 and then the Lumix is
at<00:00:46.200> its<00:00:46.379> widest<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.190> 37<00:00:47.910> millimeter<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.450> 4k

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
at its widest at 37 millimeter and 4k

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.160 
at its widest at 37 millimeter and 4k
mode<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:50.730> at<00:00:50.879> its<00:00:51.120> fastest<00:00:51.660> which<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.020> f

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
mode and it at its fastest which is f

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.930 
mode and it at its fastest which is f
2.8<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.850> not<00:00:54.000> exactly<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.800> totally<00:00:55.940> fair

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
2.8 so it's not exactly a totally fair

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.029 
2.8 so it's not exactly a totally fair
shootout<00:00:57.629> because<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.199> Lumix<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.739> at<00:00:58.890> its

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
shootout because the Lumix is at its

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.430 
shootout because the Lumix is at its
widest<00:00:59.579> angle<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.180> view<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.690> then<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.930> sonia

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
widest angle of view and then the sonia

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.729 
widest angle of view and then the sonia
zoomed<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> little<00:01:02.280> bit<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.409> what

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
zoomed in a little bit so but it is what

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.770 
zoomed in a little bit so but it is what
it<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.280> closest<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:05.939> get<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
it is it's the closest I can get it and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.340 
it is it's the closest I can get it and
both<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.470> them<00:01:07.590> are<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.490> vivid<00:01:08.939> setting<00:01:09.810> so

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
both of them are on the vivid setting so

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.100 
both of them are on the vivid setting so
I<00:01:10.740> believe<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> term<00:01:12.000> they<00:01:12.180> both<00:01:12.659> use

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
I believe that's the term they both use

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.249 
I believe that's the term they both use
the<00:01:13.619> Sony<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.820> had<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.150> put<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.509> program<00:01:15.990> mode

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the Sony I had to put it in program mode

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.719 
the Sony I had to put it in program mode
in<00:01:16.409> order<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.369> you're<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
in order to do that if you're in the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.910 
in order to do that if you're in the
full<00:01:17.880> auto<00:01:18.090> mode<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.630> won't<00:01:18.869> allow<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.710> put

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
full auto mode it won't allow you to put

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.429 
full auto mode it won't allow you to put
it<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.340> both<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.299> them<00:01:21.630> are<00:01:21.780> tracking<00:01:22.320> my

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it in that both of them are tracking my

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.740 
it in that both of them are tracking my
face<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.159> again<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:24.060> had<00:01:24.330> problems<00:01:24.600> with

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
face and again I have had problems with

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.260 
face and again I have had problems with
the<00:01:24.930> Lumix<00:01:25.320> hunting<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.070> focus<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.000> type

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the Lumix hunting on focus in this type

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.330 
the Lumix hunting on focus in this type
of<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.570> situation<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> past<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.250> gonna

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
of a situation in the past so it's gonna

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.179 
of a situation in the past so it's gonna
be<00:01:29.460> interesting<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.880> see<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.210> happens<00:01:30.329> here

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
be interesting to see what happens here

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.800 
be interesting to see what happens here
so<00:01:32.189> when<00:01:32.790> you're<00:01:32.939> doing<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.210> stand<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.630> like

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
so when you're doing a stand up like

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.450 
so when you're doing a stand up like
this<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.350> you're<00:01:34.470> moving<00:01:34.619> around<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.310> so

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
this and you're moving around and so

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.910 
this and you're moving around and so
forth<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:36.119> rely<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.990> ability<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
forth you do rely on the ability of the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.460 
forth you do rely on the ability of the
camera<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.670> track<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.450> face<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.020> keep<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> in

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
camera to track the face and keep it in

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.609 
camera to track the face and keep it in
focus<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.150> best<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.659> keep<00:01:42.899> looking<00:01:43.409> at

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
focus and it is best to keep looking at

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.350 
focus and it is best to keep looking at
the<00:01:43.860> camera<00:01:44.070> because<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.850> look<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the camera because if you look to the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.460 
the camera because if you look to the
side<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:45.930> you're<00:01:46.079> interviewing

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
side like if you're interviewing

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.950 
side like if you're interviewing
somebody<00:01:46.939> sometimes<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.149> cameras<00:01:48.540> will<00:01:48.720> lose

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
somebody sometimes the cameras will lose

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.289 
somebody sometimes the cameras will lose
that<00:01:49.380> facial<00:01:49.979> recognition<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.850> it'll<00:01:51.090> hunt

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
that facial recognition and it'll hunt

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.920 
that facial recognition and it'll hunt
to<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.479> background<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:53.119> of<00:01:54.119> course<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.600> ideal

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
to the background so of course the ideal

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.139 
to the background so of course the ideal
thing<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.619> put<00:01:55.770> them<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.009> manual<00:01:56.549> focus<00:01:56.579> if

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
thing is to put them in manual focus if

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.389 
thing is to put them in manual focus if
at<00:01:57.299> all<00:01:57.390> possible<00:01:57.680> but<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.799> some<00:01:59.040> run-and-gun

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
at all possible but in some run-and-gun

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.459 
at all possible but in some run-and-gun
situations<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.540> gets<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.960> little<00:02:01.110> bit<00:02:01.290> dicey

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
situations that gets a little bit dicey

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.289 
situations that gets a little bit dicey
as<00:02:01.860> well<00:02:02.100> because<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.610> might<00:02:02.820> miss<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
as well because you might miss that

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.289 
as well because you might miss that
manual<00:02:03.840> focus<00:02:04.229> point<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.909> not<00:02:05.909> know<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
manual focus point and not know it and

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.199 
manual focus point and not know it and
take<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.630> back<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.869> learn<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.799> post<00:02:08.209> so

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
take it back and learn it in post so

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.550 
take it back and learn it in post so

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
little heads up these both have the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.369

Lumix<00:02:16.019> I<00:02:16.230> think<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.560> can<00:02:16.680> get<00:02:16.799> for<00:02:16.829> like<00:02:17.069> $800

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
Lumix I think you can get for like $800

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.300 
Lumix I think you can get for like $800
now<00:02:18.030> Sony<00:02:18.750> just<00:02:19.019> came<00:02:19.200> out<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:19.920> list

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
now Sony just came out so it's it's list

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.569 
now Sony just came out so it's it's list
price<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.700> about<00:02:21.150> $1,000<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:23.280> course<00:02:23.489> the

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
price is about $1,000 of course the

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.520 
price is about $1,000 of course the
advantage<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:24.060> Sony<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.659> it's<00:02:24.900> extremely

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
advantage that Sony is it's extremely

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.199 
advantage that Sony is it's extremely
compact<00:02:25.980> very<00:02:26.280> very<00:02:26.609> small

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
compact very very small

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.720 
compact very very small
the<00:02:27.870> advantage<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.379> lumix<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.280> has<00:02:29.430> much

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
the advantage to lumix is it has much

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.030 
the advantage to lumix is it has much
more<00:02:29.760> zoom<00:02:30.299> reach<00:02:30.599> that<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.170> huge<00:02:31.650> plus<00:02:31.980> for

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
more zoom reach that is a huge plus for

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.800 
more zoom reach that is a huge plus for
event<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:32.909> this<00:02:33.030> thing<00:02:33.269> will<00:02:33.390> go<00:02:33.510> all<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.780> way

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
event so this thing will go all the way

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.869 
event so this thing will go all the way
out<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.140> almost<00:02:34.379> 600<00:02:34.769> millimeter<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.790> have

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
out to almost 600 millimeter and I have

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.179 
out to almost 600 millimeter and I have
a<00:02:35.939> lot<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.180> reviews<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.959> FC<00:02:37.260> 1,000<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:38.010> my

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
a lot of reviews on the FC 1,000 on my

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.910 
a lot of reviews on the FC 1,000 on my
site<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.790> sample<00:02:39.180> videos<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.689> so<00:02:39.840> forth

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
site and in sample videos and so forth

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.649 
site and in sample videos and so forth
only<00:02:40.920> issue<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.609> have<00:02:41.819> with<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.030> camera<00:02:42.510> is

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
only issue I have with that camera is

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.770 
only issue I have with that camera is
that<00:02:42.689> focus<00:02:43.409> hunting<00:02:44.400> issue<00:02:44.609> which<00:02:45.329> we<00:02:45.569> might

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
that focus hunting issue which we might

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.490 
that focus hunting issue which we might
see<00:02:46.049> a<00:02:46.079> little<00:02:46.230> bit<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.409> in<00:02:46.769> this<00:02:47.040> video<00:02:48.500> so

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
see a little bit of in this video so

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.129 
see a little bit of in this video so
that's<00:02:50.250> my<00:02:50.730> head-to-head<00:02:51.209> comparison<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.049> of

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
that's my head-to-head comparison and of

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.509 
that's my head-to-head comparison and of
course<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.470> other<00:02:52.620> big<00:02:52.709> advantage<00:02:52.859> to<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
course the other big advantage to the

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.069 
course the other big advantage to the
Lumix<00:02:53.819> is<00:02:54.030> I've<00:02:54.239> got<00:02:54.419> this<00:02:54.629> microphone

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
Lumix is I've got this microphone

plugged right into a mic input right on
the<00:02:57.450> side<00:02:57.859> very<00:02:58.859> easy<00:02:59.189> for<00:02:59.489> audio<00:02:59.760> with<00:03:00.480> the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
the side very easy for audio with the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.509 
the side very easy for audio with the
Sony<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.319> have<00:03:01.439> a<00:03:01.500> video<00:03:01.769> I<00:03:01.829> did<00:03:01.889> yesterday

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
Sony and I have a video I did yesterday

can do that very easily with just your
iPhone<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.290> mic<00:03:10.530> or<00:03:10.769> just<00:03:11.010> hand<00:03:11.340> holding

basically<00:03:14.849> recording<00:03:15.599> audio<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.200> then

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
basically recording audio and then

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.619 
basically recording audio and then

syncing it up in post so it's not a

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.869 
syncing it up in post so it's not a
