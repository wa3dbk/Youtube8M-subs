00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the trend is so much now but there used

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.670 
the trend is so much now but there used

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
to be that the concealer under the eye

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.240 
to be that the concealer under the eye
would<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.910> really<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:30.600> light<00:00:30.950> and<00:00:31.950> I<00:00:32.070> never

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
would be really really light and I never

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.970

quite understood that and the correctors
are<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.250> good<00:00:35.430> because<00:00:35.610> when<00:00:35.910> they're<00:00:36.059> placed

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300

two together now doing this in a little

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.150 
two together now doing this in a little
pot<00:02:55.930> makes<00:02:56.200> more<00:02:56.410> sense<00:02:56.710> because<00:02:56.830> you<00:02:57.040> can

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
pot makes more sense because you can

keep<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.580> it's<00:02:57.760> not<00:02:57.880> great<00:02:58.150> but<00:02:58.180> I'm<00:02:58.420> using<00:02:58.630> a

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
keep it it's not great but I'm using a

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.080 
keep it it's not great but I'm using a
stainless<00:02:59.200> steel<00:02:59.230> palette<00:02:59.740> just<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.850> show<00:03:01.030> you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
now add more color as you go along but

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.430 
now add more color as you go along but
best<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.820> kind<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.210> go<00:03:04.450> sparingly<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.230> add

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
best to kind of go sparingly and add

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.890 
best to kind of go sparingly and add
rather<00:03:05.860> than<00:03:06.070> put<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.220> load<00:03:06.460> in<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:07.510> just<00:03:07.720> mix

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
rather than put a load in so just mix

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.270 
rather than put a load in so just mix
the<00:03:08.020> two<00:03:08.140> together<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.710> can<00:03:08.830> see<00:03:08.860> that<00:03:09.160> it

the two together and you can see that it

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.850 
the two together and you can see that it
becomes<00:03:09.460> more<00:03:10.300> sort<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:11.160> orangey<00:03:12.160> based<00:03:12.880> and

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
becomes more sort of orangey based and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.290 
becomes more sort of orangey based and
correctives<00:03:14.860> are<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.160> good<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:15.610> here's<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.180> on
