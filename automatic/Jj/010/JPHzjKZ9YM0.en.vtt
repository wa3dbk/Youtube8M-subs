00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.440
 Hi guys, before you start this 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.880
 review 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.010
 I know there are not many people who 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.380
 knows that three weeks without 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.150
 post it because I was lazy 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.910
 that's the good truth at last I am today 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.380
 here make a book review the curve 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.769
 showed the same band 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.690
 I did the fire proof review. 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.399
 a few weeks and I said I was going to do 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.210
 a review that is the last one of the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.090
 trilogy 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.200
 I know it has a spin-off order of 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.590
 extermination and also has the same files 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.739
 only they do not compose the history of 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.960
 technology so I know the order of 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.180
 extermination is talking about how they 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.250
 created the labyrinth and I wanted to be 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.460
 but it is a goal because of that book 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.670
 if you have seen fire proof friendship 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.740
 you must have seen in discussing a box 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.830
 that I gave a low grade for this 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.210
 I book from 6.8 tank to the first 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.830
 of 8.9 then how has it been a while since 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.490
 I read this book and I can not talk to 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.439
 details everything I see everything I liked 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.790
 one more thing that with a lot on my 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:30.479
 head is that I was very fond of tereza 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.450
 very much always liked even proof of 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.799
 fire when that motherfucker was me 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.310
 I liked her 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.060
 I think she's cool, I like the character. 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.659
 nature 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.060
 hey thomas is dying of rage 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:50.430
 because in the second book she 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.200
 lied to him and hit him and those 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.390
 things you read you fire proof you 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.490
 You know I'm talking and then he stayed. 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.960
 all angry why she did it 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.899
 because she kind of worked cruel and 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.430
 He can not forgive Teresa and there 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.770
 happens 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.940
 spoiler max people this review facit 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.250
 spoiler because I have to express the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.020
 how unsatisfied 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.160
 I kept this book that I could 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.930
 reached the third he discovers that the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.570
 brenda has also worked for the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.660
 cruel and he's not mad at all 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.950
 not a bit or a little 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.090
 I understand why he could not 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:40.100
 excuse Teresa for something she 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:43.070
 did to save him and friend Thomas 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.600
 What hit you in the head if I did not understand 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.760
 What happened in the books jumped? 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.190
 explain why I do not 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.400
 I understood this game and I was more 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.170
 streets of noni with this book because I 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.209
 I loved nature and wanted me 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.920
 stay with Teresina and another school is 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.610
 maximum here if you read the book you 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.690
 knows that maybe it will not die in the end 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.180
 thing that she uses very dissatisfied and 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.920
 frustrated because the first time 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.920
 it was a favorite character the shock 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:30.110
 He dies in the first book of mine. 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:34.790
 favorite character 2011 and humble him 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.950
 dies and still for the reason but it is not 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.989
 immunity drowned and near the goal and who 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.750
 answers thomas mann I do not like the 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:46.579
 thomas thomas just made me dislike 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.920
 r touring hydrants for everything he did alone 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.870
 I do not like tom's bound to like it 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.820
 it 's just that the main character is good 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.370
 I thought this story is 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.190
 winding up I took so long 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.590
 I wrote this book because the story told me 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.549
 I developed it there was that thing 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.950
 so and you pass yourself like that, I will not 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:10.280
 I spent this whole series wanting to know 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.709
 more about the aunt and be happy in that law to 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.560
 aped that always in the last pages of 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.130
 book's appeal is the type she talking and 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.950
 tals I do not appear worthy type 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.690
 from this book the ridiculous departure the final 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.900
 The book is ridiculous. 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.480
 has an end worthy of a series that 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.510
 started so good is an end 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.100
 the rotten I've seen people talking an example is 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.440
 the list is what would have happened if 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.140
 stories so something good and if it's legal the 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.670
 books and can travel can 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.670
 banese can create a crazy story 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.820
 Anyway, when I finished my book, I 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:57.100
 I threw it in the trash 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:59.810
 there I took and kept because exalted 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.900
 remembered would not be the same much anger 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.520
 has this deal also from dl I liked it 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.020
 than it appears because I had not 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.300
 managed to understand at the end of the first 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.590
 book had died the cruel had 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.510
 so I learned from it the Indians fled 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.310
 she had not understood and there 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.100
 in this book when he showed up here 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.290
 Okay, I get it. I liked it, it was. 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.030
 a positive factor for this book that I 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.820
 I also liked that they went back to 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.590
 Brito in the end wins there as I already said 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.960
 in my other reviews and in my 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.000
 reaction to the messejana trailer 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.270
 I do not like this generation that James 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.700
 From China, I think I really cross it. 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.800
 could have developed better because in the 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.260
 scene are already in the cells goal had only 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.460
 I wanted to go because as I said 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.080
 psychological development of 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.470
 characters were much more interesting 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.660
 for me than the ones used and action is 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.730
 Okay, no problem, but since he 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.919
 want to make a book that has one of the 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.960
 main action genres of view it 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.300
 develop better but this is a taste 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.480
 today that you like the 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.730
 similarity then I do not know, but with 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.840
 a lot of anger with Teresa dying at the end 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:12.620
 very angry because he built the 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.110
 jeans should have built this personality 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.200
 for Teresa and a whole story and 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.270
 things behind everything she did 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.060
 in the end she died 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:26.390
 I'm sure the net jeans sucked 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.220
 brenda with thomas so it killed 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.500
 damn nature just did not notice 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.120
 that more than half of the same sedan 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.760
 reader 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.040
 beauty and I do not understand either because 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.260
 and external technology. 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:43.630
 books are gradually becoming larger 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.479
 began to find the first book - 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.280
 all and the latter the union of all 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:53.770
 he developed thing project you in 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:56.199
 galt draws with garbage is do not remain but 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.770
 I complaining because the books happened. 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:02.410
 here because of this book I have to 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.900
 totally Mexican food and I do not 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.430
 I will read books on me I remember the 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.340
 law the order of extermination 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.199
 why then do not take so maybe in the 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:15.220
 end of the year maybe later this way 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:17.580
 when a ray has passed I can read the 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:21.370
 James Amy ended my happiness 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:23.199
 told amazon but I'm still super 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:29.380
 looking forward to the movie yet another four 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:30.850
 days in haia you talk about income fell and I 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.650
 I think it's going to be really cool because 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:37.539
 first book is perfect is wonderful 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.340
 I only have to complain about this book. 

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:40.750
 that is the truth that we are required 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.849
 to watch 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:51.090
 I hope you like the science of 

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:51.090
 existence of the channel and bye
