00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
come up with a new design for this that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.539 
come up with a new design for this that
has<00:01:34.860> holes<00:01:35.810> around<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.890> allows

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
has holes around it so that it allows

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.640 
has holes around it so that it allows
the<00:01:38.579> grease<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.360> drip<00:01:39.570> out<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.079> allows<00:01:40.259> more

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the grease to drip out and allows more

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.399 
the grease to drip out and allows more
smoke<00:01:41.009> penetration<00:01:41.869> that<00:01:42.869> was<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> really

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
smoke penetration that was a really

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.730

Bacon's<00:04:51.660> cooled<00:04:51.930> down<00:04:52.080> a<00:04:52.140> little<00:04:52.290> bit<00:04:52.550> like<00:04:53.550> I

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
Bacon's cooled down a little bit like I

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.400 
Bacon's cooled down a little bit like I
say<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:54.380> really<00:04:55.380> really<00:04:56.360> like<00:04:57.360> using<00:04:57.600> this<00:04:57.870> what

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
to have perfect quiz grill press it's

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.640 
to have perfect quiz grill press it's
the<00:05:00.360> first<00:05:00.510> time<00:05:00.660> I've<00:05:00.810> used<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:01.110> for<00:05:01.140> bacon

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
the first time I've used it for bacon

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.429 
the first time I've used it for bacon
but<00:05:02.310> they<00:05:02.460> can<00:05:02.640> turned<00:05:02.850> out<00:05:02.970> perfectly

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:07.439 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:12.930 

I<00:05:07.469> think<00:05:07.830> it<00:05:07.949> takes<00:05:08.539> turn<00:05:09.539> now

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.469 

yeah

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.939 

perfect<00:05:20.479> and<00:05:20.630> that<00:05:20.660> did<00:05:20.900> not<00:05:21.080> take<00:05:21.380> long<00:05:21.410> at

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
perfect and that did not take long at

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:22.420 
perfect and that did not take long at
all

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
all

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.360 
all
I<00:05:22.460> think<00:05:22.970> that<00:05:23.090> was<00:05:23.240> less<00:05:23.449> than<00:05:23.630> 10<00:05:23.810> minutes<00:05:24.020> to

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
I think that was less than 10 minutes to

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.310 
I think that was less than 10 minutes to
cook<00:05:25.370> up<00:05:25.520> those<00:05:25.699> four<00:05:26.449> pieces<00:05:26.600> of<00:05:26.750> bacon<00:05:27.110> no

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
cook up those four pieces of bacon no

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.520 
cook up those four pieces of bacon no
mess

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:40.890 

new<00:05:31.010> flare-ups

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.370
