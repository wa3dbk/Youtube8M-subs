00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
way but um one thing that I don't really

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.010 
way but um one thing that I don't really
like<00:01:04.409> about<00:01:05.009> reflex<00:01:05.609> urethane<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.270> its<00:01:06.719> slide

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
like about reflex urethane is its slide

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.459 
like about reflex urethane is its slide
characteristics<00:01:07.829> um<00:01:08.240> cuz<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.509> reflex<00:01:10.319> your

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
characteristics um cuz with reflex your

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.010 
characteristics um cuz with reflex your
think<00:01:10.709> it<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.950> meant<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.490> grip<00:01:11.969> and<00:01:12.209> grip<00:01:12.509> only

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
think it is meant to grip and grip only

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.359 
think it is meant to grip and grip only
and<00:01:13.609> when<00:01:14.609> it<00:01:14.729> brakes<00:01:15.090> traction<00:01:15.859> um<00:01:16.859> if<00:01:17.159> you

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and when it brakes traction um if you

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.550 
and when it brakes traction um if you
well<00:01:18.209> even<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.569> you<00:01:18.599> do<00:01:18.929> have<00:01:19.109> a<00:01:19.139> glove<00:01:19.349> down

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
well even if you do have a glove down

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.980 
well even if you do have a glove down
sometimes<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.219> is<00:01:20.579> not<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.179> smoothest<00:01:21.479> slides

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
sometimes it is not the smoothest slides

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.149 
sometimes it is not the smoothest slides
because<00:01:22.649> it<00:01:22.889> is<00:01:23.009> pretty<00:01:23.719> chattery<00:01:24.719> and<00:01:25.159> just

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
because it is pretty chattery and just

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.989 
because it is pretty chattery and just
not<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.549> fun<00:01:26.880> um<00:01:27.469> and<00:01:28.469> also<00:01:29.279> at<00:01:29.429> times<00:01:29.609> too

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
not that fun um and also at times too

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:34.219 
not that fun um and also at times too
with<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.630> wheel<00:01:30.899> its<00:01:31.999> transition<00:01:32.999> into<00:01:33.450> a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
with this wheel its transition into a

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.739 
with this wheel its transition into a
slide<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:35.039> not<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.479> most<00:01:37.789> ease<00:01:38.789> in<00:01:39.270> cuz

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
slide is not really the most ease in cuz

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:42.019 
slide is not really the most ease in cuz
like<00:01:39.959> you<00:01:40.169> can<00:01:40.319> be<00:01:40.439> gripping<00:01:40.919> all<00:01:41.279> out<00:01:41.789> and

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:42.029 
like you can be gripping all out and

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:44.089 
like you can be gripping all out and
then<00:01:42.299> Oh<00:01:42.630> brick<00:01:43.109> traction<00:01:43.679> and<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:43.919> just

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:44.099 
then Oh brick traction and then just

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:47.510 
then Oh brick traction and then just
zoom<00:01:44.729> right<00:01:45.149> out<00:01:45.359> which<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:46.279> something<00:01:47.279> that<00:01:47.399> I

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
zoom right out which is something that I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.729 
zoom right out which is something that I
don't<00:01:47.639> like<00:01:48.029> in<00:01:48.179> a<00:01:48.239> wheel<00:01:48.419> and<00:01:48.779> as<00:01:49.020> most<00:01:49.349> people

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:49.739 
don't like in a wheel and as most people

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:52.760 
don't like in a wheel and as most people
probably<00:01:49.979> don't<00:01:50.219> like<00:01:50.869> but<00:01:51.869> however<00:01:52.079> if<00:01:52.560> you

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
probably don't like but however if you

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.690 
probably don't like but however if you
are<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.249> a<00:01:53.279> course<00:01:53.669> where<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.979> does<00:01:56.219> require<00:01:56.459> a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
are on a course where it does require a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.580 
are on a course where it does require a
decent<00:01:57.119> amount<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.539> grip<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:58.049> insane

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
decent amount of grip but not insane

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.679 
decent amount of grip but not insane
amounts<00:01:59.039> i<00:01:59.249> do<00:01:59.849> recommend<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.509> wheel

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
amounts i do recommend this wheel

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.690 
amounts i do recommend this wheel
because<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.259> hold<00:02:01.469> its<00:02:01.679> grip<00:02:02.159> very<00:02:02.459> well

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
because it can hold its grip very well

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.049 
because it can hold its grip very well
still<00:02:03.109> despite<00:02:04.109> that<00:02:04.319> fact<00:02:04.559> and<00:02:05.459> also<00:02:05.789> this

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:06.059 
still despite that fact and also this

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:09.919 
still despite that fact and also this
wheel<00:02:06.329> too<00:02:06.599> um<00:02:07.819> as<00:02:08.819> with<00:02:09.179> other<00:02:09.390> wheels<00:02:09.689> it

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
wheel too um as with other wheels it

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.410 
wheel too um as with other wheels it
does<00:02:10.079> cone<00:02:10.409> after<00:02:10.679> wear<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.219> all<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.519> and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
does cone after wear and all that and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.300 
does cone after wear and all that and
I<00:02:12.480> have<00:02:12.780> slim<00:02:13.110> these<00:02:13.319> things<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.709> bit<00:02:13.890> because

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
I have slim these things a bit because

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.550 
I have slim these things a bit because
pushing<00:02:15.240> around<00:02:15.300> town<00:02:15.660> doing<00:02:15.930> checks<00:02:16.380> here

and there to slow myself down thick blip

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.199 
and there to slow myself down thick blip
is<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:19.680> getting<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.950> little<00:02:19.980> bit<00:02:20.430> beveled<00:02:20.819> and

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
is just getting a little bit beveled and

about aesthetics like that and also with
these<00:03:14.819> wheels<00:03:15.060> too<00:03:15.360> one<00:03:16.049> last<00:03:16.290> thing<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.470> I

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
these wheels too one last thing that I

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.900 
these wheels too one last thing that I
will<00:03:16.709> say<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.930> lips<00:03:19.260> are<00:03:19.910> relatively

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
will say is that the lips are relatively

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.990 
will say is that the lips are relatively
soft<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:21.859> they<00:03:22.859> do<00:03:22.920> dig<00:03:23.370> them<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.760> paint

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
soft so they do dig them to the paint

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.910 
soft so they do dig them to the paint
well<00:03:24.180> they<00:03:24.299> do<00:03:24.359> like<00:03:24.690> hold<00:03:25.620> on<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.829> the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
well they do like hold on to the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.479 
well they do like hold on to the
pavement<00:03:26.390> more<00:03:27.390> so<00:03:27.720> then<00:03:27.989> wheel<00:03:28.530> with<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:29.190> much

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
pavement more so then wheel with a much

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.120 
pavement more so then wheel with a much
more<00:03:29.700> support<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.269> lip<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.890> if<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.010> have

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
more support to the lip and if you have

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.140
