half of your cooking liquid you don't
want<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.470> use<00:05:28.620> all<00:05:29.010> of<00:05:29.039> it<00:05:29.400> because<00:05:29.880> you<00:05:30.000> don't

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
want to use all of it because you don't

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.529 
want to use all of it because you don't
want<00:05:30.330> your<00:05:30.630> sauce<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:31.169> be<00:05:31.289> too<00:05:31.650> thin

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
want your sauce to be too thin

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.210 
want your sauce to be too thin
your<00:05:33.539> sauce<00:05:33.930> should<00:05:34.289> have<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:34.650> texture<00:05:35.099> and

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
your sauce should have the texture and

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.020 
your sauce should have the texture and
consistency<00:05:35.370> of<00:05:36.030> a<00:05:36.389> loose<00:05:36.690> tomato<00:05:37.289> soup

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
consistency of a loose tomato soup

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:48.649 
consistency of a loose tomato soup
fairly<00:05:39.030> liquid<00:05:39.440> but<00:05:40.440> not<00:05:40.580> watery

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.230 

now<00:05:49.659> this<00:05:49.900> next<00:05:50.259> step<00:05:50.439> is<00:05:50.889> totally<00:05:51.430> optional

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
now this next step is totally optional

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.409 
now this next step is totally optional
I<00:05:52.270> believe<00:05:52.930> it<00:05:53.080> produces<00:05:53.589> a<00:05:53.770> much<00:05:54.129> richer<00:05:54.729> more

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
I believe it produces a much richer more

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.079 
I believe it produces a much richer more
