00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
now the 88 frag name is basically the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.519 
now the 88 frag name is basically the
unkempt<00:00:18.510> herald<00:00:18.900> returning<00:00:19.470> from

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
unkempt herald returning from

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
functions in a different way

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.140 
functions in a different way
now<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.420> original<00:00:25.010> unkempt<00:00:26.010> herald<00:00:26.369> shot<00:00:26.849> one

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
now the original unkempt herald shot one

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.450 
now the original unkempt herald shot one
bullet<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.630> then<00:00:27.869> split<00:00:28.199> into<00:00:28.380> seven<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
bullet and then split into seven the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.820 
bullet and then split into seven the
fragment<00:00:30.240> however<00:00:30.599> will<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.260> shoot<00:00:31.470> five

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
fragment however will just shoot five

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.250 
fragment however will just shoot five
right<00:00:32.250> off<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> bat<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:33.030> no<00:00:33.239> splitting<00:00:33.630> this

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
right off the bat with no splitting this

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.790 
right off the bat with no splitting this
has<00:00:34.559> benefits<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.760> well<00:00:36.180> as<00:00:36.360> downsides<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
has benefits as well as downsides the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.160 
has benefits as well as downsides the
benefit<00:00:38.160> being<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.700> well<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.540> now<00:00:39.809> fire

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
benefit being that well you can now fire

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.590 
benefit being that well you can now fire
this<00:00:40.469> gun<00:00:40.680> at<00:00:40.920> point-blank<00:00:41.309> range<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.210> not

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
this gun at point-blank range and not

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.720 
this gun at point-blank range and not
have<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.989> worry<00:00:43.260> about<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.860> actual<00:00:44.190> splitting

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
have to worry about the actual splitting

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.690 
have to worry about the actual splitting
or<00:00:44.879> being<00:00:45.719> at<00:00:45.899> some<00:00:46.110> sort<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> ideal<00:00:46.950> range<00:00:47.340> in

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
or being at some sort of ideal range in

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.600 
or being at some sort of ideal range in
addition<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.899> will<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.170> much<00:00:49.500> better<00:00:49.860> at<00:00:50.219> long

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
addition it will be much better at long

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.819 
addition it will be much better at long
ranges<00:00:51.149> since<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.660> won't<00:00:51.840> basically<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
ranges since it won't basically be a

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.939 
ranges since it won't basically be a
line<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.640> gets<00:00:54.289> further<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.559> further<00:00:55.710> apart

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
line that gets further and further apart

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.010 
line that gets further and further apart
basically<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.480> you're<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.840> able<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
basically so you're going to be able to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.389 
basically so you're going to be able to
use<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.680> bit<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.920> longer<00:00:59.219> range

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
use it at a little bit of a longer range

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.430 
use it at a little bit of a longer range
in<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> original<00:01:00.000> herald<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.780> downside<00:01:01.289> is

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
in the original herald the downside is

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.740 
in the original herald the downside is
that<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.829> damaged<00:01:02.190> definitely<00:01:02.699> did<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.149> cut

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
that it's damaged definitely did get cut

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.490 
that it's damaged definitely did get cut
pretty<00:01:04.589> significantly<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.869> non<00:01:07.140> double

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
pretty significantly the the non double

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.219 
pretty significantly the the non double
penetrating<00:01:08.010> version<00:01:08.430> basically<00:01:09.030> has<00:01:09.570> times

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
penetrating version basically has times

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.310 
penetrating version basically has times
5<00:01:10.680> where<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> original<00:01:11.700> herald<00:01:12.210> had<00:01:12.390> times<00:01:12.750> 7

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
5 where the original herald had times 7

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.210 
5 where the original herald had times 7
and<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:14.869> double<00:01:15.869> penetrating<00:01:16.350> prefix<00:01:16.770> has

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and the double penetrating prefix has

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.149 
and the double penetrating prefix has
times<00:01:17.640> 8<00:01:17.939> where<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> original<00:01:18.990> head<00:01:19.290> times<00:01:19.619> 14

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
times 8 where the original head times 14

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.249 
times 8 where the original head times 14
so<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.330> definitely<00:01:21.509> see<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.900> there's<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
so you can definitely see that there's a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.859 
so you can definitely see that there's a
very<00:01:22.560> large<00:01:23.070> difference<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.909> damage<00:01:24.479> from

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
very large difference in damage from

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.130 
very large difference in damage from
this<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.070> original<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.479> when<00:01:27.960> going

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
this one and the original so when going

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.319 
this one and the original so when going
for<00:01:28.350> prefixes<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.100> would<00:01:29.250> honestly<00:01:29.460> stay<00:01:30.060> away

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
for prefixes I would honestly stay away

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.480 
for prefixes I would honestly stay away
from<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.689> devil<00:01:30.869> it's<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.680> worth<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
from the devil it's not worth it the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.760 
from the devil it's not worth it the
fire<00:01:32.729> rate<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:32.970> too<00:01:33.420> low<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.590> all<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
fire rate is too low with that all the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.990 
fire rate is too low with that all the
way<00:01:34.860> let's<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.220> ahead<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.520> take<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> look<00:01:35.909> at

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
way let's go ahead and take a look at

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.399 
way let's go ahead and take a look at
all<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> different<00:01:36.420> prefixes<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.170> are

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
all the different prefixes that are

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.370 
all the different prefixes that are
available<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.549> gun<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:40.140> our<00:01:40.229> first

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
available for this gun so for our first

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.020 
available for this gun so for our first
prefix<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> double<00:01:41.549> penetrating

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
prefix we have the double penetrating

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.510 
prefix we have the double penetrating
version<00:01:42.360> which<00:01:42.840> as<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.920> only<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
version which as you can see is only a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.969 
version which as you can see is only a
times<00:01:44.909> 8<00:01:45.180> rather<00:01:45.450> than<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.659> times<00:01:45.899> 14<00:01:46.380> that

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
times 8 rather than the times 14 that

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.030 
times 8 rather than the times 14 that
the<00:01:47.460> original<00:01:48.000> herald<00:01:48.329> had<00:01:48.509> anyway<00:01:49.290> at<00:01:49.740> long

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the original herald had anyway at long

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.310 
the original herald had anyway at long
ranges<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.759> basically<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:51.990> it's

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
ranges it is basically you know it's

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.139 
ranges it is basically you know it's
still<00:01:52.649> alright<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.399> hit<00:01:53.549> very<00:01:53.820> large

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
still alright it can hit very large

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.139 
still alright it can hit very large
targets<00:01:55.040> but<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.549> would<00:01:56.670> not<00:01:56.820> recommend

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
targets but I really would not recommend

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.760 
targets but I really would not recommend
the<00:01:57.390> double<00:01:57.570> penetrating<00:01:58.079> version<00:01:58.439> its

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
the double penetrating version its

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.950 
the double penetrating version its
accuracy<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.820> just<00:02:00.060> too<00:02:00.210> low<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
accuracy it's just too low and the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.260 
accuracy it's just too low and the
increase<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.649> damage<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.610> not<00:02:02.790> worth<00:02:03.000> it

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
increase in damage is just not worth it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.899 
increase in damage is just not worth it
next<00:02:03.960> up<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.229> intense<00:02:05.009> which<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.790> going

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
next up we have intense which is going

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
next up we have intense which is going
to<00:02:05.969> increase<00:02:06.329> your<00:02:06.630> rate<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.899> fire<00:02:07.020> by<00:02:07.920> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
to increase your rate of fire by a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.630 
to increase your rate of fire by a
fairly<00:02:08.700> significant<00:02:09.330> amount<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.400> I'm<00:02:11.400> either

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
fairly significant amount so I'm either

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.040 
fairly significant amount so I'm either
going<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.910> go<00:02:12.120> with<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.569> one

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
going to go with this one

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.610 
going to go with this one
the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.680 
the
fire<00:02:13.890> increase<00:02:14.220> or<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.430> damage<00:02:14.730> one<00:02:15.060> if<00:02:15.540> we're

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
fire increase or the damage one if we're

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.289 
fire increase or the damage one if we're
going<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> go<00:02:16.049> for<00:02:16.349> perfect<00:02:16.799> heralds<00:02:17.220> next<00:02:18.180> up

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
going to go for perfect heralds next up

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.320 
going to go for perfect heralds next up
we<00:02:18.510> have<00:02:18.540> V<00:02:19.080> bayonet<00:02:19.620> Herald<00:02:19.980> which<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.430> just

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
we have V bayonet Herald which is just

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.970 
we have V bayonet Herald which is just
like<00:02:21.510> every<00:02:21.840> other<00:02:21.870> band<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.440> attachment<00:02:22.890> of

like every other band and attachment of
50%<00:02:23.519> increase<00:02:23.909> to<00:02:24.060> your<00:02:24.090> melee<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.780> since

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
50% increase to your melee and since

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.080 
50% increase to your melee and since
this<00:02:25.890> gun<00:02:26.129> can<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.489> fired<00:02:26.730> at<00:02:26.940> point-blank

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
this gun can be fired at point-blank

this gun can be fired at point-blank
range<00:02:27.299> now<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.049> not<00:02:28.560> necessarily<00:02:29.159> a<00:02:29.190> bad<00:02:29.400> thing

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
range now is not necessarily a bad thing

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.089 
range now is not necessarily a bad thing
now<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.840> next<00:02:31.079> prefix<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:31.890> would

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
now the next prefix that I would

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.610 
now the next prefix that I would
actually<00:02:32.370> use<00:02:32.579> is<00:02:33.060> hard<00:02:33.540> which<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.319> going<00:02:34.530> to

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
actually use is hard which is going to

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.770 
actually use is hard which is going to
increase<00:02:34.890> your<00:02:35.370> damage<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.510> see<00:02:36.629> it's

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
increase your damage you can see it's

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.220 
increase your damage you can see it's
1,500<00:02:37.769> there<00:02:37.799> times<00:02:38.640> 5<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.360> out<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.989> all<00:02:40.200> of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
1,500 there times 5 so out of all of

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.410 
1,500 there times 5 so out of all of
them<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.739> would<00:02:41.250> probably<00:02:41.459> go<00:02:41.700> either<00:02:41.909> intense

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
them I would probably go either intense

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.470 
them I would probably go either intense
or<00:02:42.690> hard<00:02:42.989> when<00:02:43.200> looking<00:02:43.470> for<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> specific<00:02:44.010> one

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
or hard when looking for a specific one

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.970 
or hard when looking for a specific one
next<00:02:45.480> up<00:02:45.569> we<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.750> stiff<00:02:46.230> which<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:46.829> going<00:02:46.920> to

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
next up we have stiff which is going to

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.849 
next up we have stiff which is going to
add<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.519> gun<00:02:48.150> stock<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:48.989> basically

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
add a gun stock to it and basically

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.979 
add a gun stock to it and basically
reduce<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.340> kick<00:02:50.670> now<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.540> gun<00:02:51.690> doesn't

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
reduce the kick now this gun doesn't

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.289 
reduce the kick now this gun doesn't
really<00:02:52.170> kick<00:02:52.530> too<00:02:52.890> badly<00:02:53.160> it's<00:02:53.760> more<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.150> its

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
really kick too badly it's more of its

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.270 
really kick too badly it's more of its
accuracy<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.530> gets<00:02:55.709> affected<00:02:55.829> anything

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
accuracy that gets affected anything

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.640 
accuracy that gets affected anything
else<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:57.599> help<00:02:57.810> with<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:57.959> we<00:02:58.470> have

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
else and to help with that we have

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.710 
else and to help with that we have
explicit<00:02:59.310> explicit<00:03:00.030> will<00:03:00.150> increase<00:03:00.569> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
explicit explicit will increase the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.809 
explicit explicit will increase the
accuracy<00:03:01.079> and<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:02.129> can<00:03:02.250> definitely<00:03:02.370> see<00:03:02.670> here

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
accuracy and you can definitely see here

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.280 
accuracy and you can definitely see here
even<00:03:03.000> at<00:03:03.209> long<00:03:03.450> ranges<00:03:03.840> you're<00:03:03.989> going<00:03:04.109> to<00:03:04.170> be

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
even at long ranges you're going to be

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.110 
even at long ranges you're going to be
able<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.470> get<00:03:04.620> all<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:05.280> pellets<00:03:05.609> on<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:06.000> your

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
able to get all the pellets on to your

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.210 
able to get all the pellets on to your
target<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.659> then<00:03:07.140> finally<00:03:07.530> we<00:03:07.680> have<00:03:07.829> crammed

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
target and then finally we have crammed

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.399 
target and then finally we have crammed
crammed<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.269> going<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:09.900> increase<00:03:10.170> your

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
crammed is going to just increase your

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.130 
crammed is going to just increase your
magazine<00:03:10.950> size<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:11.970> if<00:03:12.599> you're<00:03:12.750> going<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.959> go

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
magazine size so if you're going to go

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.069 
magazine size so if you're going to go
long<00:03:13.440> range<00:03:13.769> go<00:03:14.190> explicit<00:03:14.819> if<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.209> want<00:03:15.510> pure

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
long range go explicit if you want pure

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.300 
long range go explicit if you want pure
DPS<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.920> would<00:03:17.340> honestly<00:03:17.549> go<00:03:17.970> either<00:03:18.239> intense

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
DPS I would honestly go either intense

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.990 
DPS I would honestly go either intense
or<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.760> would<00:03:21.389> go<00:03:21.569> hard<00:03:22.310> either<00:03:23.310> those<00:03:23.669> super

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
or I would go hard either those super

or I would go hard either those super
fixes<00:03:24.329> will<00:03:24.780> be<00:03:24.900> fine<00:03:25.190> now<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:26.370> wraps<00:03:26.609> up<00:03:26.790> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
fixes will be fine now that wraps up the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.089 
fixes will be fine now that wraps up the
prefixes<00:03:27.569> for<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.930> gun<00:03:28.109> now<00:03:28.290> how<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.530> get<00:03:28.980> it

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
prefixes for this gun now how to get it

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.159 
prefixes for this gun now how to get it
it<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.760> unfortunately<00:03:30.540> one<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.900> those<00:03:31.019> weapons

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
it is unfortunately one of those weapons

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.960 
it is unfortunately one of those weapons
that<00:03:31.379> you<00:03:31.560> have<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:31.950> get<00:03:32.069> from<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.310> grinder<00:03:32.790> or

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
that you have to get from the grinder or

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.780 
that you have to get from the grinder or
from<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.540> vendor<00:03:33.900> however<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.889> can<00:03:35.250> get<00:03:35.609> a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
from a vendor however you can get a

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.180 
from a vendor however you can get a
moonshine<00:03:36.480> buff<00:03:36.780> on<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.169> so<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.650> would<00:03:37.950> go

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
moonshine buff on this so I would go

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.650 
moonshine buff on this so I would go
with<00:03:38.220> boom<00:03:38.639> inator<00:03:38.879> which<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.239> going<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.540> add

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
with boom inator which is going to add

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.530 
with boom inator which is going to add
5%<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.650> grenade<00:03:40.799> damage<00:03:41.310> which<00:03:41.849> won't<00:03:42.389> do

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
5% to the grenade damage which won't do

as grips are concerned you're pretty

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.339 
as grips are concerned you're pretty
much<00:03:56.879> going<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.120> always<00:03:57.239> want<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.660> tor<00:03:57.959> grip<00:03:58.199> as

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
much going to always want a tor grip as

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.530 
much going to always want a tor grip as
that<00:03:58.829> will<00:03:58.949> increase<00:03:59.250> your<00:03:59.310> magazine<00:03:59.940> size<00:04:00.239> as

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
that will increase your magazine size as

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.750 
that will increase your magazine size as
well<00:04:01.109> as<00:04:01.169> your<00:04:01.379> reload<00:04:01.709> speed<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.609> is

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
well as your reload speed and that is

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.250 
well as your reload speed and that is
very<00:04:03.060> good<00:04:03.299> for<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.569> weapon<00:04:03.720> because<00:04:03.989> it

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
very good for this weapon because it

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.289 
very good for this weapon because it
does<00:04:04.620> kind<00:04:04.949> of<00:04:05.040> suffer<00:04:05.370> on<00:04:05.579> both<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.150> those

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
does kind of suffer on both of those

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.140 
does kind of suffer on both of those
ends<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:06.720> adding<00:04:07.049> any<00:04:07.260> other<00:04:07.440> kind<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.400> grip

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
ends and adding any other kind of grip

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.839 
ends and adding any other kind of grip
is<00:04:09.299> going<00:04:09.419> to<00:04:09.540> also<00:04:09.720> lower<00:04:10.079> your<00:04:10.669> rate<00:04:11.669> of<00:04:11.699> fire

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
is going to also lower your rate of fire

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.809 
is going to also lower your rate of fire
by<00:04:12.269> quite<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.019> bit<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:13.410> I<00:04:13.470> would<00:04:13.620> really<00:04:14.250> avoid

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
by quite a bit so I would really avoid

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.270 
by quite a bit so I would really avoid
using<00:04:15.269> Jacobs<00:04:15.840> although<00:04:16.590> if<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.919> want<00:04:16.949> rate

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
using Jacobs although if you want rate

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.699 
using Jacobs although if you want rate
of<00:04:17.370> fire<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.820> can<00:04:17.849> go<00:04:18.239> Vlad<00:04:18.479> off<00:04:18.690> so<00:04:19.320> that

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
of fire you can go Vlad off so that

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.480 
of fire you can go Vlad off so that
pretty<00:04:19.919> much<00:04:20.010> wraps<00:04:20.130> up<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.880> 88<00:04:21.750> frag<00:04:22.169> numb

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
pretty much wraps up the 88 frag numb

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.380 
pretty much wraps up the 88 frag numb
definitely<00:04:23.490> not<00:04:23.610> as<00:04:23.700> strong<00:04:23.940> as<00:04:23.969> it<00:04:24.120> wasn't

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
definitely not as strong as it wasn't

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.409 
definitely not as strong as it wasn't
born<00:04:24.539> into<00:04:24.659> but<00:04:25.229> it's<00:04:25.380> an<00:04:25.440> all<00:04:25.590> right

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
born into but it's an all right

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.870 
born into but it's an all right
and<00:04:26.509> compared<00:04:27.169> to<00:04:27.199> the<00:04:27.320> Maggie<00:04:27.530> it's<00:04:28.430> kind<00:04:28.790> of

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
and compared to the Maggie it's kind of

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.129 
and compared to the Maggie it's kind of
weird<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.120> say<00:04:29.270> this<00:04:29.419> but<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.660> Maggie<00:04:29.840> still

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
weird to say this but the Maggie still

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.860 
weird to say this but the Maggie still
does<00:04:30.410> help<00:04:31.400> DPS<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:32.000> herald<00:04:32.270> by<00:04:32.360> a<00:04:32.389> very<00:04:32.630> large

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
does help DPS the herald by a very large

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.200 
does help DPS the herald by a very large
margin<00:04:33.229> so<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:34.370> is<00:04:34.550> going<00:04:34.729> to<00:04:34.789> wrap<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.000> up

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
margin so that is going to wrap it up

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.090 
margin so that is going to wrap it up
