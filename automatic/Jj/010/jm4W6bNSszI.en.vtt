finally we have the control panel for

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.580 
finally we have the control panel for
the<00:01:57.060> protection<00:01:58.060> if<00:01:58.450> we<00:01:58.569> look<00:01:58.810> at<00:01:58.990> that<00:01:59.200> Yujin

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
has a lot of impressive different

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.570 
has a lot of impressive different
positions<00:02:08.979> he<00:02:09.280> can<00:02:09.489> do<00:02:10.440> turn<00:02:11.440> him<00:02:11.680> around<00:02:11.830> if

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
positions he can do turn him around if

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.780 
positions he can do turn him around if
you<00:02:12.849> push<00:02:13.150> on<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.480> backpack<00:02:13.890> then<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.519> little

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
wings come out like so also he can even

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.530 
wings come out like so also he can even
bend<00:02:21.310> his<00:02:21.489> arms<00:02:21.880> like<00:02:22.299> at<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.769> angle<00:02:23.769> and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
bend his arms like at that angle and

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.440 
bend his arms like at that angle and
then<00:02:25.540> if<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.810> look<00:02:26.019> behind<00:02:26.230> him<00:02:26.940> he<00:02:27.940> has<00:02:28.180> this

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
then if you look behind him he has this

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.920 
then if you look behind him he has this
little<00:02:29.459> little<00:02:30.459> things<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:30.880> go<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.329> here<00:02:31.359> so

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
little little things that go in here so

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.220 
little little things that go in here so
he<00:02:32.140> can<00:02:32.739> actually<00:02:33.130> bend<00:02:33.700> his<00:02:33.940> legs<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:35.820> almost

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
he can actually bend his legs in almost

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.870 
he can actually bend his legs in almost
an<00:02:38.230> impossible<00:02:38.980> angle<00:02:40.799> anyways<00:02:41.799> this<00:02:42.579> is<00:02:42.850> a

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
an impossible angle anyways this is a

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.000 
an impossible angle anyways this is a
soul<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.870> Chogokin<00:02:44.700> tetsujin<00:02:45.700> 28<00:02:46.329> I

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010
