00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
time it they're gonna be a little bit

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.720 
time it they're gonna be a little bit
speechless<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:38.250> know<00:00:38.340> they're<00:00:38.460> gonna<00:00:38.519> look

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.900 

I<00:00:53.630> think<00:00:54.630> any<00:00:54.870> great<00:00:55.260> game<00:00:55.620> needs<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.460> grow<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
I think any great game needs to grow it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.760 
I think any great game needs to grow it
needs<00:00:57.150> to<00:00:57.330> spread<00:00:57.510> its<00:00:57.780> wings<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.260> needs<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.560> be

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
needs to spread its wings it needs to be

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.490 
needs to spread its wings it needs to be
more<00:00:59.370> than<00:00:59.400> just<00:00:59.700> what<00:01:00.330> it<00:01:00.480> set<00:01:00.720> up<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.900> be<00:01:01.140> if

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
more than just what it set up to be if

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.080 
more than just what it set up to be if
you<00:01:01.650> don't<00:01:01.830> try<00:01:02.130> new<00:01:02.340> things<00:01:02.370> you're<00:01:02.910> never

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
you don't try new things you're never

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.530 
you don't try new things you're never
going<00:01:03.330> to<00:01:03.360> know<00:01:03.450> how<00:01:03.809> far<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.379> take<00:01:04.589> it

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
going to know how far you can take it

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.240 
going to know how far you can take it
when<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.660> make<00:01:06.840> games<00:01:07.050> we<00:01:07.440> make<00:01:07.620> games<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.010> us

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
when we make games we make games for us

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.010 
when we make games we make games for us
for<00:01:08.610> ourselves<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.270> find<00:01:09.540> fun<00:01:09.750> because

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
for ourselves that we find fun because

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.000 
for ourselves that we find fun because
if<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.140> don't<00:01:10.290> find<00:01:10.410> it<00:01:10.530> fun<00:01:10.680> we're<00:01:10.890> not

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
if we don't find it fun we're not

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.230 
if we don't find it fun we're not
interested<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.460> doing<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.850> not<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> be

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
interested in doing it's not going to be

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.200 
interested in doing it's not going to be
great<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:13.320> explored<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.160> kinds<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.790> different

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
great we explored all kinds of different

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.240 
great we explored all kinds of different
games<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.840> could<00:01:15.990> make<00:01:16.229> with<00:01:16.410> this<00:01:16.619> but

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
games that we could make with this but

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.300 
games that we could make with this but
the<00:01:17.580> action<00:01:18.210> shooter<00:01:18.869> genre<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.619> was<00:01:19.770> actually

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the action shooter genre it was actually

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.609 
the action shooter genre it was actually
a<00:01:20.369> really<00:01:20.670> great<00:01:21.300> marriage<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.259> see

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
a really great marriage you get see

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.710 
a really great marriage you get see
where<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.040> could<00:01:23.220> go<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.880> think<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.479> biggest

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
where it could go I think the biggest

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.270 
where it could go I think the biggest
obstacle<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.560> ways<00:01:25.649> is<00:01:25.800> people's

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
obstacle a lot of ways is people's

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.680 
obstacle a lot of ways is people's
perception<00:01:26.910> and<00:01:27.090> that's<00:01:27.330> mostly<00:01:27.600> because

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
perception and that's mostly because

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.480 
perception and that's mostly because
people<00:01:28.200> know<00:01:28.350> PBZ<00:01:28.860> very<00:01:29.100> much<00:01:29.280> by<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.770 
into a big ol 3d I think if it was sort
of<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.590> secondary<00:01:44.460> thought<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.970> hey<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.630> need<00:01:45.690> to

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
of a secondary thought of hey we need to

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.480 
of a secondary thought of hey we need to
make<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.320> game<00:01:46.500> let's<00:01:46.740> put<00:01:46.890> PBZ<00:01:47.310> on

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
it I think if that would be crazy I

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.450 
it I think if that would be crazy I
think<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.590> teams<00:01:49.800> did<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.979> great<00:01:50.190> job<00:01:50.220> of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
