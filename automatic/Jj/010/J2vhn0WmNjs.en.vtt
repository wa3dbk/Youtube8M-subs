00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.060 
once like you get some heat in a mine
and<00:03:20.420> get<00:03:20.750> my<00:03:20.870> momentum<00:03:21.050> my<00:03:21.440> rhythm<00:03:21.710> going<00:03:21.890> I

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
and get my momentum my rhythm going I

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.680 
and get my momentum my rhythm going I
was<00:03:22.220> better<00:03:22.430> kind<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.180> running<00:03:23.420> through<00:03:23.540> that

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
was better kind of running through that

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.110 
was better kind of running through that
bottom<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.200> middle<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:24.680> know<00:03:24.800> two<00:03:25.700> thirds<00:03:25.910> of

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
bottom to middle you know two thirds of

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.390 
bottom to middle you know two thirds of
racetrack<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:26.930> just<00:03:27.140> just<00:03:28.010> took<00:03:28.220> me<00:03:28.340> a

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
racetrack and it just just took me a

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.530 
racetrack and it just just took me a
little<00:03:28.459> while<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.820> get<00:03:28.910> my<00:03:29.060> train<00:03:29.330> back

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
little while to get my train back

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.760 
little while to get my train back
rolling<00:03:29.810> with<00:03:30.020> our<00:03:30.140> trains<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:30.560> know<00:03:30.650> they

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
just took right off I probably should

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.270 
just took right off I probably should
have<00:03:32.840> been<00:03:32.930> on<00:03:33.080> that<00:03:33.110> bottom<00:03:33.560> but<00:03:33.740> you<00:03:34.130> know<00:03:34.190> it

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280
