00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.570
 how to install department mode 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.960
 which is the easiest way to 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.029
 install 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.250
 you will see there is no required 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.750
 so as you can see there is 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.920
 a fucking web video that's been around since 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.850
 long time this guy did not do anymore 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.230

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.540
 well yes as I wanted to said 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.579

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.320
 what is a mini theme? 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.910
 new interface added in minecraft 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.359
 this interface allows you to get 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.550
 objects per coin per stack or to 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.019
 infinity then to open and close the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.000
 menu is very simple you press 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.590
 shoo 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.270
 then if you want to get by 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.670

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.320

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.710
 time lapse

 if you install your fashion shots that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.869
 can span five five seven 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.759
 yes page it depends on the modes you 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.009

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.420
 said before we will delete everything 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.700

 so that's the end of what is 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.090
 from the explanation of any military then 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.989
 any mini temse can be used solo 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.370
 and in multiplayer 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.069
 the only difference is that 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.709
 multiplayer we can not use the 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.930
 use the options to delete 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.609
 objects or back up inventories 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.370
 it will not be that in multiplayer 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.530
 but the interface offering all 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.690

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.299
 mini temse does not require a prerequisite 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.349
 in the sense that there is no fashion 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.150
 installed beforehand 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.639
 we will first download the 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.109
 fashion on the official website then we 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.889

 on google yahoo as you feel 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:40.199
 you type too many times and you go 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.870
 fall on a link that is called everything 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.620
