00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.530
 It is his third working day as the new railway boss but Rüdiger Grube takes his own 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.579
 An afternoon time just has this appointment 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:17.099
 the meeting of the supporting members of the pro-rail alliance is his goal 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.109
 Breakfast Bobo has from trust moment 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.500
 a home game is found attacking railway companies 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:30.189
 But friends who now very benevolently accept them today 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.189
 Welcome to welcome us 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.100
 «We believe in the future of rail transport and the organ 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.480
 We are torn by the pro-rail alliance for fair competition 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.790
 Thus, the rail competition of the modes of transport fully exploited their potential 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.980
 can unfold with its affable nature 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.990
 coarsen the supporting members for themselves without financing for example 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.640
 make stop and expand the rail infrastructure 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.609
 the railways can play their role in a sustainable transport system 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.840
 do not take over 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.820
 it is therefore very good 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.350
 That's in Germany 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.580
 this alliance 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.550
 the rail gives 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.180
 said to my team 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.009
 if the alliance does not exist 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.369
 you have to invent them the new railroad boss 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.529
 answers questions from members about the passenger used 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.900
 Hotspots and he meets very attentive listeners the lead 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.990
 This overall process is general judgment of the sponsoring members 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.900
 Büchler's successor 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.530
 one of the hardest job ever in Germany 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.320
 until he's looking at us Note is part 2 of this 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.160
 Förderkreis Treffen public panel discussion 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.420
 what brings the federal election for rail traffic should pay off 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.729
 the truck toll redistributed one has at that time Tel he chooses Weende 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.690
 the number of promised 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.820
 Government would have to pay more 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.030
 the students use with Milo presented Netgear better and who 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.140
 about 2 2 get under the water surface while it is 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.370
 also the idea of ​​user financing which has just been strengthened 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.040
 look at what went on there as a big scam and those of the toll 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.439
 pays because the whole has been set up with the clear statement it comes 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.979
 In addition to the transport investment that is one of the big problems and 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:25.049
 that's why our head is 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:25.829
 Ruckus 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.810
 not to change the distribution key 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.439
 to ensure that what is in place law is also taking place 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.499
 placed 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.479
 on what I said of a good Oskamp funding 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.459
 and we have it for the first time and apartments 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.789
 with the stimulus on top of that what we have arranged there 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.369
 for the modes of transport in question 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.899
 sustainable the us team okay i had a very important in advance 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:55.500
 political and social statement that us the rail 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.830
 Werth is that we also a bit more than our own earned 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.520
 Enter meter and that would have a maintenance and even partial 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.569
 Invest expansion 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.639
 however, for us, a very important prerequisite would be that the 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:13.249
 Transparency of the use of funds since we were not on the ships though 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:16.260
 you do not claim the points and we also see that 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.160
 the pro alone if you really the modernization backlog in the 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.230
 rail shows Dorow friends you have to do relatively well for years out there 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.909
 You can do it so that you say everything that comes out of yourself stuck in the middle 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.330
 in the street it goes to the deputies 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.489
 so changes the murder distribution so nothing 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.849
 Final question to politicians why train friends in the fall 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.010
 just choose each party I believe the social democracy 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.399
 then quite a percent claim for themselves here in the past 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.559
 Century will see you in Worms for this percent 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:55.349
 Transportation use more critical face this lawn hall 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.209
 sit six million baht but what would they give the CDU to mg mg 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:02.729
 because percent related to the 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:08.149
 were and a cdu-chancellor the prom reform decided completely new the 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:12.359
 Regionalization Photographer series has been completed that we 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.120
 finally in the area more competition get so the customer more 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.099
 Has choices and 11 gradually more and more too 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:24.550
 It will be king and because we under the cdu-chancellor with strong FDP 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.669
 Involved has succeeded 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.509
 to make a promotion of a guest and a customer 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.560
 and make sure that what a state-owned Nuno Bull is 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.240
 So far not forced to move had become better in the competition 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.960
 and also the competitors close the hole what the state monopolist 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.960
 So far maybe not wishing to exercise for us is pushing under traffic 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.499
 public task 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:50.370
 that too 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.040
 can be shaped by democratic influence so to speak of the 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.300
 Train users in Denmark 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.280
 For election, I think that's an argument to agree to per year before us 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.569
 or at least that will put our position as action 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.569
 Winfried Hermann why should the train drivers Grüningen 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.529
 because we want to do many many farmers self build form and that's why 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:14.180
 Worry without good conversation 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.649
 as z there are differences in detail 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:23.000
 but in Turkey a very relaxed atmosphere arrested the whole 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:24.089
 finally too 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:27.089
 sbm francs 

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:34.539
 Friends and railway representatives are still a bit like that today 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.129
 spurs community
