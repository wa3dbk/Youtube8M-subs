00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.870
 His eyes are shining, his heart is pounding 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:16.420
 faster very clear occasion for the 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.849
 joyful tumble with each aigner so 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.840
 smooth and pretty anti fouling 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.790
 the underwater ship that is also 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.160
 may look very different before so 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.899
 pretty much every motorboat in front of its own 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.630
 painful experience 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.940
 to find out how such an old one 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.110
 anti fouling have best removed 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.840
 we are looking for one 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.690
 made a matching test object and it 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.790
 found this stalker boot from the 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:48.160
 danish value faaborg needed below 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.170
 urgent a fresh cure as you but 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.240
 at all, find out about the old anti 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.440
 really fouling down has to be declared 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.060
 Baumeister jean-pierre matthaus ob der 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.579
 painting has to be removed at all 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.579
 we see very well in this at this 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.649
 Drucker offered that many already 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.420
 you can peel off the anti 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.880
 fouling very lightly with the spatula 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.979
 sign 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.840
 some areas a bit heavier and 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.580
 Here we can go where heavier 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.050
 handle with different methods 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.840
 this fouling this old one 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.670
 appeals to remove the three 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.220
 the most common methods are for one thing 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.170
 Scrape off with a blade very often 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.360
 used 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.850
 the abrading with one and with one 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.610
 appropriate device or the chemical 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.520
 Variant the pickling with an anti 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.549
 fouling workers all three methods 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.080
 Let's go through today 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.970
 but before it can start right 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.430
 We first glue in water pass 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.229
 carefully from here you should always 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.210
 equal to a longer piece to deal with 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.189
 who sticks only in centimeters 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.420
 most likely has one at the end 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.420
 wavy line 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.440
 a few important pointers to 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.750
 health must also be heeded 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.580
 become 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.170
 when dealing with color it is for us as 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.060
 Color manufacturers also always very important 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.190
 to indicate the health protection 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.750
 especially with solvent-containing 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.610
 products must be taken care of 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.140
 for example, the corresponding ones 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.360
 gloves to wear the appropriate 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.850
 kind and protection but also one 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.380
 goggles and a jumpsuit around the the 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.910
 eyes and in the body 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.830
 to protect paint splashes 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.480
 when working on the ground, we have to do it all 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.260
 clearly what we work for 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.510
 carry out 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.780
 We do sanding work 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.100
 we work with a particle filter 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.140
 We need a kind of protection in color 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.140
 which protects against solvent vapors 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.650
 when grinding anti from the left 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.730
 especially a good suction of the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.610
 to pay attention to machines 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.050
 through the standing in the steuber the 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.720
 really need from the surface 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.830
 they are not sucked off 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.480
 be inhaled 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.850
 when grinding itself is on it 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.780
 Pay special attention to rounding areas 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.920
 or in the area that you are careful here 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.930
 Otherwise, you get a lot 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.740
 fast through the money and through it 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.740
 immediately on the laminate 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.319
 The machine should rest flat 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.629
 even if you make good progress 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.730
 a problem when polishing polishing 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.650
 The anti-fouling soon becomes clear 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.540
 through the soft structure the only one 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.980
 few left and the resulting 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.469
 heat development , the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.120
 grinding wheel very fast to it 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:05.430
 can the material requirement of such 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.069
 Sleep quickly into immeasurable 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.730
 go up and that means it costs just 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.730
 more money 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.979
 a cheaper but also forces 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.840
 scouring method is scratching the 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.940
 bell should be as sharp as possible 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.160
 then you get depending on the texture 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.160
 the anti v.links progressed well 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.680
 when working with something called 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.240
 Goals can be the ablation of the 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.440
 old anti fouling layers very well 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.570
 control over the force 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.370
 but what you should pay particular attention 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.080
 it is not that the blade 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.740
 canted because otherwise very easy 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.460
 make money and thus go down 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.460
 up from laminate 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.230
 Another method to remove old ones 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.880
 to the stories is that 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.220
 we use our for this 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.900
 product inter stripper f before 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:17.440
 It is very important to use it 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:19.030
 Product stop well with a tassel 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.030
 and the corresponding protective clothing 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.750
 then the degradation is applied and indeed 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.750
 generously 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.060
 after the order of interstate lay 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.860
 we also add a foil to the 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.850
 surface 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.980
 So we can use the solvents 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.290
 Include this all atv 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.400
 left walking and the effect thus 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.400
 is reinforced 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.010
 After about ten minutes you can with 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.710
 a spatula test whether the wastewater 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.720
 he should have worked on none 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:19.620
 fall as long as that applied 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:21.720
 he starts to dry in our case 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.280
 can the anti fouling be done without a big one 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.140
 de-energize 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.120
 after that should abbeizen 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.590
 Underwater then once thoroughly 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.400
 with clear water and a sponge 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.110
 be washed off 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.040
 All three methods have theirs before and 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.140
 disadvantage 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.880
 depending on the texture of the tv left 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.020
 and its background should be everyone 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.480
 try it yourself 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.200
 which solution approach suits him best 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:49.050
 ahead comes another one 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.760
 Working step after we have the bulk 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.260
 of the anti fouling must have removed 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.820
 we sand the surface again 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.170
 so that the new coating too 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.260
 neatly stick to the ground 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:00.510
 we can best use one for this 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.750
 Grain between 80 and 120 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:07.340
 which is ideal for that 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.340
 is going to sneak up nicely now 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.250
 after grinding you almost have it 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.930
 managed with a suitable cleaner 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.760
 and a sponge just has to be done now 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.510
 The sanding dust is thoroughly washed off 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.820
 become 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:25.190
 loose rinse with water benefits here 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.350
 nothing but the dust then stays in the 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.990
 sit grind and later bothers the 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:34.330
 Reconstruction and how that works we show 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.330
 here at boats tv in the next episode
