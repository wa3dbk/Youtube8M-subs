 and he was allowed to correct 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.570
 Some bugs are showing here to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.579
 you 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.219
 initially when you create 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.320
 come here so you will have the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.410
 option to choose four Pokémon that is 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.120

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.670

 the commands are are you press you 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.219
 toss the pokémon tap and back again to 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.750
 You 're in case I have a Pokémon. 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.990
 I'll try to capture another to show. 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.540
 for you but you are not taxing 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.479
 Send there you move the arrows to 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.640
 low to select it, right? 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.530
 when I 'm here in the creative is now 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.330
 stay that way here is showing your 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.590
 pokémon chp your money here in case 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.150
 do not have no shout it's good it's like me 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.860
 I said a lot has been updated some 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.409
 items they could not get by 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.200
 example as stone thunder stone for 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.470
 its good role is of a nature that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.549
 if pokémon that is because monde is of 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.439
 plant foot 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.720
 now I think this here is that the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.610
 business that heals the pokémon 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.850
 I'm not sure let me see here. 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.159
 I think I did not forget the name I 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.869
 I think I do not know if I break here and it's not 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.420
 dropped probably gotta break this 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.640
 with a pick but I'll try 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.649
 face that I'll try to see the way 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.630
 no battle because it's not the same as the game 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:03.689
 Boy I threw it, that's just click. 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.810
 here and there you have changed here as well 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.539
 A fait here, I'll write it on it. 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:16.280
 wait here right? 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:20.640
 The resolution of the attack ok, let's go 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.010
 Beauty, he only gave me a few dies. 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.939
 get out of the fight because they're probably going to 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.069
 die 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:29.939
 I can not leave, beauty. I died, guys. 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.730
 calling amanda there was bankruptcy 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:35.340
 I do not know, I think this is 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.769
 getting put on the floor but ok 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.409
 I managed to run it, okay, it works. 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.480
 this way it recharges percentage and 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.450
 well, that's basically what I said 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.090
 already brought a video is brought not all and 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.310

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.950

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.299

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.310
 That to show you guys, you can 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.900
 Pick it up or not, I think it will. 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.700
 break it I'll get you I do not 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.639
 I know how she can change my game. 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.549
 mode is up to you because some 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:11.849
 dog I think it does not evolve 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.319
 she just came in because the book story of 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.609

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.169
 four serve

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.629
