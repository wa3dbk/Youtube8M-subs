difference like aw do you guys get the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.250 
difference like aw do you guys get the
idea<00:02:27.430> like<00:02:27.850> this<00:02:28.240> one<00:02:28.420> moves<00:02:28.660> all<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:28.960> like<00:02:29.140> it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
idea like this one moves all I like it

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.720 
idea like this one moves all I like it
all<00:02:29.380> kind<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.590> moves<00:02:29.770> on<00:02:29.950> its<00:02:30.010> own<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:30.610> does

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
all kind of moves on its own and it does

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.340 
all kind of moves on its own and it does
its<00:02:30.880> own<00:02:30.970> thing<00:02:31.030> starting<00:02:31.660> pieces<00:02:31.990> of<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.200> and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
its own thing starting pieces of it and

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.380 
its own thing starting pieces of it and
this<00:02:32.830> one<00:02:32.980> pretty<00:02:33.280> much<00:02:33.490> all<00:02:33.790> stays<00:02:34.180> together

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
this one pretty much all stays together

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.870 
this one pretty much all stays together
the<00:02:34.720> fibers<00:02:35.110> just<00:02:35.380> stay<00:02:35.620> together<00:02:35.800> they<00:02:36.700> don't

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
the fibers just stay together they don't

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.090 
the fibers just stay together they don't
move<00:02:37.090> as<00:02:37.300> much<00:02:37.660> as<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.170> other<00:02:38.260> one<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.680> that's

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
move as much as the other one so that's

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.490 
move as much as the other one so that's
one<00:02:39.459> way<00:02:39.490> you<00:02:39.670> can<00:02:39.910> tell<00:02:40.150> when<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:40.540> fake<00:02:41.260> hair

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
one way you can tell when it's fake hair

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.460 
one way you can tell when it's fake hair
another<00:02:42.160> way<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.790> it's<00:02:43.750> not<00:02:44.020> as<00:02:44.170> light

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
another way is that it it's not as light

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.470 
another way is that it it's not as light
as<00:02:44.650> human<00:02:45.040> hair<00:02:45.250> it's<00:02:45.490> a<00:02:45.610> little<00:02:45.880> more<00:02:46.000> heavier

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
as human hair it's a little more heavier

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.050 
as human hair it's a little more heavier
so<00:02:47.290> be<00:02:47.470> careful<00:02:47.890> with<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.010> because<00:02:48.190> even

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
so be careful with that because even

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.479 
so be careful with that because even
though<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.270> hair<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.540> really<00:02:49.690> shiny<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:51.310> is

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
though this hair is really shiny it is

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.800 
though this hair is really shiny it is
human<00:02:51.820> hair<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.120> can<00:02:52.270> just<00:02:52.480> feel<00:02:52.660> the

human hair you can just feel the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.140 
human hair you can just feel the
difference<00:02:53.140> put<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.500> up<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.620> your<00:02:53.860> hair<00:02:54.150> you
