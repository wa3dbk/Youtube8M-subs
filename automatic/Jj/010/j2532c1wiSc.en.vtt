 hello very good to all and 709 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.200
 since she was good for a long time 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:14.299
 without recording a gameplay 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.930
 I felt like it, but they are already 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.970
 I wanted to record one 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.960
 and good this is from 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.960

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.100

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.820
 hate 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.820
 down 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.809

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:53.030

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.030
 evident that a one on one in a 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.570
 wall for more 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:08.320
 one against one of 4.4 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:11.220
 5,668 against one if you want the choirs of 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.400

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.650
 second that I did 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.000
 this is good because cannons 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.299
 fire 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.299

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.190

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.190
