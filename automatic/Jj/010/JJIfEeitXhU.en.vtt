00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
alright from here do a split size or

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.410 
alright from here do a split size or
1200<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.719> capital<00:00:49.590> n<00:00:49.829> capital<00:00:49.860> B<00:00:50.550> alright

and<00:00:51.629> then<00:00:51.750> I'd<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> compression<00:00:52.559> method<00:00:53.039> as

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
and then I'd be a compression method as

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.410 
and then I'd be a compression method as
store<00:00:53.870> all<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:55.050> now<00:00:55.559> hit<00:00:55.770> OK

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.599 

so<00:01:00.420> once<00:01:00.690> that's<00:01:00.960> done<00:01:01.230> get<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.890> folder<00:01:02.309> not

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
so once that's done get this folder not

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.429 
so once that's done get this folder not
going<00:01:02.940> for<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.180> program<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.290> this

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
going for this program here on on this

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.770 
going for this program here on on this
one's<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.830> OGG<00:01:05.250> extracts<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:06.270> get<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
one's like OGG extracts we get the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.359 
one's like OGG extracts we get the
windows<00:01:07.080> binary<00:01:07.320> which<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.890> basically<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
windows binary which is basically the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.030 
windows binary which is basically the
program<00:01:08.610> alright<00:01:09.540> can't<00:01:09.869> open<00:01:09.990> width<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.799> 1

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
program alright can't open width of 1

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.429 
program alright can't open width of 1
more<00:01:11.250> naturally<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.330> I'm<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.780> select
