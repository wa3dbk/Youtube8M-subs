00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
gaining hype these adidas were crazy I

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.830 
gaining hype these adidas were crazy I
thought<00:03:26.830> these<00:03:26.920> were<00:03:27.100> samples<00:03:27.520> but<00:03:28.330> it's<00:03:28.510> kind

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
thought these were samples but it's kind

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.680 
thought these were samples but it's kind
of<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:28.990> seamless<00:03:29.380> upper<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.430> had<00:03:31.030> its<00:03:31.270> I<00:03:31.510> could

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
of a seamless upper and had its I could

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.030 
of a seamless upper and had its I could
tell<00:03:31.840> just<00:03:32.110> from<00:03:32.200> looking<00:03:32.320> at<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.710> that<00:03:32.800> it<00:03:32.830> was

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
tell just from looking at it that it was

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.740 
tell just from looking at it that it was
I<00:03:33.220> believe<00:03:33.910> this<00:03:34.180> is<00:03:34.240> the<00:03:34.420> one<00:03:34.540> that<00:03:34.630> was

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
I believe this is the one that was

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.660 
I believe this is the one that was
reflective<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:36.100> can<00:03:36.220> see<00:03:36.370> what<00:03:36.460> it<00:03:36.580> was

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
reflective so you can see what it was

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.280 
reflective so you can see what it was
called<00:03:36.880> right<00:03:37.090> there<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:37.450> there<00:03:37.540> were<00:03:37.600> thirty

called right there and there were thirty
dollars<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:38.860> not<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.070> bad<00:03:39.250> price<00:03:39.460> definitely

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
dollars so not a bad price definitely

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.490
