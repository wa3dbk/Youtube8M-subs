00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.110 
side here you can see how I do it I try
to<00:02:09.440> plat<00:02:10.440> my<00:02:11.190> hair<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> little<00:02:11.550> bit<00:02:11.880> before

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
to plat my hair a little bit before

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.090 
to plat my hair a little bit before
pulling<00:02:12.630> more<00:02:13.050> hair<00:02:13.260> from<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.560> next<00:02:13.830> section

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
pulling more hair from the next section

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.430 
pulling more hair from the next section
and<00:02:14.490> that's<00:02:14.910> how<00:02:15.210> I<00:02:15.240> get<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.570> more<00:02:15.840> defined<00:02:16.200> look

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
and that's how I get a more defined look

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.160 
and that's how I get a more defined look
but<00:02:17.280> as<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.060> see<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.360> not<00:02:18.510> very<00:02:18.810> tight

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
but as you can see it's not very tight

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.720 
but as you can see it's not very tight
it's<00:02:19.440> because<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:19.980> like<00:02:20.220> my<00:02:20.430> hair<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.700> be

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
it's because I like my hair to be

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.790 
it's because I like my hair to be
voluminous<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:21.900> also<00:02:22.110> because<00:02:22.500> my<00:02:22.620> hair

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
voluminous and it's also because my hair

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.950 
voluminous and it's also because my hair
is<00:02:22.830> not<00:02:23.070> completely<00:02:23.520> detangled<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.630> it's<00:02:24.810> not

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
is not completely detangled so it's not

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.050 
is not completely detangled so it's not
always<00:02:25.170> possible<00:02:25.560> who<00:02:26.070> this<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.460> perhaps<00:02:26.820> so

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
always possible who this is perhaps so

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.870 
always possible who this is perhaps so
close<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> scalp<00:02:28.400> another<00:02:29.400> thing<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:29.730> do

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
close to the scalp another thing I do

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.030 
close to the scalp another thing I do
when<00:02:30.360> I'm<00:02:30.480> preparing<00:02:30.690> my<00:02:31.140> hair<00:02:31.350> for<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> braid

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
when I'm preparing my hair for a braid

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.960 
when I'm preparing my hair for a braid
out<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:33.060> don't<00:02:33.840> try<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.590> separate<00:02:35.370> sections

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
out is I don't try to separate sections

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.390 
out is I don't try to separate sections
of<00:02:36.150> my<00:02:36.300> hair<00:02:36.330> into<00:02:36.900> sections<00:02:37.560> for<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.160> plat

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
of my hair into sections for the plat

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.150 
of my hair into sections for the plat
however<00:02:39.360> my<00:02:39.570> hair<00:02:39.780> wants<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.350> separate<00:02:40.740> itself

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
however my hair wants to separate itself

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.210 
however my hair wants to separate itself
is<00:02:41.430> what<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.820> use<00:02:42.120> as<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.300> general<00:02:42.750> guideline

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
is what I use as a general guideline

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.880 
is what I use as a general guideline
again<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.430> only<00:02:44.940> separate<00:02:45.420> strands<00:02:45.870> away<00:02:46.560> from

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
again I only separate strands away from

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.460 
again I only separate strands away from
each<00:02:47.100> other<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:48.090> serious<00:02:48.630> manner<00:02:48.840> when<00:02:49.260> I'm

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
each other in a serious manner when I'm

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.860 
each other in a serious manner when I'm
detangling<00:02:50.130> my<00:02:50.190> hair<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:50.700> wash<00:02:51.330> day<00:02:51.360> other

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
detangling my hair on wash day other

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.750 
detangling my hair on wash day other
