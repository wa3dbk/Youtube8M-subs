at<00:00:24.119> first<00:00:24.170> because<00:00:25.170> neither<00:00:25.910> me<00:00:26.910> or<00:00:26.939> him<00:00:27.480> have

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
at first because neither me or him have

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.359

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
this so I didn't really have anyone to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.930 
this so I didn't really have anyone to
ask<00:00:31.890> if<00:00:32.160> he<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.340> alive<00:00:32.520> or<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:33.530> so<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.820> bit<00:00:35.820> the
