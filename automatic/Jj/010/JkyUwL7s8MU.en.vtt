00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.839
 hi water welcome to new mac 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.750
 of the week today I take you 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.220
 behind the scenes the hopes he's 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.840
 wake up 5 am I tell you 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.840
 this spades eyes so follow me 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.470
 so this thing 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.020
 good go rent explain us a little 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.809
 what is the purpose of this training the 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.520
 morning at 6 o'clock the goal is its 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.540
 dunes to add a workout because 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.430
 that today we realize that 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.660
 for these players there and the chance to 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.190
 pass well phu who do not care anymore 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.830
 than the others, ie since the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.809
 pros so this year we added some 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.160
 trainings at 6am so they have 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.199
 place once every fortnight 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.699
 so it's not specifically rugby 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.970
 we will try to grace the room 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.500
 fight 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.300
 we try to work everything that is 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.129
 attitudes to touch a little bit more 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.269
 all we do not have much time to 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.269
 to do during the week 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.939
 here 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.590
 in fact it happened to us but did that 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.299
 besides base where we want 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.979
 it's the language contests and you make 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.409
 seeming to scratch and you with the 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.509
 pressure ok we imagine that a boat for 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.520
 I do not care max hockey 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.750
 slightly raise the head to see what 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.149
 which happens do I have to know the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.420
 challenge knees like that I am 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.420
 not efficient 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.630
 it's important it's not a sentence 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.500
 is that the list is distant 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.240
 quickly 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.940
 with the benhellal chord trap 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.890
 more is no more covering the recoil 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.890
 Bt11 not it significant expenditure 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.200
 cold objective so move forward 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.420
 players on particular areas and 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.760
 the second goal is also as 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.310
 to work the minds state because at 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.230
 6am is not easy and it is not 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.430
 so that's when you could see there 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.340
 puts a lot of enthusiasm on a lot of 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.230
 motivation and that's very much the vote 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.400
 present-day 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.690
 what is it needed then what it 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.150
 must know well so it concerns the 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.500
 category u 22 from 6 to 2.6 at this 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.460
 drive at this time they have the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.310
 possibility of making a small 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.840
 lunch at the gauthière and after for 80 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.030
 90% of them return 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.860
 course from 8h to 12h 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.910
 after generally they ate the 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.100
 gauthière he goes back to class 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.430
 the afternoon at 4 o'clock they have 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.110
 the front weights from 5 to 6 for 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.590
 refer peas three quarters of 6 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.270
 to 7 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.800
 bodybuilding it makes people good 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.420
 apply way eg deals 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.630
 mixed today that makes them both 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.150
 three four sessions all the courses so 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.920
 it's a lot of work 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.210
 quite important wap after that is the goal 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.530
 of the game it's really as you say then 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.540
 it is that they are more preoccupied than 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.040
 the remarks just reminded here we go 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.420
 try to advance that player 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.610
 that's it we do not bump especially on 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.140
 the team on the content on the on the 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.750
 many game philosophy that 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.650
 technically on the player and after on 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.420
 muscle development 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.210
 so we the goal is that at the end 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.950
 one year two years or three years 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.090
 gets them to their best 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.060
 level individually 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.980
 that's from there if we get to 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.150
 do that while these big ones 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.470
 anxieties and rough diamonds he 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.270
 need to tweak what exactly 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.270
