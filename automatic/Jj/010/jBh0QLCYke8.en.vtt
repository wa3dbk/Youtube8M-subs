00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.569
 after we have you so many pretty shelves 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.980
 we have just come 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.620
 time to the forbidden techniques 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.450
 to let in the nasty things the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.639
 actually not so gladly seen 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.630
 and you have to be right as a fighter 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.520
 deftly proceed that the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.800
 Referee maybe random 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.630
 is just in the other corner or 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.670
 you just do not make it so clear 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.160
 that you pulled so hard there or 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.890
 be pressed 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.109
 short of a technology that means it starts 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.899
 im infight one is close together and 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.540
 how can you get out of it and what? 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.239
 Can you take advantage of it? 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.260
 in the case someone means the animals themselves 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:47.010
 Together here would be in the cover with 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.850
 the advantage to catch one can 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.300
 it will follow 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.649
 i know christian based turn out 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.899
 from his situation 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.449
 that means I act only my calling 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.640
 and march backward think so 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.250
 a little break with that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.010
 balance out here and pull 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.710
 broken down therefrom TIH rum 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.280
 i tore it right in rome one 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.920
 paper the punks and from each and what 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.560
 is not available 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.530
 So if you see that and practice 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.360
 but mostly always that time 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.630
 push push but that works 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.850
 Not 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.680
 they stand up for you the fighters one falls 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.170
 she just has to take with her 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.210
 they want to admit aggressive and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.900
 firm forward are on the other hand pressure to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.979
 armed in front 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.659
 that's why it's better to be dragged along 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.560
 anyway forward I can give them 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.689
 wants to push 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.649
 back pressure is the celebrated but give 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.610
 Do not take ten with you 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.329
 and goes again from the perspective 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.970
 again slowly 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.200
 The animals then have to be kept 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.970
 just hurry up fast 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.520
 I'm already saying you're almost done 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.430
 at the same time away with that looks like 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.390
 if she had held on 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.719
 slowly I'm almost here 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.329
 move away to me and turn myself 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.179
 one-shot moving is not like that 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.110
 Strong really feel for more 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.650
 come yourself 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:21.590
 does somebody always get that from me? 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.590
 whole story turn 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.450
 because you have just the right moment 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.130
 wait for 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.500
 that works wonderfully it comes 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.150
 unexpected because they are completely different 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.850
 flow then pulls the dishes 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.069
 just follow it again at night 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.410
 to live alone at the lookout 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.410
 Maybe the club is okay with that
