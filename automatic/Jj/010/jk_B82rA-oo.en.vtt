00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:16.669
 hello and this video review i attend miracle 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:20.630
 marker and jack which is worth a thousand 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:22.519
 rubles and let you draw tracks 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.510
 Yes, and printed circuit boards 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:30.460
 namely, let's say get a piece of paper 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:36.559
 draw tracks on it solder the scheme 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:38.839
 all do not poison the board do not need anything like that 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.049
 let 's see what he is 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.049
 presents 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.629
 to the connection marker just to normal 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.920
 bag 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.920
 So let's proceed to the review 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:07.310
 so here he is a marker 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:12.110
 The kit also has a special 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.830
 paper on which to draw tracks in 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.830
 quantity 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:31.280
 5 pieces about 10 by 15 here it is 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.770
 the marker itself is nothing special and 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.840
 noteworthy plain black white 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.340
 building 2 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.200
 let's try to draw myself 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.200
 track and test it 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:10.500
 here it is our path 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:15.450
 i glitters and shimmers the color of metal and 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.450
 now also on it represents 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.230
 turn on the device is given on dialing 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.090
 check and drill he told us that well and 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:39.970
 chain 3 ohm wire resistance 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:43.540
 spectrum im on track 55 msk pitami is 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.650
 very much by only 10 centimeters 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:52.650
 50 com now try to dry the track 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.650
 hair dryer and see what happens 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.360
 re-check the track and in 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:19.890
 As a result, we have 40 he doesn't care for 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.430
 any scheme is very big 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:27.599
 Savanna size resistance 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:33.019
 it just doesn't work on such tracks 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.019
 will or will work very badly and 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.489
 last test 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:45.200
 namely try to solder first 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:49.879
 got wire on this track 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.879
 let's see how I do it 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:30.440
 I want to end with cd se 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.500
 tracks drawn with this marker 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.340
 have a very large resistance it 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:41.720
 very bad this is firstly second to me 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.210
 never managed to solder the wire 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.000
 train your track she's just 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:52.670
 win disappears all that appears 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.270
 but nothing like the fact that 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:01.190
 declares the manufacturer in other words 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:05.290
 he is not worth the money from he 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:08.540
 generally not worth buying 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.330
 Thank you all for your attention, we put a finger 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.600
 top subscribe to the channel to new 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.600
 meeting
