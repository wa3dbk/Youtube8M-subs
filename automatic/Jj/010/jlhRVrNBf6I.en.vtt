00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
not worry about the bike stalling so he

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.990

I<00:02:35.690> guess<00:02:36.690> he<00:02:36.870> wrote<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.260> o.9<00:02:38.540> 450<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.570> bet<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
I guess he wrote the o.9 450 of bet and

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.410 
I guess he wrote the o.9 450 of bet and
he<00:02:40.050> said<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.500> was<00:02:40.790> was<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.820> big<00:02:42.060> difference

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
he said this was was a big difference

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.180 
he said this was was a big difference
the<00:02:44.140> fact<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.560> put<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.710> little<00:02:44.890> different

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
the fact it put a little different

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.280 
the fact it put a little different
program<00:02:45.550> in<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.760> computer<00:02:46.240> so<00:02:46.920> their<00:02:47.920> their

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
program in the computer so their their

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.590 
program in the computer so their their
injector<00:02:50.290> system<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.580> mapping<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.480> the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
injector system and the mapping of the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.840 
injector system and the mapping of the
field<00:02:52.840> it's<00:02:53.380> it's<00:02:53.980> right<00:02:54.160> on<00:02:54.340> now<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.670> works

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850

just you probably would eat it they've
also<00:03:21.670> made<00:03:21.910> some<00:03:22.090> changes<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.600> frame<00:03:22.959> they

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
also made some changes to the frame they

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.720 
also made some changes to the frame they
have<00:03:23.320> what<00:03:23.440> they<00:03:23.560> call<00:03:23.709> microfusion<00:03:24.340> frame

now<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.840> frame<00:03:26.080> is<00:03:26.290> stronger<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.430> frame<00:03:27.670> fits

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
now the frame is stronger the frame fits

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.260 
now the frame is stronger the frame fits
together<00:03:28.150> better<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:30.340> when<00:03:30.550> they<00:03:30.640> join<00:03:31.030> those

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
pipe gives the engine a bit better

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.590 
pipe gives the engine a bit better
performance<00:05:37.800> you<00:05:38.160> can<00:05:38.310> notice<00:05:38.820> that<00:05:38.940> when<00:05:39.510> you

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
performance you can notice that when you

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.210 
performance you can notice that when you
ride<00:05:39.780> it<00:05:39.930> just<00:05:39.960> a<00:05:40.170> little<00:05:40.290> bit<00:05:40.410> mellower<00:05:41.100> sound

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
ride it just a little bit mellower sound

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.190 
ride it just a little bit mellower sound
also<00:05:42.560> the<00:05:43.560> trials<00:05:43.890> bikes<00:05:44.720> just<00:05:45.720> what<00:05:45.870> I<00:05:45.900> expect

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
also the trials bikes just what I expect

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.840 
also the trials bikes just what I expect
from<00:05:46.230> gas<00:05:46.470> gas<00:05:46.680> they're<00:05:46.890> always<00:05:47.010> the<00:05:47.190> best<00:05:47.220> and

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
from gas gas they're always the best and

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:48.770 
from gas gas they're always the best and
always<00:05:47.970> will<00:05:48.210> be

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
always will be

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.630 
always will be
so<00:05:49.680> we<00:05:50.100> hope<00:05:50.630> we<00:05:51.630> willing<00:05:51.960> improve<00:05:52.640> ourselves

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
so we hope we willing improve ourselves

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.810 
so we hope we willing improve ourselves
in<00:05:53.960> in<00:05:54.960> the<00:05:55.110> States<00:05:55.410> but<00:05:56.070> it<00:05:56.190> just<00:05:56.400> depends<00:05:56.700> on

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
in in the States but it just depends on

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.820 
in in the States but it just depends on
our<00:05:56.970> bikes<00:05:57.270> and<00:05:57.630> I<00:05:57.750> think<00:05:57.990> that<00:05:58.140> we<00:05:58.560> have<00:05:58.710> the

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
our bikes and I think that we have the

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:15.250 
our bikes and I think that we have the
weapons<00:05:59.190> to<00:05:59.310> do<00:05:59.430> it

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.320
