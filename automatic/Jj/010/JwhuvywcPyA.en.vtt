cut-and-dry<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> little<00:02:38.520> different

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
cut-and-dry this is a little different

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.380 
cut-and-dry this is a little different
than<00:02:38.940> your<00:02:39.090> standard<00:02:39.120> Honda<00:02:39.840> engine<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.560> that

than your standard Honda engine in that

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.730 
than your standard Honda engine in that
you<00:02:42.390> first<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.900> have<00:02:42.990> your<00:02:43.020> on/off<00:02:43.260> switch

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
you first you have your on/off switch

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.320 
you first you have your on/off switch
that's<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.190> easiest<00:02:44.400> thing<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.670> forget

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
that's the easiest thing to forget

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.180 
that's the easiest thing to forget
and<00:02:46.430> then<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.610> have<00:02:47.880> your<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:49.290> classic<00:02:49.830> choke

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
and then you have your the classic choke

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.340 
and then you have your the classic choke

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
towards the slanted line so that means

choke is at the top and unchoke tis at
the<00:02:58.230> bottom<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:58.800> start<00:02:59.250> these<00:02:59.370> elections

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970

there<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> primer<00:03:02.070> bulb<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.760> like<00:03:02.940> on<00:03:03.090> a

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
there is a primer bulb just like on a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.760 
there is a primer bulb just like on a
chainsaw<00:03:03.450> or<00:03:03.720> anything<00:03:04.020> else<00:03:04.320> but<00:03:04.590> it's<00:03:04.680> a

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
chainsaw or anything else but it's a

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
little hidden right down under here so

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.560 
little hidden right down under here so
you<00:03:07.350> depress<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.740> five<00:03:08.220> times<00:03:08.520> just<00:03:09.450> like

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
you depress that five times just like

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.210 
you depress that five times just like
any<00:03:09.900> other<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.200> don't<00:03:10.350> have<00:03:10.440> any<00:03:10.590> gas<00:03:10.800> in<00:03:11.100> this

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
any other I don't have any gas in this

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.100 
any other I don't have any gas in this
right<00:03:11.459> now<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.540> would<00:03:12.690> be<00:03:12.780> depressed

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
right now but that would be depressed

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.480 
right now but that would be depressed
five<00:03:13.410> times<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:14.060> then<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.510> set<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.490> about

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
five times and then you set this about

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.449 
five times and then you set this about
here<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:18.540> about<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.720> quarter<00:03:19.110> inch<00:03:19.140> in<00:03:19.620> you

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
here so about a quarter inch in you

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.360 
here so about a quarter inch in you
start<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.209> engine<00:03:21.630> with<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.440> primed<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:23.100> that

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
start the engine with it primed and that

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.900 
start the engine with it primed and that
would<00:03:23.610> be<00:03:23.820> now<00:03:24.150> go<00:03:24.690> ahead<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:24.930> pull<00:03:25.760> kick<00:03:26.760> it

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
would be now go ahead and pull kick it

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.949 
would be now go ahead and pull kick it
off<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.680> butter<00:03:28.680> down<00:03:28.980> on<00:03:29.250> my<00:03:29.400> choke<00:03:29.670> and

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
off and butter down on my choke and

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.000 
off and butter down on my choke and
butter<00:03:30.959> up<00:03:31.260> on<00:03:31.970> your<00:03:32.970> on<00:03:33.209> your<00:03:33.830> throttle<00:03:34.830> and

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
butter up on your on your throttle and

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.250 
butter up on your on your throttle and
the<00:03:35.250> Honda<00:03:36.180> still<00:03:36.450> does<00:03:36.660> The<00:03:36.810> Tortoise<00:03:37.080> and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
the Honda still does The Tortoise and

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.930 
the Honda still does The Tortoise and
the<00:03:37.350> hare<00:03:37.410> just<00:03:37.800> like<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.130> childhood<00:03:38.580> story

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
the hare just like the childhood story

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.540 
the hare just like the childhood story
and<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.870> that's<00:03:40.050> still<00:03:40.350> around<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:41.310> it's<00:03:41.459> a

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
and so that's still around so it's a

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.790 
and so that's still around so it's a
great<00:03:41.760> little<00:03:42.000> machine<00:03:42.380> surprising<00:03:43.380> how<00:03:43.560> much

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
great little machine surprising how much

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.160 
great little machine surprising how much
torque<00:03:44.310> this<00:03:44.519> thing<00:03:44.790> has<00:03:45.030> for<00:03:45.480> its<00:03:45.600> size<00:03:45.840> and

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
torque this thing has for its size and

torque this thing has for its size and
weight<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:47.459> can<00:03:47.610> get<00:03:47.730> fancier<00:03:48.330> you<00:03:48.600> can<00:03:48.720> get

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
weight you can get fancier you can get

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.380 
weight you can get fancier you can get
bigger<00:03:49.110> but<00:03:49.590> at<00:03:49.920> 37<00:03:50.519> gallons<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.940> minute<00:03:51.090> for
