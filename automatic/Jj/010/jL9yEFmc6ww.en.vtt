00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
wanted exactly and I didn't even know

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.110 
wanted exactly and I didn't even know
what<00:03:41.680> did<00:03:41.829> it<00:03:43.920> looks<00:03:44.920> like<00:03:45.069> you<00:03:45.220> have<00:03:45.400> blue

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
what did it looks like you have blue

they<00:03:53.680> did<00:03:53.859> that<00:03:54.099> I<00:03:54.250> think<00:03:54.370> when<00:03:54.609> they<00:03:54.670> take<00:03:54.849> all

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
they did that I think when they take all

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.300 
they did that I think when they take all
the<00:03:55.209> colors<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.690> make<00:03:55.780> black<00:03:56.079> it<00:03:56.859> just<00:03:57.069> looks

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
the colors and make black it just looks

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.030

like grey anyway just remove some of the

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:16.550 
like grey anyway just remove some of the
safety<00:04:03.280> tape<00:04:08.459> like<00:04:09.459> I'm<00:04:09.639> missing<00:04:10.030> something
