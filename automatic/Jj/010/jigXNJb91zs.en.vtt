00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.890
 Hi, I'm Borja Mateos from the hunting team 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.830
 from iberia television and we are here 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.130
 to present you the new model rx the 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.140
 ix de merkel at this time we want you 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.610
 present the advantages that this 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.220
 rifle with respect to the other rifles 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.760
 of the market we will teach aspects of 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:38.050
 security is an intuitive rifle easy to 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.660
 handle very portable and very dynamic to 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.760
 start we will teach you the facility 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.320
 at the time of disassembling the rifle not a 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.989
 of the main advantages that it presents 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.449
 the new rx model of the ix is its easy 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.760
 disassembly as you see is very easy 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.580
 disassemble in a few seconds this 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.680
 facilitates transportation and also to the 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.530
 time to change the caliber of 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.530
 cannon to do it quickly 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.930
 as we have seen in just three steps 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.540
 we are able to assemble and disassemble this 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.030
 merkel rifle without any kind of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.700
 tools when using this 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.610
 this system for the hunter is 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.259
 fundamental to be sure of good 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.170
 rifle and easy operation 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.420
 management is a very intuitive system and in 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.150
 which we highlight therefore its security and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.030
 your facility 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.500
 It is important to emphasize also within 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.660
 all this security system the head 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.580
 rotating merkel which is a system 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.440
 that has 6 lugs on the head of the 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.440
 rifle 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.660
 as we can see in the easy disassembly 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.860
 we see the head of the six tutors who 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.470
 is one of the security systems 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.090
 innovators of the rifle that merkel the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.929
 ics 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.880
 easy handling when riding and 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.570
 disassemble the rifle as we said 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.890
 previously 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.590
 and well they have tried this system 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.890
 up to eight thousand bars of pressure what 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.869
 What is it 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.970
 an oversize to what was 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.880
 used this type of rifles which 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.030
 gives us an infinite security an aspect 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.850
 fundamental of the helix is ​​the system of 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.180
 rectilinear bolt as we will see an easy 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.470
 handling and agility is super intuitive 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.900
 as you will see with a small movement 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.870
 we are able to upload and download the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.209
 two bullets caps one of the 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.430
 important issues is that when it comes to 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.560
 t face the rifle do not have to have 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.380
 fear of approaching the bolt in the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.190
 eye as you will see stays at a distance 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.140
 super secure loading thus unloaded the 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.770
 casings without ever being 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.760
 brings you closer to the eye 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:55.150
 Another feature of this rifle is the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.860
 removable charger merkel de helix gives you 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.160
 the possibility of having chargers 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.590
 three bullets plus one in the bedroom 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.140
 or five bullets and one in the chamber what 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.120
 which makes this rifle very versatile 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.560
 for the type of fighter you want 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.050
 to practice 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.319
 a fundamental aspect that they told me 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.810
 when talking to me this rifle is that it is 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.450
 a rifle that people consider it what 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.150
 can consider as the first last and 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.709
 only rifle that means this because 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.630
 that serves you so much to go 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:30.459
 montería as go of stalking and as icaza 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.989
 in 28 around the world 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.760
 the ease in changing 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.160
 caliber as we have seen before with the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.870
 breakdown system makes it possible for the 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.300
 to be able to use the same rifle with 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.420
 any caliber besides the rifle has 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.860
 a picatinny lane which serves to 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.380
 any type of frame depending 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.980
 of the type of viewer that we want to put 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.770
 presents a straight stock with cheek piece 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.930
 and also has a rubber nock that 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.180
 completely deadens the shots that 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.040
 We want to hit this when it comes to hunting 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.469
 It is very comfortable for the hunter 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.400
 we see that it also brings the 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:08.560
 carrier ring that provides belts 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.500
 and as we had previously said the 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.780
 removable charger 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.670
 finally talk about the closed system 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.400
 with manual brother that is so fashionable 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.859
 lately as we see is a system the 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.400
 which gives an infinite security at the time 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.180
 of the handling of these rifles 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.190
 well as we have seen the summary is that 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.460
 this rifle can be a rifle 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.580
 versatile for any type of hunting 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.820
 have been very interested in the 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.130
 security issue in which it is a 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.100
 intuitive rifle in which is a rifle 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:48.030
 easily transportable easy handling 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.389
 assembly and disassembly and the advantage of 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.630
 changing caliber is a wonder what 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:58.380
 what we are going to do now is to test in a 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.360
 target to 100 meters the concentration of 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.539
 the shots that we're going to hit and so 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.949
 You also see a little the fast loading and 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.949
 discharge that these rifles have 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.090
 well now let's move on to try the 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.230
 rifle see the concentrations of the 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.550
 shots at a distance of 120 meters to 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.490
 that you also see the ease of loading 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.760
 what have we going to do three shots 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.300
 very consecutive and see what 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.300
 groupings we get 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.340
 ah 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:38.969
 to 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.509
 and 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.509
 to 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.550
 well let's see how they have been 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.470
 groupings of the shots of the 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.080
 witnesses that we have given before going to 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.970
 see them I want to comment we have them here 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.460
 to show you another rifle finished in 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:03.470
 wood is a rifle that has a weight of 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.910
 about 29 kilograms very light in this 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.820
 rifle we also wanted to show you 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.320
 another look liu for a look a 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.900
 little more of montería for more shots 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.840
 short and fastest is a one and a half 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.910
 six for 42 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.070
 one of the characteristic practices 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.710
 fundamentals of these of these rifles 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.389
 is that they have the edges of the lenses 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.790
 darkened to avoid reflections 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:27.280
 with which prevents that at the time that is 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.639
 centering the shot at some fixed point you 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.900
 come some reflection we will not see how 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.220
 They have been three shots sections 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.220
 stuck 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.550
 and see how he has given those 125 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.550
 meters 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.350
 just as I said 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.180
 previously, here we see that the 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:52.570
 three shots are concentrated in some 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:56.380
 23 centimeters than with a viewer of 39 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:58.930
 by 50 to 125 meters giving it 5 increases 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.030
 It is a wonder not only 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.990
 commented that the rifle has hit very 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:07.380
 little latazo very comfortable very intuitive and 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:10.990
 a very good experience there is no need 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:13.420
 highlight the viewer which I have 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:16.750
 mounted on this rifle which is the leopold 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:19.530
 as I said before 39 by 50 with 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.730
 very bright reticle has many 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:25.390
 luminosity even a day like today 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:28.000
 quite cloudy it looks perfectly very 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:30.640
 recommended for rainy days and 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.060
 all kinds of weather also resistant to 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.449
 Water 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.330
 and good 

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:38.259
 a very satisfying experience 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.020
 I recommend to the spectators of iberia 

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:42.849
 of television that they may be able to 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.680
 be interested in a rifle very 

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:47.379
 very comfortable polyvalent very practical and 

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.819
 as I said before it 's like a single rifle 

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:53.650
 with different types of cannon and with 

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:56.379
 Attachable to any viewer and type of 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.669
 the one that they use and try 

00:07:56.379 --> 00:08:00.550
 this rifle because the truth is that it is 

00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:03.180
 wonderful and we have had very good 

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.180
 experiences with him
