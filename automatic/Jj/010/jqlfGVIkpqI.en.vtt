00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hi everyone guys in this video 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.830
 we'll talk about some of the news 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.360
 introduced in version 1.4 point 7 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.269
 from the server of rossino che buffon 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.519
 in particular we will talk about mobs as 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.430
 zombie zombie big man and skeletons like 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.199
 you can see these mobies now 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.050
 will be able to wear of 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.420
 use weapons and armor they find 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.880
 on the ground and then they can 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.730
 find them on the ground once they die then 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.320
 as you can see this movie has 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.160
 now the nature of diamond has been collected 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.380
 found on the ground and just found 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.110
 these two objects he wore then 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.250
 don't be surprised to find mobs with 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.079
 nature winch or tools in hand 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.660
 another peculiarity is that they are the same 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.449
 mobs will be able to cross the portals of the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.840
 never therefore both aggressive and non-aggressive mobs 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.770
 aggressive you see the paws less pil is 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.620
 passed through the portal like 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.799
 some of you will know 2 mobs introduced 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.420
 in photo 4.7 are the bats at 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.689
 witches for joy like radio tracks 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.369
 are not harmless because the mob 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.930
 they attack are basically passive 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.869
 and are mainly found in 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.960
 caves fail to recognize the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.270
 danger approaching there was love and of 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.210
 day they are always perched 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.280
 in the caverns to the ceiling could 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.979
 look like mobs but annoying 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.689
 rather than flutter to issue 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.729
 Frequent sounds will not be much 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.490
 annoyance for the player another mob 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.430
 this time aggressive introduced in the 1 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.829
 point 4.7 and the witch 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.369
 as you can see the witches can 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.159
 attack the players here and launch some 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.140
 potions that can be poison of 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.860
 weakness of slowness and damage 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.180
 instantaneous they are very strong new ones in 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.650
 how their life regenerates 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.780
 automatically 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.310
 they can also drink healing potions 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.440
 of fire resistance in the moment in 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.640
 whose attacks there were killings 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.150
 instead they rarely even succeed in 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.569
 find these portions of care and 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.459
 support 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:24.819
 when they are killed as you can see 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:29.860
 when the black witch is tagged a 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.700
 move your nose but another way that 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.709
 will be introduced in this new one 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.810
 version is the best skeleton key 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.019
 withers that age can be 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.239
 only rediscovered of the never is yes 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.220
 time they will get stuck in the bones of the 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.989
 coal or the weaver skeleton 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.660
 staller that would be their head that 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.090
 it will be useful then to summon a very boss 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.690
 powerful of this new version that is 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.690
 my boss 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.100
 here he is of the boss and I remind you that on 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.770
 until he remembers the leader will be 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.540
 only to be found in the leather in the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.340
 land 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.830
 this is because as you can see between 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.990
 a little with her when she attacks 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.220
 it destroys everything that surrounds it 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.350
 so we did it short for 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.350
 protect cities 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.990
 another characteristic of the village of 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.000
 this new version is that if attacked 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:33.420
 from a zombie they can become gods 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 zombie village and we could but it comes 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.370
 also the opposite effect that is to do them 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.040
 return to the village leaving them with 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.060
 of pools of weakness and pendulums 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.950
 with a golden apple with a little right button 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:53.270
 time you will see that our zombie 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.270
 villager I will return to a simple village 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.890
 it's all for today I give you an appointment 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.780
 next video on 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.780
 server and ours but close with hello
