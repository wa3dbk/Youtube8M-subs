00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
opportunity to let boarded orthopedic

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.719 
opportunity to let boarded orthopedic
surgeon<00:01:14.870> like<00:01:15.020> dr.<00:01:15.080> McCarthy<00:01:15.979> perform<00:01:16.550> that

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
surgeon like dr. McCarthy perform that

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.220 
surgeon like dr. McCarthy perform that
procedure<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:17.930> do<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.050> much<00:01:18.260> better<00:01:18.290> job

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.230 

the<00:01:24.230> reindeer<00:01:25.100> has<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.370> dislocated<00:01:26.030> kneecap

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
the reindeer has a dislocated kneecap

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.900 
the reindeer has a dislocated kneecap
and<00:01:26.800> this<00:01:27.800> is<00:01:28.010> something<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:28.490> actually<00:01:28.610> we

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
and this is something that actually we

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.330 
and this is something that actually we
see<00:01:29.180> fairly<00:01:29.660> frequently<00:01:30.110> in<00:01:30.320> small<00:01:30.920> animals

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
see fairly frequently in small animals

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.830 
see fairly frequently in small animals
so<00:01:31.550> they're<00:01:31.760> gonna<00:01:31.850> have<00:01:31.940> us<00:01:32.390> do<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:32.720> I'm<00:01:32.810> a

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
so they're gonna have us do it I'm a

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.750 
so they're gonna have us do it I'm a
small<00:01:33.050> animal<00:01:33.410> hospital<00:01:34.220> instead<00:01:34.430> of<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.580> large

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
small animal hospital instead of a large

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.200 
small animal hospital instead of a large
animal<00:01:35.090> surgeons<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.350> basically<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.430> kneecap

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
animal surgeons so basically the kneecap

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.590 
animal surgeons so basically the kneecap
is<00:01:38.750> attached<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:40.160> know<00:01:40.190> to<00:01:40.490> there<00:01:40.670> your<00:01:40.940> your

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
is attached you know to there your your

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.930 
is attached you know to there your your
knee<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.110> quadriceps<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.070> kneecap<00:01:43.640> to

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
knee to the quadriceps to the kneecap to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.880 
knee to the quadriceps to the kneecap to
the<00:01:44.090> top<00:01:44.570> of<00:01:44.690> your<00:01:44.810> tibia<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.260> so<00:01:45.440> we're

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
the top of your tibia and so we're

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.050 
the top of your tibia and so we're
actually<00:01:45.980> going<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.250> take<00:01:46.400> the<00:01:46.520> attachment<00:01:47.030> of

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
actually going to take the attachment of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.760 
actually going to take the attachment of
the<00:01:47.150> kneecap<00:01:47.480> which<00:01:47.750> is<00:01:47.900> too<00:01:48.080> far<00:01:48.350> towards<00:01:48.560> the

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
the kneecap which is too far towards the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.480 
the kneecap which is too far towards the
outside<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.790> move<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.540> Center<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.680> by<00:01:52.190> making

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
outside and move it Center and by making

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.040 
outside and move it Center and by making
a<00:01:52.550> fracture<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.150> then<00:01:53.480> we're<00:01:53.630> gonna<00:01:53.720> fix<00:01:53.930> the

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
a fracture and then we're gonna fix the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.740 
a fracture and then we're gonna fix the
fracture<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.530> place<00:01:54.710> of<00:01:54.830> screws<00:01:55.090> but<00:01:56.090> she

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
fracture of the place of screws but she

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.610 
fracture of the place of screws but she
is<00:01:56.990> very<00:01:57.170> large<00:01:57.620> than<00:01:58.040> 250<00:01:58.610> 160<00:01:59.270> pounds<00:01:59.690> and<00:01:59.960> so

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
is very large than 250 160 pounds and so

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.590 
is very large than 250 160 pounds and so
when<00:02:00.830> they<00:02:00.980> flex<00:02:01.310> their<00:02:01.430> knee<00:02:01.730> they're<00:02:02.450> gonna

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
when they flex their knee they're gonna

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.120 
when they flex their knee they're gonna
pull<00:02:02.840> against<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.230> fracture<00:02:03.650> that<00:02:03.770> we<00:02:03.920> made

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
pull against the fracture that we made

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.610 
pull against the fracture that we made
with<00:02:04.340> incredible<00:02:04.910> force<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.510> so<00:02:06.290> what<00:02:06.470> we're

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
with incredible force and so what we're

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.450 
with incredible force and so what we're
going<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:06.770> do<00:02:06.920> is<00:02:07.070> you're<00:02:07.160> going<00:02:07.190> to<00:02:07.310> use<00:02:07.430> a

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
going to do is you're going to use a

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.180 
going to do is you're going to use a
placing<00:02:07.820> screws<00:02:08.410> not<00:02:09.410> only<00:02:09.679> Clayton<00:02:09.950> schools

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
placing screws not only Clayton schools

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.710 
placing screws not only Clayton schools
but<00:02:10.399> there's<00:02:10.550> special<00:02:10.880> types<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.360> plate<00:02:11.570> and

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
but there's special types of plate and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.660 
but there's special types of plate and
screws<00:02:12.020> that<00:02:12.500> we<00:02:12.650> have<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.040> we'd<00:02:13.160> use<00:02:13.190> here

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
screws that we have that we'd use here

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.460 
screws that we have that we'd use here
and<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.660> is<00:02:14.750> just<00:02:14.900> not<00:02:15.110> going<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.380> be

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
and so that is just not going to be

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.130 
and so that is just not going to be
accessible<00:02:16.240> pretty<00:02:17.240> much<00:02:17.480> in<00:02:17.690> other<00:02:17.840> places

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
accessible pretty much in other places

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.830 
accessible pretty much in other places
so<00:02:18.530> that's<00:02:18.710> it
