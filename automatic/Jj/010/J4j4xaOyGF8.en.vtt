00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.359
 nescafé dolce gusto melody automatic 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.649
 the name is a bit awkward after all 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.019
 everything else about this capsule 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.849
 Coffee maker is simply the newest 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.320
 version of this made by Krups 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.000
 I have a portion of stuff 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.920
 tested extensively and I can now 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.290
 say I really like it 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.730
 sure the striking design is 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.160
 matter of taste but pronounced 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.780
 practically the water tank can be here 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.580
 namely, especially easy to lose weight 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.830
 instead, you can do the water though 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.780
 also refill during the tank then 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.520
 connected to the machine remains the 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.070
 lid of the water tank is in fact only 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.450
 Loosely at first it irritated me 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.670
 but it makes sense because it is for the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.680
 user is easiest with the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.300
 1.3 liter tank, I come through the well 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.920
 day once a day fresh water 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.870
 to introduce is completely sufficient 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.000
 with the best of the nescafé dolce gusto 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.130
 Men's automatic is the holders 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.989
 which you can insert the capsules you can 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.150
 Just bring them out to you 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.020
 then he put in a capsule and 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.370
 push her back in 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.230
 the bracket and the lever to 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.520
 make pronounce both pronounced 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.950
 solid impression 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.390
 before he starts the test process 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.159
 up here in the rat the amount of water 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.960
 it is hardly faster and easier 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.220
 for special request quantity you have to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.840
 so not only a certain value 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.000
 program but you can 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.570
 each time spontaneously, simply new 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.760
 decide 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.590
 the nescafé dolce gusto men the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.900
 automatic is one of the fastest 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.100
 helping ska-p machines go fast 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.750
 not only at the actual 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.520
 preparation but already in the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.680
 warm-up phase after switching on 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.700
 The coffee machine is after a short time 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.040
 operational 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.510
 depending on the size of its cup or 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.060
 Becher chose the distance to 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.320
 coffee spout the storage area can 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.930
 you on three different positions 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.119
 stuck that works uncomplicated acts 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.200
 but a bit shaky as well I ask 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.030
 me how unbreakable the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.320
 plug is that could the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.979
 manufacturer for the future yet 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.080
 improve 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.689
 apart from that, the nescafé dolce 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.119
 Gusto melody automatic wherever there is 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.890
 it depends on how well it is processed and how it works 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.390
 the coffee tastes good it tastes good to me 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.700
 at least for most of them 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.100
 meanwhile 32 different drinks 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.630
 varieties the nescafé dolce gusto men 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.299
 The automatic can not only 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.119
 different kinds of coffee from espresso 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.470
 cappuccino latte macchiato café olé bis 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.920
 are of course to black coffee 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.990
 prepare 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.280
 cacau drinks cold coffee the latte 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.620
 and ice t dominates the machine 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.540
 also to prepare cold drinks 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.030
 Can he use the second start 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.680
 Button with the blue symbol for some 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.080
 drinks in the german bus system 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.330
 you need two capsules for one of them 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.550
 the milk at the system german short 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.440
 For milk powder comes to use hardly 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.270
 to believe in the taste of the 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.940
 German bus capsules are always in 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.860
 packs of 16 pieces is sold for 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.840
 one drink milk needed needed for 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.450
 a drink so two capsules then 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.319
 does not give a pack of 16 but only 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.569
 eight portions 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.280
 who has some experience of inflation 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.660
 coffee makers may know that 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.720
 problem with taking out of 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.769
 used capsule from the machine or 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.569
 you spend a little time already 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.489
 the fingers but not so with this 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.140
 device after the preparation of the 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.850
 hot drink she pulls the capsule 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.530
 bracket out and tilt the used one 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.810
 capsule simply in the included 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.370
 of course he could be the same 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.230
 Dispose of the supplied 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.090
 containers had to drain 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.160
 that makes sense because it stays right 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.140
 a lot of liquid in the capsules back 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.239
 your fingers come in the operation of the 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.890
 café german gusto men automatic 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.390
 also not with hot steam or 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.940
 hot capsule in touch 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.440
 I wonder why that's helping ska 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.299
 like machines not yet more general 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.350
 standard is there can be some manufacturers 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.019
 learn something else 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.820
 he wanted to know more some photos now 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.680
 and a detailed review 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.230
 This coffee maker is on her 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.019
 a block café navigator de short 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.359
 conclusion the nescafé dolce gusto melody 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.040
 automatic has indeed in complicated 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.730
 names but otherwise they like me 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.560
 really good 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.560
 my expectations, it has surpassed
