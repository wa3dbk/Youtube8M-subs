more<00:01:03.600> quality<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:05.010> more<00:01:05.369> money<00:01:05.489> obviously

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.340 
of really rubbery and super soft and
super<00:01:50.220> robbery<00:01:50.790> which<00:01:51.540> means<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.930> really

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
super robbery which means it really

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.819 
super robbery which means it really
isn't<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.009> slip<00:01:53.360> however<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.829> also

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
isn't going to slip however that also

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.200 
isn't going to slip however that also
means<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.070> personally<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.670> find<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.090> it's

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
means that personally I find that it's

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.109 
means that personally I find that it's
not<00:01:57.450> going<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.350> ideal<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.860> none<00:01:59.460> water<00:01:59.759> use

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
not going to be ideal for none water use

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.300 
not going to be ideal for none water use
because<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.899> find<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:01.950> doesn't<00:02:02.219> feel

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
because I find that it just doesn't feel

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.310 
because I find that it just doesn't feel
as<00:02:02.490> nice<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.969> skin<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.689> was<00:02:03.840> you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
as nice on the skin like if I was you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.399 
as nice on the skin like if I was you
know<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.680> water<00:02:05.990> swimming<00:02:06.990> pool<00:02:07.200> or<00:02:07.290> something

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
know in water swimming pool or something

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.800 
know in water swimming pool or something
this<00:02:08.009> would<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:08.190> fine<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:08.729> if<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.450> was<00:02:09.539> being

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
this would be fine but if it was being

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.350 
this would be fine but if it was being
used<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.379> dry<00:02:10.819> just<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.060> know<00:02:12.090> just

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
used on the dry just you know just

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.410 
used on the dry just you know just
carrying<00:02:12.660> my<00:02:12.750> GoPro<00:02:13.080> around

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
carrying my GoPro around

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.180 
carrying my GoPro around
then<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.050> neoprene<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.680> think<00:02:14.890> would<00:02:14.980> feel

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
then this neoprene I think would feel

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.920 
then this neoprene I think would feel
nicer<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:15.880> unfortunately<00:02:16.120> they<00:02:16.450> haven't<00:02:16.480> made

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
nicer so unfortunately they haven't made

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.809 
nicer so unfortunately they haven't made
it<00:02:16.990> as<00:02:17.590> far<00:02:17.680> as<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.950> know<00:02:18.010> these<00:02:18.580> aren't

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
it as far as I know these aren't

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.790 
it as far as I know these aren't
removable<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.930> it's<00:02:20.319> not<00:02:20.440> going<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.650> be<00:02:20.709> very

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
removable so it's not going to be very

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.190 
removable so it's not going to be very
easy<00:02:21.099> to<00:02:21.430> switch<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.180> around<00:02:22.239> so<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.020> you

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
easy to switch this around so that you

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.059 
easy to switch this around so that you
can<00:02:23.440> use<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:24.550> side<00:02:25.319> for<00:02:26.319> your<00:02:26.440> hand<00:02:26.770> just

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
can use this side for your hand just

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.370 
can use this side for your hand just
because<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.640> feel<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.540> there's<00:02:28.720> grippy<00:02:29.110> stuff

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
because I feel that there's grippy stuff

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.570 
because I feel that there's grippy stuff
might<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.770> know<00:02:29.860> just<00:02:30.010> feels<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.310> little<00:02:30.430> bit

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
might you know just feels a little bit

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.280 
might you know just feels a little bit
weird<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:31.390> might<00:02:31.569> just<00:02:31.660> be<00:02:31.840> because<00:02:31.959> I<00:02:32.110> have

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
weird it might just be because I have

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.410 
weird it might just be because I have
some<00:02:32.470> hair<00:02:32.709> on<00:02:32.860> my<00:02:33.400> arm<00:02:33.580> but<00:02:33.819> it<00:02:34.180> just<00:02:34.270> feels

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
some hair on my arm but it just feels

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.250 
some hair on my arm but it just feels
slightly<00:02:34.780> weird<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.470> use<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.830> like<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:37.260> but

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
slightly weird to use it like this but

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.140 
slightly weird to use it like this but
no<00:02:38.410> not<00:02:38.950> really<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.130> big<00:02:39.280> complaint<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.000> guess

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
no not really a big complaint I guess

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.059 
no not really a big complaint I guess
just<00:02:40.330> feels<00:02:40.690> weird<00:02:40.810> for<00:02:41.080> me<00:02:41.170> but<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.830> is<00:02:41.860> really

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
just feels weird for me but it is really

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.009 
just feels weird for me but it is really
nice<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.280> soft<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.790> made<00:02:43.390> from<00:02:43.630> really<00:02:43.870> nice

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
nice and soft and made from really nice

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.380 
nice and soft and made from really nice
feeling<00:02:44.290> materials<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.130> then<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:45.940> have<00:02:46.090> this

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
feeling materials and then you have this

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.900 
feeling materials and then you have this
strap<00:02:47.050> here<00:02:47.739> which<00:02:47.950> then<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.430> know<00:02:48.519> you<00:02:48.610> use

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
strap here which then you know you use

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.039 
strap here which then you know you use
this<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.690> close<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.560> up<00:02:50.650> like<00:02:51.549> so<00:02:51.870> now<00:02:52.870> here's

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
this to close it up like so now here's

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.780 
this to close it up like so now here's
the<00:02:53.230> weird<00:02:53.350> thing<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.830> find<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.549> this<00:02:54.640> is

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
the weird thing I find that this is

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.400 
the weird thing I find that this is
actually<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.269> bit<00:02:55.450> too<00:02:55.690> small<00:02:55.900> I'm<00:02:56.260> not<00:02:56.350> sure

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
actually a bit too small I'm not sure

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.920 
actually a bit too small I'm not sure
exactly<00:02:56.830> how<00:02:56.950> its<00:02:57.430> intended<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.970> be<00:02:58.060> used<00:02:58.090> but

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
exactly how its intended to be used but

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.920 
exactly how its intended to be used but
I<00:02:59.170> don't<00:02:59.350> have<00:02:59.560> really<00:03:00.040> big<00:03:00.549> wrists<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.690> just

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
I don't have really big wrists I just

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.759 
I don't have really big wrists I just
sort<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.260> have<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.830> normal<00:03:03.580> hand<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:05.500> find

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
sort of have a normal hand and I find

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.720 
sort of have a normal hand and I find
this<00:03:06.030> quite<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.450> mean<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:07.959> does<00:03:08.080> fit<00:03:08.440> as<00:03:08.739> you<00:03:09.580> can

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
this quite I mean it does fit as you can

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.699 
this quite I mean it does fit as you can
see<00:03:09.910> it's<00:03:10.150> really<00:03:10.510> gripping<00:03:10.900> onto<00:03:11.140> my<00:03:11.290> hand<00:03:11.440> I

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
see it's really gripping onto my hand I

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.039 
see it's really gripping onto my hand I
have<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.519> sort<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.760> walk<00:03:13.209> it<00:03:13.420> along<00:03:13.690> my<00:03:13.840> hand

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
have to sort of walk it along my hand

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.289 
have to sort of walk it along my hand
rather<00:03:14.500> than<00:03:14.680> slide<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.280> along<00:03:15.370> because<00:03:16.150> it's

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
rather than slide it along because it's

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.860 
rather than slide it along because it's
really<00:03:16.480> grippy<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:18.180> basically<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.540> close

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
really grippy and basically you close

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.690 
really grippy and basically you close
this<00:03:20.140> up<00:03:20.320> like<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.250> it's<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.489> little<00:03:21.609> bit

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
this up like so it's a little bit

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.420 
this up like so it's a little bit
awkward<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:22.239> close<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:22.989> up<00:03:23.079> but<00:03:23.440> not

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
awkward to close it up but not

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.289 
awkward to close it up but not
impossible<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:26.760> close<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.940> up<00:03:28.060> like<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.950> and

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
impossible so close it up like that and

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.620 
impossible so close it up like that and
so<00:03:31.299> it's<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.790> doesn't<00:03:34.120> really<00:03:34.180> go<00:03:34.390> all<00:03:34.510> the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
so it's this doesn't really go all the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.319 
so it's this doesn't really go all the
way<00:03:34.660> around<00:03:35.220> if<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.340> had<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:36.640> sideways<00:03:37.120> like

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
way around if you had it sideways like

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.530 
way around if you had it sideways like
that<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:37.900> then<00:03:38.200> closed<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:39.609> sort<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.359> goes

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
that and then closed it it sort of goes

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.960 
that and then closed it it sort of goes
all<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.780> way<00:03:40.930> around<00:03:41.019> but<00:03:41.440> still<00:03:41.820> not<00:03:42.820> exactly

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
all the way around but still not exactly

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.750 
all the way around but still not exactly
and<00:03:43.510> so<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:44.140> personally<00:03:45.010> would<00:03:45.130> have<00:03:45.220> liked<00:03:45.459> to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
and so I personally would have liked to

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.090 
and so I personally would have liked to
see<00:03:45.970> this<00:03:46.150> longer<00:03:46.690> so<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:47.380> it<00:03:47.590> could<00:03:47.739> go<00:03:47.859> all

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
see this longer so that it could go all

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.130 
see this longer so that it could go all
the<00:03:48.250> way<00:03:48.280> around<00:03:48.370> your<00:03:48.760> hand<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.150> so<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.840> soft

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
the way around your hand and so the soft

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.420 
the way around your hand and so the soft
bit<00:03:50.380> can<00:03:50.650> really<00:03:50.980> go<00:03:51.130> all<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.310> way<00:03:51.340> around

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
bit can really go all the way around

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.699 
bit can really go all the way around
because<00:03:51.910> here<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.299> can<00:03:52.480> sort<00:03:52.690> of<00:03:52.810> yeah<00:03:53.650> you

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
because here you can sort of yeah you

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.470 
because here you can sort of yeah you
don't<00:03:54.190> have<00:03:54.280> anything<00:03:54.459> soft<00:03:54.880> on<00:03:55.120> this<00:03:55.269> here

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
don't have anything soft on this here

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.569 
don't have anything soft on this here
not<00:03:56.019> really<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.319> big<00:03:56.440> problem<00:03:56.920> not<00:03:57.310> something

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
not really a big problem not something

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.640 
not really a big problem not something
that<00:03:57.700> really<00:03:57.819> bothers<00:03:57.910> me<00:03:58.180> but<00:03:58.660> just<00:03:59.140> would

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
that really bothers me but just would

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.750 
that really bothers me but just would
have<00:03:59.709> been<00:03:59.769> nice<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.040> see<00:04:00.310> this<00:04:00.459> go<00:04:00.579> all<00:04:00.700> the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
have been nice to see this go all the

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.849 
have been nice to see this go all the
way<00:04:00.819> around<00:04:00.880> and<00:04:01.440> possibly<00:04:02.440> go<00:04:02.620> all<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.829> way

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
way around and possibly go all the way

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.729 
way around and possibly go all the way
around<00:04:02.920> and<00:04:03.370> then<00:04:03.459> clip<00:04:03.880> in<00:04:04.090> place<00:04:04.329> here<00:04:04.930> and

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
around and then clip in place here and

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.920 
around and then clip in place here and
then<00:04:06.130> if<00:04:06.489> it<00:04:06.790> was<00:04:06.910> longer<00:04:07.120> enough<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.810> go<00:04:07.900> all

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
then if it was longer enough to go all

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.870 
then if it was longer enough to go all
the<00:04:08.019> way<00:04:08.049> around<00:04:08.170> this<00:04:09.010> could<00:04:09.340> have<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.489> double

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
the way around this could have a double

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.940 
the way around this could have a double
use<00:04:10.120> as<00:04:10.299> a<00:04:10.720> sort<00:04:10.989> of<00:04:11.019> neck<00:04:11.350> strap<00:04:11.709> or<00:04:11.920> a

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
use as a sort of neck strap or a

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.699 
use as a sort of neck strap or a
shoulder<00:04:12.190> strap<00:04:12.579> whereas<00:04:13.299> right<00:04:13.480> now<00:04:13.720> it

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
shoulder strap whereas right now it

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.319 
shoulder strap whereas right now it
doesn't<00:04:14.769> really<00:04:15.220> have<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.459> but<00:04:15.730> hopefully<00:04:16.180> i

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
doesn't really have that but hopefully i

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.000 
doesn't really have that but hopefully i
will<00:04:16.780> send<00:04:17.049> this<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.320> gary's<00:04:17.650> i'll<00:04:17.799> sell<00:04:17.950> this

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
will send this to gary's i'll sell this

will send this to gary's i'll sell this
video<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.340> gary's<00:04:18.579> and<00:04:18.700> hopefully<00:04:19.049> maybe<00:04:20.049> this

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
video to gary's and hopefully maybe this

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.930 
video to gary's and hopefully maybe this
tip<00:04:20.530> will<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:21.400> know<00:04:21.519> maybe<00:04:21.700> they'll<00:04:21.849> make

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
tip will you know maybe they'll make

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.589 
tip will you know maybe they'll make
something<00:04:22.419> like<00:04:22.510> that<00:04:22.710> so<00:04:24.060> basically<00:04:25.060> i<00:04:25.150> think

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
something like that so basically i think

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:26.430 
something like that so basically i think
this<00:04:25.870> is

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
this is

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.270 
this is
is<00:04:26.530> really<00:04:27.070> nicely<00:04:27.280> made<00:04:27.460> product<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:29.280> it's

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
is really nicely made product and it's

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.260 
is really nicely made product and it's
you<00:04:30.610> know<00:04:30.640> it<00:04:30.760> has<00:04:30.910> all<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.090> few<00:04:31.360> quirks<00:04:31.720> this

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
you know it has all a few quirks this

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.570 
you know it has all a few quirks this
little<00:04:34.270> piece<00:04:34.540> can<00:04:34.840> unclip<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:35.830> then<00:04:36.340> you

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
little piece can unclip and then you

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.890 
little piece can unclip and then you
would<00:04:36.930> connect<00:04:37.930> that<00:04:38.230> to<00:04:38.440> whatever<00:04:38.830> your

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
would connect that to whatever your

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.020 
would connect that to whatever your
whatever<00:04:40.900> place<00:04:41.110> your<00:04:41.290> camera<00:04:41.650> has<00:04:42.030> for

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
whatever place your camera has for

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.110 
whatever place your camera has for
connection<00:04:43.990> so<00:04:44.580> something<00:04:45.580> like<00:04:45.610> that<00:04:45.940> for

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
connection so something like that for

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.840 
connection so something like that for
example<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:47.040> then<00:04:48.040> you<00:04:48.130> can<00:04:48.250> easily<00:04:48.370> unclip

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
example and then you can easily unclip

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.820 
example and then you can easily unclip
it<00:04:48.940> from<00:04:49.180> there<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.510> this<00:04:50.200> seems<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.710> be<00:04:50.740> a

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
it from there and this seems to be a

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.110 
it from there and this seems to be a
pretty<00:04:51.010> nice<00:04:51.280> strong<00:04:51.790> connection<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:53.070> then

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
pretty nice strong connection and then

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.280 
pretty nice strong connection and then
another<00:04:55.120> thing<00:04:55.480> that<00:04:55.660> I<00:04:55.690> actually<00:04:55.900> thought

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
another thing that I actually thought

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.810 
another thing that I actually thought
this<00:04:56.650> could<00:04:56.890> be<00:04:57.040> useful<00:04:57.220> for<00:04:57.430> and

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
this could be useful for and

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.150 
this could be useful for and
unfortunately<00:04:58.690> may<00:04:58.960> require<00:04:59.500> you<00:04:59.980> know<00:05:00.070> if

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
unfortunately may require you know if

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.820 
unfortunately may require you know if
you<00:05:00.280> bought<00:05:00.520> this<00:05:00.730> for<00:05:01.570> that<00:05:01.780> purpose<00:05:02.200> it

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
you bought this for that purpose it

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.060 
you bought this for that purpose it
would<00:05:03.250> require<00:05:03.700> some<00:05:04.540> some<00:05:05.290> modifications<00:05:05.950> to

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
would require some some modifications to

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.330 
would require some some modifications to
this<00:05:06.190> but<00:05:07.030> I<00:05:07.330> think<00:05:07.510> this<00:05:08.230> could<00:05:08.560> be<00:05:08.800> really

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
this but I think this could be really

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.380 
this but I think this could be really
nice<00:05:09.700> as<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.630> DSLR<00:05:11.440> hand<00:05:12.430> strap<00:05:12.820> so<00:05:13.090> Gary's

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
nice as a DSLR hand strap so Gary's

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.910 
nice as a DSLR hand strap so Gary's
actually<00:05:13.660> do<00:05:13.900> hand<00:05:14.140> straps<00:05:14.440> I've<00:05:14.620> reviewed

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
actually do hand straps I've reviewed

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.980 
actually do hand straps I've reviewed
one<00:05:15.130> before<00:05:15.520> and<00:05:15.670> I<00:05:16.030> personally<00:05:16.450> really<00:05:16.750> love

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
one before and I personally really love

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.870 
one before and I personally really love
hand<00:05:17.230> straps<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:17.680> basically<00:05:18.310> your<00:05:18.490> camera

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
hand straps and basically your camera

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.790 
hand straps and basically your camera
goes<00:05:19.030> there<00:05:19.330> and<00:05:19.540> then<00:05:19.990> this<00:05:20.170> connects<00:05:20.560> to<00:05:20.710> the

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
goes there and then this connects to the

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.080 
goes there and then this connects to the
bottom<00:05:21.040> of<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.160> camera<00:05:21.310> and<00:05:21.460> this<00:05:21.760> connects

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
bottom of the camera and this connects

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.090 
bottom of the camera and this connects
to<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.300> top<00:05:22.450> of<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.630> camera<00:05:22.810> and<00:05:23.170> you<00:05:23.920> have

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
to the top of the camera and you have

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.230 
to the top of the camera and you have
this<00:05:24.370> thing<00:05:24.670> that<00:05:25.150> allows<00:05:25.690> you<00:05:26.140> to<00:05:27.090> sort<00:05:28.090> of

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
this thing that allows you to sort of

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.930 
this thing that allows you to sort of
you<00:05:28.570> know<00:05:29.100> gives<00:05:30.100> you<00:05:30.220> a<00:05:30.250> really<00:05:30.550> really<00:05:30.760> nice

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940
