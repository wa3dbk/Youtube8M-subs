00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:20.609

 we a top screwdriver the biggest 4 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.580
 and unscrew the screw which the display 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.960
 holds in position so the screw rotates 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.279
 long until it cracks very easily 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.539
 then we take a flat 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.189
 Tool and try the display 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.780

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.969
 flex cables are connected to it 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.590
