00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.410
 Super bowl at the first time not yet 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.109

 also not better I wanted to everyone 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.490
 Many people wonder 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.750
 here are his favorite roles are the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.399
 pages or is it the title defender 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.309

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.399
 say who's the nose in front of me, I mean 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.410
 without what you say now we are the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.510
 defender defender you have to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.530
 the first the championship the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.960
 Remove from so I will have to say 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.129
 they are at the front 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.510
 the meaning of footballs in 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.879
 germany we notice that at 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.530
 sat 1 with the going up the quotas 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.180
 maybe you know ours 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.739
 spectators once explain Germany is 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.390
 football country usually a fortiori 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.190
 since the world champion have become what 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.949
 it means for a football player 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.359
 how to get the thing in here in super 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.719
 what does that mean in the bowl? 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.810
 United States 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.950
 yes of course I mean the olymp 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.540
 all our sports travel 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.010
 kids playing football dream of it 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 and so we of course then also, of course, 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.100
 started later than most but 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.009
 yes of course to create a dreamless 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.659
 and as a German post, doing little rather 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.860
 as a professional athlete of course meant 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.509
 about the biggest thing you can achieve in 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.150
 his career is why he is 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.920
 of course, you get that big too 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.140
 in some way with that in 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.700
 germany yes such a kind of small 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.900
 football fever has broken out or 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.189
 that goes completely past you or 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.409
 war that through the family 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.189
 yes transported my family my 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.320
 father now also in the week before 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.380
 But the media interest is natural 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.970
 here in the hustle and bustle here and all 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.140
 yes i think so the interest I 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.390
 hope that of course, keep it up 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.770
 stays and hopefully with young 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.939
 Players start over with us 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.829
 few years even more German players 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.270
 you have actually got in touch with us 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.100
 has to lead one another yes 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.439
 unfortunately not played against you in the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.450
 championship game markus kuhn first 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.130
 German with a touchdown mad thing 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.530
 you have contact with each other during 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.800
 There is no time for the season 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.210
 just talked a few times 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.760
 Of course summer was the same 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.920
 gone as I endure in the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.120
 to establish league and so on and 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.350
 then after testifying he still has me 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.680
 Wish good luck here with the super 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.050
 bowl and great guy and I have 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.710
 wish each other a little bit 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.450
 Landmanns look a little bit like that 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.220
 that you are successful too 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.900
 you belong here to the boys the tom brady 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.400
 time to give him the ass 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.260
 keep clear in German said so 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.430
 There are many who wanted to be in 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
 germany does not yet play this role 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.400
 not really understand it is one 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.400
 important in the open line 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.520
 how would that be? 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.960
 players themselves own 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.970
 Responsibility we say took place in vienna 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.480
 allegedly was not significantly jean 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.210
 make etc 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.100
 and as we said we are trying to time 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.010
 can go throwing the ball from the 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.610
 laufspiel a bit of profit to 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.140
 can run the path and if possible 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.880
 one has space of eleven years 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.810
 not even then will his job 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.980
 probably nothing with the game 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.550
 at home we all see each other 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.230
 pretty much the same 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.910
 How is your relationship there? 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.050
 personal relationship with the star 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.780
 quarterback tom brady 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.000
 as said one is in the locker room one 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.470
 place for ten hours a day and stays there 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.400
 it does not matter and yes friends are all 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.190
 Colleagues but also as friends because you 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.390
 But every day so far seen and 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.550
 the mood in the team is half past four 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.140
 also build the idea the boys in parts 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.270
 That's why it's a good team 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.220
 while werner will be with us on sunday 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.020
 Being an expert in the studio means just 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.780
 to give something on the way 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.440
 yes, I wish you luck and yes that 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.440
 what to do
