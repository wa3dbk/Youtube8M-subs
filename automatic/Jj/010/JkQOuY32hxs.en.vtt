 with her 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.010

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.630
 that it could work 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.910
 It was at the moment that I saw that everyone 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.130
 is wearing sweaters so we 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.800

 I 'm far beyond my own 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.730
 and gives it still more the goal of it 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.010
 it does not look like the paint is in and the paint is very 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.760
 well done and then I liked it 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.440
 I bought 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.620
 I find this work very interesting. 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.180
 craft because it is still very 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.320

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:50.340
 A future knows why I have it in my 

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:53.039

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.800
 money so I see it as a 

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:00.960
 beginning of a future 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.129
