00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
hi here we are again with Sam's fitness

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.129 
hi here we are again with Sam's fitness
and<00:00:09.280> what<00:00:10.280> I'd<00:00:10.370> like<00:00:10.490> to<00:00:10.580> do<00:00:10.760> is<00:00:11.139> demonstrate

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
and what I'd like to do is demonstrate

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.600 
and what I'd like to do is demonstrate
extended<00:00:12.980> sets<00:00:13.250> on<00:00:14.230> the<00:00:15.230> Multi<00:00:15.949> multi<00:00:16.430> system

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
extended sets on the Multi multi system

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.060 
extended sets on the Multi multi system
this<00:00:17.090> also<00:00:17.330> can<00:00:17.630> be<00:00:17.750> done<00:00:17.900> on<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:18.230> leverage

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
this also can be done on the leverage

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.430 
this also can be done on the leverage
system<00:00:19.699> as<00:00:19.820> well<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:20.390> again<00:00:20.930> like<00:00:21.230> I<00:00:21.320> said

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:21.440 
system as well and again like I said

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.250 
system as well and again like I said
extended<00:00:21.920> sets<00:00:22.160> allow<00:00:23.000> you<00:00:23.060> to<00:00:23.450> keep<00:00:24.140> the

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
extended sets allow you to keep the

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.260 
extended sets allow you to keep the
muscle<00:00:24.530> under<00:00:24.740> tension<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.280> to<00:00:26.270> get<00:00:28.060> say<00:00:29.060> more

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
muscle under tension and to get say more

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.990 
muscle under tension and to get say more
bang<00:00:29.450> for<00:00:29.480> your<00:00:29.750> buck<00:00:29.900> okay<00:00:30.410> now<00:00:31.340> with<00:00:31.910> this

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
bang for your buck okay now with this

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.610 
bang for your buck okay now with this
particular<00:00:32.300> version<00:00:32.719> of<00:00:32.930> extended<00:00:33.379> sets

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
particular version of extended sets

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.770 
particular version of extended sets
again<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.670> idea<00:00:34.910> of<00:00:35.030> center<00:00:35.329> centers<00:00:35.629> you're

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
again the idea of center centers you're

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.970 
again the idea of center centers you're
still<00:00:35.960> doing<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.260> same<00:00:36.440> movement<00:00:36.680> it's<00:00:36.890> not

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
still doing the same movement it's not

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.180 
still doing the same movement it's not
like<00:00:37.130> a<00:00:37.220> superset<00:00:37.730> where<00:00:38.270> you<00:00:38.390> do<00:00:38.600> like<00:00:39.190> bench

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
like a superset where you do like bench

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.940 
like a superset where you do like bench
press<00:00:40.550> followed<00:00:40.940> by<00:00:41.260> dumbbell<00:00:42.260> flyes<00:00:42.530> that's

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
press followed by dumbbell flyes that's

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.920 
press followed by dumbbell flyes that's
a<00:00:43.070> super<00:00:43.399> set<00:00:43.579> because<00:00:43.940> they're<00:00:44.450> two<00:00:44.630> chest

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
a super set because they're two chest

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.350 
a super set because they're two chest
exercises<00:00:45.410> yes<00:00:45.890> but<00:00:46.670> they're<00:00:47.000> two<00:00:47.180> different

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
exercises yes but they're two different

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.940 
exercises yes but they're two different
movements<00:00:47.840> one's<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:48.290> pressing<00:00:48.649> movement

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
movements one's a pressing movement

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.120 
movements one's a pressing movement
one's<00:00:49.250> an<00:00:49.370> isolation<00:00:49.970> movement<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:51.739> only<00:00:51.980> one

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
one's an isolation movement the only one

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.830 
one's an isolation movement the only one
the<00:00:52.190> extended<00:00:52.610> sets<00:00:52.850> is<00:00:53.059> that<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.660> movement

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
the extended sets is that the movement

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.860 
the extended sets is that the movement
must<00:00:54.230> remain<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.710> same<00:00:55.450> so<00:00:56.450> if<00:00:56.719> you're

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
must remain the same so if you're

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.360 
must remain the same so if you're
pressing<00:00:57.110> it<00:00:57.350> must<00:00:57.559> still<00:00:57.800> be<00:00:57.829> a<00:00:57.980> pressing

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
pressing it must still be a pressing

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.220 
pressing it must still be a pressing
movement<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:58.880> just<00:00:58.910> change<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.630> angle<00:01:00.050> of<00:01:00.110> it

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
movement you just change the angle of it

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.650 
movement you just change the angle of it
a<00:01:00.290> little<00:01:00.500> bit<00:01:00.680> slightly<00:01:00.980> okay<00:01:01.579> and<00:01:02.480> what<00:01:02.600> I'm

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
a little bit slightly okay and what I'm

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.539 
a little bit slightly okay and what I'm
going<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.809> demonstrate<00:01:02.980> on<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.100> model<00:01:04.280> system

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
going to demonstrate on the model system

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.490 
going to demonstrate on the model system
is<00:01:04.640> how<00:01:04.759> to<00:01:04.820> do<00:01:04.969> that<00:01:05.089> for<00:01:05.239> chest<00:01:05.509> now<00:01:06.439> the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
is how to do that for chest now the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.590 
is how to do that for chest now the
reason<00:01:06.799> I<00:01:06.829> like<00:01:07.009> the<00:01:07.310> this<00:01:07.700> extended<00:01:08.210> set<00:01:08.450> the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
reason I like the this extended set the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.090 
reason I like the this extended set the
way<00:01:08.719> I'm<00:01:08.780> going<00:01:08.929> to<00:01:09.020> show<00:01:09.170> you<00:01:09.229> how<00:01:09.439> I<00:01:09.469> do<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:09.799> is

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
way I'm going to show you how I do it is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.449 
way I'm going to show you how I do it is
because<00:01:10.909> with<00:01:11.179> this<00:01:11.299> extended<00:01:11.840> set<00:01:12.049> a<00:01:12.950> lot<00:01:13.369> of

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
able to squeeze the inner PEC so this

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.899 
able to squeeze the inner PEC so this
form<00:01:29.749> of<00:01:29.869> extended<00:01:30.289> set<00:01:30.529> will<00:01:31.459> be<00:01:31.609> able<00:01:31.729> to<00:01:31.819> hit

form of extended set will be able to hit

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.919 
form of extended set will be able to hit
the<00:01:32.029> inner<00:01:32.179> pecs<00:01:32.389> without<00:01:32.719> doing<00:01:32.990> flyers<00:01:33.229> okay

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.910 
the inner pecs without doing flyers okay
so<00:01:35.929> we're<00:01:36.200> going<00:01:36.289> to<00:01:36.380> demonstrate<00:01:36.529> it<00:01:38.920> the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
so we're going to demonstrate it the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.039 
so we're going to demonstrate it the
idea<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:42.130> you<00:01:43.130> just<00:01:43.189> start<00:01:43.399> a<00:01:43.609> food<00:01:43.759> yet<00:01:44.049> your

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
idea is you just start a food yet your

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.469 
idea is you just start a food yet your
normal<00:01:45.409> bench<00:01:45.590> okay

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
normal bench okay

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.569 
normal bench okay
now<00:01:47.749> again<00:01:48.020> when<00:01:48.169> I<00:01:48.229> do<00:01:48.289> extended<00:01:48.829> sets<00:01:49.099> I<00:01:49.310> like

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
now again when I do extended sets I like

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.909 
now again when I do extended sets I like
to<00:01:49.759> sort<00:01:49.969> of<00:01:50.029> make<00:01:50.359> the<00:01:50.539> first<00:01:50.840> part<00:01:51.679> of<00:01:51.829> the

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:51.919 
to sort of make the first part of the

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:54.489 
to sort of make the first part of the
exercise<00:01:52.599> continuous<00:01:53.599> tension<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.200> I<00:01:54.319> keep

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:54.499 
exercise continuous tension and I keep

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:56.469 
exercise continuous tension and I keep
it<00:01:54.619> up<00:01:54.709> to<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:54.889> bit<00:01:55.009> higher<00:01:55.189> maybe<00:01:55.429> 12<00:01:55.849> to<00:01:55.969> 15

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
it up to the bit higher maybe 12 to 15

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.349 
it up to the bit higher maybe 12 to 15
and<00:01:57.099> I'll<00:01:58.099> just<00:01:58.340> do<00:01:58.459> a<00:01:58.490> continuous<00:01:58.849> tension

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
and I'll just do a continuous tension

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:00.309 
and I'll just do a continuous tension
okay

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
okay

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.929 
okay
and<00:02:00.889> so<00:02:00.979> I'm<00:02:01.069> keeping<00:02:01.279> the<00:02:01.489> tension<00:02:01.849> on<00:02:01.909> the

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
and so I'm keeping the tension on the

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.989 
and so I'm keeping the tension on the
muscle<00:02:01.999> so<00:02:02.270> I'm<00:02:02.329> not<00:02:02.450> mocking<00:02:02.719> right<00:02:03.079> here<00:02:03.319> I

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:03.999 
muscle so I'm not mocking right here I

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.940 
muscle so I'm not mocking right here I
just<00:02:04.999> came<00:02:05.359> in<00:02:05.419> that<00:02:05.569> 3/4<00:02:06.139> movement<00:02:06.499> keeping

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
just came in that 3/4 movement keeping

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.660 
just came in that 3/4 movement keeping
the<00:02:07.039> tension<00:02:07.520> on<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:08.780> muscle<00:02:09.459> then<00:02:10.459> when<00:02:10.550> I've

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
the tension on the muscle then when I've

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.070 
the tension on the muscle then when I've
done<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:10.849> for<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.599> 10<00:02:11.959> 12<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:12.860> 15<00:02:13.190> reps<00:02:13.570> did<00:02:14.570> I

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
done that for the 10 12 to 15 reps did I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.060 
done that for the 10 12 to 15 reps did I
put<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.680> grip<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:17.010> closer<00:02:17.960> shove<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:19.080> up<00:02:19.170> okay

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
put the grip in closer shove it up okay

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.490 
put the grip in closer shove it up okay
when<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.490> put<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.940> close<00:02:21.180> now<00:02:21.870> when<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.110> go<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.320> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
when I put in close now when I go to the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.930 
when I put in close now when I go to the
second<00:02:22.800> part<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.160> movement<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.520> extended

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
second part of the movement of extended

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.350 
second part of the movement of extended
sets<00:02:24.180> I'll<00:02:24.960> do<00:02:28.250> okay<00:02:29.250> then<00:02:29.520> now<00:02:29.700> we're<00:02:30.240> going

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
sets I'll do okay then now we're going

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.820 
sets I'll do okay then now we're going
to<00:02:30.420> go<00:02:30.570> into<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.760> into<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.590> closer<00:02:34.590> circle

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
to go into the into the closer circle

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.470 
to go into the into the closer circle
panel<00:02:35.100> now<00:02:35.220> now<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.640> idea<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.030> when<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.360> do

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
panel now now the idea is when I do

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.990 
panel now now the idea is when I do
extended<00:02:37.020> sex<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.160> second<00:02:38.550> car

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
extended sex is on the second car

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.180 
extended sex is on the second car
I<00:02:39.030> drop<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.720> reps<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.170> maybe<00:02:40.320> five<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:40.950> ten

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
I drop the reps to maybe five to ten

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.110 
I drop the reps to maybe five to ten
because<00:02:41.400> you're<00:02:41.550> not<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.880> have<00:02:41.970> much

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
because you're not going to have much

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.660 
because you're not going to have much
left<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.510> tank<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:42.990> then<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.950> increase

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
left in the tank and then to increase

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.070 
left in the tank and then to increase
the<00:02:44.850> intensity<00:02:45.120> because<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.690> won't<00:02:45.870> going<00:02:45.990> to

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
the intensity because I won't going to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.450 
the intensity because I won't going to
do<00:02:46.200> these<00:02:46.320> in<00:02:46.380> continuous<00:02:47.010> tension<00:02:47.190> because

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
do these in continuous tension because

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.010 
do these in continuous tension because
like<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.610> said<00:02:47.790> I'm<00:02:47.940> starting<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.390> eat<00:02:48.570> favorite

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
like I said I'm starting to eat favorite

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.870 
like I said I'm starting to eat favorite
so<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:49.620> more<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.070> conventional<00:02:50.430> style

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
so that I do more in conventional style

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.650 
so that I do more in conventional style
another<00:02:51.240> five<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.720> ten<00:02:51.870> reps<00:02:52.140> coming<00:02:52.890> down<00:02:53.100> and

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
another five to ten reps coming down and

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.020 
another five to ten reps coming down and
then<00:02:54.660> squeeze<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.980> then<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.130> come<00:02:56.310> down<00:02:56.340> and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
then squeeze and then you come down and

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.880 
then squeeze and then you come down and
then<00:02:57.440> squeeze<00:02:58.640> we're<00:02:59.640> down<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:01.410> it's<00:03:01.590> squeaks

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
then squeeze we're down and it's squeaks

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.950 
then squeeze we're down and it's squeaks
the<00:03:02.100> idea<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.610> appeared<00:03:02.910> like<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.120> said<00:03:03.390> is<00:03:03.780> to

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
the idea in appeared like I said is to

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.800 
the idea in appeared like I said is to
get<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.340> 12<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.460> 15<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.060> conventional<00:03:06.630> I'm

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
get you 12 to 15 and conventional I'm

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.710 
get you 12 to 15 and conventional I'm
eating<00:03:07.110> in<00:03:07.290> continuous<00:03:07.980> tension<00:03:08.720> pumping

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
eating in continuous tension pumping

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.970 
eating in continuous tension pumping
them<00:03:09.810> out<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.500> then<00:03:10.650> when<00:03:10.740> you've<00:03:10.830> done<00:03:10.860> that

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
them out and then when you've done that

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.110 
them out and then when you've done that
put<00:03:11.780> your<00:03:12.780> hand<00:03:12.930> inside<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:14.580> then<00:03:14.730> continue

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
put your hand inside and then continue

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.150 
put your hand inside and then continue
on<00:03:15.150> with<00:03:15.570> another<00:03:15.990> five<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.530> ten<00:03:16.770> reps<00:03:17.040> or

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
on with another five to ten reps or

on with another five to ten reps or
whatever<00:03:17.400> got<00:03:17.550> left<00:03:17.730> in<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.910> tank<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.420> do

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
whatever got left in the tank and do

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.870 
whatever got left in the tank and do
them<00:03:19.170> in<00:03:19.260> conventional<00:03:19.980> lifting<00:03:20.520> so<00:03:20.670> just

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
them in conventional lifting so just

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.470 
them in conventional lifting so just
down<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.450> then<00:03:22.440> squeeze<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.430> dead<00:03:23.970> out<00:03:24.150> and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
down and then squeeze the dead out and

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.870 
down and then squeeze the dead out and
then<00:03:25.200> squeeze<00:03:25.560> okay<00:03:27.770> and<00:03:28.770> like<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:29.010> said<00:03:29.220> you're

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
then squeeze okay and like I said you're

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.750 
then squeeze okay and like I said you're
getting<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:30.180> full<00:03:30.450> workout<00:03:30.900> they're<00:03:31.760> getting

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
getting a full workout they're getting

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.390 
getting a full workout they're getting
out<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:34.080> chest<00:03:34.320> inner<00:03:34.680> chest<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.250> would

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
out of chest inner chest and that would

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.130 
out of chest inner chest and that would
be<00:03:35.489> like<00:03:35.520> doing<00:03:36.120> like<00:03:36.270> a<00:03:36.300> superset<00:03:36.870> that's<00:03:37.050> an

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
be like doing like a superset that's an

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.920 
be like doing like a superset that's an
extended<00:03:37.560> set<00:03:37.739> but<00:03:38.100> they'd<00:03:38.220> be<00:03:38.310> like<00:03:38.459> doing

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
extended set but they'd be like doing

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.600 
extended set but they'd be like doing
incline<00:03:39.930> barbell<00:03:40.440> presses<00:03:40.950> superset<00:03:41.580> with

incline barbell presses superset with
incline<00:03:42.360> flyes<00:03:42.720> okay<00:03:43.410> but<00:03:44.280> there<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.489> go<00:03:44.700> I'm

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
incline flyes okay but there I go I'm

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.400 
incline flyes okay but there I go I'm
just<00:03:44.880> showing<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.300> how<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.480> do<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.900> without

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
just showing you how to do that without

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.280 
just showing you how to do that without
