this<00:02:53.490> one<00:02:53.640> was<00:02:53.760> kind<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:53.940> weird<00:02:54.210> because<00:02:54.420> it

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
this one was kind of weird because it

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.770

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
guess not since they give me alone a key

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.800 
guess not since they give me alone a key
episodes<00:02:59.580> they<00:02:59.760> have<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.970> get<00:03:00.090> Jinora<00:03:00.360> one<00:03:00.630> now

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
think the next two episodes with

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.600 
think the next two episodes with
flashback<00:03:09.870> episodes<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.560> first<00:03:10.830> avatar<00:03:11.070> WAN

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
flashback episodes the first avatar WAN

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.960 
flashback episodes the first avatar WAN
and<00:03:12.170> how<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.290> became<00:03:13.530> an<00:03:13.680> avatar<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.730> me

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
and how it became an avatar so that I me

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.690 
and how it became an avatar so that I me
guess<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.360> guess<00:03:15.570> that'll<00:03:15.810> be<00:03:15.840> interesting<00:03:16.700> so

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700
