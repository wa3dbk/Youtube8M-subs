00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.560 
quite full coverage and it has a really
nice<00:03:16.830> natural<00:03:17.100> matte<00:03:17.490> finish<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.390> does

nice natural matte finish and it does

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
last all day as well which is really

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.740 
last all day as well which is really
important<00:03:20.550> if<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:20.700> have<00:03:20.730> super<00:03:21.030> oily<00:03:21.330> skin

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
important if you have super oily skin

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.040 
important if you have super oily skin
like<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:22.050> do

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
like I do

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.290 
like I do
and<00:03:25.070> I<00:03:26.070> find<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.550> damp<00:03:26.760> sponge<00:03:27.000> works

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
and I find that the damp sponge works

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.640 
and I find that the damp sponge works
best<00:03:27.540> for<00:03:27.660> applying<00:03:27.990> this<00:03:28.170> foundation

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
best for applying this foundation

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.780 
best for applying this foundation
because<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.040> just<00:03:29.160> keeps<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.550> from<00:03:29.670> looking

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
because it just keeps it from looking

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.370 
because it just keeps it from looking
too<00:03:30.150> heavy<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.540> keeps<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.900> looking<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.260> little

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
too heavy and keeps it looking a little

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:44.060 
too heavy and keeps it looking a little
bit<00:03:31.560> more<00:03:31.740> natural<00:03:42.170> then<00:03:43.170> for<00:03:43.410> concealer<00:03:43.890> I'm
