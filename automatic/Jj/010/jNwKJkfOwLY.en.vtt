of wraparound cockpit feel but it's the

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
back seat that is the biggest surprise

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.850

for<00:05:31.910> me<00:05:32.240> you<00:05:32.780> would<00:05:32.930> look<00:05:33.050> at<00:05:33.169> this<00:05:33.260> NX<00:05:33.680> and

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
for me you would look at this NX and

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.140 
for me you would look at this NX and
look<00:05:33.979> at<00:05:34.070> the<00:05:34.160> crop<00:05:34.400> roof<00:05:34.669> and<00:05:34.820> think<00:05:35.000> there's

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
look at the crop roof and think there's

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.640 
look at the crop roof and think there's
not<00:05:35.330> going<00:05:35.450> to<00:05:35.540> be<00:05:35.630> much<00:05:35.780> Headroom<00:05:36.050> back<00:05:36.410> there

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
not going to be much Headroom back there

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.810 
not going to be much Headroom back there
but<00:05:36.830> what<00:05:36.979> they've<00:05:37.130> actually<00:05:37.280> been<00:05:37.550> able<00:05:37.700> to

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
but what they've actually been able to

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.610 
but what they've actually been able to
accomplish<00:05:38.300> is<00:05:38.450> theater<00:05:39.110> seating<00:05:39.410> the

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620

backseat passengers sit higher than the

backseat passengers sit higher than the
front<00:05:41.870> seat<00:05:42.050> but<00:05:42.440> they've<00:05:42.590> sculpted<00:05:43.130> out<00:05:43.220> the

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
front seat but they've sculpted out the

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.490 
front seat but they've sculpted out the
headliner<00:05:43.850> and<00:05:44.120> you<00:05:44.450> actually<00:05:44.690> can<00:05:45.080> sit<00:05:45.320> back

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
headliner and you actually can sit back

headliner and you actually can sit back
there<00:05:45.650> I'm<00:05:45.830> 6<00:05:46.160> feet<00:05:46.370> tall<00:05:46.610> no<00:05:47.240> problem<00:05:47.870> in<00:05:48.020> the

there I'm 6 feet tall no problem in the

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.710 
there I'm 6 feet tall no problem in the
back<00:05:48.590> seat<00:05:48.919> the<00:05:49.160> cargo<00:05:49.729> area<00:05:49.760> they<00:05:50.270> claim<00:05:50.510> is

back seat the cargo area they claim is

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.420 
back seat the cargo area they claim is
longer<00:05:51.200> than<00:05:51.320> most<00:05:51.500> of<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.710> competition<00:05:52.010> but

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
longer than most of the competition but

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.130 
longer than most of the competition but
I<00:05:52.490> don't<00:05:52.700> think<00:05:52.820> it<00:05:52.970> is<00:05:53.000> high<00:05:53.240> because<00:05:53.900> of<00:05:54.020> the

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
I don't think it is high because of the

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.290 
I don't think it is high because of the
sloped<00:05:54.410> rear<00:05:54.650> hatch<00:05:54.830> area<00:05:55.070> but<00:05:55.340> overall<00:05:55.669> the

sloped rear hatch area but overall the

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.540 
sloped rear hatch area but overall the
interior<00:05:56.870> is<00:05:57.110> a<00:05:57.320> nice<00:05:57.620> surprise<00:05:57.830> the

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
interior is a nice surprise the

British Columbia and we've been driving

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.890 
British Columbia and we've been driving
this<00:06:04.400> model<00:06:04.849> through<00:06:05.000> some<00:06:05.210> very<00:06:05.419> twisty

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
this model through some very twisty

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.710 
this model through some very twisty
roads<00:06:06.200> and<00:06:06.560> I<00:06:06.770> have<00:06:06.950> to<00:06:07.130> say<00:06:07.340> that<00:06:07.550> it's

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
roads and I have to say that it's

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.770 
roads and I have to say that it's
happiest<00:06:08.720> when<00:06:08.900> you're<00:06:09.080> cruising

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
happiest when you're cruising

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.570 
happiest when you're cruising
and<00:06:09.900> when<00:06:10.260> you<00:06:10.380> push<00:06:10.620> it<00:06:10.800> hard<00:06:11.010> in<00:06:11.130> the<00:06:11.220> corners

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
and when you push it hard in the corners

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.130 
and when you push it hard in the corners
you<00:06:11.610> definitely<00:06:12.090> feel<00:06:12.270> quite<00:06:12.540> a<00:06:12.570> bit<00:06:12.810> of<00:06:12.930> body

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
you definitely feel quite a bit of body

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.960 
you definitely feel quite a bit of body
roll<00:06:13.260> now<00:06:13.830> I<00:06:13.890> haven't<00:06:14.160> had<00:06:14.340> a<00:06:14.400> chance<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:14.790> drive

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
roll now I haven't had a chance to drive

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.730 
roll now I haven't had a chance to drive
the<00:06:15.210> f<00:06:15.360> sport<00:06:15.630> and<00:06:15.840> I<00:06:15.900> wish<00:06:16.080> we<00:06:16.230> had<00:06:16.410> because

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
the f sport and I wish we had because

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.650 
the f sport and I wish we had because
it's<00:06:16.950> got<00:06:17.130> bigger<00:06:17.700> wheels<00:06:18.060> a<00:06:18.360> sports

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
it's got bigger wheels a sports

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.300 
it's got bigger wheels a sports
suspension<00:06:19.200> with<00:06:19.350> stiffer<00:06:19.590> dampeners<00:06:20.100> and

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
suspension with stiffer dampeners and

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.950 
suspension with stiffer dampeners and
that<00:06:20.520> certainly<00:06:20.940> would<00:06:21.150> help<00:06:21.300> if<00:06:21.570> you're<00:06:21.840> out

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
that certainly would help if you're out

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.140 
that certainly would help if you're out
on<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.170> twisty<00:06:22.560> bits<00:06:22.770> also<00:06:23.490> right<00:06:23.820> out<00:06:23.970> of<00:06:24.000> the

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
on the twisty bits also right out of the

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.790 
on the twisty bits also right out of the
pocket<00:06:24.600> the<00:06:24.750> power<00:06:24.960> isn't<00:06:25.260> really<00:06:25.770> that

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
pocket the power isn't really that

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.560 
pocket the power isn't really that
exhilarating<00:06:26.460> when<00:06:26.730> you<00:06:27.060> do<00:06:27.240> have<00:06:27.420> the

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
exhilarating when you do have the

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.150 
exhilarating when you do have the
turbocharged<00:06:28.170> spooled<00:06:28.590> up<00:06:28.800> there's

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
turbocharged spooled up there's

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.710 
turbocharged spooled up there's
certainly<00:06:29.490> enough<00:06:29.550> power<00:06:29.970> under<00:06:30.420> the<00:06:30.540> hood

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
certainly enough power under the hood

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.770 
certainly enough power under the hood
here<00:06:31.050> so<00:06:31.650> this<00:06:31.830> new<00:06:32.100> NX<00:06:32.670> is<00:06:32.910> definitely<00:06:33.510> at<00:06:33.660> its

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
here so this new NX is definitely at its

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.660 
here so this new NX is definitely at its
core<00:06:34.050> still<00:06:34.410> Alexis<00:06:35.010> they're<00:06:35.220> not<00:06:35.340> gonna<00:06:35.430> get

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
core still Alexis they're not gonna get

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.180 
core still Alexis they're not gonna get
away<00:06:35.730> from<00:06:35.970> that<00:06:36.300> smooth<00:06:36.690> refined<00:06:37.200> feel<00:06:37.650> that

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
away from that smooth refined feel that

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.190 
away from that smooth refined feel that
they're<00:06:38.400> known<00:06:38.640> for<00:06:38.670> they're<00:06:39.420> adding<00:06:39.840> in<00:06:40.020> a

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
they're known for they're adding in a

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.840 
they're known for they're adding in a
bit<00:06:40.380> of<00:06:40.500> edginess<00:06:40.650> and<00:06:41.130> they<00:06:41.190> certainly<00:06:41.520> have

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
bit of edginess and they certainly have

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.090 
bit of edginess and they certainly have
an<00:06:42.030> edgy<00:06:42.360> looking<00:06:42.690> exterior<00:06:43.230> that<00:06:43.590> they<00:06:43.830> hope
