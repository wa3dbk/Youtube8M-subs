00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.510
 hello I am pascal meunier creation 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.640
 and design I am a furniture designer 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.710
 in cardboard and today I'm going to you 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.030
 talk about the coating that we can 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.820
 put on your furniture once they 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.420
 are finished so we have different 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.970
 types of wallpaper paper as the 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.380
 framing paper that one can 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.750
 put on all the furniture 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.050
 as for the wallpaper we're going 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:34.420
 use a paper not too thick of this 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:36.160
 type of non-woven type with regard to 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.590
 the framing papers we will see a 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.680
 great choice of paper since we can 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:46.360
 to have tissue paper as well 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.879
 this one with effects or so we'll 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.640
 to be able to use vertex ski which is 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.660
 an imitation leather which is declined in full 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.820
 different patterns 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.260
 with regard to the vertex ski he 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.469
 will have to be careful because it's 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.570
 a very thick paper that does not work 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.460
 always very well so does very 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.140
 be careful using this type of paper 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.640
 we have a whole range of papers 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.530
 framing who are really very 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.690
 good and very practical which adheres very 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.630
 very well to the furniture that I you 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.170
 particularly advises 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.510
 so we have in the range that we 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.390
 call handmade paper or the 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.270
 mali which is said declined in different 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.960
 color with patterns or without pattern 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.420
 as here what I can advise you 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.550
 for a first piece of furniture so that we do not 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.950
 can not see the flaws that's 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.750
 to use this canvas paper which is 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.580
 really handy because they 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.220
 camouflage not bad we see that he has a 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.320
 adhering canvas side would do very well 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.090
 to the furniture and this side a little bit 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.430
 crumpled can remove all 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.680
 roughness of the furniture so that our 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.990
 furnished with very nice effects what we 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.510
 can do it's married a plain paper 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.050
 with a flower paper or patterned everything 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.690
 simply 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.330
 so most of the time we will do the 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.580
 patterns on the drawers and let the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.350
 united side for the furniture one can also 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.350
 decorated with paint 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.319
 the furniture entirely in paint 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.439
 satin matte as we want 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.239
 ideally in acrylic since 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.400
 acrylic contains water one goes 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.400
 first cover our furniture with a 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.099
 ideally smear a name of migrants 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.709
 but we can also use other 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.079
 coated which works very well too 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.060
 so I selected two types of 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.670
 paper that went very well with my 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.650
 furniture a fancy paper a paper 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.829
 fabric that can be found on this 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.129
 furniture at the drawers and 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:46.919
 sides so that's the tissue paper that has 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.049
 effects a little moire and at the level of 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:52.909
 furniture in front of and behind this paper 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.909
 fancy shaped lace 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.770
 when we are going to want to decorate 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.940
 inside the drawer we will either put 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.730
 paper like here all around and the 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.760
 painting inside that's what there is 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.160
 easier to coat we go 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.640
 also put in the openings of the 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.770
 painting 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.260
 you now know more about the 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.610
 decoration of cardboard furniture 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.610
 painting paper for you to choose 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.470
 and
