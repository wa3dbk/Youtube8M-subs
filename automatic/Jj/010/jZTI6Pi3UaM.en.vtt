with me
it<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> GH<00:00:13.230> rotor<00:00:13.650> pump<00:00:14.040> basically<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
it is a GH rotor pump basically the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.240 
it is a GH rotor pump basically the
crankshaft<00:00:15.330> goes<00:00:15.750> through<00:00:16.020> here<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.980> go

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
crankshaft goes through here this go

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.279 
crankshaft goes through here this go
this<00:00:17.550> piece<00:00:17.789> here<00:00:18.090> goes<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.720> pickup<00:00:18.960> tube

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
this piece here goes to the pickup tube

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.609 
this piece here goes to the pickup tube
that<00:00:19.470> goes<00:00:19.529> into<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.789> oil<00:00:21.330> pan<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:22.140> picks<00:00:22.500> it

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
that goes into the oil pan it picks it

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.660 
that goes into the oil pan it picks it
up<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.890> pumps<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.220> through<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.490> motor

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
up and pumps it through the motor

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.910 
up and pumps it through the motor
through<00:00:24.119> here<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:25.109> I'm<00:00:25.260> gonna<00:00:25.380> take<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.650> apart

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
through here so I'm gonna take it apart

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.080 
through here so I'm gonna take it apart
because<00:00:26.070> it's<00:00:26.310> old<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.760> has<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> lot<00:00:27.060> of

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
because it's old and it has a lot of

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.029 
because it's old and it has a lot of
miles<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.570> I'm<00:00:28.170> not<00:00:28.349> gonna<00:00:28.529> use<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.710> again

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
miles on it I'm not gonna use it again

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.800 
miles on it I'm not gonna use it again
so<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> was<00:00:29.760> kind<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.000> curious<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.449> see<00:00:30.480> what<00:00:30.720> was

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
so I was kind of curious to see what was

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.970 
so I was kind of curious to see what was
inside<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.439> figured<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.800> guys<00:00:31.920> might

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
inside of it so I figured you guys might

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.380 
inside of it so I figured you guys might
want<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.369> see<00:00:32.520> what's<00:00:32.640> inside<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.030> too

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
want to see what's inside of it too

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
want to see what's inside of it too
so<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.770> need<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.160> 30<00:00:35.610> W<00:00:37.280> star<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.610> hex<00:00:39.090> socket

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
so you need a 30 W star or hex socket

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.069 
so you need a 30 W star or hex socket
it's<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.559> 30<00:00:40.680> W<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> side<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.930> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
it's just 30 W on the side and this is a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.600 
it's just 30 W on the side and this is a
3/8<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.829> don't<00:00:43.980> know<00:00:44.070> if<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.340> gonna<00:00:44.460> work

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
3/8 I don't know if this is gonna work

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.279 
3/8 I don't know if this is gonna work
and<00:00:44.789> they<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.059> put<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.420> my<00:00:45.570> use<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
and they have to put it on my use the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.380 
and they have to put it on my use the
adapter<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.739> put<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.010> my<00:00:47.210> half<00:00:48.210> inch

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
adapter and put it on my half inch

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.580 
adapter and put it on my half inch

can<00:02:26.880> pull<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.240> cover<00:02:27.840> off<00:02:27.990> here<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:28.830> what

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
can pull the cover off here this is what

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.910 
can pull the cover off here this is what
the<00:02:29.100> backside<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.760> looks<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.680> this

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
the backside of it looks like and this

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.810 
the backside of it looks like and this
is<00:02:32.070> what's<00:02:32.760> inside<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.360> GH<00:02:33.720> rotor<00:02:34.020> problem

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
is what's inside of the GH rotor problem

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.690 
is what's inside of the GH rotor problem
basically<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:36.770> camp<00:02:37.770> sits<00:02:38.040> through<00:02:38.310> here<00:02:38.610> and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
basically the camp sits through here and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.360 
basically the camp sits through here and
it<00:02:38.790> spins<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.330> gear<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:41.540> somehow<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.810> pumps

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
it spins this gear and somehow it pumps

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.350 
it spins this gear and somehow it pumps
maybe<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.519> guys<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.880> tell<00:02:45.060> me<00:02:45.120> better

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
maybe you guys can tell me better

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.949 
maybe you guys can tell me better
somehow<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.900> pumps<00:02:46.260> oil<00:02:46.739> around<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.340> system

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
somehow it pumps oil around the system

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.820 
somehow it pumps oil around the system
with<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.110> gear<00:02:51.290> let's<00:02:52.290> see<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.530> would<00:02:52.650> turn

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
with this gear let's see it would turn

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.650 
with this gear let's see it would turn
like<00:02:53.070> this<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.489> it's<00:02:53.850> keyed<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.450> can't

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
like this and it's keyed so you can't

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.240 
like this and it's keyed so you can't
put<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.110> camshaft<00:02:55.320> backwards<00:02:56.070> it<00:02:56.220> says

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
put it on the camshaft backwards it says

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.640 
put it on the camshaft backwards it says
grooves<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.910> cams<00:02:57.120> rescues<00:02:57.510> me<00:02:57.660> we<00:02:58.470> take

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
grooves and the cams rescues me we take

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.770 
grooves and the cams rescues me we take
that<00:02:58.800> back<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.489> goes<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.820> crankshaft<00:03:00.480> and

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
that back this goes on a crankshaft and

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.870 
that back this goes on a crankshaft and
those<00:03:01.470> grooves<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.950> crankshaft<00:03:02.550> that

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
those grooves in the crankshaft that

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.670 
those grooves in the crankshaft that
match<00:03:03.150> up<00:03:03.360> with<00:03:03.480> these<00:03:03.630> grooves<00:03:03.930> here<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:04.590> you

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
match up with these grooves here so you

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.940 
match up with these grooves here so you
can't<00:03:04.860> put<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:05.220> backwards<00:03:05.459> etc<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:07.680> comes

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
can't put it on backwards etc that comes

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:20.979 
can't put it on backwards etc that comes
out<00:03:08.160> that's<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.610> gear<00:03:14.150> gear<00:03:15.150> or<00:03:15.360> bearing<00:03:18.260> out

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
out that's the gear gear or bearing out

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.580 
out that's the gear gear or bearing out
like<00:03:21.989> that

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
like that

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.920 
like that
actually<00:03:23.010> doesn't<00:03:23.280> look<00:03:23.310> too<00:03:23.610> bad<00:03:23.640> for<00:03:26.930> 172

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
actually doesn't look too bad for 172

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.900 
actually doesn't look too bad for 172
thousand<00:03:28.320> miles<00:03:28.470> on<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.799> truck<00:03:29.040> original

models<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:33.870> have<00:03:34.019> no<00:03:34.170> intentions<00:03:34.590> of

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
models and I have no intentions of

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.080 
models and I have no intentions of
putting<00:03:34.709> this<00:03:34.980> back<00:03:35.160> together<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.760> really

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
putting this back together so I really

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.930 
putting this back together so I really
I'm<00:03:36.360> not<00:03:37.700> too<00:03:38.700> concerned<00:03:38.910> about<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:40.940> parts

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
I'm not too concerned about the parts

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.869 
I'm not too concerned about the parts
really

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
really

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.790 
really

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
the other thing that's here is some sort

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.140 
the other thing that's here is some sort
of<00:03:47.980> some<00:03:48.980> sort<00:03:49.220> of<00:03:49.250> like<00:03:49.310> lift<00:03:49.610> or<00:03:49.790> maybe<00:03:49.940> or

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
of some sort of like lift or maybe or

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.089 
of some sort of like lift or maybe or
something<00:03:50.330> I'll<00:03:50.540> see<00:03:50.660> thing<00:03:50.810> get<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:51.110> out<00:03:52.660> no

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
something I'll see thing get that out no

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.040 
something I'll see thing get that out no
get<00:03:55.099> this<00:03:55.280> broken<00:03:55.730> loose<00:03:55.879> I'm<00:03:56.390> screwed<00:03:56.810> yeah

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
get this broken loose I'm screwed yeah

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.360 
get this broken loose I'm screwed yeah
feels<00:03:57.349> like<00:03:57.500> it's<00:03:57.620> some<00:03:57.800> sort<00:03:57.980> of<00:03:58.069> spring

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
feels like it's some sort of spring

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.940 
feels like it's some sort of spring
mechanism<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.959> guys<00:04:00.110> can<00:04:00.349> chime<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.709> us<00:04:00.830> you

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
mechanism you guys can chime in us you

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.390 
mechanism you guys can chime in us you
know<00:04:01.040> what<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.310> is<00:04:01.430> because<00:04:01.730> I<00:04:01.910> don't<00:04:06.370> but<00:04:07.370> I

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
know what it is because I don't but I

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.710 
know what it is because I don't but I
just<00:04:07.640> thought<00:04:07.849> you'd<00:04:08.000> like<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.299> see<00:04:08.480> what<00:04:08.629> was

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
just thought you'd like to see what was

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.410 
just thought you'd like to see what was
inside<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:09.110> it<00:04:09.459> they're<00:04:10.459> taking<00:04:10.819> it<00:04:10.879> apart

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
inside of it they're taking it apart

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.759 
inside of it they're taking it apart
some<00:04:12.140> type<00:04:12.319> of<00:04:12.349> oil<00:04:12.560> plug<00:04:14.319> and<00:04:15.319> then<00:04:15.440> there's<00:04:15.680> a

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
some type of oil plug and then there's a

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.289 
some type of oil plug and then there's a
big<00:04:15.920> spring<00:04:16.310> this<00:04:16.549> must<00:04:16.760> be<00:04:16.880> some<00:04:17.030> type<00:04:17.150> of

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
big spring this must be some type of

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:41.620 
big spring this must be some type of
valve<00:04:21.880> looks<00:04:22.880> like<00:04:39.729> and<00:04:40.729> that's<00:04:41.180> what's<00:04:41.479> at

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
valve looks like and that's what's at

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.940 
valve looks like and that's what's at
the<00:04:41.720> bottom<00:04:46.389> some<00:04:47.389> type<00:04:47.600> of<00:04:47.630> oil<00:04:48.020> plug<00:04:48.710> of

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
the bottom some type of oil plug of

00:04:48.950 --> 00:05:00.129 
the bottom some type of oil plug of
sorts<00:04:50.139> so<00:04:51.139> it<00:04:51.289> sits<00:04:51.470> in<00:04:51.680> there<00:04:51.919> like<00:04:52.520> this<00:04:59.139> so

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
sorts so it sits in there like this so

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.980 
sorts so it sits in there like this so
the<00:05:00.229> package<00:05:00.620> is<00:05:00.740> just<00:05:00.889> took<00:05:01.070> out<00:05:01.250> sits<00:05:01.550> in<00:05:02.150> the

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
the package is just took out sits in the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.810 
the package is just took out sits in the
housing<00:05:03.470> right<00:05:03.860> here<00:05:04.160> just<00:05:05.090> like<00:05:05.300> this<00:05:05.889> and<00:05:06.889> it

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
housing right here just like this and it

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.430 
housing right here just like this and it
screws<00:05:08.210> down<00:05:08.419> this<00:05:08.630> it's<00:05:08.810> like<00:05:08.930> I<00:05:08.960> said<00:05:09.200> some

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
screws down this it's like I said some

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.820 
screws down this it's like I said some
kind<00:05:09.650> of<00:05:09.740> pressure<00:05:10.669> valve<00:05:11.000> or<00:05:11.270> will<00:05:12.080> help<00:05:12.349> sort

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
kind of pressure valve or will help sort

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.980 
kind of pressure valve or will help sort
so<00:05:13.130> I<00:05:13.460> don't<00:05:14.210> know<00:05:14.270> what<00:05:14.419> it<00:05:14.510> does<00:05:14.660> exactly

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
so I don't know what it does exactly

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.629 
so I don't know what it does exactly
looks<00:05:15.320> like<00:05:15.470> it<00:05:15.590> regulates<00:05:16.010> maybe<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.430> flow

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
looks like it regulates maybe the flow

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.779 
looks like it regulates maybe the flow
of<00:05:16.849> oil<00:05:17.590> going<00:05:18.590> into<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.979> block<00:05:19.220> or<00:05:19.580> something

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
of oil going into the block or something

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.750
