over the sound you know how good those

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.839 
over the sound you know how good those
controls<00:02:21.480> are<00:02:21.659> really<00:02:22.220> determine<00:02:23.220> if<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:23.550> if

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
controls are really determine if it's if
