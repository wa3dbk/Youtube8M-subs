00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.799
 crazy world of battlefield 4 and 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.389
 also welcome to the first issue 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:16.830
 call burden answered 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.300
 see the clicks he doesn't see us he shoots 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.939
 and here he is 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.410
 what a beautiful mountain you are 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.410
 mountain temperate 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.410
 well, says good machine 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.280
 there the remains were waiting and how they performed 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.400
 Now there will be a performance trolling 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:07.170
 help together 4 and let's go find the first 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:10.229
 the tank did not go there I drove the whole map 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.380
 and in front, as you can see a bunch of racist 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.160
 enemy very enemy technology and how 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:27.509
 I would not have time to ass Troll in advance and 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:33.420
 and since the task is so interesting 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:44.000
 let's confirm once again we catch 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:44.000
 surprise beeps 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.230
 the next task is a little more serious 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:56.130
 it is to blow 2 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:00.660
 units of enemy equipment from me shells 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.390
 from rpp from files of course and here I am 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.560
 lucky found 1 shot down 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:12.440
 the enemy in front of him solder 2 sweep the enemy 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.440
 and the chapka itself was easily fulfilled. 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.020
 the next task does not need to blow 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.990
 enemy technique shot from 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.300
 sniper rifle all four 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.260
 look at him like we did with my 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.260

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:49.840
 here we go from here we go still to look up 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.390
 distance is insignificant but fact 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.390
 remains a fact the equipment is destroyed 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.110
 and the guy si4 carries me to tear off 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.000

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.020

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.599
 shoot down an enemy air machine unit 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.150
