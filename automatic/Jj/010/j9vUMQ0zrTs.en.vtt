00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.250
 d 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.660
 very good seeing the success that has 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.029
 had in regard to 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.820
 participation in the theme of choosing the 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.710
 front of the fmi but of Alvaro 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.560
 I'm thinking about working this physical 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.560
 I'm aesthetic I got it done 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.710
 one year I think and the only thing I did because 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.270
 picked up bare root the only thing that 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.340
 I did was put it in this facet that we 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.890
 joke be like this they did not leave with the flights 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.300
 of verona I made and was planted in 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.710
 poor quality soil but good 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.040
 they are behaving very well and it has sprouted 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.690
 very much I have thought to be then 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.059
 I bought a good flower pot maybe 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.500
 a little too short but I think that 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.930
 it's going to be worth it to buy a 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.640
 good pot that has me inside and 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.860
 tomorrow then surely this end of 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.130
 week work this tree and I'm 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.180
 deciding the front that I'm going to put 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.340
 that's why I want your collaboration 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.290
 then here to more truth I have clear 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.310
 I 'm going to turn the tree 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.790
 slowly and then ye 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.130
 comments from youtube or on facebook 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.290
 you look at the time counter that 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.580
 has the video and tells me david in the 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.710
 minute for example 238 I think that that 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.540
 front of the good ok let's do it 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.220
 well because now a different one there are 30 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.220
 times with a totally round tree and 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.700
 As such I 'm going to do a 360 turn 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:41.110
 degrees and already front would choose the court of 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.380
 here as well as 'david the gnome' the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.380
 watering can 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.520
 come start spinning the tree and 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:55.380
 you decide at what minute and what 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.380
 second choose and in front 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.119
 It is a rich 15 microcar for the variety 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:10.899
 tiger walk in my favorite you already know and 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:14.290
 I bought it because it was a huge ball 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.390
 of leaves with many fused trunks 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.069
 because well I think they are not trunks I'm going 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.340
 to put a picture of how I knew this 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.340
 tree 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.460
 and you tell me 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.530
 what is the front that you wanted 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.530
 and this tree was your 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.290
 I do not know if I'll do a vanian with this tree or 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.129
 I will leave it simply with many roots 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.180
 stuck of the trunk without roots columns of 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.180
 this nice forgive 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.659
 have any man because I get him 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.659
 a few branches but that's it 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.330
 tomorrow I have to finish Alvaro on 1 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.280
 June the number of Alvaro 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.350
 and in addition to a tribute and work this 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.630
 tree if it looks good 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.500
 They did not carry gas if they do not stay here 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.500
 because it is very big 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:26.160
 and I think the 360 ​​turn is over here 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.160
 degrees 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.560
 so good 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.540
 the comments of youtube you put me the 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.580
 minute and the second that you 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.350
 you should as front and on facebook what 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.560
 same or already the third state and 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.090
 reason is a bit average so good with 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.590
 that makes a hug 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.590
 and until the next video
