00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
why there's all these other games out

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.330 
why there's all these other games out
there<00:03:22.019> that<00:03:22.319> are<00:03:22.349> so<00:03:22.620> much<00:03:22.769> better<00:03:22.919> than<00:03:23.189> this

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
there that are so much better than this

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.729 
there that are so much better than this
game<00:03:23.639> so<00:03:24.299> I'm<00:03:24.629> a<00:03:24.689> low<00:03:24.989> turns<00:03:25.259> off<00:03:25.439> by<00:03:25.680> the

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
game so I'm a low turns off by the

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.670 
game so I'm a low turns off by the
future<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.489> although<00:03:26.930> Triarch<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.139> making

so<00:04:24.930> if<00:04:25.020> all<00:04:25.139> those<00:04:25.289> games<00:04:25.560> I<00:04:25.710> just<00:04:25.919> said<00:04:26.190> the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
so if all those games I just said the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.860 
so if all those games I just said the
money<00:04:27.300> alone

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
money alone

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.020 
money alone
but<00:04:28.050> just<00:04:28.290> thinking<00:04:29.010> about<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.490> time<00:04:29.729> that

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
but just thinking about the time that

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.189 
but just thinking about the time that
it's<00:04:30.180> gonna<00:04:30.270> take<00:04:30.479> me<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.720> play<00:04:30.900> Oh<00:04:30.930> through

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
it's gonna take me to play Oh through

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.870 
it's gonna take me to play Oh through
all<00:04:31.290> these<00:04:31.410> games<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:31.949> just<00:04:32.010> enjoy<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.669> games

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
all these games and just enjoy the games

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.420 
all these games and just enjoy the games
I<00:04:33.150> really<00:04:33.690> won't<00:04:33.840> have<00:04:34.139> time<00:04:34.530> or<00:04:34.860> perhaps

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
I really won't have time or perhaps

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.810 
I really won't have time or perhaps
money<00:04:35.910> to<00:04:36.540> go<00:04:36.750> out<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.229> pick<00:04:37.740> up<00:04:37.889> black<00:04:38.220> ops<00:04:38.460> 3

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
money to go out and pick up black ops 3

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.490 
money to go out and pick up black ops 3
so<00:04:39.000> that's<00:04:39.180> no<00:04:39.300> reason<00:04:39.510> why<00:04:39.780> I<00:04:39.810> probably<00:04:40.290> won't

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
so that's no reason why I probably won't

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.620 
so that's no reason why I probably won't
be<00:04:40.650> picking<00:04:40.830> up<00:04:41.040> this<00:04:41.190> game<00:04:41.490> and<00:04:41.820> then<00:04:42.510> the

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
be picking up this game and then the

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.240 
be picking up this game and then the
last<00:04:42.660> reason<00:04:43.139> why<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.470> probably<00:04:43.889> won't<00:04:44.100> be

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
last reason why I probably won't be

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.850 
last reason why I probably won't be
picking<00:04:44.430> up<00:04:44.669> black<00:04:44.940> ops<00:04:45.210> 3<00:04:45.540> is<00:04:45.750> because<00:04:46.560> this

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
picking up black ops 3 is because this

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.010 
picking up black ops 3 is because this

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
emulate the xbox 360 system so now if

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.480 
emulate the xbox 360 system so now if
you<00:05:01.800> put<00:05:02.400> in<00:05:02.550> a<00:05:02.760> approved<00:05:03.720> xbox<00:05:04.350> 360<00:05:04.860> game<00:05:05.160> into

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
you put in a approved xbox 360 game into

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.180 
you put in a approved xbox 360 game into
your<00:05:05.639> xbox<00:05:05.970> one<00:05:06.210> it'll<00:05:06.930> just<00:05:06.960> work<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.560> if<00:05:08.070> you

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
your xbox one it'll just work and if you

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.340 
your xbox one it'll just work and if you
downloaded<00:05:08.610> them<00:05:08.880> or<00:05:09.090> have<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.300> disc<00:05:09.630> it'll<00:05:10.260> be

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
downloaded them or have a disc it'll be

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.020 
downloaded them or have a disc it'll be
free<00:05:10.650> so<00:05:10.800> you<00:05:10.860> don't<00:05:11.010> have<00:05:11.100> to<00:05:11.190> pay<00:05:11.370> repay<00:05:11.970> for

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
free so you don't have to pay repay for

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.300 
free so you don't have to pay repay for
the<00:05:12.300> game<00:05:12.449> that<00:05:12.630> you<00:05:12.780> already<00:05:12.930> own<00:05:13.289> and<00:05:13.620> this

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
the game that you already own and this

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.189 
the game that you already own and this
is<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.520> huge<00:05:14.789> feature<00:05:15.060> because<00:05:15.440> if<00:05:16.440> arm

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
is a huge feature because if arm

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.420 
is a huge feature because if arm
Activision<00:05:19.199> allows<00:05:19.530> backwards

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
Activision allows backwards

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.070 
Activision allows backwards
compatibility<00:05:21.060> because<00:05:21.419> the<00:05:21.600> publishers

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
compatibility because the publishers

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.230 
compatibility because the publishers
have<00:05:22.260> to<00:05:22.470> say<00:05:22.770> it's<00:05:23.039> okay<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.490> use<00:05:23.789> this<00:05:24.000> and

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
have to say it's okay to use this and

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.890 
have to say it's okay to use this and
while<00:05:24.900> this<00:05:25.110> could<00:05:25.860> possibly<00:05:26.550> network<00:05:27.180> but

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
while this could possibly network but

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.620 
while this could possibly network but
hopefully<00:05:28.500> Activision<00:05:29.310> is<00:05:29.460> nice<00:05:30.030> enough<00:05:30.240> to

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
hopefully Activision is nice enough to

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.110 
hopefully Activision is nice enough to
allow<00:05:31.410> backwards<00:05:31.979> compatibility<00:05:32.729> for<00:05:32.970> their

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
allow backwards compatibility for their

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.940 
allow backwards compatibility for their
games<00:05:33.360> which<00:05:33.990> would<00:05:34.169> mean<00:05:34.349> I<00:05:34.590> could<00:05:34.770> pick<00:05:34.919> up

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
games which would mean I could pick up

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.089 
games which would mean I could pick up
black<00:05:35.400> ops<00:05:35.639> 2<00:05:35.849> black<00:05:36.300> ops<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:37.680> modern<00:05:37.950> warfare

the black ops 3 because really doesn't

the black ops 3 because really doesn't
entice<00:06:09.449> me<00:06:09.660> that<00:06:09.840> much<00:06:10.050> and<00:06:10.349> interest<00:06:10.770> me<00:06:10.979> so

those<00:06:11.910> are<00:06:11.940> basically<00:06:12.360> my<00:06:12.570> three<00:06:13.199> reasons<00:06:13.650> why

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
those are basically my three reasons why

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.310 
those are basically my three reasons why
I<00:06:13.860> probably<00:06:14.490> won't<00:06:14.760> be<00:06:14.910> picking<00:06:15.060> up<00:06:15.419> black<00:06:16.139> up

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
I probably won't be picking up black up

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.290 
I probably won't be picking up black up
three<00:06:16.620> unless<00:06:16.860> something<00:06:17.280> dramatic<00:06:17.490> changes

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
three unless something dramatic changes

three unless something dramatic changes
