00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
this point now we're we're in the end of

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.459 
this point now we're we're in the end of
April<00:00:53.210> beginning<00:00:53.329> of<00:00:53.600> May<00:00:53.659> here<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:54.319> it's

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
April beginning of May here so it's

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:55.509 
April beginning of May here so it's
starting<00:00:54.769> to<00:00:54.829> butt<00:00:55.010> out<00:00:55.039> which<00:00:55.280> is<00:00:55.429> the

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
starting to butt out which is the

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.129 
starting to butt out which is the
perfect<00:00:55.819> time<00:00:55.969> to<00:00:55.999> actually<00:00:56.359> do<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:56.719> grafting

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:57.139 
perfect time to actually do the grafting

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:59.500 
perfect time to actually do the grafting
itself<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:58.519> can<00:00:58.639> do<00:00:58.760> grafting<00:00:59.120> up<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.359> the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
itself you can do grafting up to the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.809 
itself you can do grafting up to the
point<00:00:59.749> where<00:01:00.019> the<00:01:00.289> but<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:00.710> Leafs<00:01:01.249> are<00:01:01.579> about

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
point where the but the Leafs are about

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
point where the but the Leafs are about
the<00:01:01.940> size<00:01:02.089> of<00:01:02.329> a<00:01:02.420> mouse

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
the size of a mouse

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.780 
the size of a mouse
ear<00:01:03.170> which<00:01:03.499> is<00:01:03.530> kind<00:01:03.799> of<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:03.949> perfect<00:01:04.100> timing

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
ear which is kind of the perfect timing

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.950 
ear which is kind of the perfect timing
so<00:01:05.270> Wow

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
so Wow

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.230 
so Wow
we'll<00:01:06.140> do<00:01:06.320> some<00:01:06.350> some<00:01:07.340> simple<00:01:07.610> grafting<00:01:08.060> and

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
we'll do some some simple grafting and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.760 
we'll do some some simple grafting and
then<00:01:08.630> then<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:08.900> couple<00:01:09.080> of<00:01:09.200> months<00:01:09.260> will<00:01:09.560> follow

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
then then a couple of months will follow

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.290 
then then a couple of months will follow
up<00:01:09.980> and<00:01:10.130> see<00:01:10.310> how<00:01:10.400> these<00:01:10.550> grafts<00:01:10.850> are<00:01:11.060> doing

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
up and see how these grafts are doing

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.210 
up and see how these grafts are doing
one<00:01:11.960> thing<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:12.230> do<00:01:12.290> have<00:01:12.410> to<00:01:12.560> say<00:01:12.680> with<00:01:12.800> graphing

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
one thing I do have to say with graphing

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.410 
one thing I do have to say with graphing
especially<00:01:13.640> if<00:01:13.700> you're<00:01:13.820> not<00:01:13.940> gonna<00:01:14.060> use<00:01:14.150> some

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
especially if you're not gonna use some

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.120 
especially if you're not gonna use some
of<00:01:14.510> the<00:01:14.570> commercially<00:01:15.080> available<00:01:15.170> tools<00:01:15.800> is

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
of the commercially available tools is

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.370 
of the commercially available tools is
it<00:01:17.030> doesn't<00:01:17.210> have<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.480> perfect<00:01:17.810> success<00:01:17.960> rate

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
it doesn't have a perfect success rate

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.560 
it doesn't have a perfect success rate
which<00:01:18.590> is<00:01:18.770> fine<00:01:19.010> just<00:01:19.730> learn<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.180> try<00:01:20.360> and

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
which is fine just learn and try and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.050 
which is fine just learn and try and
I've<00:01:20.690> had<00:01:20.900> a<00:01:20.930> tree<00:01:21.740> generously<00:01:22.340> donated<00:01:22.940> that

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
I've had a tree generously donated that

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.270 
I've had a tree generously donated that
I<00:01:23.120> can<00:01:23.330> learn<00:01:23.480> on<00:01:23.690> before<00:01:24.020> I<00:01:24.050> go<00:01:24.260> and<00:01:24.650> try<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:25.070> on

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
I can learn on before I go and try it on

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.900 
I can learn on before I go and try it on
my<00:01:25.460> apple<00:01:25.820> tree<00:01:25.970> at<00:01:26.060> home<00:01:27.220> so<00:01:28.220> so<00:01:28.610> what<00:01:28.730> you'll

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
my apple tree at home so so what you'll

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.640 
my apple tree at home so so what you'll
need<00:01:29.030> is<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.240> Scion<00:01:29.690> now<00:01:30.230> you'll<00:01:30.440> want<00:01:30.590> to

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
need is a Scion now you'll want to

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.610 
need is a Scion now you'll want to
collect<00:01:30.920> these<00:01:31.100> in<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.930> beginning<00:01:33.230> of<00:01:33.350> April

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
collect these in the beginning of April

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.930 
collect these in the beginning of April
before<00:01:33.830> they<00:01:34.100> actually<00:01:34.430> start<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.700> butt<00:01:34.910> out

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
before they actually start to butt out

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.010 
before they actually start to butt out
because<00:01:35.210> you'll<00:01:35.360> notice<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.720> difference

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
because you'll notice the difference

here you've got buds coming out and this
one<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.900> buds<00:01:39.080> are<00:01:39.230> still<00:01:39.470> in<00:01:39.740> their<00:01:40.190> fall

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
one the buds are still in their fall

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.350 
one the buds are still in their fall
configuration<00:01:41.510> this<00:01:42.260> is<00:01:42.410> actually<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:43.360> pear

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
configuration this is actually a pear

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.600 
configuration this is actually a pear
variety<00:01:45.080> and<00:01:45.230> and<00:01:45.470> apparently<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.490> we're

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
variety and and apparently and we're

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.250 
variety and and apparently and we're
gonna<00:01:46.700> test<00:01:47.180> this<00:01:47.330> out<00:01:47.480> today<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:47.780> can<00:01:48.020> graph

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
gonna test this out today you can graph

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.530 
gonna test this out today you can graph
pears<00:01:48.620> two<00:01:48.860> apple<00:01:49.160> trees<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:50.180> what<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:50.390> want

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
pears two apple trees so what you want

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.190 
pears two apple trees so what you want
to<00:01:50.600> do<00:01:50.780> is<00:01:52.030> put<00:01:53.030> that<00:01:53.180> knife<00:01:53.330> away<00:01:53.420> safely<00:01:53.990> for

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
to do is put that knife away safely for

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
now you want to freshen up the cut what

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.210 
now you want to freshen up the cut what
that<00:01:58.550> means<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.480> this<00:02:00.080> part<00:02:00.470> right<00:02:00.680> in<00:02:00.830> here

has dried out and you want to have one

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.030 
has dried out and you want to have one
bud<00:02:04.580> kind<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.480> above<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:06.290> work<00:02:06.470> with<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:06.920> we'll

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
bud kind of above to work with so we'll

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.460 
bud kind of above to work with so we'll
cut<00:02:07.220> just<00:02:07.460> above<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.820> bud<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.350> freshen<00:02:09.350> that

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
cut just above the bud to freshen that

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.360 
cut just above the bud to freshen that
up<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:10.150> the<00:02:11.150> same<00:02:11.360> thing<00:02:11.540> on<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.750> other<00:02:11.900> end

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
up and the same thing on the other end

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.690 
up and the same thing on the other end
you'll<00:02:13.370> know

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
you'll know

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.869 
you'll know
that<00:02:14.830> I'm<00:02:15.830> not<00:02:16.010> sure<00:02:16.129> if<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.310> can<00:02:16.400> see<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.700> but

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
that I'm not sure if you can see it but

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.160 
that I'm not sure if you can see it but
there's<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.270> green<00:02:17.510> layer<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.900> that's<00:02:17.959> the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
there's a green layer and that's the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.320 
there's a green layer and that's the
important<00:02:18.620> layer<00:02:18.800> here<00:02:19.099> so<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.730> want<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.180> make

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
important layer here so you want to make

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.309 
important layer here so you want to make
sure<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.629> find<00:02:20.900> for<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:22.370> cleft<00:02:22.910> graph

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
sure you find for this this cleft graph

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.400 
sure you find for this this cleft graph
roughly<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.470> same<00:02:24.739> diameter<00:02:25.959> part<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
roughly the same diameter part of the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.030 
roughly the same diameter part of the
tree<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:29.810> that's<00:02:30.019> that's<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.680> little<00:02:30.920> bit

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
tree and so that's that's a little bit

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.140 
tree and so that's that's a little bit
up<00:02:31.160> here<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.989> so<00:02:33.170> what<00:02:33.349> we're<00:02:33.470> going<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.739> do<00:02:34.150> is

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
up here and so what we're going to do is

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.559 
up here and so what we're going to do is
we<00:02:35.390> are<00:02:35.540> going<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:36.050> cut<00:02:36.290> below<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:39.459> bud<00:02:40.459> get<00:02:41.420> rid

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
we are going to cut below a bud get rid

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.640 
we are going to cut below a bud get rid
of<00:02:41.599> that<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:43.549> want<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.849> nice<00:02:44.000> strong<00:02:44.810> stable

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
of that so you want a nice strong stable

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.960 
of that so you want a nice strong stable
thin<00:02:46.099> knife<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.970> do<00:02:47.120> this<00:02:47.330> with<00:02:48.819> what<00:02:49.819> we're

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
thin knife to do this with what we're

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.220 
thin knife to do this with what we're
going<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.209> do<00:02:50.390> is<00:02:50.569> you<00:02:50.690> want<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.870> make<00:02:50.959> sure<00:02:51.110> the

going to do is you want to make sure the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.800 
going to do is you want to make sure the
buds<00:02:51.410> are<00:02:51.560> oriented<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.190> same<00:02:52.220> way<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:52.910> with

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
buds are oriented the same way and with

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.140 
buds are oriented the same way and with
the<00:02:54.049> Scion<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.970> want<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:57.819> cut<00:02:58.819> the<00:02:59.120> two<00:02:59.329> sides

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
the Scion you want to cut the two sides

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.039 
the Scion you want to cut the two sides
it's<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.180> great<00:03:02.390> kind<00:03:02.630> of<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.780> wedge<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:05.049> then

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
it's a great kind of a wedge and then

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.270 
it's a great kind of a wedge and then
with<00:03:06.519> be<00:03:07.519> very<00:03:07.760> careful<00:03:08.180> about<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.599> and<00:03:08.900> slow

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
with be very careful about this and slow

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.830 
with be very careful about this and slow
you<00:03:10.280> want<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.610> slowly<00:03:10.910> rock<00:03:11.269> your<00:03:11.510> way<00:03:11.630> into

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
you want to slowly rock your way into

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.059 
you want to slowly rock your way into
the<00:03:12.079> center<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:13.239> tree<00:03:14.769> don't<00:03:15.769> want<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:15.980> go

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
the center of this tree don't want to go

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.360 
the center of this tree don't want to go
too<00:03:16.130> far

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
too far

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.400 
too far
then<00:03:20.350> you<00:03:21.350> slowly<00:03:22.780> guess<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.959> could<00:03:24.109> use<00:03:24.139> the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
then you slowly guess you could use the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.960 
then you slowly guess you could use the
knife<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.620> wedge<00:03:24.950> this<00:03:25.190> open<00:03:25.549> a<00:03:25.609> little<00:03:25.850> bit

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
knife to wedge this open a little bit

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.069 
knife to wedge this open a little bit
but<00:03:26.859> slowly<00:03:27.859> push<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.519> into<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:29.120> cut<00:03:29.930> that

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
but slowly push this into the cut that

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.680 
but slowly push this into the cut that
you've<00:03:30.260> made<00:03:30.530> in<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:31.310> rootstock<00:03:32.060> which<00:03:32.540> is

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
you've made in the rootstock which is

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.960 
you've made in the rootstock which is
the<00:03:32.840> term<00:03:33.079> for<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:34.160> tree<00:03:34.459> that<00:03:34.760> you're

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
the term for the tree that you're

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.920 
the term for the tree that you're
cutting<00:03:35.239> you're<00:03:35.799> graphing<00:03:36.799> on<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.780> so<00:03:38.780> once

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
cutting you're graphing on to so once

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.069 
cutting you're graphing on to so once
you<00:03:39.049> have<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.350> nice<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.530> wedged<00:03:39.889> in<00:03:40.130> there

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
you have it nice and wedged in there

everything nice and tight you pull that

everything nice and tight you pull that
through<00:04:52.580> and<00:04:53.580> tug<00:04:53.880> on<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.919> there<00:04:55.919> we<00:04:56.039> go<00:04:56.220> we

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
through and tug on it there we go we

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.029 
through and tug on it there we go we
should<00:04:56.819> be<00:04:57.150> good<00:04:57.300> in<00:04:57.449> teep<00:04:57.660> now<00:04:59.690> and<00:05:00.800> you<00:05:01.800> want

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
should be good in teep now and you want

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.180 
should be good in teep now and you want
to<00:05:02.250> watch<00:05:02.520> this<00:05:02.880> as<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.630> starts<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.080> heal<00:05:04.410> it

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
to watch this as it starts to heal it

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.640 
to watch this as it starts to heal it
will<00:05:05.490> bulge<00:05:06.360> out<00:05:06.599> a<00:05:06.630> little<00:05:06.840> bit<00:05:07.050> in<00:05:07.169> about<00:05:07.349> six

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
will bulge out a little bit in about six

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.960 
will bulge out a little bit in about six
to<00:05:07.710> eight<00:05:07.830> weeks<00:05:08.130> and<00:05:08.310> all<00:05:08.460> you'll<00:05:08.669> do<00:05:08.820> is<00:05:08.940> run

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
to eight weeks and all you'll do is run

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.450 
to eight weeks and all you'll do is run
carefully<00:05:09.840> cut<00:05:10.050> this<00:05:10.199> tape<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:10.830> just<00:05:11.160> let<00:05:11.310> it

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
carefully cut this tape and just let it

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.310 
carefully cut this tape and just let it
fall<00:05:11.639> off<00:05:11.849> in<00:05:12.030> there<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.419> tree<00:05:12.780> will<00:05:12.930> take<00:05:13.110> it

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
fall off in there the tree will take it

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.430 
fall off in there the tree will take it
on<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.930> grafting<00:05:16.470> will<00:05:16.590> heal<00:05:16.830> itself<00:05:18.380> so<00:05:19.380> the

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
on the grafting will heal itself so the

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.529 
on the grafting will heal itself so the
next<00:05:19.620> step<00:05:19.800> is<00:05:19.949> a<00:05:19.979> isn't<00:05:20.370> wax<00:05:20.699> so<00:05:21.180> this<00:05:21.360> is

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
next step is a isn't wax so this is

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.230 
next step is a isn't wax so this is
actually<00:05:21.900> grafting<00:05:22.409> wax<00:05:22.440> of<00:05:22.949> my<00:05:23.580> seen<00:05:23.909> lots<00:05:24.120> of

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
actually grafting wax of my seen lots of

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.110 
actually grafting wax of my seen lots of
people<00:05:24.300> use<00:05:24.690> other<00:05:24.930> things<00:05:25.250> but<00:05:26.250> we<00:05:26.849> figured

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
people use other things but we figured

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.990 
people use other things but we figured
we<00:05:27.240> would<00:05:27.659> stick<00:05:27.990> with<00:05:28.020> this<00:05:28.289> one<00:05:28.819> you<00:05:29.819> don't

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
we would stick with this one you don't

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.760 
we would stick with this one you don't
need<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.210> whole<00:05:30.599> ton<00:05:30.930> but<00:05:31.110> what<00:05:31.289> you<00:05:31.409> want<00:05:31.590> to<00:05:31.650> do

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
need a whole ton but what you want to do

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.689 
need a whole ton but what you want to do
is<00:05:31.919> you<00:05:32.039> want<00:05:32.220> to<00:05:32.720> cover<00:05:33.720> any<00:05:34.080> of<00:05:34.409> the<00:05:34.889> open

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
is you want to cover any of the open

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.860 
is you want to cover any of the open
areas<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:37.909> elements<00:05:38.909> to<00:05:39.180> prevent<00:05:39.509> disease

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
areas to the elements to prevent disease

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.040 
areas to the elements to prevent disease
and<00:05:40.289> decay<00:05:40.889> from<00:05:41.400> setting<00:05:41.759> in<00:05:41.880> so<00:05:42.690> we'll<00:05:42.810> just

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
and decay from setting in so we'll just

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.659 
and decay from setting in so we'll just
make<00:05:43.259> sure<00:05:43.289> that<00:05:43.469> it's<00:05:43.770> got<00:05:43.889> a<00:05:43.949> nice<00:05:44.159> clean

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
make sure that it's got a nice clean

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.820 
make sure that it's got a nice clean
seal<00:05:45.150> on<00:05:45.389> there<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:47.539> that<00:05:48.539> should<00:05:48.870> be<00:05:49.020> it<00:05:49.110> so

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
seal on there and that should be it so

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.469 
seal on there and that should be it so
we'll<00:05:50.130> leave<00:05:50.250> this<00:05:50.490> for<00:05:50.820> a<00:05:50.849> couple<00:05:51.150> of<00:05:51.240> weeks

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
we'll leave this for a couple of weeks

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.339 
we'll leave this for a couple of weeks
and<00:05:51.949> we'll<00:05:52.949> come<00:05:53.159> back<00:05:53.370> and<00:05:53.750> check<00:05:54.750> up<00:05:54.930> on<00:05:55.080> it

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
and we'll come back and check up on it

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:56.959 
and we'll come back and check up on it
we're<00:05:55.919> gonna<00:05:56.039> go<00:05:56.280> ahead<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:56.669> do<00:05:56.729> a<00:05:56.759> couple

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:56.969 
we're gonna go ahead and do a couple

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:00.050 
we're gonna go ahead and do a couple
more<00:05:57.270> graphs<00:05:57.570> we've<00:05:57.930> got<00:05:58.169> this<00:05:59.039> is<00:05:59.250> a<00:05:59.280> spicy

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
more graphs we've got this is a spicy

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.969 
more graphs we've got this is a spicy
pear<00:06:00.479> we've<00:06:01.050> got<00:06:01.199> two<00:06:01.380> different<00:06:01.469> types<00:06:01.680> of

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
pear we've got two different types of

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.379 
pear we've got two different types of
apples<00:06:02.280> we're<00:06:02.430> gonna<00:06:02.520> see<00:06:02.759> if<00:06:02.849> we<00:06:02.909> can't<00:06:03.180> get

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
apples we're gonna see if we can't get

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.850 
apples we're gonna see if we can't get
some<00:06:04.349> of<00:06:04.380> them<00:06:04.620> to<00:06:04.770> take<00:06:05.520> to<00:06:05.669> this<00:06:05.789> root<00:06:06.060> stock

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
some of them to take to this root stock

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.890 
some of them to take to this root stock
so<00:06:07.860> it's<00:06:08.009> important<00:06:08.370> to<00:06:08.400> mark<00:06:08.639> and<00:06:09.030> just

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
so it's important to mark and just

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.330 
so it's important to mark and just
flagging<00:06:10.199> tape<00:06:10.380> will<00:06:10.680> do<00:06:10.800> and<00:06:10.979> all<00:06:11.070> you<00:06:11.190> want

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
flagging tape will do and all you want

flagging tape will do and all you want
to<00:06:11.430> do<00:06:11.520> is<00:06:11.669> lightly<00:06:12.060> put<00:06:12.240> it<00:06:12.330> below<00:06:12.509> the<00:06:12.750> graph

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
to do is lightly put it below the graph

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.189 
to do is lightly put it below the graph
point<00:06:13.380> and<00:06:13.620> tie<00:06:14.280> it<00:06:14.340> on<00:06:14.639> so<00:06:14.940> we've<00:06:15.090> tied<00:06:15.330> on<00:06:15.599> the

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
point and tie it on so we've tied on the

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.560 
point and tie it on so we've tied on the

Apple and this is the m36 t-bone is just

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.680 
Apple and this is the m36 t-bone is just
to<00:06:23.310> make<00:06:23.639> sure<00:06:23.669> that<00:06:23.940> you<00:06:24.090> remember<00:06:24.360> which

to make sure that you remember which
variety<00:06:25.620> is<00:06:25.710> you're<00:06:25.889> attaching<00:06:26.340> where<00:06:26.550> and<00:06:26.820> it

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:27.509 
variety is you're attaching where and it

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:28.909 
variety is you're attaching where and it
also<00:06:27.690> helps<00:06:28.080> you<00:06:28.229> keep<00:06:28.469> your<00:06:28.680> head<00:06:28.800> from

also helps you keep your head from

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:30.320 
also helps you keep your head from
knocking<00:06:29.159> them<00:06:29.460> over<00:06:29.550> the<00:06:29.759> next<00:06:29.940> six<00:06:30.180> to<00:06:30.210> eight

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
knocking them over the next six to eight

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.510 
knocking them over the next six to eight
weeks<00:06:30.659> so<00:06:31.259> just<00:06:31.530> to<00:06:31.650> recap<00:06:31.979> what<00:06:32.009> we've<00:06:32.310> done

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
weeks so just to recap what we've done

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.850 
weeks so just to recap what we've done
is<00:06:32.759> we've<00:06:33.509> taken<00:06:34.760> scions<00:06:35.760> in<00:06:36.270> early<00:06:36.930> spring

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
is we've taken scions in early spring

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.340 
is we've taken scions in early spring
from<00:06:38.669> the<00:06:39.060> varieties<00:06:39.630> we<00:06:39.839> want

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
from the varieties we want

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.370 
from the varieties we want
we've<00:06:41.450> put<00:06:42.450> those<00:06:42.570> in<00:06:42.720> the<00:06:42.810> fridge<00:06:42.960> we<00:06:43.200> cut

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
we've put those in the fridge we cut

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.230 
we've put those in the fridge we cut
kind<00:06:43.920> of<00:06:44.070> a<00:06:44.100> couple<00:06:44.340> inch<00:06:44.460> sections<00:06:44.910> of<00:06:45.090> them

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
kind of a couple inch sections of them

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.580 
kind of a couple inch sections of them
put<00:06:45.420> them<00:06:45.540> in<00:06:45.630> the<00:06:45.720> fridge<00:06:45.900> with<00:06:46.200> a<00:06:46.230> little<00:06:46.500> bit

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
put them in the fridge with a little bit

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.130 
put them in the fridge with a little bit
of<00:06:46.620> water<00:06:46.860> kept<00:06:47.220> them<00:06:47.430> dormant<00:06:48.060> we<00:06:48.750> took<00:06:48.930> them

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
of water kept them dormant we took them

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.800 
of water kept them dormant we took them
out<00:06:49.260> when<00:06:49.470> the<00:06:49.910> rootstock<00:06:50.910> so<00:06:51.360> the<00:06:51.450> tree<00:06:51.630> we're

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
out when the rootstock so the tree we're

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.850 
out when the rootstock so the tree we're
grafting<00:06:52.350> these<00:06:52.470> on<00:06:52.680> was<00:06:53.310> starting<00:06:54.180> to<00:06:54.330> bud<00:06:54.860> we

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
grafting these on was starting to bud we

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.380 
grafting these on was starting to bud we
did<00:06:56.130> a<00:06:56.160> cleft<00:06:56.460> graft<00:06:56.550> there's<00:06:56.880> many<00:06:57.060> different

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390 
did a cleft graft there's many different

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.700 
did a cleft graft there's many different
types<00:06:57.540> of<00:06:57.660> graphs<00:06:57.840> but<00:06:58.080> this<00:06:58.230> one<00:06:58.410> seemed<00:06:58.620> the

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
types of graphs but this one seemed the

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.010 
types of graphs but this one seemed the
simplest<00:06:59.190> for<00:06:59.400> the<00:06:59.490> beginner<00:06:59.790> we<00:07:00.570> taped<00:07:00.870> them

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
simplest for the beginner we taped them

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.920 
simplest for the beginner we taped them
really<00:07:01.260> nicely<00:07:01.470> we<00:07:01.830> put<00:07:02.270> grafting<00:07:03.270> wax<00:07:03.300> on<00:07:03.780> the

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
really nicely we put grafting wax on the

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.210 
really nicely we put grafting wax on the
end<00:07:04.050> there's<00:07:04.230> all<00:07:04.590> sorts<00:07:04.860> of<00:07:04.920> different

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
end there's all sorts of different

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.620 
end there's all sorts of different
products<00:07:05.520> that<00:07:05.700> can<00:07:05.820> do<00:07:06.000> this<00:07:06.150> is<00:07:06.300> just<00:07:06.540> to

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
products that can do this is just to

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.270 
products that can do this is just to
keep<00:07:06.750> the<00:07:06.900> water<00:07:07.050> out<00:07:07.230> and<00:07:07.500> we've<00:07:08.010> labeled

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
keep the water out and we've labeled

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.850 
keep the water out and we've labeled
them<00:07:08.640> so<00:07:09.060> now<00:07:09.210> it's<00:07:09.660> time<00:07:09.900> to<00:07:09.930> wait<00:07:10.200> six<00:07:10.800> to

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 
them so now it's time to wait six to

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.050 
them so now it's time to wait six to
eight<00:07:11.010> weeks<00:07:11.280> we'll<00:07:11.490> know<00:07:11.640> if<00:07:11.760> this<00:07:11.910> has

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 
eight weeks we'll know if this has

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.990 
eight weeks we'll know if this has
really<00:07:12.270> taken<00:07:12.420> off<00:07:12.660> or<00:07:12.870> not<00:07:13.790> thank<00:07:14.790> you<00:07:14.880> very
