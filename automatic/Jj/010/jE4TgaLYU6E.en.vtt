particular grips are designed for ATV
use<00:00:20.070> only<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.090> reason<00:00:21.359> why<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.810> because

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
use only and the reason why is because

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.870 
use only and the reason why is because
both<00:00:22.590> grips<00:00:22.890> are<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.039> exact<00:00:23.310> same<00:00:23.340> sides<00:00:23.730> in

both grips are the exact same sides in
the<00:00:23.939> middle<00:00:24.180> which<00:00:24.779> means<00:00:24.990> they're<00:00:25.199> not

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
the middle which means they're not

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.410 
the middle which means they're not
designed<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> go<00:00:26.010> over<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> throttle<00:00:26.699> tube<00:00:26.880> so
