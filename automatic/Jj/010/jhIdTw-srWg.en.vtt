just<00:01:41.579> kind<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.630> making<00:01:43.619> things<00:01:44.009> as<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.369> go

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
just kind of making things as you go

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.730 
just kind of making things as you go
along<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.270> crop<00:01:46.140> circle<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.680> you

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
along like this crop circle that you

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.450 
along like this crop circle that you
have<00:01:47.130> probably<00:01:47.549> seen<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:48.000> other<00:01:48.149> videos<00:01:49.460> we

have probably seen in my other videos we

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.950 
have probably seen in my other videos we
have<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> culprit<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.659> crop

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
have to have a culprit for the crop

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.620 
have to have a culprit for the crop
circle<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.979> we've<00:01:53.280> got<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.640> UFO<00:01:54.060> over<00:01:54.090> here

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
scale to it but it's really cool just

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.990 
scale to it but it's really cool just
takes<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.990> little<00:02:18.110> bit<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.380> wiring<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.000> just

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
takes a little bit of wiring and just

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.820 
takes a little bit of wiring and just
for<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.180> more<00:02:20.540> dramatic<00:02:20.660> effect<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:21.380> threw<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.590> cow

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
for a more dramatic effect I threw a cow

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.610 
for a more dramatic effect I threw a cow
under<00:02:22.160> their<00:02:22.310> little<00:02:22.550> tractor<00:02:23.120> beam<00:02:23.620> because

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
under their little tractor beam because

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.900 
under their little tractor beam because
they're<00:02:24.770> going<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.950> be<00:02:25.040> doing<00:02:25.370> some<00:02:25.640> cow

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
they're going to be doing some cow

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.510 
they're going to be doing some cow
experiments<00:02:26.690> here<00:02:26.840> later<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:28.070> there's<00:02:28.340> my

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
experiments here later so there's my

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.330 
experiments here later so there's my
culprit<00:02:28.910> for<00:02:29.150> my<00:02:29.330> crop<00:02:29.960> circles<00:02:30.440> I've<00:02:31.040> already

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
culprit for my crop circles I've already

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.340 
culprit for my crop circles I've already
showed<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.730> how<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:31.970> tilled<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.510> Phils<00:02:32.870> here

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
showed you how I tilled the Phils here

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.670 
showed you how I tilled the Phils here
and<00:02:33.560> made<00:02:33.860> little<00:02:34.330> lines<00:02:35.330> in<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.720> fields<00:02:36.170> I've

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
and made little lines in the fields I've

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.800 
and made little lines in the fields I've
also<00:02:36.920> picked<00:02:37.250> up<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.580> few<00:02:37.610> engines<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.540> other

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.130 
prototypical with the only one that's
accurate<00:03:14.209> but<00:03:14.390> it<00:03:14.480> does<00:03:14.660> have<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.959> correct

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
looks way more destroyed and I just like

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.039 
looks way more destroyed and I just like
the<00:03:21.680> clean<00:03:21.950> look<00:03:22.160> of<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:23.060> locomotive<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.870> may

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
the clean look of a locomotive and I may

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.199 
the clean look of a locomotive and I may
get<00:03:24.230> into<00:03:24.380> weathering<00:03:24.860> and<00:03:25.010> graffiti<00:03:25.700> later

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
get into weathering and graffiti later

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.340 
get into weathering and graffiti later
but<00:03:26.510> not<00:03:26.660> right<00:03:26.720> now

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.330 
there sparsely I won't do a review on it
because<00:03:35.959> you're<00:03:36.170> not<00:03:36.230> going<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.500> like<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.680> but

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
because you're not going to like it but

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.000 
because you're not going to like it but
I<00:03:37.370> highly<00:03:37.910> suggest<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:39.350> if<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.680> get<00:03:39.860> this

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
I highly suggest that if you get this

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.190 
I highly suggest that if you get this
Wine<00:03:40.250> Train<00:03:40.549> Set<00:03:40.820> you<00:03:41.150> expect<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.870> do<00:03:42.019> some

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
Wine Train Set you expect to do some

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.350 
Wine Train Set you expect to do some
tweaking<00:03:42.350> because<00:03:43.040> these<00:03:43.220> cars<00:03:43.549> derail<00:03:44.060> like

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
tweaking because these cars derail like

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.110 
tweaking because these cars derail like
nobody's<00:03:44.780> business<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:46.340> that's<00:03:46.580> some<00:03:46.850> extra

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
nobody's business so that's some extra

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.270 
nobody's business so that's some extra
rolling<00:03:47.450> stock<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.870> picked<00:03:48.140> up<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:48.769> you<00:03:49.130> can

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
rolling stock I picked up and you can

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.160 
rolling stock I picked up and you can
see<00:03:49.489> some<00:03:49.760> of<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.940> other<00:03:50.090> farmland<00:03:50.840> stuff

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
see some of the other farmland stuff

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.440 
see some of the other farmland stuff
that<00:03:51.350> I've<00:03:51.470> done<00:03:51.500> here<00:03:52.160> I've<00:03:52.700> still<00:03:53.060> got<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.209> lot

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
that I've done here I've still got a lot

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.630 
that I've done here I've still got a lot
to<00:03:53.690> do<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.900> lot<00:03:54.320> to<00:03:54.470> bring<00:03:54.739> up<00:03:54.890> out<00:03:55.070> of<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.310> soil

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
to do a lot to bring up out of the soil

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.250 
to do a lot to bring up out of the soil
and<00:03:56.030> make<00:03:56.120> three-dimensional<00:03:57.549> because<00:03:58.549> this

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
and make three-dimensional because this

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.530 
and make three-dimensional because this
the<00:04:00.260> way<00:04:00.410> it<00:04:00.560> is<00:04:00.680> over<00:04:00.980> here<00:04:01.400> works<00:04:02.000> good<00:04:02.299> if

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
the way it is over here works good if

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.410 
the way it is over here works good if
you're<00:04:02.690> like<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.049> 20<00:04:03.440> or<00:04:03.590> 30,000<00:04:04.250> scale<00:04:05.060> feet

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
you're like a 20 or 30,000 scale feet

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.210 
you're like a 20 or 30,000 scale feet
view<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:06.290> you're<00:04:06.380> looking<00:04:06.650> from<00:04:06.769> an<00:04:06.920> airplane

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.220 
view and you're looking from an airplane
this<00:04:07.489> is<00:04:07.549> how<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.790> field<00:04:08.090> looks<00:04:08.360> but<00:04:08.930> we're<00:04:09.079> down

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
this is how a field looks but we're down

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.970 
this is how a field looks but we're down
here<00:04:09.290> almost<00:04:09.680> on<00:04:09.950> ground<00:04:10.250> level<00:04:10.340> with<00:04:11.239> these

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
here almost on ground level with these

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.440 
here almost on ground level with these
locomotives<00:04:12.980> running<00:04:13.340> by<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:14.120> we<00:04:14.299> need

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
locomotives running by and we need

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.240 
locomotives running by and we need
three-dimensional<00:04:15.380> things<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.769> come<00:04:15.950> up<00:04:16.100> out

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
three-dimensional things to come up out

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.469 
three-dimensional things to come up out
of<00:04:16.370> these<00:04:16.430> fields<00:04:16.850> so<00:04:17.000> I've<00:04:17.090> got<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.269> lot<00:04:17.419> of

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
of these fields so I've got a lot of

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.420 
of these fields so I've got a lot of
work<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.900> do<00:04:18.049> if<00:04:18.260> they're<00:04:18.919> a<00:04:18.950> plowed<00:04:19.400> field

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
work to do if they're a plowed field

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.610 
work to do if they're a plowed field
that's<00:04:20.000> fine<00:04:20.209> they<00:04:20.359> can<00:04:20.510> be<00:04:20.630> flat<00:04:20.900> but<00:04:21.140> if

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
that's fine they can be flat but if

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.990 
that's fine they can be flat but if
they're

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
they're

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.760 
they're
to<00:04:22.210> have<00:04:22.360> things<00:04:22.630> going<00:04:22.810> on<00:04:23.020> I'm<00:04:23.440> going<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.710> be

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
to have things going on I'm going to be

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.380 
to have things going on I'm going to be
putting<00:04:24.040> corn<00:04:24.280> stock<00:04:24.550> sweet<00:04:24.880> things<00:04:25.210> like

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
putting corn stock sweet things like

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.330 
putting corn stock sweet things like
that<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.750> make<00:04:25.930> it<00:04:25.990> come<00:04:26.890> up<00:04:27.040> out<00:04:27.190> of<00:04:27.280> the

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
that to make it come up out of the

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.300 
that to make it come up out of the
ground<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:28.540> those<00:04:28.750> are<00:04:28.900> just<00:04:29.020> some<00:04:29.200> ideas<00:04:29.310> for
