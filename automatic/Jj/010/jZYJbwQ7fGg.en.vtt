obviously a little aggressive you as you
can<00:01:32.930> see<00:01:33.110> here<00:01:33.730> but<00:01:34.730> at<00:01:35.150> any<00:01:35.420> rate<00:01:35.650> the<00:01:36.650> biggest

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
can see here but at any rate the biggest

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.340 
can see here but at any rate the biggest
tip<00:01:37.160> I<00:01:37.280> can<00:01:37.310> give<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.760> is<00:01:37.790> when<00:01:38.690> you<00:01:38.840> see<00:01:39.080> for

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
tip I can give you is when you see for

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.700 
tip I can give you is when you see for
the<00:01:39.440> four<00:01:39.970> corners<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.470> building<00:01:42.470> on<00:01:42.590> the

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
the four corners of the building on the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.649 
the four corners of the building on the
bottom<00:01:43.100> make<00:01:43.730> sure<00:01:43.970> that<00:01:44.150> you<00:01:44.240> plant<00:01:44.510> them

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
bottom make sure that you plant them

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.170 
bottom make sure that you plant them
from<00:01:44.900> your<00:01:45.020> shoulders<00:01:45.260> and<00:01:45.710> up<00:01:46.460> this<00:01:46.909> high<00:01:47.150> up

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
from your shoulders and up this high up

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.120 
from your shoulders and up this high up
maybe<00:01:47.659> into<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:47.960> ceiling<00:01:48.170> as<00:01:48.350> possible<00:01:48.920> so

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
maybe into the ceiling as possible so

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.970 
maybe into the ceiling as possible so
that<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:50.180> idea<00:01:50.510> is<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.720> blow<00:01:51.320> out<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.590> joints

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
that the idea is to blow out the joints

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.740 
that the idea is to blow out the joints
in<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.190> building<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.120> building<00:01:53.420> will<00:01:53.540> come

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
in the building the building will come

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.780 
in the building the building will come
down<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.440> can<00:01:54.590> see<00:01:54.620> here<00:01:54.980> at<00:01:55.100> God<00:01:55.250> obviously

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
down you can see here at God obviously

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.680 
down you can see here at God obviously
one<00:01:56.290> kill<00:01:57.290> at<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.190> destruction<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:58.909> point<00:01:59.210> o<00:01:59.390> out

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
one kill at a destruction to point o out

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.780 
one kill at a destruction to point o out
of<00:01:59.720> it<00:02:00.050> so<00:02:00.320> at<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.830> very<00:02:00.860> least<00:02:01.070> if<00:02:01.490> there<00:02:01.670> was

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
of it so at the very least if there was
