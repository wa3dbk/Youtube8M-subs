just<00:01:15.380> leave<00:01:15.530> it<00:01:15.560> in<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.830> styrofoam<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:17.140> I

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
just leave it in the styrofoam and I

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.740 
just leave it in the styrofoam and I
used<00:01:18.350> some<00:01:18.500> epoxy<00:01:19.040> to<00:01:19.190> glue<00:01:19.220> it<00:01:19.520> in<00:01:19.670> place<00:01:19.750> and

used some epoxy to glue it in place and

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.080 
used some epoxy to glue it in place and
it's<00:01:20.930> not<00:01:21.050> going<00:01:21.320> anywhere<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:24.430> then<00:01:25.430> here<00:01:25.940> we
