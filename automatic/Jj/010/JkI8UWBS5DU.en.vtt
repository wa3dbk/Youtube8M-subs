battle I'm surprised we got a I mean

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.180 
battle I'm surprised we got a I mean
that<00:03:05.220> was<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.460> really<00:03:05.580> tough<00:03:06.150> battle<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:07.290> that

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
that was a really tough battle so that

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.560 
that was a really tough battle so that
was<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.560> matching<00:03:10.560> Buu<00:03:10.830> saga<00:03:11.270> playing<00:03:12.270> as<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
was the matching Buu saga playing as the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.410 
was the matching Buu saga playing as the
enemy<00:03:13.320> or<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.590> villain<00:03:14.070> character<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:14.880> we

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
enemy or the villain character and we

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:26.300 
enemy or the villain character and we
got<00:03:15.720> Super<00:03:16.230> Saiyan<00:03:16.560> 2<00:03:17.070> Vegeta<00:03:24.980> alright<00:03:25.980> so<00:03:26.280> I

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
got Super Saiyan 2 Vegeta alright so I

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.160 
got Super Saiyan 2 Vegeta alright so I
think<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.030> pretty<00:03:27.209> much<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.780> for<00:03:27.840> this

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
think that is pretty much it for this

think that is pretty much it for this
saga<00:03:29.209> but<00:03:30.209> that<00:03:30.450> was<00:03:30.720> definitely<00:03:31.440> one<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.739> the
