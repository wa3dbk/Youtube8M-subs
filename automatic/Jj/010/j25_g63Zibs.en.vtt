basically all you're gonna do is install

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.840 
basically all you're gonna do is install
LogMeIn<00:00:24.360> hamachi<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:25.369> we're<00:00:26.369> gonna<00:00:26.520> do<00:00:26.700> is

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
LogMeIn hamachi and we're gonna do is

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.700 
LogMeIn hamachi and we're gonna do is
create<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.270> new<00:00:27.390> network<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:28.290> you're<00:00:28.590> gonna

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
create a new network if you're gonna

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.620 
create a new network if you're gonna
actually<00:00:29.040> make<00:00:29.250> your<00:00:29.400> own<00:00:29.460> server<00:00:29.910> or<00:00:30.210> you're

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
actually make your own server or you're

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.990 
actually make your own server or you're
gonna<00:00:30.720> join<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.020> network<00:00:31.200> you<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:32.310> join<00:00:32.640> from

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
gonna join a network you just join from

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.310 
gonna join a network you just join from
Weber<00:00:33.270> I'm<00:00:33.930> gonna<00:00:34.079> create<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.380> network<00:00:34.739> called

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.790 

Colossus<00:00:40.320> password<00:00:41.280> we'll<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.270> leave<00:00:42.390> it

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
Colossus password we'll just leave it

00:00:42.800 --> 00:01:15.710 
Colossus password we'll just leave it
well<00:00:43.910> with<00:00:44.910> one<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.300> one<00:01:11.420> IP<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:14.360> of<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
well with one one one IP of the of the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.080 
well with one one one IP of the of the
server<00:01:15.930> host<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:17.490> basically<00:01:17.820> you're<00:01:18.030> just

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
server host so basically you're just

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.960 
server host so basically you're just
going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:19.100> connect<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.730> basically

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
going to connect to that and basically

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.770 
going to connect to that and basically
all<00:01:21.240> your<00:01:21.420> friends<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.840> play<00:01:23.780> there's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
all your friends can play there's

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.250 
all your friends can play there's
nothing<00:01:25.110> much<00:01:25.470> more<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:26.159> than<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:27.260> it's

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
nothing much more to do than that it's

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.590 
nothing much more to do than that it's
then<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.220> have<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.550> join<00:01:29.760> an<00:01:29.909> existing<00:01:30.390> work

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
then you have to join an existing work

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.010 
then you have to join an existing work
network<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:32.720> don't<00:01:33.720> know<00:01:35.450> can<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.780> join

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
network I don't know can you just join

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.230 
network I don't know can you just join
the<00:01:37.110> password<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:38.190> they<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.729> set<00:01:39.180> up

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the password and if they have it set up

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
the password and if they have it set up
correctly<00:01:40.130> you'll<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.310> able<00:01:41.370> to<00:01:41.520> log<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:42.950> let's

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
correctly you'll be able to log in let's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.560 
correctly you'll be able to log in let's
see<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:46.280> we<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.549> run<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:47.880> server<00:01:48.120> first

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.510 

this<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> use<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.350> tutorial<00:01:53.070> before

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
this is the one I use in tutorial before

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:10.759 
this is the one I use in tutorial before
like<00:01:54.479> ten<00:01:54.690> minutes<00:01:54.930> ago<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:58.140> let's<00:02:09.769> it's

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
like ten minutes ago so let's it's

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.410 
like ten minutes ago so let's it's
lagging<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.159> bit<00:02:11.189> because<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:11.849> replace<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
lagging a bit because I just replace the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.440 
lagging a bit because I just replace the
worlds<00:02:12.900> like<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.580> world<00:02:14.819> for<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.299> was

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
worlds like so the world for this was

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.990 
worlds like so the world for this was
lagging<00:02:15.659> a<00:02:15.840> bit<00:02:16.489> but<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.640> doesn't<00:02:17.909> usually

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
lagging a bit but it doesn't usually

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.760 
lagging a bit but it doesn't usually
it's<00:02:18.269> also<00:02:18.420> cuz<00:02:19.049> I'm<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.230> recording<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.340> I

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
it's also cuz I'm like recording so I

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.410 
it's also cuz I'm like recording so I
was<00:02:22.770> generating<00:02:23.430> stuff<00:02:23.760> at<00:02:23.940> so

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
was generating stuff at so

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.100 
was generating stuff at so
that's<00:02:25.930> basically<00:02:26.230> just<00:02:26.680> how<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:28.080> how<00:02:29.080> to

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
that's basically just how to how to

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.740 
that's basically just how to how to
connect<00:02:29.500> your<00:02:29.590> hamachi<00:02:30.360> how<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.420> connect

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
connect your hamachi how to connect

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.210 
connect your hamachi how to connect
hamachi<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.560> your<00:02:34.380> it's<00:02:35.380> your<00:02:35.470> server

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
hamachi to your it's your server

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.420 
hamachi to your it's your server
that's<00:02:36.700> offline<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.810> know<00:02:38.430> that's
