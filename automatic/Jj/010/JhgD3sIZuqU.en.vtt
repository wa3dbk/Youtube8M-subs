primarily because we're trying a lot of
new<00:00:26.070> things<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.519> scrims<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.269> know<00:00:27.359> we're

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
new things in scrims you know we're

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.450 
new things in scrims you know we're
pretty<00:00:28.380> much<00:00:28.529> splitting<00:00:28.949> how<00:00:29.039> far<00:00:29.220> screams

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
pretty much splitting how far screams

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.980 
pretty much splitting how far screams
with<00:00:29.609> Keith<00:00:29.820> halfer<00:00:30.179> screams<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.570> turtle<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
with Keith halfer screams of turtle and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.479 
with Keith halfer screams of turtle and
we're<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:31.920> trying<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.130> figure<00:00:32.250> out<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
we're just trying to figure out the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
are expected because we've already

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.709 
are expected because we've already

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.580 
in orchha like you know run my
organization<00:04:51.750> down<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:51.960> ground<00:04:52.170> but<00:04:52.320> i<00:04:52.380> think

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
organization down the ground but i think

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.210 
organization down the ground but i think
the<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:52.890> hardest<00:04:53.610> part<00:04:53.790> really<00:04:54.090> is<00:04:54.210> um

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
the the hardest part really is um

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.070 
the the hardest part really is um
benching<00:04:56.220> a<00:04:56.310> player<00:04:56.490> once<00:04:57.150> primarily<00:04:57.990> because

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
benching a player once primarily because

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.160 
benching a player once primarily because
I<00:04:58.260> came<00:04:58.710> from<00:04:58.980> a<00:04:59.130> player<00:04:59.310> and<00:04:59.580> we<00:05:00.240> had<00:05:00.570> really

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
I came from a player and we had really

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.750 
I came from a player and we had really
deep<00:05:01.350> emotional<00:05:01.710> ties<00:05:01.920> with<00:05:02.100> pliers<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.580> so

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
deep emotional ties with pliers and so

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.640 
deep emotional ties with pliers and so
it's<00:05:03.270> really<00:05:03.600> hard<00:05:03.930> when<00:05:04.050> you<00:05:04.290> have<00:05:04.380> to<00:05:04.470> tell

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
it's really hard when you have to tell

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.370 
it's really hard when you have to tell
someone<00:05:04.680> like<00:05:05.310> hey<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:06.060> know<00:05:06.210> how<00:05:07.200> you're

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
someone like hey you know how you're

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.440 
someone like hey you know how you're
performing<00:05:07.500> just<00:05:08.130> isn't<00:05:08.430> this<00:05:08.940> isn't<00:05:09.180> cutting

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
performing just isn't this isn't cutting

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.910 
performing just isn't this isn't cutting
it<00:05:09.600> I<00:05:09.840> think<00:05:10.200> that's<00:05:10.380> really<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.740> hardest

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
it I think that's really the hardest

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.500 
it I think that's really the hardest
part<00:05:11.280> primarily<00:05:11.880> because<00:05:11.970> you<00:05:12.300> know<00:05:12.390> we're

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
part primarily because you know we're

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.570 
part primarily because you know we're
spending<00:05:12.720> like<00:05:12.960> 10<00:05:13.140> to<00:05:13.200> 12<00:05:13.380> hours<00:05:13.500> with<00:05:14.280> every

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
spending like 10 to 12 hours with every

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.450 
spending like 10 to 12 hours with every
single<00:05:14.730> player<00:05:15.030> every<00:05:15.690> day<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:16.310> at<00:05:17.310> that

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
single player every day and at that

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.890 
single player every day and at that
point<00:05:17.670> we're<00:05:17.940> more<00:05:18.150> than<00:05:18.180> just<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.810> know

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
point we're more than just you know

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.180 
point we're more than just you know
co-workers<00:05:19.500> we're<00:05:20.070> friends<00:05:20.670> and<00:05:20.850> so<00:05:21.120> it

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
co-workers we're friends and so it

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.230 
co-workers we're friends and so it
that's<00:05:23.190> just<00:05:23.310> definitely<00:05:23.730> the<00:05:23.820> hardest<00:05:23.940> part

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
that's just definitely the hardest part

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.090 
that's just definitely the hardest part

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
versus a higher performance so we don't

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.820 
versus a higher performance so we don't
need<00:06:53.160> to<00:06:54.160> change<00:06:54.460> out<00:06:54.610> any<00:06:55.410> pires<00:06:56.410> right<00:06:56.710> now
