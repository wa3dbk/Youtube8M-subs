and do the same thing on the other side

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.800 
and do the same thing on the other side
so<00:02:26.560> start<00:02:26.770> at<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.920> temple<00:02:27.420> take<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.600> little

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
so start at the temple take this little

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.640 
so start at the temple take this little
triangle<00:02:29.110> section<00:02:29.560> up<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.010> top<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:32.260> begin

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
triangle section up to the top and begin

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:45.580 
triangle section up to the top and begin
your<00:02:32.770> braid

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.190 

and<00:02:45.770> then<00:02:46.700> split<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.060> into<00:02:47.180> two<00:02:47.480> sections<00:02:47.750> and

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
and then split it into two sections and

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.320 
and then split it into two sections and
fishtail<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.130> just<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:49.850> case<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.150> aren't

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
fishtail and just in case you aren't

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.699 
fishtail and just in case you aren't
sure<00:02:50.390> how<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.720> fishtail<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.230> probably<00:02:51.500> should

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
sure how to fishtail I probably should

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.949 
sure how to fishtail I probably should
have<00:02:51.740> covered<00:02:52.100> this<00:02:52.220> earlier<00:02:52.400> all<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.450> do<00:02:53.690> is

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
have covered this earlier all you do is

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.630 
have covered this earlier all you do is
you<00:02:54.080> split<00:02:54.350> it<00:02:54.440> into<00:02:54.620> two<00:02:54.920> sections<00:02:55.190> and

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
you split it into two sections and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.150 
you split it into two sections and
you're<00:02:55.819> gonna<00:02:55.910> take<00:02:56.270> small<00:02:56.720> pieces<00:02:57.140> from<00:02:58.010> the

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
you're gonna take small pieces from the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.750 
you're gonna take small pieces from the
back<00:02:58.490> of<00:02:58.760> either<00:02:59.030> side<00:02:59.480> and<00:03:00.220> switch<00:03:01.220> sections

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
back of either side and switch sections

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.180 
back of either side and switch sections
so<00:03:02.750> you're<00:03:02.989> gonna<00:03:03.080> start<00:03:03.380> from<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.620> take<00:03:04.160> a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
so you're gonna start from the take a

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.570 
so you're gonna start from the take a
piece<00:03:04.459> from<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.790> back<00:03:04.989> put<00:03:05.989> it<00:03:06.080> over<00:03:06.520> take<00:03:07.520> a

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
piece from the back put it over take a

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.210 
piece from the back put it over take a

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
piece from the back put it over and just

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:23.890 
piece from the back put it over and just
work<00:03:13.489> your<00:03:13.700> way<00:03:13.880> down<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:15.410> hair<00:03:15.560> strands<00:03:22.900> this
