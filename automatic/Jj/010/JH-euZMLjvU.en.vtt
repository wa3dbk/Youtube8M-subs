00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.020 
get darker after you bleached it but
it's<00:02:15.780> been<00:02:15.930> happening<00:02:16.129> so<00:02:17.129> I<00:02:17.159> want<00:02:17.609> to<00:02:17.700> get<00:02:17.909> it

a<00:02:18.090> little<00:02:18.239> bit<00:02:18.540> blonder<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.049> bottom<00:02:19.409> and<00:02:19.650> I

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
a little bit blonder on the bottom and I

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.130
