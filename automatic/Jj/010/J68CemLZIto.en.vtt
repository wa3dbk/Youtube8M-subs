down<00:00:30.149> what<00:00:31.149> gun<00:00:31.359> I<00:00:31.630> feel<00:00:31.899> is<00:00:32.140> better<00:00:32.770> than<00:00:33.100> the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
down what gun I feel is better than the

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.400 
down what gun I feel is better than the
other<00:00:33.310> for<00:00:33.850> certain<00:00:34.270> parts<00:00:34.570> they<00:00:35.080> both<00:00:35.260> have

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
other for certain parts they both have

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.780 
other for certain parts they both have
their<00:00:35.530> strengths<00:00:35.860> and<00:00:35.980> weaknesses<00:00:36.400> but<00:00:36.610> there

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
their strengths and weaknesses but there

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.430 
their strengths and weaknesses but there
is<00:00:36.880> one<00:00:37.060> gun<00:00:37.330> that<00:00:37.570> I<00:00:37.720> feel<00:00:37.960> in<00:00:38.080> my<00:00:38.110> opinion

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
is one gun that I feel in my opinion

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.490 
is one gun that I feel in my opinion
clearly<00:00:39.100> goes<00:00:39.580> over<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.120> other<00:00:40.300> one<00:00:40.540> and<00:00:40.780> so

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
clearly goes over the other one and so

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.630 
clearly goes over the other one and so
I'm<00:00:41.620> going<00:00:41.770> to<00:00:41.800> start<00:00:41.980> off<00:00:42.070> with<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.250> service
