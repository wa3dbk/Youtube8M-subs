00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.840 
to be if you have a fairly bright
situation<00:02:25.200> it's<00:02:25.710> going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.980> focus<00:02:26.190> fairly

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
situation it's going to focus fairly

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.870 
situation it's going to focus fairly
quickly<00:02:27.090> not<00:02:27.810> super<00:02:28.380> fast<00:02:28.830> but<00:02:29.340> fairly

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
quickly not super fast but fairly

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.780 
quickly not super fast but fairly
quickly<00:02:30.360> as<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:31.500> get<00:02:31.710> into<00:02:31.860> low<00:02:32.130> light<00:02:32.400> it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
quickly as you get into low light it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.510 
quickly as you get into low light it
becomes<00:02:33.480> problematic<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.430> going

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
becomes problematic in that it's going

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.460 
becomes problematic in that it's going
to<00:02:35.610> sit<00:02:35.820> there<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.060> hunt<00:02:36.540> for<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> long<00:02:37.170> time

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
to sit there and hunt for a long time

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.410 
to sit there and hunt for a long time
because<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.280> really<00:02:38.610> needs<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.120> lot<00:02:39.390> of

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
because it really needs a lot of

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.230 
because it really needs a lot of
contrast<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.100> dark<00:02:41.370> environment<00:02:41.580> you

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
contrast so in a dark environment you

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.120 
contrast so in a dark environment you
don't<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.720> lot<00:02:43.020> of<00:02:43.050> contrast<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.010> it's

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
don't have a lot of contrast so it's

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.040 
don't have a lot of contrast so it's
going<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.310> fight<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:45.270> try<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.630> find<00:02:45.810> that

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
going to fight to try and find that

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.730 
going to fight to try and find that
focus<00:02:46.530> now<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.670> way<00:02:47.790> around<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.740> don't

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
focus now the way around that I don't

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.320 
focus now the way around that I don't
know<00:02:49.860> this<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.100> going<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.310> sound<00:02:50.430> odd<00:02:50.730> for<00:02:51.000> some

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
know this is going to sound odd for some

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.140 
know this is going to sound odd for some
people<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.080> put<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.680> lens<00:02:52.920> in<00:02:53.190> manual

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
people is to put the lens in manual

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.190 
people is to put the lens in manual
focus<00:02:54.680> what's<00:02:55.680> nice<00:02:55.980> about<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.820> with<00:02:57.570> the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
focus what's nice about that is with the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.490 
focus what's nice about that is with the
sony<00:02:58.470> NEX<00:02:59.040> cameras<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.390> can<00:03:00.420> enable<00:03:00.780> focus

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
sony NEX cameras you can enable focus

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.040 
sony NEX cameras you can enable focus
peaking<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.130> i<00:03:02.850> change<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.480> default<00:03:03.750> color

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
peaking and i change the default color

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.449 
peaking and i change the default color
from<00:03:04.320> red<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.709> yellow<00:03:04.740> because<00:03:05.130> i<00:03:05.190> think<00:03:05.250> it

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
from red to yellow because i think it

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.180 
from red to yellow because i think it
pops<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.180> little<00:03:06.209> bit<00:03:06.480> more<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:07.290> what<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.650> does

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
pops a little bit more so what that does

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.660 
pops a little bit more so what that does
is<00:03:08.430> while<00:03:09.180> I'm<00:03:09.390> sitting<00:03:09.630> there<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:10.490> mean<00:03:11.490> my

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
is while I'm sitting there a mean my

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.479 
is while I'm sitting there a mean my
shot<00:03:11.940> composing<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:12.690> as<00:03:12.870> i<00:03:13.440> turn<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:14.220> focus

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
shot composing it as i turn the focus

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.720 
shot composing it as i turn the focus
wheel<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.750> get<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.140> subject<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.620> focus

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
wheel and I get the subject in focus

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.460 
wheel and I get the subject in focus
this<00:03:17.730> yellow<00:03:18.390> haze<00:03:18.959> or<00:03:18.989> like<00:03:20.630> dancing<00:03:21.630> ants<00:03:22.140> or

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
this yellow haze or like dancing ants or

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.690 
this yellow haze or like dancing ants or
whatever<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.800> want<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.010> call<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.220> comes

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
whatever you want to call it comes

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.540 
whatever you want to call it comes
around<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.630> image<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:25.260> or<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.920> subject<00:03:26.370> and

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
around the image that or the subject and

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.900 
around the image that or the subject and
so<00:03:27.090> as<00:03:27.330> I<00:03:27.660> focus<00:03:28.440> in<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.709> out<00:03:28.860> maybe<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.610> trees

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
so as I focus in and out maybe the trees

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.350 
so as I focus in and out maybe the trees
behind<00:03:30.150> them<00:03:30.959> will<00:03:31.170> have<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:32.100> outline<00:03:32.610> as<00:03:32.910> I

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
behind them will have that outline as I

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.540 
behind them will have that outline as I
focus<00:03:33.750> back<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.320> become<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:35.010> moves<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.459> the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
focus back it become it moves to the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.610 
focus back it become it moves to the
subject<00:03:36.060> if<00:03:36.209> i<00:03:36.269> come<00:03:36.510> back<00:03:36.630> further<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.530> know

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
subject if i come back further you know

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.800 
subject if i come back further you know
i<00:03:37.650> can<00:03:37.920> see<00:03:38.160> where<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.820> focus<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.630> going<00:03:39.720> to

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
i can see where that focus is going to

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.229 
i can see where that focus is going to
be<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.560> very<00:03:40.980> quickly<00:03:41.280> i<00:03:41.549> can<00:03:41.670> pull<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.120> up

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
be so very quickly i can pull it up

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.660 
be so very quickly i can pull it up
adjust<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.049> focus<00:03:43.260> get<00:03:43.860> that<00:03:44.040> focus<00:03:44.459> peaking

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
adjust the focus get that focus peaking

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.520 
adjust the focus get that focus peaking
right<00:03:45.000> on<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.420> subject<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:45.900> take<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.320> shot

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
right on the subject and take the shot

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.229 
right on the subject and take the shot
in<00:03:46.880> most<00:03:47.880> cases<00:03:48.090> i<00:03:48.870> am<00:03:49.530> faster<00:03:50.190> using<00:03:50.610> focus

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
in most cases i am faster using focus

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.620 
in most cases i am faster using focus
peaking<00:03:51.480> then<00:03:52.290> using<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:53.040> auto<00:03:53.250> focus<00:03:53.850> in

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
peaking then using the auto focus in

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.780 
peaking then using the auto focus in
this<00:03:55.230> configuration<00:03:55.530> now<00:03:56.220> don't<00:03:56.610> get<00:03:56.700> me

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
this configuration now don't get me

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.030 
this configuration now don't get me
wrong<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.030> like<00:03:57.239> having<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.110> in<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.860> right

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040
