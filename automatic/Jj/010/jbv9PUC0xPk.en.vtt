so<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.299> filter<00:00:06.839> out<00:00:06.990> engine<00:00:07.319> noise<00:00:07.649> from<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.130> car

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
so to filter out engine noise from a car

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.830 
so to filter out engine noise from a car
stereo<00:00:09.139> you<00:00:10.139> may<00:00:10.290> use<00:00:10.559> one<00:00:11.070> or<00:00:12.030> both<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.480> these

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
stereo you may use one or both of these

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.359 
stereo you may use one or both of these
filters<00:00:13.349> here<00:00:14.099> we<00:00:14.309> have<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.759> ferrite<00:00:15.509> core

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
filters here we have a ferrite core

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.820 
filters here we have a ferrite core
electric<00:00:17.369> filter<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:19.189> here<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.449> an<00:00:22.230> RCA

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
electric filter and here we have an RCA

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.330 
electric filter and here we have an RCA
line-level<00:00:23.519> filter<00:00:24.619> before<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.980> know<00:00:26.130> which

one<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:26.789> need<00:00:27.109> we're<00:00:28.109> going<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.289> have<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> do<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
one we need we're going to have to do a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.099 
one we need we're going to have to do a
little<00:00:28.859> troubleshooting<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.420> I've<00:00:30.539> mocked<00:00:30.840> up

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
little troubleshooting so I've mocked up

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.560 
little troubleshooting so I've mocked up
here<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> radio<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.279> amplifier<00:00:32.730> installation

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
here a radio and amplifier installation

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.080 
here a radio and amplifier installation
and<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.680> fairly<00:00:34.980> common<00:00:35.340> setup<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.059> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and it's a fairly common setup we have a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.860 
and it's a fairly common setup we have a
radio<00:00:36.680> running<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.920> two<00:00:38.280> RCA<00:00:38.460> cables<00:00:39.180> 2<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> 4

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
radio running on two RCA cables 2 a 4

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.010 
radio running on two RCA cables 2 a 4
channel<00:00:39.899> amplifier<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.690> engine

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
channel amplifier and we have engine

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.709 
channel amplifier and we have engine
oils<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> car<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.430> first<00:00:44.789> we<00:00:45.480> need<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
oils in the car but first we need to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.900 
oils in the car but first we need to
find<00:00:45.930> out<00:00:46.170> where<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.829> noise<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.010> coming<00:00:47.340> from

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
find out where the noise is coming from

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.139 
find out where the noise is coming from
before<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.289> filter<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.860> out<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.940> have

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
before we can filter it out so you have

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.600 
before we can filter it out so you have
to<00:00:51.329> do<00:00:51.480> some<00:00:51.719> testing<00:00:52.140> first<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.309> first

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
to do some testing first and the first

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.580 
to do some testing first and the first
thing<00:00:53.789> you're<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.600> start<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
thing you're going to do is start the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.439 
thing you're going to do is start the
car<00:00:56.120> go<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.360> back<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> radio<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
car go to the back of the radio and

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.500 
car go to the back of the radio and
disconnect<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.289> RCA

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.920 

if<00:01:04.900> in<00:01:05.260> disconnecting<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.190> RCA<00:01:06.580> cables<00:01:07.090> the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
if in disconnecting the RCA cables the

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.890 
if in disconnecting the RCA cables the
noise<00:01:08.230> goes<00:01:08.650> away<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:10.390> you're<00:01:10.660> going<00:01:10.810> to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
noise goes away then you're going to

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.690 
noise goes away then you're going to
want<00:01:11.110> to<00:01:11.170> reach<00:01:11.380> for<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:11.770> electrical<00:01:12.280> filter

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
want to reach for the electrical filter

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.680 
want to reach for the electrical filter
with<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.300> ferrite<00:01:13.720> core<00:01:14.230> and<00:01:14.560> you'll<00:01:15.690> filter

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
with a ferrite core and you'll filter

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.940 
with a ferrite core and you'll filter
either<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:19.060> power<00:01:19.300> on<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:20.110> constant<00:01:20.710> wire

and you go on

to your amplifier and then we'll go and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.020 
to your amplifier and then we'll go and
unplug<00:02:19.050> them<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.890> usually<00:02:20.610> in<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.760> trunk

of the car from the amplifier if in fact

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.390

the<00:02:26.310> noise<00:02:26.550> goes<00:02:26.820> away<00:02:26.880> when<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.570> do<00:02:27.810> that

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
the noise goes away when you do that

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.670 
the noise goes away when you do that
then<00:02:29.400> what<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.790> want<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.090> do<00:02:30.270> is<00:02:30.540> use<00:02:31.110> an<00:02:31.290> RCA

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
then what you want to do is use an RCA

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.870 
then what you want to do is use an RCA
line<00:02:32.100> filter<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:35.040> way<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.370> works<00:02:35.640> is

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
line filter and the way that works is

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.240 
line filter and the way that works is
you'll<00:02:36.660> plug<00:02:37.020> your<00:02:37.470> RCA<00:02:37.920> cables<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.640> here<00:02:39.240> and

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
you'll plug your RCA cables in here and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.860 
you'll plug your RCA cables in here and
then<00:02:41.250> plug<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.760> other<00:02:41.790> end<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> RCA

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
then plug the other end of the RCA

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.250 
then plug the other end of the RCA
cables<00:02:43.350> into<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.280> amplifier<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.260> that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
cables into the amplifier and that

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
cables into the amplifier and that
should<00:02:46.650> eliminate<00:02:47.250> any<00:02:47.760> engine<00:02:48.300> noise<00:02:48.450> and

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
should eliminate any engine noise and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.640 
should eliminate any engine noise and
that<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.610> how<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.330> troubleshoot<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.230> get<00:02:52.440> rid

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
that is how you troubleshoot and get rid

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.560 
that is how you troubleshoot and get rid
of<00:02:52.970> noise<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.510> car<00:02:54.750> stereo<00:02:54.960> system
