00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.929
 soft we find ourselves to forbid the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.740
 tan new formula so I 'm going 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.179
 explain to me immediately wars 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.250
 after a week of quiet absence 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.960
 on youtube we come back with 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.160
 returns from the tam so new formula 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.140
 how are you guys have well 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.850
 as you know is the update there 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.070
 there are price ranges so I can 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.189
 no longer transfer credit to my account 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.599
 dtz of course and suddenly it is not 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.710
 that a little bit the series in the sense that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.110
 had to make challenges to win 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.840
 credits with these credits improve bath 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.500
 equipped in players and it's with 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 themes like the pg I come you know 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.149
 that it's a jax following the clubs 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.500
 of zatanna done and suddenly ben because 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.090
 of this premium range one is 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.570
 obliged to start again on a glory return 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.940
 basic 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.500
 so that is to say division 1 win 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.329
 or at least go to division 1 with 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.670
 zlatan while making teams 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.320
 around him and starting from scratch so 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.100
 there we put the credit we can 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.520
 to make teams etc 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.070
 so that's the end of the theme of 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.930
 malmö juventus 2 etc etc 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.750
 we go on the road or snatches the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.650
 basic forgiveness and I hope that you 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.350
 will please anyway because it's chic 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.710
 drawing statham with no playing time on a 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.990
 account 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.030
 so we start directly the first 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.320
 match to note that my team is 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.650
 heavy the institute had said diop to 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.040
 meilhan from boateng choupo-moting 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.409
 abdennour etc 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.720
 you saw it matip stekelenburg filet 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.430
 just do with the players I saw 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.229
 in the free time that there was everything 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.810
 the world of years until the fetish not 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.040
 Spent money I live day took lé 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.390
 I had in my club and I built 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.650
 a team that is pretty good so 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.060
 one starts directly ample ski 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.310
 coffee a bar on the counter attack 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.079
 ex tan tan waiting for me at the start 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.670
 meeting horses launches him in 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.990
 depth and we see that in this 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.579
 new formula the natal guys made some 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.409
 positions since the goal is still to 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.659
 win got noticed statham 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.119
 but it's to win and natal does it 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.930
 first assist in the series 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.100
 weeds episode 5 or 6 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.300
 so it's true that it's a little 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.620
 moment to do is make his bass 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.150
 But that's how it is 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.700
 then we continue you can mutilated who 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.320
 goes through zlatan we believe 13 minutes the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.000
 doublette is rather not bad and rather 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.530
 quite frankly that's okay it goes to 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.509
 daily your meetings 4 stars gesture 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.860
 so it's a pleasure we're in 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.690
 streets of Athens so a mark and you 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.720
 does not poutine have this pes even if 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.730
 ps boss who is of the world for zlatan 3 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.930
 0 the opponent who has a very big 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.610
 team with very big players but 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.020
 in the end we walk we would like 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.760
 still in division 8 so at 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.670
 final is not very complicated without 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.830
 to boast it's true it's not 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.930
 still the division 5 4 3 2 1 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.340
 that's answering including we continue 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.260
 festival is from Athens frankly you 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.400
 did you see that the little passing of legs 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.880
 to be in the sense of purpose 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.070
 it hurts a lot 4-0 and a40 the opponent 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.780
 at just 4 0 before half time I the 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.489
 understand it rages which one is so 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.920
 divisional champion 8 if I'm wrong 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.140
 no one earns 4000 credit to invest in 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.510
 episode ends not the next 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.430
 follow-up episode after on 30 is a 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.360
 new team around the z any case 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.209
 for the moment we have a very beautiful 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.160
 team everything is quiet all 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.390
 beautiful is pretty shit and frankly I 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.010
 did not expect such an abused team 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.720
 but you will see in the next 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.760
 matches that's going to be crazy that and 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.190
 frankly that and we continue against a 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.680
 brazilian who put on me bernard in 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.830
 mc while being more you find that at 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.690
 we but hey we attack directly from 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.400
 the beginning of the match with abdennour that 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.190
 to make the pass formatted matuidi life which 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.739
 going tender launches deep into the z and 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.890
 the a20 a feint hit hits that 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.320
 come back as in butter 2 0 and 2 0 to 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.340
 0 in the second minute forgiveness it starts very 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.620
 well it starts very well 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.299
 then the vesicle free years to us 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.650
 to wash wanted because it does it does 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.459
 not take out his guardian and get him out 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.920
 in their sales 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.079
 that's why I could have scored but good 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.390
 without a photo we continue to say that then 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.220
 that once again this post side 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.600
 frankly the bad luck is back 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.890
 maybe we do not know anyway 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.480
 the opponent just after these two 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.730
 poles away decided to leave 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.989
 frankly he had to say to himself I take the 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.410
 broth the whole game it's useless I 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.000
 guide 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.680
 I think it says that because 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.630
 frankly I dominated directly on 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.510
 put him in direct pressure and I admit 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.470
 than 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.840
 I could have done hi 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.970
 unfortunately and the rage left at 1 0 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.290
 it does not matter we attack the third 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.450
 match but it's true that it's boring 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.470
 that kind of person who rages out 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.060
 direct at the end 2 0 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.890
 but hey it's like that it's like that 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.150
 just that makes it good for the 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.569
 for the form of my players all 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.070
 simply 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.269
 then guys I'm going to ask you 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.799
 something is what you want 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.419
 still the return of the overlay that 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.070
 I put in the old sees in the 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.900
 ancient tertous of athens in these 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.010
 episodes so the overlay to this little frame 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.449
 and that the number of goals et cetera 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.250
 do I add with new 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.990
 of a new thing to you to tell me 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.389
 in any case we start the third match 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.160
 against a beautiful pl a people with 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.479
 very very big players we attack 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.460
 matuidi who launches deep 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.699
 kwami depth me mouse hole 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.960
 Aubameyang control hits 1-0 6th minute 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.190
 and there I have no where the case at 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.120
 the opponent opposite was not good 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.610
 look at what he's doing and do 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.740
 beginner mistakes so with this dalton 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.570
 low I kill such a suarez against 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.000
 sirigu little flat foot in him 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.190
 turned well and then the only 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.930
 opportunity in the opponent it will be that the 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.919
 free kick this is his only opportunity and 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.710
 after I confess you wishing a 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.320
 recital choupo moting that leaves on the 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.410
 side and there the center in force with a 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.910
 beautiful striking pole coming back from sagna 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.919
 I admit again it's really 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.960
 anything but well we continue on 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.770
 take a walk frankly wander 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.930
 the opponent was really not good so 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.270
 had frankly I'm going to try to 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.229
 clips and then again to free kick and 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.660
 there I confess that his free kicks there 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.880
 that's what I prefer 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.410
 alas the strike of the z she was going under 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.260
 the terminal unfortunately I have not very 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.760
 well shot of the month i just shot at 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.650
 better it was not the best choice 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.780
 but was well pulled this bring his 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.740
 know but good like that to continue 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.900
 Exane we try to dribble the goalkeeper 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.060
 we strike it pauses d matuidi 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.030
 for the second place of the two the trend 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.289
 mad in this series we continue 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.460
 get the ball back to the meeting 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.100
 frankly he makes errors of 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.540
 beginners the opponent 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.880
 So you being told to rebellion will 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.900
 pay just accelerated in tribe the guardian 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.870
 it's anything that match 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.310
 frankly it's anything 5-0 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.230
 adversary did not do anything opposite they me 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.160
 tackle in the penalty area 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.330
 ibra he pulls and transport positively 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.740
 the opponent had nothing to fuck 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.940
 frankly I have the impression I am 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.500
 even happy northerner galley more in 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.140
 beginner is not to boast but 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.910
 do not abuse it's the same 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.050
 still need the shot is more picking 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.710
 we on release and a dive goal 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.990
 the goal is division 1 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.640
 we will not allow ourselves to 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.380
 opponents play as soon as it makes a 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.090
 mistake she pays it cash and our marks 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.380
 are still waiting for us tripped on this 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.090
 huge match 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.330
 as usual we will see them after 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.260
 his jump orders his record which is very 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.550
 very very impressive 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.080
 at least to my wet eyes 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.300
 the awesome after you I think that 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.500
 you think about it but and I was 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.780
 impressed by the record I made 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.610
 seeming again with its size 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.850
 its axa accused you'll see we're going 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:45.130
 see right away so in the series 17 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.290
 wins a defeat we are pretty good 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.760
 we're gone division 7 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.960
 so I think it's going to go very fast 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.280
 now we're going to chain the episodes 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.380
 since is more to do calculations and 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.060
 cetera it will go very fast this kind 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.620
 of dental episode all at table I hope 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.080
 that you will like it anyway 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.910
 this year soft home 17 games 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.710
 for 45 goals and passes all 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.020
 just huge in any case it was 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.260
