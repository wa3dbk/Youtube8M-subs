00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
concrete batch plant but what makes it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.500 
concrete batch plant but what makes it
special<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.550> we're<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> most

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
special is we have we're the most

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.929 
special is we have we're the most
portable<00:01:03.930> plant<00:01:04.409> out<00:01:04.949> there<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.580> market

portable plant out there on the market

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.700 
portable plant out there on the market
and<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.360> been<00:01:06.600> for<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> number<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> years

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
and we have been for a number of years

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.219 
and we have been for a number of years
but<00:01:08.280> usually<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.030> portability<00:01:09.479> comes<00:01:09.990> with

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
but usually the portability comes with

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.929 
but usually the portability comes with
some<00:01:10.409> drawbacks<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.310> drawback<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
some drawbacks and that drawback is

usually production we we do both we're

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.060 
usually production we we do both we're

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
niche is really the portable market so

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.789 
niche is really the portable market so
instead<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.810> having<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.140> system<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.649> might
