let's say on Fridays they now know that
battlefield<00:03:56.700> is<00:03:57.090> going<00:03:57.269> to<00:03:57.329> be<00:03:57.450> on<00:03:57.569> Fridays

battlefield is going to be on Fridays

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.680 
battlefield is going to be on Fridays
they<00:03:58.440> know<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:58.919> they<00:03:59.069> can<00:03:59.099> see<00:03:59.519> older<00:04:00.180> FPS

games<00:04:01.019> on<00:04:01.230> Thursdays<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.310> they<00:04:02.400> can<00:04:02.579> expect

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910

ghosts<00:04:03.450> on<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.840> other<00:04:04.019> days<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.950> there<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:05.639> I

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
ghosts on the other days on there so I

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.180 
ghosts on the other days on there so I
think<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.389> actually<00:04:06.540> works<00:04:07.049> in<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.319> it<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.799> to

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
think it actually works in it it is to

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.819 
think it actually works in it it is to
