to like have a vacation every now and
then<00:02:20.860> or<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.190> slow<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.760> down<00:02:21.940> just<00:02:22.299> a<00:02:22.420> little

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
then or just slow it down just a little

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.850 
then or just slow it down just a little
bit<00:02:22.660> cuz<00:02:22.959> it's<00:02:23.079> hard<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:23.410> such<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.590> whirlwind

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
bit cuz it's hard it's such a whirlwind

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.310 
bit cuz it's hard it's such a whirlwind
that<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.310> end<00:02:24.489> up<00:02:24.610> forgetting<00:02:25.090> about<00:02:25.660> what

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320
