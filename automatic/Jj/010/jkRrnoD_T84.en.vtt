00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.399 
important okay so I'm gone right I said
earlier<00:01:42.390> few<00:01:42.540> lessons<00:01:42.689> ago<00:01:42.930> clapping<00:01:43.320> just

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
earlier few lessons ago clapping just

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
earlier few lessons ago clapping just
adjust<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> lot<00:01:47.390> that's<00:01:48.390> what<00:01:48.509> you've<00:01:48.689> use<00:01:48.899> that

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
adjust a lot that's what you've use that

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.859 
adjust a lot that's what you've use that
like<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.409> we're<00:01:49.979> starting<00:01:50.220> with<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.869> and

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
like so we're starting with that and

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.060 
like so we're starting with that and
then<00:01:52.880> right<00:01:53.880> seems<00:01:54.570> easy<00:01:55.079> enough<00:01:55.259> we're<00:01:56.009> gonna

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
then right seems easy enough we're gonna

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.850 
then right seems easy enough we're gonna
bend<00:01:56.369> again<00:01:56.820> for<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.060> eighth<00:01:57.210> fret<00:01:57.500> up<00:01:58.500> to

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
bend again for the eighth fret up to

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.200 
bend again for the eighth fret up to
that<00:01:59.009> whole<00:01:59.219> step<00:01:59.490> man<00:01:59.670> up

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that whole step man up

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.630 
that whole step man up
and<00:02:00.870> into<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.470> would<00:02:01.650> say<00:02:02.060> alright<00:02:03.060> so

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
and into like I would say alright so

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.080 
and into like I would say alright so
slow<00:02:05.640> down<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.970> sounds<00:02:06.120> pretty<00:02:06.330> easy<00:02:08.300> right

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
slow down it sounds pretty easy right

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.670 
slow down it sounds pretty easy right
the<00:02:12.090> key<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.660> get<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.020> controlling

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the key is to get to a controlling

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.500 
the key is to get to a controlling
day-to-day<00:02:14.310> wait<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.610> little<00:02:14.760> bit<00:02:15.240> right

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
day-to-day wait a little bit right

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.130 
day-to-day wait a little bit right
obviously<00:02:15.720> right<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:17.780> gets<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.900> speed

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
obviously right that that gets the speed

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.580 
obviously right that that gets the speed
up<00:02:19.260> right<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:19.980> real<00:02:20.190> slowest<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.959> key<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.380> to

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
up right so real slowest the key is to

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.230 
up right so real slowest the key is to
learn<00:02:25.770> them<00:02:25.980> slow<00:02:26.310> if<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.760> try<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.180> to

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
learn them slow if you try to have to

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.240 
learn them slow if you try to have to
Kate<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.630> know<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.590> know<00:02:28.680> I'm<00:02:28.800> start<00:02:29.130> out

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
Kate you know and you know I'm start out

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.460 
Kate you know and you know I'm start out

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
aides fret high E string then it has to

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.830 
aides fret high E string then it has to
bend<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.790> then<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.420> end<00:03:27.600> up<00:03:27.720> on<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:27.930> high<00:03:28.200> E
