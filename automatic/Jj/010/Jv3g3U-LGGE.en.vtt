I'm<00:00:00.299> going<00:00:00.570> to<00:00:00.659> show<00:00:00.750> you<00:00:00.840> guys<00:00:01.020> how<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.380> draw<00:00:01.620> a

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
I'm going to show you guys how to draw a

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.210 
I'm going to show you guys how to draw a
dog<00:00:01.829> quickly<00:00:02.159> and<00:00:02.610> SketchBook<00:00:03.060> Pro

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.220 
dog quickly and SketchBook Pro

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.130 
dog quickly and SketchBook Pro
the<00:00:05.220> first<00:00:05.490> step<00:00:05.700> you're<00:00:06.480> going<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.899> turn<00:00:07.049> on

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
the first step you're going to turn on

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.049 
the first step you're going to turn on
the<00:00:07.290> symmetry<00:00:07.589> button<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.429> symmetry<00:00:08.849> button

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
the symmetry button the symmetry button

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.540 
the symmetry button the symmetry button
is<00:00:09.179> up<00:00:09.300> at<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.480> top<00:00:09.540> toolbar<00:00:10.110> once<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.190> symmetry

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
is up at the top toolbar once a symmetry

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.980 
is up at the top toolbar once a symmetry
button<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.509> gonna<00:00:12.630> mirror

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
button is on it's gonna mirror

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.379 
button is on it's gonna mirror
everything<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.740> draw<00:00:14.040> on<00:00:14.400> one<00:00:14.790> side<00:00:15.030> on

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
everything that you draw on one side on

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.080 
everything that you draw on one side on
the<00:00:15.450> other<00:00:15.809> for<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.289> automatically<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.760> it

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
the other for you automatically so it

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.220 
the other for you automatically so it
makes<00:00:18.240> everything<00:00:18.480> just<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.900> little<00:00:19.109> bit

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
makes everything just a little bit

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.900 
makes everything just a little bit
easier<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.740> only<00:00:19.890> have<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.130> kind<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.430> draw<00:00:20.640> half

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
easier we only have to kind of draw half

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.080 
easier we only have to kind of draw half
this<00:00:21.150> job<00:00:21.439> so<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.560> symmetry<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.820> first

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
this job so with symmetry on the first

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.210 
this job so with symmetry on the first
step<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.840> draw<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> circle<00:00:25.439> at<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> top<00:00:25.980> of

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
step is to draw a circle at the top of

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.880 
step is to draw a circle at the top of
your<00:00:26.519> canvas<00:00:26.960> it's<00:00:27.960> gonna<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.289> probably<00:00:28.769> about

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
your canvas it's gonna be probably about

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.490 
your canvas it's gonna be probably about
this<00:00:29.099> big<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:30.330> next<00:00:30.689> step<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.260> draw<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
this big the next step is to draw a

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.680 
this big the next step is to draw a
circle<00:00:31.920> right<00:00:32.399> underneath<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.570> it's

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
circle right underneath it but it's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.750 
circle right underneath it but it's
gonna<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.110> little<00:00:34.380> bit<00:00:34.620> smaller<00:00:34.980> than<00:00:35.550> your

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
gonna be a little bit smaller than your

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.900 
gonna be a little bit smaller than your
first<00:00:36.000> circle<00:00:37.160> lastly<00:00:38.160> you're<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.700> draw

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
first circle lastly you're going to draw

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.630 
first circle lastly you're going to draw
another<00:00:39.149> circle<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.530> about<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.100> same<00:00:41.309> size

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
another circle it's about the same size

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.779 
another circle it's about the same size
as<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.660> top<00:00:42.690> circle

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
as the top circle

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.670 
as the top circle
so<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> bottom<00:00:45.239> circle<00:00:45.899> we're<00:00:46.260> gonna<00:00:46.379> draw

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
so on the bottom circle we're gonna draw

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.400 
so on the bottom circle we're gonna draw
two<00:00:47.190> more<00:00:47.219> circles<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> inside<00:00:49.379> of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
two more circles one on the inside of

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.889 
two more circles one on the inside of
the<00:00:49.710> circle<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.430> another<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> outside<00:00:51.750> of

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the circle and another on the outside of

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.639 
the circle and another on the outside of
the<00:00:52.050> circle<00:00:53.210> now<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> next<00:00:54.719> step<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.199> you're

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the circle now the next step is you're

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.430 
the circle now the next step is you're
going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.980> connect<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.969> middle<00:00:57.329> circle<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
going to connect the middle circle to

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.069 
going to connect the middle circle to
the<00:00:58.559> bottom<00:00:59.100> circles<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.210> we're

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the bottom circles just like this we're

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.560 
the bottom circles just like this we're
gonna<00:01:01.170> draw<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> line<00:01:01.829> from<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.460> top<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
gonna draw a line from the top to the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.050 
gonna draw a line from the top to the
bottom<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.379> circle<00:01:04.799> connecting<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.850> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
bottom of the circle connecting it and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.670 
bottom of the circle connecting it and
then<00:01:06.479> we're<00:01:06.570> gonna<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.960> again<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
then we're gonna do it again on the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.850 
then we're gonna do it again on the
inside<00:01:08.780> alright<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.049> now<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> next<00:01:10.590> thing

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
inside alright so now the next thing

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.070 
inside alright so now the next thing
that<00:01:10.979> we're<00:01:11.189> gonna<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.600> we're<00:01:12.600> gonna<00:01:12.750> start

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
that we're gonna do we're gonna start

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.800 
that we're gonna do we're gonna start
drawing<00:01:13.350> his<00:01:13.680> face<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.820> we're<00:01:15.479> going<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.659> draw

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
drawing his face so we're going to draw

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.440 
drawing his face so we're going to draw
a<00:01:15.840> circle<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.799> inside<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.820> top<00:01:18.030> circle

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
a circle on the inside of the top circle

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.260 
a circle on the inside of the top circle
right<00:01:18.810> about<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:20.939> middle

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
right about here and then in the middle

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.030 
right about here and then in the middle
I'm<00:01:21.600> gonna<00:01:21.780> give<00:01:21.930> them<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.140> big<00:01:22.320> nose<00:01:22.530> kind<00:01:22.920> of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
I'm gonna give them a big nose kind of

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.150 
I'm gonna give them a big nose kind of
like<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.790> erase<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.330> bit

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.250 

underneath<00:01:28.160> his<00:01:28.580> nose<00:01:28.880> I'm<00:01:29.390> going<00:01:29.690> to<00:01:29.810> draw<00:01:30.020> a

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
underneath his nose I'm going to draw a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.730 
underneath his nose I'm going to draw a
u-shape<00:01:31.030> so<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.180> u-shape<00:01:32.690> is<00:01:32.960> going<00:01:33.350> speed

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
u-shape so the u-shape is going speed

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.250 
u-shape so the u-shape is going speed
his<00:01:33.920> mouth<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.310> then<00:01:35.240> underneath<00:01:35.510> that<00:01:35.660> I'll

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
his mouth and then underneath that I'll

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.110 
his mouth and then underneath that I'll
do<00:01:36.500> another<00:01:36.860> u-shape<00:01:37.370> and<00:01:37.580> then<00:01:37.760> that's<00:01:37.970> his

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
do another u-shape and then that's his

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.010 
do another u-shape and then that's his
little<00:01:38.210> tongue<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:44.210> next<00:01:44.480> step<00:01:44.630> is<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.900> give

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
little tongue the next step is to give

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.960 
little tongue the next step is to give
him<00:01:45.110> some<00:01:45.290> ears<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.250> if<00:01:46.370> I'm<00:01:46.550> going<00:01:46.730> to<00:01:46.790> draw<00:01:46.940> a

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
him some ears so if I'm going to draw a

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.810 
him some ears so if I'm going to draw a
line<00:01:47.240> down<00:01:47.750> from<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.140> top<00:01:48.410> circle<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.100> I'm

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
line down from the top circle and I'm

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.880 
line down from the top circle and I'm
gonna<00:01:49.940> curve<00:01:50.270> it<00:01:50.450> around<00:01:50.510> into<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.200> u-shape<00:01:51.650> so

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
gonna curve it around into a u-shape so

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.370 
gonna curve it around into a u-shape so
he's<00:01:52.010> got<00:01:52.160> some<00:01:52.190> cute<00:01:52.550> fluffy<00:01:52.730> ears<00:01:53.320> now<00:01:54.320> the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380

he's got some cute fluffy ears now the
last<00:01:54.740> step<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.220> drawing<00:01:55.430> our<00:01:55.580> dog<00:01:55.790> is<00:01:56.120> to

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
last step of the drawing our dog is to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.020 
last step of the drawing our dog is to
give<00:01:56.600> him<00:01:56.660> his<00:01:56.780> ham<00:01:57.010> so<00:01:58.010> if<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:58.400> go<00:01:58.580> down<00:01:58.820> to

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
give him his ham so if you go down to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.760 
give him his ham so if you go down to
the<00:01:59.119> bottom<00:01:59.300> circle<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.110> we<00:02:00.200> start<00:02:00.440> drawing<00:02:00.619> a

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
the bottom circle and we start drawing a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.270 
the bottom circle and we start drawing a
tail<00:02:01.010> well<00:02:01.910> oh<00:02:02.330> oh<00:02:02.780> he's<00:02:03.229> got<00:02:03.440> two<00:02:03.590> tails<00:02:03.770> we

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
tail well oh oh he's got two tails we

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.490 
tail well oh oh he's got two tails we
have<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.460> turn<00:02:04.640> off<00:02:04.760> symmetry<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:05.869> first<00:02:06.290> let's

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
have to turn off symmetry so first let's

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.230 
have to turn off symmetry so first let's
turn<00:02:06.619> off<00:02:06.800> symmetry<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.640> then<00:02:07.850> let's<00:02:08.060> go<00:02:08.209> back

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
turn off symmetry and then let's go back

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.199 
turn off symmetry and then let's go back
and<00:02:08.570> erase<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:09.110> two<00:02:09.260> tails<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.970> then<00:02:10.970> let's

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
and erase the two tails and then let's

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.699 
and erase the two tails and then let's
go<00:02:11.330> ahead<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:11.600> draw<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.810> line<00:02:12.080> from<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.590> bottom

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
go ahead and draw a line from the bottom

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.160 
go ahead and draw a line from the bottom
circle<00:02:13.330> pointing<00:02:14.330> outward<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.900> then<00:02:15.080> I'm

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
circle pointing outward and then I'm

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.390 
circle pointing outward and then I'm
gonna<00:02:15.320> draw<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.560> couple<00:02:15.740> little<00:02:16.040> feathery

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
gonna draw a couple little feathery

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.949 
gonna draw a couple little feathery
strokes<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.940> kind<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.209> give<00:02:17.390> him<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.600> little<00:02:17.750> bit

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
strokes to kind of give him a little bit

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.830 
strokes to kind of give him a little bit
of<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.140> fluffy<00:02:18.350> tail<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:19.400> that's<00:02:20.390> how<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:20.600> draw

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
of a fluffy tail and that's how you draw

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:31.330 
of a fluffy tail and that's how you draw
a<00:02:20.870> dog's<00:02:21.140> super-quick<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:21.980> SketchBook<00:02:22.580> Pro
