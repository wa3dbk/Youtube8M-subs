00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
with a ton of refined sugar which brings

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.410 
with a ton of refined sugar which brings
me<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.680> my<00:02:12.890> third<00:02:13.400> tip<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:16.730> really

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
me to my third tip and that is to really

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.020 
me to my third tip and that is to really
limit<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.260> amount<00:02:18.710> of<00:02:18.950> sugar<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.460> you're

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
limit the amount of sugar that you're

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.720 
limit the amount of sugar that you're
putting<00:02:20.870> into<00:02:21.050> your<00:02:21.200> system<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.950> salt

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
putting into your system and salt

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.590 
putting into your system and salt
those<00:02:23.570> can<00:02:24.310> be<00:02:25.310> horrible<00:02:26.090> for<00:02:26.300> your<00:02:26.420> body

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
those can be horrible for your body

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.470 
those can be horrible for your body
especially<00:02:27.410> sugar<00:02:27.710> what<00:02:28.130> sugar<00:02:28.370> does<00:02:28.520> is<00:02:29.000> it

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
especially sugar what sugar does is it

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.250 
especially sugar what sugar does is it
sticks<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.770> your<00:02:31.280> fat<00:02:31.700> muscles<00:02:32.090> your<00:02:32.660> families

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
sticks to your fat muscles your families

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.220 
sticks to your fat muscles your families
what<00:02:33.860> sugar<00:02:34.100> does<00:02:34.220> is<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.790> really<00:02:35.000> sticks<00:02:35.750> to

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
what sugar does is it really sticks to

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.150 
what sugar does is it really sticks to
the<00:02:36.890> fat<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.490> it<00:02:38.240> obviously<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.590> turns<00:02:39.860> into

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
the fat and it obviously it turns into

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.300 
the fat and it obviously it turns into
fat<00:02:40.340> it's<00:02:40.930> added<00:02:41.930> calorie<00:02:42.350> I<00:02:42.740> feel<00:02:42.980> like<00:02:43.130> it

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
fat it's added calorie I feel like it

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.520

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
alcohol there's a ton of sugar in it if

of red wine but don't over consume and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.810 
of red wine but don't over consume and
just<00:03:01.820> binge<00:03:02.540> on<00:03:03.020> drinking<00:03:03.830> it's<00:03:04.220> horrible<00:03:04.760> for

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
just binge on drinking it's horrible for

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.130 
just binge on drinking it's horrible for
your<00:03:05.060> body<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:06.350> really<00:03:06.709> sits<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.550> your<00:03:07.790> abs

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
your body and it really sits in your abs

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.570 
your body and it really sits in your abs
as<00:03:09.140> far<00:03:09.350> as<00:03:09.470> salt<00:03:09.740> you<00:03:09.920> really<00:03:10.220> want<00:03:10.400> to

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
as far as salt you really want to

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.550 
as far as salt you really want to
minimize<00:03:10.790> your<00:03:11.060> salt<00:03:11.630> intake<00:03:12.080> just<00:03:12.380> so<00:03:12.500> you

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
minimize your salt intake just so you

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.479 
minimize your salt intake just so you
can<00:03:12.769> minimize<00:03:12.980> your<00:03:13.880> water<00:03:14.150> retention<00:03:14.600> and

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
can minimize your water retention and

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.040 
can minimize your water retention and
water<00:03:16.489> retention<00:03:16.670> really<00:03:17.239> just<00:03:17.420> blows<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.989> up

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
water retention really just blows you up

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.580 
water retention really just blows you up
and<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:19.310> will<00:03:19.640> sit<00:03:20.450> on<00:03:20.600> your<00:03:20.690> stomach<00:03:21.350> as<00:03:21.530> well

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
and it will sit on your stomach as well

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.830 
and it will sit on your stomach as well
so<00:03:22.400> you'll<00:03:22.610> kind<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.300> look<00:03:23.510> bloated

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
so you'll kind of you look bloated

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.650 
so you'll kind of you look bloated
basically<00:03:24.739> so<00:03:25.430> really<00:03:25.850> limit<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.150> amount<00:03:26.480> of

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
basically so really limit the amount of

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.170 
basically so really limit the amount of
salt<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:26.930> you're<00:03:27.200> eating<00:03:27.500> my<00:03:28.010> fourth<00:03:28.459> tip<00:03:28.850> is

salt that you're eating my fourth tip is

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.310 
salt that you're eating my fourth tip is
