00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.530
 hello friends how are you good at this 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.130
 chance 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:29.010
 more than a recipe I bring a technique 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.630
 how to do something what we will do today is 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.000
 a shake to the point of snow good as 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.220
 we make it super simple they are going to see 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.070
 that is super simple and for this 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.989
 heat if there is a lot of heat like here in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.620
 mexico and like in this southern part of 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.980
 veracruz 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.730
 I recommend them and apart he knows very, very 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.280
 good that we are going to use then what 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.339
 you need to make an atole always 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.510
 stopped atole good I tell you in this 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:05.399
 case our milkshake will be strawberry what 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.770
 that we are going to use is water only 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:11.870
 just a little bit a small glass 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:16.130
 to dilute what is our 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:19.310
 our cornstarch we will use sugar 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.310
 sugar is to taste friends is to taste 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.630
 what are we going to use then our 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.440
 where are we going to boil the milk 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:37.000
 and to prepare a liter of milk 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.000
 good having all this we go to the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.970
 first we put all our cornstarch 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.610
 in this case it's the strawberry flavor if you 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.860
 like surprises can do the same if 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:57.630
 they liked vanilla chocolate good 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.000
 let's put the cornstarch and sugar 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.240
 taste is to taste there are some that 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.090
 like to drink more sugar than others 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.390
 so that is left as an option they will say 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.429
 because it puts you so much 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.360
 So much sugar because we're going to 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:17.920
 dilute in a little while more in our milk 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.920
 while we are preparing is 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.540
 what we do is 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.750
 in an aluminum container or in which 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:33.270
 have to boil the liter of milk 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.390
 once it has boiled 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.980
 by such I say what is 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.260
 good once it is already boiling 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.260
 our milk, let's go 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.900
 and let's put the cornstarch that already 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.900
 we see 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.730
 mixed with water and sugar and if 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.730
 they want to put vanilla break 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.970
 well in fact these instructions by 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.220
 if they do not know it and they are in the part of 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.459
 behind the maizena envelopes for 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.770
 make atoles but if not then here they can 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:18.250
 see it as science 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:22.270
 very well as you see starts to grab a 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.540
 a little thicker consistency and that 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.730
 is the one we're going to want after 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.280
 boil perfectly what we do is 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.690
 turn it off and now we're going to 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.690
 say what is next 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.750
 well once our atole is already 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.300
 served and ready 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.970
 we are going to empty it in a container 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.610
 plastic I recommend more plastic 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.710
 after this we will put it in 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.740
 our freezer all night that 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:56.660
 rest is perfectly but about 4 o 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:59.180
 5 hours the case is great and it is 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.850
 Do not freeze completely but stay 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.250
 about to freeze because that's the 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.990
 joke of our shake and good 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.140
 tomorrow we are going to open our freezer 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.310
 to see how it was and how it is prepared and 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.310
 how is it enjoyed too 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.590
 well we are already in the next day and 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.780
 our atole has remained practically 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.110
 semi-frozen 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.680
 once we have 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.680
 these 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:36.440
 this creamy and frozen consistency 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:40.750
 what we are going to do is 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.750
 put it in our blender 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.220
 what I'm going to do is put a 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.610
 trickle of 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.710
 milk is only so that not so that 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.009
 I will not leave 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.260
 so that the blender does not work zone 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.720
 and I'm going to put it 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.510
 a little bit of vanilla there is optional 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.569
 you can put the clothes or 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.580
 just so nothing too 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.159
 here also with option you can put 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.420
 natural fruit chopped example if it is 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.130
 strawberry would be prey 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.689
 if it's vanilla they can put 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.939
 peaches 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:37.370
 and if you are chocolate there are like you of 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:41.419
 the particular could not do anything 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:45.729
 once we have that good, we're going to 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.729
 liquefy , we are going to liquefy 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:55.680
 well once we will 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.680
 put a paste look at a thick smoothie 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.460
 to this 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.460
 I call him 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.919
 to the history there is a year 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.919
 malted to the point of snow 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:21.029
 sorry I can not help but put my hand 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:24.050
 but it tastes delicious very well and it solitates me 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:24.050
 in this hot season 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.350
 and well well that's how our shake looks 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.350
 point of snow can enjoy 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.930
 can you tell us 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.430
 in this way or in the way that 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.430
 you want 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.620
 just enjoy it and enjoy this 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.830
 heat also with so much food with 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.409
 So many desserts there are to do so 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.959
 what 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:54.499
 with this I say goodbye as they say outside 

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:57.259
