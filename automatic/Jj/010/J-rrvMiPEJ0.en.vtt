00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:18.369
 The Epistle of the Apostle Saint Paul to Titus Chapter 1 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.100
 Tit 1: 1 Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.429
 of God and the knowledge of the truth that is according to piety, 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.750
 Tit 1: 2 in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised from 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.480
 before the beginning of the centuries, Tit 1: 3 and in due time manifested his 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.350
 word through the preaching that was entrusted to me by God's command 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.080
 Salvador, Tit 1: 4 to Titus, true son in common 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.010
 faith: Grace, mercy and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.770
 Tit 1: 5 For this cause I left you in Crete, to correct the deficient, and to establish 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.520
 Elders in every city, just as I sent you; Tit 1: 6 whoever is blameless, husband 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.440
 of one woman, and have believing children who are not accused of dissolution or 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.550
 rebellion. Tit 1: 7 Because it is necessary that the bishop 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:18.790
 be irreproachable, as administrator of God; not arrogant, not angry, not given to wine, 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.730
 not quarrelsome, not greedy for dishonest gain, 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.940
 Tit 1: 8 but host, lover of the good, sober, just, holy, master of himself, 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.440
 Tit 1: 9 retainer of the faithful word as it has been taught, so that it may also 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.800
 exhort with sound teaching and convince those who contradict. 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.490
 Tit 1:10 For there are still many obstinate, talkers of vanities and deceivers, mostly 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.740
 those of the circumcision, Tit 1:11 to which it is necessary to cover the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.640
 mouth; They overthrow entire houses, teaching for dishonest gain what is not convenient. 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.120
 Tit 1:12 One of them, his own prophet, said: The Cretans, always liars, bad 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.631
 beasts, idle gluttons. Tit 1:13 This testimony is true; by 

00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:05.370
 so much, rebuke them harshly, so that they may be healthy in the faith, 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.530
 Tit 1:14 not attending to Jewish fables, or to commandments of men who turn away 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.740
 of the truth. Tit 1:15 All things are pure for the 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.640
 pure, but for the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure to them; well up to your mind and your 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.640
 conscience are corrupted. Tit 1:16 They profess to know God, but with 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.959
 the facts deny it, being abominable and rebellious, reproved as to all good 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.900
 work. Episode 2 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.720
 Tit 2: 1 But you speak what is in accordance with sound doctrine. 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.061
 Tit 2: 2 May the elders be sober, serious, prudent, healthy in faith, in love, in 

00:02:43.061 --> 00:02:46.840
 patience. Tit 2: 3 Older women are also reverent 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.090
 in his bearing; not slanderers, not slaves of wine, teachers of good; 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.870
 Tit 2: 4 to teach young women to love their husbands and their children, 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.600
 Tit 2: 5 to be prudent, chaste, careful at home, good, subject to their husbands, 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.630
 so that the word of God is not blasphemed. Tit 2: 6 Also exhorts young people to 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.610
 that they be prudent; Tit 2: 7 presenting yourself in everything as an example 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.250
 of good works; in teaching showing integrity, seriousness, 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.130
 Tit 2: 8 sound and blameless word, so that the adversary be ashamed, and have no 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.050
 nothing bad to say about you. Tit 2: 9 Exhorts the servants to submit 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.830
 to their masters, who please in everything, who are not respondents; 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.010
 Tit 2:10 Not defrauding, but showing themselves faithful in everything, so that in everything they decorate the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.610
 doctrine of God our Savior. Tit 2:11 For the grace of God has manifested 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.569
 for salvation to all men, Tit 2:12 teaching us that, renouncing 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.560
 ungodliness and worldly desires, let us live in this century soberly, justly and piously, 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.780
 Tit 2:13 awaiting the blessed hope and the glorious manifestation of our great 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.090
 God and Savior Jesus Christ, Tit 2:14 who gave himself for us 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.989
 to redeem us from all iniquity and purify for themselves a people of their own, jealous of good 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.730
 works. Tit 2:15 This speaks, and exhorts and reproves 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.209
 with all authority. Nobody despises you. Chapter 3 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.939
 Tit 3: 1 Remind them to submit to the rulers and authorities, to obey, 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:25.139
 that are willing to every good work. Tit 3: 2 Let no one defame, let them not be quarrelsome, 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.620
 but kind, showing all meekness to all men. 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.099
 Tit 3: 3 For we also were once foolish, rebellious, lost, 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.039
 slaves of various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, abhorrent, 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:44.690
 and hating each other. Tit 3: 4 But when goodness manifested 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.749
 of God our Savior, and his love for men, 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:52.919
 Tit 3: 5 saved us, not for works of righteousness that we would have done, but for their 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.550
 mercy, by the washing of regeneration and by the renewal in the Holy Spirit, 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.560
 Tit 3: 6 which He poured out upon us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.919
 Tit 3: 7 so that justified by his grace, we would become heirs according to the 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.939
 hope of eternal life. Tit 3: 8 Faithful word is this, and in these things 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:18.360
 I want you to insist firmly, so that those who believe in God try to take care of themselves 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.520
 good works. These things are good and useful to men. 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.740
 Tit 3: 9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and arguments 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:33.810
 about the law; because they are vain and without profit. Tit 3:10 To the man who causes divisions, after 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.849
 from one and another admonition discard it, Tit 3:11 knowing that such has been perverted, 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:45.370
 and he sins and is condemned by his own judgment. Tit 3:12 When I send you to Artemas or 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.879
 Tychicus, hurry to come to me in Nicopolis, because there I have determined to spend the winter. 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:56.979
 Tit 3:13 To Zenas interpreter of the law, and to Apollos, send them with solicitude, so 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.449
 that nothing lacks. Tit 3:14 And let our people learn also 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:07.129
 to be engaged in good works for cases of necessity, so that they are not fruitless. 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:12.319
 Tit 3:15 All who are with me greet you. Said hello to the people who love you in the faith. The grace 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:15.319
 be with all of you Amen.
