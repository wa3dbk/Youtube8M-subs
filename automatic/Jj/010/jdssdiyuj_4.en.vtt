crumbling<00:00:53.430> infrastructure<00:00:53.879> I'm<00:00:54.750> going<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
crumbling infrastructure I'm going to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.040 
crumbling infrastructure I'm going to
introduce<00:00:55.500> legislation<00:00:56.300> do<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.750> part

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
introduce legislation do that and part

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.790 
introduce legislation do that and part
of<00:00:58.489> infrastructure<00:00:59.489> repair<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.590> creating<00:01:01.590> a

catch<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.390> with<00:01:06.420> Europe<00:01:06.900> Japan<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.560> even

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
catch up with Europe Japan and even

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.240 
catch up with Europe Japan and even
China<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.299> high<00:01:09.510> speed<00:01:09.900> rail<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.350> part<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
