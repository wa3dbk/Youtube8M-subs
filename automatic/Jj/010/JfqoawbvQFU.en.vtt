00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
okay so for today we have the black

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.380 
okay so for today we have the black

see<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.630> better<00:01:24.900> comparison<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.920> this

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
see the better comparison with this

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.340 
see the better comparison with this
resolution<00:01:26.700> now<00:01:27.299> first<00:01:27.689> off<00:01:27.960> what<00:01:28.229> you're

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
resolution now first off what you're

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.160 
resolution now first off what you're
looking<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.520> black<00:01:30.210> magic<00:01:30.509> footage

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
looking at here is black magic footage

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.899 
looking at here is black magic footage
you<00:01:31.380> might<00:01:31.650> not<00:01:31.860> even<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.130> able<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.549> tell<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
you might not even be able to tell the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.120 
you might not even be able to tell the
difference<00:01:32.939> between<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.290> PVR<00:01:34.770> but

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
difference between this and a PVR but

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.039 
difference between this and a PVR but
when<00:01:35.280> you're<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> computer<00:01:35.759> editing<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
when you're on a computer editing and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.950 
when you're on a computer editing and
looking<00:01:37.470> at<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> raw<00:01:37.860> footage<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.579> is

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
looking at the raw footage it is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.510 
looking at the raw footage it is
definitely<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.170> noticeable<00:01:40.799> compared<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
definitely more noticeable compared to a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.690 
definitely more noticeable compared to a
PVR<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.509> cleaner<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.220> an<00:01:44.340> overall

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
PVR is cleaner it's just an overall

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.120 
PVR is cleaner it's just an overall
better<00:01:45.000> around<00:01:45.720> experience<00:01:46.409> compared<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
better around experience compared to the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.569 
better around experience compared to the
PVR<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> must<00:01:48.450> say<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.649> limitation<00:01:50.220> of

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
PVR but I must say the one limitation of

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.850 
PVR but I must say the one limitation of
a<00:01:50.729> black<00:01:51.119> magic<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
a black magic is you have to have the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.219 
a black magic is you have to have the
software<00:01:53.340> running<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.939> view<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.659> your<00:01:54.930> TV

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
software running to view it on your TV

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.069 
software running to view it on your TV
that's<00:01:55.619> definitely<00:01:56.399> limitation<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.420> don't

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that's definitely limitation I don't

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.109 
that's definitely limitation I don't
really<00:01:58.439> enjoy<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.740> versus<00:01:59.399> where<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> PVR

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
really enjoy that versus where the PVR

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.670 
really enjoy that versus where the PVR
you<00:02:00.360> don't<00:02:00.540> even<00:02:00.630> need<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:01.110> computer<00:02:01.560> on

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you don't even need your computer on

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.859 
you don't even need your computer on
just<00:02:01.920> need<00:02:02.130> attorney<00:02:02.460> actual<00:02:02.939> device<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:03.600> so

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
just need attorney actual device on so

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.429 
just need attorney actual device on so
that<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.229> very<00:02:04.640> limiting<00:02:05.640> there<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.960> idea

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
that is very limiting there but the idea

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.710 
that is very limiting there but the idea
of<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.649> black<00:02:08.129> magic<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.030> capture<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.629> a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
of the black magic is to capture in a

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.660

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
little bit more but that is all in the

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.730 
little bit more but that is all in the
opinion<00:05:53.330> in<00:05:53.600> yours<00:05:53.840> may<00:05:54.230> be<00:05:54.260> a<00:05:54.470> little
