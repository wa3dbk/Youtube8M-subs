know<00:01:50.660> there<00:01:51.080> are<00:01:51.110> some<00:01:51.560> players<00:01:52.130> that<00:01:52.700> are

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
know there are some players that are

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.249 
know there are some players that are
good<00:01:52.970> enough<00:01:53.179> coming<00:01:53.420> out<00:01:53.599> of<00:01:53.720> triple<00:01:53.869> a<00:01:54.050> major

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
good enough coming out of triple a major

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:55.749 
good enough coming out of triple a major
midget<00:01:54.530> or<00:01:54.800> high<00:01:54.890> school<00:01:54.920> hockey<00:01:55.310> that<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.640> go

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
midget or high school hockey that to go

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.029 
midget or high school hockey that to go
directly<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.240> college<00:01:56.630> but<00:01:57.229> nowadays<00:01:57.410> that's

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
directly to college but nowadays that's

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.339 
directly to college but nowadays that's
really<00:01:58.459> a<00:01:58.640> very<00:01:59.000> few<00:01:59.240> number<00:01:59.300> of<00:01:59.630> players

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
really a very few number of players

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.850 
really a very few number of players
thats<00:02:00.679> in<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.970> minority<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.440> what<00:02:03.590> really

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
thats in the minority and so what really

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.380 
thats in the minority and so what really
happens<00:02:04.160> is<00:02:04.310> most<00:02:04.550> players<00:02:04.789> end<00:02:05.060> up<00:02:05.149> getting

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
happens is most players end up getting

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.969 
happens is most players end up getting
some<00:02:05.569> playing<00:02:05.720> experience<00:02:06.259> at<00:02:06.709> some<00:02:06.890> other

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
some playing experience at some other

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.339 
some playing experience at some other
level<00:02:07.429> particularly<00:02:07.849> juniors<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:08.750> junior

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
level particularly juniors and junior

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.199 
level particularly juniors and junior
A's<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.429> what<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.580> means<00:02:10.910> is<00:02:11.030> they<00:02:11.150> could

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
A's and so what that means is they could

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.850 
A's and so what that means is they could
play<00:02:11.450> junior<00:02:11.720> aids<00:02:11.959> for<00:02:12.140> up<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.410> two<00:02:12.590> three

play junior aids for up to two three
four<00:02:13.130> or<00:02:13.190> five<00:02:13.340> years<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:14.170> typically<00:02:15.170> you've

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
four or five years so typically you've

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.280 
four or five years so typically you've
got<00:02:16.130> players<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.180> entering<00:02:17.390> college<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.170> can

got players to entering college that can

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.530 
got players to entering college that can

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
some people do red shirt for a year you

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.530 
some people do red shirt for a year you
just<00:02:43.400> kind<00:02:43.550> of<00:02:43.640> do<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.910> math<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.150> go<00:02:44.390> all

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
just kind of do the math you go all

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.050 
just kind of do the math you go all
divided<00:02:45.080> by<00:02:45.200> four<00:02:45.560> well<00:02:46.370> that's<00:02:46.520> not<00:02:46.700> really

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
divided by four well that's not really

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.670 
divided by four well that's not really
right<00:02:47.240> because<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.780> isn't<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.260> way<00:02:48.470> it's

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
right because it isn't that way it's

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.890 
right because it isn't that way it's
really<00:02:49.130> /<00:02:49.580> either<00:02:49.880> six<00:02:50.270> or<00:02:50.420> eight<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.870> you

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
really / either six or eight and you

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.480 
really / either six or eight and you
know<00:02:51.320> it's<00:02:51.470> while<00:02:51.680> it's<00:02:51.860> up<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.160> eight<00:02:52.250> years

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
know it's while it's up to eight years

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.450 
know it's while it's up to eight years
of<00:02:52.580> range<00:02:52.910> age<00:02:53.360> range<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.650> know<00:02:54.680> there's<00:02:55.310> not

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
of range age range you know there's not

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.310 
of range age range you know there's not
a<00:02:55.520> lot<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.510> but<00:02:56.750> they<00:02:56.840> solve<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.230> but

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
a lot of that but they solve it but

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.380 
a lot of that but they solve it but
let's<00:02:57.500> just<00:02:57.590> say<00:02:57.770> six<00:02:58.280> for<00:02:58.490> example<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.180> if<00:02:59.300> you

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
let's just say six for example so if you

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.050 
let's just say six for example so if you
take<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.810> d1<00:03:00.230> number<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.970> fourteen<00:03:01.970> hundred

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
take the d1 number of fourteen hundred

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.600 
take the d1 number of fourteen hundred
and<00:03:02.390> fifty<00:03:02.750> players<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:03.980> divide<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.280> by

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
and fifty players and you divide that by

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.390 
and fifty players and you divide that by
six<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.270> get<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.420> number<00:03:05.630> less<00:03:05.930> than<00:03:06.190> 250<00:03:07.190> and

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
six you get a number less than 250 and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.250 
six you get a number less than 250 and
the<00:03:07.510> point<00:03:08.510> here<00:03:08.900> is<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:10.210> understand<00:03:11.210> that<00:03:11.390> if

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the point here is to understand that if

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.610 
the point here is to understand that if
I<00:03:12.410> were<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.710> ask<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:13.100> is<00:03:13.400> your<00:03:13.670> son<00:03:14.290> really<00:03:15.290> one

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
eighty-four I would have been

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.370 
eighty-four I would have been
hard-pressed<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.450> say<00:03:38.540> yes<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.200> that<00:03:39.230> question

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
hard-pressed to say yes to that question

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.680 
hard-pressed to say yes to that question
if<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.040> had<00:03:40.130> been<00:03:40.160> asked<00:03:40.580> me<00:03:40.670> before<00:03:41.120> you<00:03:41.240> he

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
if it had been asked me before you he

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.050 
if it had been asked me before you he
made<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.900> d1<00:03:42.320> team<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:43.400> not<00:03:43.520> because<00:03:43.790> I<00:03:43.850> didn't

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
made a d1 team it's not because I didn't

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.330 
made a d1 team it's not because I didn't
have<00:03:44.150> confidence<00:03:44.840> in<00:03:45.170> his<00:03:45.320> capabilities<00:03:46.040> but

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
have confidence in his capabilities but

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.600 
have confidence in his capabilities but
I<00:03:46.550> never<00:03:46.940> framed<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:48.590> environment<00:03:49.340> he<00:03:49.459> was

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
I never framed the environment he was

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.940 
I never framed the environment he was
trying<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:50.030> be<00:03:50.180> successful<00:03:50.420> in<00:03:51.080> in<00:03:51.290> that

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
trying to be successful in in that

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.530 
trying to be successful in in that
manner<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.459> didn't<00:03:52.760> think<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:53.150> in<00:03:53.300> that<00:03:53.330> way

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
manner I didn't think of it in that way

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.010 
manner I didn't think of it in that way
and<00:03:54.250> similarly<00:03:55.250> if<00:03:55.520> we<00:03:55.640> look<00:03:55.940> at<00:03:56.030> d3<00:03:56.570> even<00:03:56.930> to

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
and similarly if we look at d3 even to

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.990 
and similarly if we look at d3 even to
play<00:03:57.200> at<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.350> e3<00:03:57.470> hockey<00:03:58.010> if<00:03:58.370> you<00:03:58.520> divide<00:03:58.820> that

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
play at the e3 hockey if you divide that

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.720 
play at the e3 hockey if you divide that
number<00:03:59.060> 17<00:03:59.840> 25<00:04:00.350> by<00:04:00.709> six<00:04:01.070> you're<00:04:01.489> going<00:04:01.610> to<00:04:01.670> get

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
number 17 25 by six you're going to get

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.720 
number 17 25 by six you're going to get
a<00:04:01.790> number<00:04:01.910> around<00:04:02.180> 300<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.560> all<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.040> a<00:04:04.370> sudden

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
a number around 300 so all of a sudden

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.800 
a number around 300 so all of a sudden
you're<00:04:05.060> really<00:04:05.480> looking<00:04:05.630> at<00:04:07.120> can<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.300> be<00:04:08.600> one

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
you're really looking at can you be one

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.740 
you're really looking at can you be one
of<00:04:09.020> the<00:04:09.080> top<00:04:09.260> 200<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.340> 300<00:04:10.910> players<00:04:11.150> in<00:04:11.480> your

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
they're on a lot of these rosters of d1

hockey teams and d3 hockey teams and
there's<00:04:24.410> even<00:04:24.500> a<00:04:24.710> few<00:04:24.890> players<00:04:25.190> from<00:04:25.550> the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
there's even a few players from the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.170 
there's even a few players from the
international<00:04:26.780> sector<00:04:27.200> that<00:04:27.790> end<00:04:28.790> up<00:04:28.940> playing

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
international sector that end up playing

international sector that end up playing
so<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.750> point<00:04:30.710> here<00:04:30.860> is<00:04:31.010> just<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.460> understand

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
so the point here is just to understand

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.950 
so the point here is just to understand
that<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:33.650> really<00:04:34.010> is<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.610> very<00:04:35.120> competitive

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
that it really is a very competitive

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.529 
that it really is a very competitive
narrow<00:04:36.830> point<00:04:37.190> that<00:04:37.460> you're<00:04:37.610> trying<00:04:37.970> to

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
narrow point that you're trying to

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.690 
narrow point that you're trying to
accomplish<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:39.320> recognize<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:40.010> wall<00:04:40.190> you

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
accomplish and recognize the wall you

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.890 
accomplish and recognize the wall you
may<00:04:40.880> think<00:04:40.910> your<00:04:41.240> son's<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.570> great

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
really good point my point here isn't to

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.969 
really good point my point here isn't to
be<00:05:02.240> discouraging<00:05:02.930> about<00:05:03.259> whether<00:05:03.560> or<00:05:03.650> not<00:05:03.800> you

can make a deal with hockey team whether

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.790 
can make a deal with hockey team whether
whether<00:05:05.840> you're<00:05:06.080> not<00:05:06.199> you<00:05:06.350> should<00:05:06.380> try

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
whether you're not you should try

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.620 
whether you're not you should try
because<00:05:07.280> that<00:05:07.550> that<00:05:07.759> isn't<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.180> point<00:05:08.210> but

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
because that that isn't the point but

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.529 
because that that isn't the point but
it's<00:05:09.259> two<00:05:09.620> points<00:05:09.919> are<00:05:10.009> basically<00:05:10.400> a<00:05:10.699> you<00:05:11.419> have

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
it's two points are basically a you have

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.090 
it's two points are basically a you have
to<00:05:11.660> realize<00:05:11.990> how<00:05:12.169> competitive<00:05:12.590> the

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
to realize how competitive the

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.879 
to realize how competitive the
environment<00:05:13.910> is<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.389> make<00:05:14.960> it<00:05:15.139> in<00:05:15.350> and<00:05:15.740> what

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
environment is to make it in and what

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.560 
environment is to make it in and what
the<00:05:16.010> numbers<00:05:16.310> game<00:05:16.490> is<00:05:16.729> that<00:05:16.970> it<00:05:17.030> tells<00:05:17.419> you

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
the numbers game is that it tells you
