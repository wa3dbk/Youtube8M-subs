00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.389
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.150
 Yaroslav was lighting and today I start 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.980
 A new program in which I will gradually 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.590
 telling how to become really 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.650
 a good commander in companies and in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.119
 team battle and the first release of the transfer 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.900
 will be completely devoted to myself 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.420
 the commander 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.760
 rather that he should be in 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.920
 first you must have less 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.260
 good microphone and i'm not talking about 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.230
 pieces of plastic which is attached to 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.360
 your headphones namely microphone in 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.210
 our time of cheap model is worth a penny 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.770
 and thanks to him your subordinates will 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.070
 hear no wild noise 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.620
 And clear orders the second this headphones they 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.449
 Headphone function may be inexpensive 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.980
 is to remove the background 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.110
 which may arise 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.300
 yes and do not forget that in games with 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.270
 voice chat is always best 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.660
 have a headset because a strong word can 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.340
 fly out 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.769
 have a teammate at the most 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.560
 inopportune moment and suddenly near children 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.680
 or worse parents by the way about age 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.229
 you don't have to be 18 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.509
 + to command the rotor by itself 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.729
 there is an opinion that those who are not 15 years old 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.460
 capable of anything and so on 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.830
 80 percent I am familiar with several 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.320
 young guys who are willing to give 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.259
 pepper to any peasant and if you have 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.079
 microphone and headphones are essentially all that 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.270
 you need to stay the most important brain 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.490
 unfortunately you canâ€™t buy it 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.619
 the commander depends on the outcome of the battle in 90 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.750
 percent of cases by itself you will 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.880
 make mistakes and not always hold 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.189
 team or kind to victory but always 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.000
 need to learn from your mistakes and not 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.490
 deny 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.560
 and even better to learn from our next 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.540
 the video actually ends here 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.229
 a list of what is good 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.450
 the commander 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.000
 if you have it all you can 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.159
 start collecting comrades and start with 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.229
 of what is required of them first 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.180
 unconditional execution of commands and 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.579
 trust captain willingness to donate 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.720
 to save a teammate 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.790
 many 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.040
 Well, the higher the frequency in humans 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.620
 better he plays amazing but it doesn't 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.080
 always working in team battle extras 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.120
 quite often turns on the mode knows everything 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.280
 and do not do what is required of them 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.860
 the commander either just does not perform 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.440
 order afraid to take damage or do not let 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.660
 god give life in the name of victory as 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.640
 rule after a couple of fights even with weak 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.350
 guys if you show yourself and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.720
 right as a good commander you 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.240
 start fun and easy to carry everyone 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.910
 in a row it is not necessary to recruit a team 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.459
 who under the shades and not those who are slightly you 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:49.950
 and sang about those who completely lost touch with 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:52.410
 reality and the point is not that not 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.480
 playing bad here is amazing but also saw 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.209
 people who play better under the degree 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.820
 but the fact is that they usually chatter 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.980
 a lot of superfluous by the way about chatter 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.020
 the commander should be able to behave strictly 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.480
 and stop literally in an orderly tone 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.340
 all the extra talk in battle all that 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.290
 I'm longer on recharge or me 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.050
 lit up on the air should not sound 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.030
 by the way, be sure to check when selecting 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.040
 voice communication guys who take 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.040
 there are just those who don't know about her 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.320
 Oh, such a surprise battle you do not need 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.660
 there may also be all sorts of screamers or 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.060
 meek who better sky right to 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.100
 make yourself quieter or louder either altogether 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.380
 silent until the end of ages 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.470
 if your subordinate doesn't have a microphone 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.209
 no matter the main thing that he heard you as 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.400
 total your target contingent 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.890
 these are guys who can hear you and 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.310
 can set the tank you want not 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.400
 be afraid 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.620
 send in 12 fights to the reserve of that 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.080
 showed disobedience either just 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.239
 turned out to be a real and unbearable cancer 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.820
 Although here stand to note that the chance to give them 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.410
 worth it sometimes can just not lead and you 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.989
 lose valuable player 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.650
 Well, basically a good story 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.080
 the commander 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.930
 finish in the next issue we'll talk 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.940
 what setups can you collect and which 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.790
 popular tanks to take in a team battle 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.489
 not worth it and why is it today with everything 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.560
 you were i grew up was lighting write in 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.959
 comments that you think you need 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.010
 to the barrier and what else can you add to 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.110
 my words i 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.290
 be sure to read everything and whenever possible 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:25.280
