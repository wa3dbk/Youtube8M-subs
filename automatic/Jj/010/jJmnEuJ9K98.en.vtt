 [music] 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.250
 very interesting and everyday topic is 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.060
 main filters which generally 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.890
 just separate them can be a person 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.230
 the master doesnâ€™t care where 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.290
 what dose it is full 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.980
 fantasy that is what they themselves need 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:42.440
 probably ask Timur which is all and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.960
 will tell we are now in front of us 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.050
 main filters are all standard 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.129
 slimline standard 10-inch crankcase 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.000
 come here 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.399
 they come in various sizes sense 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.070
 input / output may vary by 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.350
 size 2 winters to connecting 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.439
 sizes from 1 2 inches to an inch can 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.700
 vary the production of all this with 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.920
 Taiwan is a good plastic and what 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.780
 even when there can be absolutely any 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.820
 that is, beginner that polypropylene yes 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.640
 as shown on search times extremely 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.020
 8 white in this so you can lacetti 100 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.100
 meters we talked back in 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.350
 automatic systems 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.540
 coal can be placed separately canisters 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.580
 any backfill can fall asleep in them 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.130
 put directly highway 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.250
 usually as it is done go to the house 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.890
 or to the country before the pump to the sand 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.900
 Nekrasov pump pump or something else 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.460
 so that the trunk arrived here 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.259
 directly in front of the house 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.460
 they put very large 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.710
 performance 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.259
 will get a minute to clear up to 100 well plus 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.520
 still some look there pressure let's 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.409
 Briefly I look here 4 here painting seen 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.259
 you can attach it to understand the strap yes 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.899
 it means different for example it is a head from 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.880
 this head here is a post here of course not 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.430
 in fact 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.030
 love these two between each other keeps 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.280
 what they have removable is exactly the bottom 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.800
 part of the body that is the bottom part of it 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.739
 different and here is a separate one so 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.420
 here is the removable cover of this it is absolutely 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:23.120
 similar mechanism 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.769
 while at the very left he has 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.860
 It is candles that are set only separately. 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.900
 at the same time the cover remains in place 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.030
 some advantages from one or another 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.200
 type is not here exactly what an amateur 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.760
 who likes what and the look 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.450
 from this the difference is here accordingly 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.400
 the entire load goes to the cover itself that is 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.099
 the body performs the minimum function 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.170
 here plastic together is thickened everywhere 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.269
 around the perimeter because the load if 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:58.010
 there is pressure that must be experienced 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:03:00.440
 there is a case on which these cards 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.060
 intended trunk filters 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:09.049
 cold water only 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:12.260
 it's not anymore, I basically understood everything 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.440
 the difference of their incomprehensible here is thickened 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.239
 the plastic twists the head here at these 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.519
 separate inlet and outlet openings 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.920
 they may be of different size diameters 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:29.389
 all have brass inserts 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.130
 which is very useful here to prove or would 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.380
 and fittings that will be used 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.709
 any adapters they steel reliably 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.930
 sit down nothing burst but also they 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.930
 dumping there is this naturally air 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.530
 keys here here before using under 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.350
 by plane 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.350
 a screwdriver 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:04:08.129
