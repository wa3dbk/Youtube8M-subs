as<00:00:22.750> some<00:00:22.989> renovations<00:00:23.649> are<00:00:23.800> going<00:00:24.040> on<00:00:24.160> so

as some renovations are going on so

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.299 
as some renovations are going on so
that's<00:00:25.270> a<00:00:25.329> bit<00:00:25.450> of<00:00:25.540> unfortunate<00:00:26.140> timing<00:00:26.380> so

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:27.309 
that's a bit of unfortunate timing so

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:31.620 
that's a bit of unfortunate timing so
then<00:00:27.570> I've<00:00:28.570> got<00:00:28.750> my<00:00:29.309> lovely<00:00:30.309> vehicular<00:00:31.119> area

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
then I've got my lovely vehicular area

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.770 
then I've got my lovely vehicular area
to<00:00:32.020> go<00:00:32.140> so<00:00:32.380> road<00:00:32.590> bike<00:00:32.860> but<00:00:33.790> I'm<00:00:34.090> not<00:00:34.360> a<00:00:34.390> big<00:00:34.570> fan

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
to go so road bike but I'm not a big fan

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.140 
to go so road bike but I'm not a big fan
of<00:00:34.840> these<00:00:35.020> pedals<00:00:35.470> at<00:00:35.590> all<00:00:35.800> I<00:00:36.040> don't<00:00:36.790> like<00:00:36.970> the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
of these pedals at all I don't like the

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.620 
of these pedals at all I don't like the
idea<00:00:37.270> of<00:00:37.510> being<00:00:37.720> strapped<00:00:38.260> onto<00:00:38.530> it<00:00:38.830> so<00:00:39.630> well

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
idea of being strapped onto it so well

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.300 
idea of being strapped onto it so well
and<00:00:40.840> it<00:00:41.050> makes<00:00:41.170> it<00:00:41.410> very<00:00:41.530> difficult<00:00:41.830> to<00:00:42.070> hang

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
and it makes it very difficult to hang

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.040 
and it makes it very difficult to hang
at<00:00:42.430> your<00:00:42.460> forearm<00:00:42.970> if<00:00:43.210> you've<00:00:43.510> got<00:00:43.630> the<00:00:43.780> stuff

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
at your forearm if you've got the stuff

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.440 
at your forearm if you've got the stuff
to<00:00:44.320> wait<00:00:44.650> to<00:00:44.800> get<00:00:44.920> into<00:00:45.190> traffic<00:00:45.450> junctions

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
to wait to get into traffic junctions

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.990 
to wait to get into traffic junctions
and<00:00:46.630> things<00:00:46.840> like<00:00:47.020> that<00:00:47.230> and<00:00:47.950> I'm<00:00:48.130> just<00:00:48.790> not<00:00:48.970> a

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
and things like that and I'm just not a

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.350 
and things like that and I'm just not a
big<00:00:49.090> fan<00:00:49.240> of<00:00:49.510> this<00:00:49.810> sort<00:00:50.110> of<00:00:50.430> general<00:00:51.430> pedal<00:00:51.850> or

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
big fan of this sort of general pedal or

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.330 
big fan of this sort of general pedal or
basically<00:00:53.079> having<00:00:53.560> your<00:00:53.680> foot<00:00:53.829> physically

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
basically having your foot physically

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.390 
basically having your foot physically
attached<00:00:54.640> to<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:55.030> bike<00:00:55.180> so<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.860> solve<00:00:57.100> this

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
attached to the bike so to solve this

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.300 
attached to the bike so to solve this
today<00:00:57.880> I<00:00:58.350> literally<00:00:59.350> have<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.739> go<00:00:59.890> to<00:01:00.040> the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
they're not and another thing to be

table and they will be Mac so make sure

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.870 
table and they will be Mac so make sure
you<00:01:40.720> keep<00:01:40.900> an<00:01:41.080> eye<00:01:41.170> on<00:01:41.200> that<00:01:41.530> as<00:01:41.740> when<00:01:42.549> a<00:01:42.580> side

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
you keep an eye on that as when a side

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.789 
you keep an eye on that as when a side
will<00:01:43.119> screw<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.690> anti-clockwise<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.440> the

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.450 
other will spewing o'clock weight which
is<00:01:46.720> about<00:01:47.320> 2<00:01:47.530> something<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.979> little<00:01:48.189> bit<00:01:48.310> random

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
is about 2 something a little bit random

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.390 
is about 2 something a little bit random
that<00:01:48.820> I<00:01:48.880> thought<00:01:49.530> if<00:01:50.530> your<00:01:50.770> pedals<00:01:51.100> have<00:01:51.189> been

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
that I thought if your pedals have been

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.859 
that I thought if your pedals have been
on<00:01:51.580> for<00:01:51.729> a<00:01:51.820> long<00:01:52.000> time<00:01:52.270> then<00:01:52.479> there's<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.689> good

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
on for a long time then there's a good

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.810 
on for a long time then there's a good
chance<00:01:52.930> this<00:01:53.350> could<00:01:53.530> be<00:01:53.680> exceptionally<00:01:54.400> stiff

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
chance this could be exceptionally stiff

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.480 
chance this could be exceptionally stiff

vs.<00:02:02.590> bike<00:02:02.830> so<00:02:03.640> if<00:02:04.180> I<00:02:04.390> just<00:02:04.869> unscrew<00:02:05.350> these

vs. bike so if I just unscrew these
you'll<00:02:06.189> see<00:02:06.369> how<00:02:06.549> simple<00:02:06.820> a<00:02:07.000> job<00:02:07.210> this<00:02:07.390> really

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
you'll see how simple a job this really

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:24.430 
you'll see how simple a job this really
is

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.130 

if<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.650> wondering<00:02:26.280> why<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:27.030> boat<00:02:27.660> was<00:02:27.990> moving

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
around so much

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.630 
around so much
just<00:02:30.180> then<00:02:30.420> there's<00:02:31.050> because<00:02:31.530> there<00:02:31.800> was<00:02:31.950> of

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
just then there's because there was of

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.360 
just then there's because there was of
course<00:02:32.700> another<00:02:33.240> boat<00:02:33.810> passing<00:02:34.320> once<00:02:35.160> you've

course another boat passing once you've
tightened<00:02:35.820> them<00:02:35.970> up<00:02:36.120> with<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.630> spanner<00:02:36.930> they
