to<00:00:12.450> one<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.719> my<00:00:12.840> replays<00:00:13.290> it's<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.130> TRA<00:00:14.490> tag

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
to one of my replays it's the TRA tag

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.600 
to one of my replays it's the TRA tag
destroy<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> t28<00:00:15.630> prot<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.250> it's<00:00:17.250> going<00:00:17.520> to

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
destroy the t28 prot and it's going to

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.300 
destroy the t28 prot and it's going to
be<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.790> bit<00:00:18.029> silly<00:00:18.360> this<00:00:19.110> is<00:00:19.290> quite<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.770> short

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
be a bit silly this is quite a short

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.609 
be a bit silly this is quite a short
replay<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.270> it's<00:00:21.509> not<00:00:21.779> going<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.170> lack<00:00:22.380> for

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
replay but it's not going to lack for

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.620 
replay but it's not going to lack for
action<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.190> don't<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> lot<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.060> time<00:00:24.360> to<00:00:24.480> sit

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
action I don't have a lot of time to sit

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.849 
action I don't have a lot of time to sit
down<00:00:24.660> record<00:00:25.140> something<00:00:25.320> today<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.710> I

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
down record something today so I

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.410 
down record something today so I
deliberately<00:00:26.460> picked<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:26.940> something<00:00:27.210> that

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
deliberately picked out something that

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.830 
deliberately picked out something that
was<00:00:28.350> both<00:00:28.529> short<00:00:28.980> but<00:00:29.400> interesting<00:00:30.270> at<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
was both short but interesting at the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.049 
was both short but interesting at the
same<00:00:31.050> time<00:00:31.289> I'm<00:00:31.740> short<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.099> replays<00:00:32.430> also<00:00:32.790> let

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
same time I'm short of replays also let

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.090 
same time I'm short of replays also let
me<00:00:33.210> encodes<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.019> climb<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:34.680> real<00:00:34.890> turn

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
me encodes the climb of the real turn

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.549 
me encodes the climb of the real turn
slightly<00:00:35.790> higher<00:00:36.059> quality<00:00:36.629> rate<00:00:36.840> as<00:00:37.019> well<00:00:37.230> so

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
slightly higher quality rate as well so

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.850 
slightly higher quality rate as well so
that<00:00:37.769> is<00:00:38.220> also<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.580> benefit<00:00:39.320> but<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.379> prot<00:00:40.620> is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
that is also a benefit but the prot is

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.130 
that is also a benefit but the prot is
for<00:00:41.640> me<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.300> stepping<00:00:42.659> stone<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.019> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
for me just a stepping stone to the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.140 
for me just a stepping stone to the
teeth<00:00:43.350> 30<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.040> I'm<00:00:44.250> actually<00:00:44.430> not<00:00:44.699> that<00:00:44.760> far

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
teeth 30 and I'm actually not that far

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.369 
teeth 30 and I'm actually not that far
off<00:00:45.180> now<00:00:45.659> I've<00:00:45.930> talked<00:00:46.110> about<00:00:46.260> this

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
off now I've talked about this

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.200 
off now I've talked about this
previously<00:00:46.799> it's<00:00:47.010> not<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.220> first<00:00:47.400> prop<00:00:47.909> game

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
previously it's not the first prop game

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.520 
previously it's not the first prop game
of<00:00:48.360> my<00:00:48.510> own<00:00:48.659> that<00:00:48.690> I've<00:00:48.930> put<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.409> this

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
of my own that I've put up on this

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.600 
of my own that I've put up on this
channel<00:00:49.940> but<00:00:50.940> uh<00:00:51.269> it<00:00:52.019> really<00:00:52.049> is<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.610> like

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
channel but uh it really is just like

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.890 
channel but uh it really is just like
I'm<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:53.909> playing<00:00:54.150> this<00:00:54.269> for<00:00:54.420> itself<00:00:54.690> i'm

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
I'm not playing this for itself i'm

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.990 
I'm not playing this for itself i'm
playing<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.409> get<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.830> the<00:00:55.979> t30<00:00:56.519> and<00:00:56.879> i'm

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
playing this to get to the t30 and i'm

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.990 
playing this to get to the t30 and i'm
quite<00:00:57.210> close<00:00:57.540> now<00:00:57.809> I've<00:00:58.019> got<00:00:58.199> maybe<00:00:58.739> 30,000<00:00:59.580> XP

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
quite close now I've got maybe 30,000 XP

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.380 
quite close now I've got maybe 30,000 XP
as<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.780> recording<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.619> get<00:01:02.369> to<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.610> t30<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
as of recording to get to the t30 and

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.810 
as of recording to get to the t30 and
that<00:01:03.540> isn't<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.500> far<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:05.040> that's<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.460> that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that isn't so far at all that's not that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.140 
that isn't so far at all that's not that
many<00:01:06.270> more<00:01:06.600> daily<00:01:07.110> doubles<00:01:08.030> provided<00:01:09.030> they're

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
many more daily doubles provided they're

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.270 
many more daily doubles provided they're
decent<00:01:09.540> daily<00:01:09.719> doubles<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.079> course<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.560> don't

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
decent daily doubles of course I don't

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.099 
decent daily doubles of course I don't
tend<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.789> sit<00:01:11.939> down<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.180> grind<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.719> thing<00:01:12.990> I

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.109 
tend to sit down and grind this thing I

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:15.139 
tend to sit down and grind this thing I
just<00:01:13.320> play<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.829> dailies<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.430> that's

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
just play it for the dailies and that's

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.330 
just play it for the dailies and that's
worked<00:01:15.450> out<00:01:15.630> reasonably<00:01:16.140> well<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:16.619> even<00:01:17.100> so

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
worked out reasonably well but even so

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.039 
worked out reasonably well but even so
I've<00:01:17.640> had<00:01:17.789> some<00:01:17.969> really<00:01:18.210> frustrating<00:01:18.840> games

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
I've had some really frustrating games

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.139 
I've had some really frustrating games
with<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.350> thing<00:01:19.560> because<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.399> it's

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
with this thing because it's just it's

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.010 
with this thing because it's just it's
not<00:01:21.600> good<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.619> really<00:01:22.950> isn't<00:01:23.840> pretty<00:01:24.840> much

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
not good it really isn't pretty much

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
not good it really isn't pretty much
everything<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.979> does<00:01:26.039> the<00:01:26.820> right<00:01:26.969> metal

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
everything it does the right metal

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.889 
everything it does the right metal
borsuk<00:01:27.810> does<00:01:28.079> better<00:01:28.469> although<00:01:28.859> I<00:01:28.950> will<00:01:29.280> say

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
borsuk does better although I will say

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.740 
borsuk does better although I will say
the<00:01:30.899> view<00:01:31.439> range<00:01:31.619> nerf<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.250> happened<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.939> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the view range nerf that happened in I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.230 
the view range nerf that happened in I
was<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.320> 9.5<00:01:34.469> my<00:01:35.369> point<00:01:35.579> 6<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.880> can't<00:01:36.090> remember

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
was in 9.5 my point 6 I can't remember

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.139 
was in 9.5 my point 6 I can't remember
but<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.289> lot<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.340> higher<00:01:38.520> tier<00:01:38.820> 10

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
but a lot of the higher tier 10

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.789 
but a lot of the higher tier 10
Australia's<00:01:39.570> got<00:01:39.780> hit<00:01:40.020> hard<00:01:40.289> including<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
Australia's got hit hard including the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.039 
Australia's got hit hard including the
ball<00:01:41.009> sick<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.820> dropped<00:01:42.090> down<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> 360

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
ball sick that dropped down to 360

ball sick that dropped down to 360
meters<00:01:43.200> view<00:01:43.530> range<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:44.399> actually<00:01:44.729> didn't

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
meters view range this actually didn't

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.349 
meters view range this actually didn't
get<00:01:45.509> touched<00:01:45.719> at<00:01:45.990> all<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:47.340> got<00:01:47.670> relatively

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
get touched at all so it got relatively

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.270 
get touched at all so it got relatively
better<00:01:48.659> even<00:01:49.079> though<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> actual<00:01:49.530> view<00:01:50.100> range

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
better even though the actual view range

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.819 
better even though the actual view range
didn't<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.999> buffed<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.689> now<00:01:51.929> has<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.590> the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
shot in the health care and I somehow

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.070 
shot in the health care and I somehow
improbably<00:04:00.790> managed<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.450> survive<00:04:01.660> that

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
improbably managed to survive that

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.400 
improbably managed to survive that
absolute<00:04:02.560> onslaught<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.420> was<00:04:04.630> just<00:04:05.019> I

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
absolute onslaught and it was just I

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.380 
absolute onslaught and it was just I
could<00:04:06.040> not<00:04:06.220> repeat<00:04:06.549> this<00:04:06.670> again<00:04:06.850> if<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.150> tried

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
could not repeat this again if I tried

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.420 
could not repeat this again if I tried
like<00:04:07.570> this<00:04:07.720> is<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.560> only<00:04:08.739> time<00:04:09.070> this<00:04:09.280> has

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
like this is the only time this has

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.710 
like this is the only time this has
actually<00:04:09.580> happened<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:10.090> me<00:04:10.150> in<00:04:10.299> the<00:04:10.360> prop<00:04:10.570> that

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
actually happened to me in the prop that

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.660 
actually happened to me in the prop that
I<00:04:10.780> face<00:04:11.049> that<00:04:11.080> many<00:04:11.530> enemies<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.040> actually

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
I face that many enemies and actually

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.000 
I face that many enemies and actually
somehow<00:04:13.110> survived

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
somehow survived

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.069 
somehow survived
and<00:04:15.269> as<00:04:16.269> I<00:04:16.359> was<00:04:16.419> saying<00:04:16.630> you<00:04:16.750> know<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.930> ball

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
and as I was saying you know the ball

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.629 
and as I was saying you know the ball
sig<00:04:17.320> does<00:04:17.500> most<00:04:17.739> things<00:04:17.979> better<00:04:18.220> but<00:04:18.519> it

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
sig does most things better but it

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.110 
sig does most things better but it
couldn't<00:04:18.940> do<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.859> it<00:04:20.859> really<00:04:21.160> couldn't<00:04:21.579> so

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
couldn't do that it really couldn't so

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.030 
couldn't do that it really couldn't so
it's<00:04:22.479> just<00:04:22.690> like<00:04:22.900> one<00:04:23.380> of<00:04:23.410> those<00:04:23.560> times<00:04:23.860> when

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
it's just like one of those times when

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.469 
it's just like one of those times when
the<00:04:24.130> absolute<00:04:24.550> perfect<00:04:24.760> combination<00:04:25.180> of

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
the absolute perfect combination of

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.939 
the absolute perfect combination of
circumstances<00:04:25.800> conspired<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:28.650> provide<00:04:29.650> for

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
circumstances conspired to I provide for

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.790 
circumstances conspired to I provide for
a<00:04:30.010> very<00:04:30.280> very<00:04:30.400> very<00:04:30.910> hair-raising<00:04:31.720> what<00:04:32.500> was

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
a very very very hair-raising what was

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.189 
a very very very hair-raising what was
like<00:04:32.979> two<00:04:33.160> minutes<00:04:33.400> maybe<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.690> wasn't<00:04:34.900> more

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
like two minutes maybe it wasn't more

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.930 
like two minutes maybe it wasn't more
than<00:04:35.229> that<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:36.479> I<00:04:37.949> still<00:04:38.949> nearly<00:04:39.190> died<00:04:39.520> but

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
than that and I still nearly died but

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.909 
than that and I still nearly died but
even<00:04:40.330> so<00:04:40.570> I'm<00:04:41.020> they<00:04:41.260> actually<00:04:41.289> still<00:04:41.800> gonna

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
even so I'm they actually still gonna

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.430 
even so I'm they actually still gonna
kill<00:04:42.190> me<00:04:42.400> like<00:04:42.580> if<00:04:42.760> they<00:04:42.970> hadn't<00:04:43.449> just<00:04:43.750> been<00:04:43.870> um

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
kill me like if they hadn't just been um

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.430 
kill me like if they hadn't just been um
I<00:04:45.430> think<00:04:46.210> it<00:04:46.479> was<00:04:46.539> rushing<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:46.990> shot<00:04:47.199> because

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
I think it was rushing that shot because

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.379 
I think it was rushing that shot because
even<00:04:47.949> with<00:04:48.190> those<00:04:48.400> guns<00:04:48.699> it's<00:04:49.060> still

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
even with those guns it's still

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.900 
even with those guns it's still
perfectly<00:04:49.990> possible<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.620> pen<00:04:51.220> a<00:04:51.250> prop<00:04:51.580> from

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
perfectly possible to pen a prop from

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.480 
perfectly possible to pen a prop from
the<00:04:52.120> front<00:04:52.360> even<00:04:52.600> with<00:04:52.690> this<00:04:52.750> matchmaking<00:04:53.490> the

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
the front even with this matchmaking the

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.700 
the front even with this matchmaking the
turret<00:04:54.850> has<00:04:55.030> some<00:04:55.270> weaker<00:04:55.539> areas<00:04:55.690> next<00:04:56.440> to<00:04:56.620> the

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
turret has some weaker areas next to the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.700 
turret has some weaker areas next to the
gun<00:04:56.949> there's<00:04:57.280> actually<00:04:57.580> an<00:04:57.699> mg<00:04:58.030> port<00:04:58.360> and

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
gun there's actually an mg port and

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.629 
gun there's actually an mg port and
there's<00:04:59.710> always<00:04:59.949> the<00:05:00.039> option<00:05:00.070> of<00:05:00.370> shooting

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
there's always the option of shooting

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.930 
there's always the option of shooting
the<00:05:00.669> sidearm<00:05:01.180> as<00:05:01.389> well<00:05:01.630> so<00:05:02.520> yeah<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.669> only

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
the sidearm as well so yeah the only

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.629 
the sidearm as well so yeah the only
decent<00:05:04.120> armor<00:05:04.360> this<00:05:04.539> has<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.430> front<00:05:06.430> plate

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
decent armor this has is the front plate

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.400 
decent armor this has is the front plate
basically<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.389> turret<00:05:07.690> armor<00:05:07.930> is<00:05:08.020> totally

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
basically the turret armor is totally

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.820 
basically the turret armor is totally
unreliable<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:10.360> side<00:05:10.570> armor<00:05:10.900> is<00:05:11.110> awful

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
unreliable and the side armor is awful

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.159 
unreliable and the side armor is awful
it<00:05:12.070> actually<00:05:12.250> has<00:05:12.490> worse<00:05:12.760> side<00:05:13.030> armor<00:05:13.479> than<00:05:13.750> I

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
it actually has worse side armor than I

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.590 
it actually has worse side armor than I
think<00:05:14.680> I've<00:05:14.830> figured<00:05:15.250> out<00:05:15.520> it<00:05:15.729> was<00:05:15.940> equal<00:05:16.479> to

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
think I've figured out it was equal to

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.140 
think I've figured out it was equal to
or<00:05:16.750> worse<00:05:16.960> than<00:05:17.289> the<00:05:17.620> tier<00:05:17.949> 8<00:05:18.130> American<00:05:18.820> medium

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
or worse than the tier 8 American medium

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.129 
or worse than the tier 8 American medium
tanks<00:05:19.539> it's<00:05:19.990> bad<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:22.150> British<00:05:22.510> td's<00:05:22.870> you<00:05:23.050> know

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
tanks it's bad the British td's you know

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.379 
tanks it's bad the British td's you know
they<00:05:23.289> may<00:05:23.440> be<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:23.710> slow<00:05:24.070> but<00:05:24.460> they<00:05:25.180> at<00:05:25.300> least

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
they may be that slow but they at least

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.210 
they may be that slow but they at least
get<00:05:25.599> some<00:05:25.810> decent<00:05:25.960> side<00:05:26.289> armor<00:05:26.650> so<00:05:26.860> that<00:05:27.070> if

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
get some decent side armor so that if

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.129 
get some decent side armor so that if
you<00:05:27.430> angle<00:05:28.090> your<00:05:28.300> front<00:05:28.570> armor<00:05:28.900> you're<00:05:29.020> not

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
you angle your front armor you're not

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.689 
you angle your front armor you're not
going<00:05:29.349> to<00:05:29.440> be<00:05:29.530> horrific<00:05:29.710> Lee<00:05:30.070> punished<00:05:30.430> for<00:05:30.669> it

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
going to be horrific Lee punished for it

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.610 
going to be horrific Lee punished for it
but<00:05:30.910> that's<00:05:30.970> not<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.330> case<00:05:31.479> with<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.780> bra<00:05:31.960> but

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
but that's not the case with the bra but

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.200 
but that's not the case with the bra but
anyway<00:05:32.889> yeah<00:05:33.070> that<00:05:33.310> was<00:05:33.550> that<00:05:33.820> was<00:05:34.150> a

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
anyway yeah that was that was a

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.719 
anyway yeah that was that was a
ridiculous<00:05:34.419> game<00:05:35.020> and<00:05:35.250> in<00:05:36.250> all<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.520> games

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
ridiculous game and in all the games

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.279 
ridiculous game and in all the games
I've<00:05:36.880> had<00:05:37.030> so<00:05:37.240> far<00:05:37.270> in<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.660> plot<00:05:37.870> I've<00:05:38.050> never

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
I've had so far in the plot I've never

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:39.990 
I've had so far in the plot I've never
had<00:05:38.590> anything<00:05:38.919> like<00:05:39.130> that<00:05:39.400> at<00:05:39.820> all

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
had anything like that at all

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.210 
had anything like that at all
unsurprisingly<00:05:40.900> that<00:05:41.139> was<00:05:41.260> a<00:05:41.289> steel<00:05:41.620> wall<00:05:41.919> but

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
unsurprisingly that was a steel wall but

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.950 
unsurprisingly that was a steel wall but
I<00:05:42.250> also<00:05:42.400> matched<00:05:42.699> a<00:05:42.789> high-caliber<00:05:43.510> there<00:05:43.720> and

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
I also matched a high-caliber there and

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.870 
I also matched a high-caliber there and
the<00:05:44.229> reload<00:05:44.650> of<00:05:44.770> the<00:05:44.860> prop<00:05:45.070> is<00:05:45.280> alright<00:05:45.669> like

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
the reload of the prop is alright like

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.640 
the reload of the prop is alright like
one<00:05:46.000> of<00:05:46.090> the<00:05:46.150> saving<00:05:46.479> graces<00:05:46.870> of<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.050> prot

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
one of the saving graces of the prot

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.400 
one of the saving graces of the prot
about<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.580> only<00:05:48.699> saving<00:05:48.910> grace<00:05:49.030> is<00:05:49.360> the<00:05:49.840> the

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
about the only saving grace is the the

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.250 
about the only saving grace is the the
top<00:05:50.620> gun<00:05:50.949> is<00:05:51.190> actually<00:05:51.639> ok<00:05:51.870> although<00:05:52.870> having

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
top gun is actually ok although having

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.500 
top gun is actually ok although having
said<00:05:53.500> it's<00:05:53.680> okay<00:05:54.280> the<00:05:54.520> accuracy<00:05:55.180> is<00:05:55.210> still

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
said it's okay the accuracy is still

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.200 
said it's okay the accuracy is still
pretty<00:05:55.780> bad<00:05:56.110> like<00:05:56.410> it's<00:05:56.590> slow<00:05:57.130> and<00:05:57.430> a<00:05:57.970> lot<00:05:58.180> of

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
pretty bad like it's slow and a lot of

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.279 
pretty bad like it's slow and a lot of
the<00:05:58.300> time<00:05:58.479> you're<00:05:58.630> going<00:05:58.750> to<00:05:58.810> be<00:05:58.900> left<00:05:59.080> behind

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
the time you're going to be left behind

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.320 
the time you're going to be left behind
and<00:05:59.770> then<00:06:00.250> you're<00:06:00.400> relying<00:06:00.699> on<00:06:00.820> the<00:06:00.909> action<00:06:01.210> if

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
and then you're relying on the action if

juicing<00:06:43.899> nearly<00:06:44.829> five<00:06:45.099> minutes<00:06:45.579> you<00:06:45.759> know

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:45.849 
juicing nearly five minutes you know

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:48.749 
juicing nearly five minutes you know
that<00:06:45.999> was<00:06:47.129> interesting<00:06:48.129> to<00:06:48.429> say<00:06:48.459> the<00:06:48.610> least

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 
that was interesting to say the least

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.889 
that was interesting to say the least
and<00:06:50.039> although<00:06:51.039> it<00:06:51.189> was<00:06:51.339> kind<00:06:51.669> of<00:06:51.759> fun<00:06:52.059> after

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:52.899 
and although it was kind of fun after

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:54.509 
and although it was kind of fun after
the<00:06:53.019> factory<00:06:53.379> while<00:06:53.649> it<00:06:53.769> was<00:06:53.889> happening<00:06:53.919> I<00:06:54.339> was

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:54.519 
the factory while it was happening I was

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:55.679 
the factory while it was happening I was
still<00:06:54.699> convinced<00:06:54.879> that<00:06:55.089> was<00:06:55.299> couldn't<00:06:55.539> die

00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:55.689 
still convinced that was couldn't die

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:58.769 
still convinced that was couldn't die
until<00:06:56.429> really<00:06:57.429> until<00:06:57.699> that<00:06:57.819> t32<00:06:58.299> turned<00:06:58.689> his

00:06:58.769 --> 00:06:58.779 
until really until that t32 turned his

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:00.209 
until really until that t32 turned his
back<00:06:58.899> on<00:06:59.110> me<00:06:59.169> and<00:06:59.349> at<00:06:59.439> that<00:06:59.529> point<00:06:59.709> I<00:06:59.860> thought<00:07:00.039> I

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:00.219 
back on me and at that point I thought I

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:03.779 
back on me and at that point I thought I
might<00:07:00.249> live<00:07:00.729> but<00:07:01.919> even<00:07:02.919> so<00:07:03.399> you<00:07:03.699> know

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:03.789 
might live but even so you know

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.029 
might live but even so you know
performances<00:07:04.300> like<00:07:04.479> this<00:07:04.779> it<00:07:05.589> just<00:07:05.860> doesn't

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 
performances like this it just doesn't

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:07.559 
performances like this it just doesn't
happen<00:07:06.189> often<00:07:06.519> enough<00:07:06.729> in<00:07:06.999> the<00:07:07.059> prop<00:07:07.300> to

happen often enough in the prop to

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:10.439 
happen often enough in the prop to
really<00:07:08.409> make<00:07:09.219> me<00:07:09.429> think<00:07:09.699> any<00:07:09.909> better<00:07:10.149> off<00:07:10.300> it

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:10.449 
really make me think any better off it

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:12.689 
really make me think any better off it
it's<00:07:10.569> still<00:07:10.869> not<00:07:11.139> great<00:07:11.409> and<00:07:12.279> I'm<00:07:12.429> still
