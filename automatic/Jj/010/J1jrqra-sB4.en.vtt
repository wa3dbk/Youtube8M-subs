00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 how about youtube friends in this video 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.000
 we are going to teach you to change the kit 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.370
 Onion packaging lever 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.410
 speeds of a chevy this because 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.230
 it showed failure when making the changes 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.570
 this car was impossible to engage first 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.760
 second and fifth speed if your car 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.770
 present some fault of this type is 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.500
 convenient to check the packages well 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.600
 let's stop blowjobs and start to 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.340
 this has already disassembled the box of the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.250
 speed lever you'll be 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.560
 asking and as mothers is dismantled not 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.600
 Do not worry as we put it together 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.239
 you will learn to do it since it is very easy 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.430
 well the first thing will be that we check if 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.590
 there is a broken or damaged piece in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.510
 this case was broken this bushing on the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.090
 which works the shift rod and what 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.829
 let's replace first we have to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.809
 purchase the packaging kit this 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.700
 you find in any refaccionaria and 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.949
 consists of five pieces two ships of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.360
 two safe rubber and one plastic g 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.820
 the rod that is the one that most 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.350
 we are interested in right now we all 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.170
 our pieces that are the most 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.359
 clean possible observe how the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.549
 Leverage this so you know well how to 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.300
 disarm since being very dirty would be 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.980
 hard 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.110
 the images and when you have it 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.180
 Arming know how to do it first 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.300
 we put the change rod in the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.100
 axis of command this as follows 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.170
 then we introduce the insurance that fixes 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.030
 both pieces and we look that fastens 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.910
 correctly this is done and must 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.010
 look like this now put some fat 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.960
 at the spindle ends and place 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.120
 the packaging as shown in the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.730
 image and place it in the box this should 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.770
 to look like this now place the insurance 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.500
 of the axis as seen in the image of 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.570
 this way it will be fixed now remove the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.400
 change rod and place the support 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.770
 rubber and rod bushing this 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.600
 it should be more or less like this now 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.120
 insert the rod so that it is 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.040
 as well as shows the image at last 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.140
 place the shift rod this has 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.330
 finished should stay as well as 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.390
 go here and let's install it on the floor 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.030
 of the car watch how this guy brings a 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.070
 mud pit under the shifter 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.049
 We will have to clean it, taking care that 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.659
 we will not skip a crocodile 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.340
 this swamp x well has already passed the 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.319
 danger let's continue 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.200
 first introduce the tip of the 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.360
 rod and put it in place and pull 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.580
 with the four screws using a 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.470
 rattle and a dice from a bank 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.500
 that's all, just put the console 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.610
 central and let's go to the last step 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.379
 introduce the tip of the dipstick 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.390
 changes to the linkage of the box 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.310
 speeds this you do below the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.260
 car just verify that they enter 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.900
 all speeds correctly 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.030
 you will see a great improvement in the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.580
 lever and you can easily engage 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.650
 all vehicle speeds well 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.810
 friends that's all remember to leave a 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.549
 like commented subscribe do not forget 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.799
 that all these repair processes 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.210
 are necessary for optimal performance 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.499
 of our car xd 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.499
