kind<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.960> know<00:01:34.520> it's<00:01:35.520> surprising<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.630> just

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
kind of know it's surprising it just

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.090 
kind of know it's surprising it just
doesn't<00:01:38.070> give<00:01:38.369> off<00:01:38.400> much<00:01:38.880> heat<00:01:39.950> for<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
doesn't give off much heat for the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.410 
doesn't give off much heat for the
amount<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.960> for<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> color<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> flame

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
amount of for the color of the flame

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.109 
amount of for the color of the flame
anyway<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.869> works<00:01:46.140> real<00:01:46.500> good<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.119> it'll

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
anyway so that works real good and it'll

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.960 
anyway so that works real good and it'll
burn<00:01:48.420> your<00:01:48.630> water<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.369> ahead<00:01:50.729> when

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
burn your water and as you go ahead when

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.499 
burn your water and as you go ahead when
you're<00:01:51.119> finished<00:01:52.430> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.610> go<00:01:53.820> ahead<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.329> use

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
you're finished you can go ahead and use

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.300 
you're finished you can go ahead and use
this<00:01:54.689> little<00:01:54.930> cover<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.500> give<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.009> snuff

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
this little cover to give you to snuff

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.770 
this little cover to give you to snuff
it<00:01:56.460> out<00:01:57.409> but<00:01:58.409> working<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.610> works<00:02:00.390> good<00:02:00.750> I

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
it out but working so works good I

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.969 
it out but working so works good I
recommend<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.280> stove<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.979> always

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
recommend as I like the stove you always

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.620 
recommend as I like the stove you always
want<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.250> make<00:02:05.310> sure<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.790> out<00:02:05.939> before<00:02:06.420> you

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
want to make sure it's out before you

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.510 
want to make sure it's out before you
put<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> cap<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.560> because<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.979> cap<00:02:08.220> has<00:02:08.489> a

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
put the cap on because the cap has a

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.300 
put the cap on because the cap has a
rubber<00:02:08.940> ring<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.500> helps<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> seal

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
rubber ring in and that helps to seal

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.740 
rubber ring in and that helps to seal
your<00:02:11.550> alcohol<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:12.540> you

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
your alcohol and if you

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.230 
your alcohol and if you
put<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:14.040> burner<00:02:14.310> while<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:14.970> still

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
put that on the burner while it's still

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.380 
put that on the burner while it's still
hot<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:16.230> will<00:02:16.500> destroy<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:16.980> rubber<00:02:17.820> ring<00:02:18.150> in

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
hot it will destroy the rubber ring in

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.770
