00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
handles just a knife itself but actually

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.160 
handles just a knife itself but actually
I've<00:00:38.280> noticed<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.820> lot<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.450> lot<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.770 
I've noticed a lot of the lot of the
simple<00:00:40.559> designs<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.309> i<00:00:41.370> did<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.910> couple<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
simple designs that i did a couple of

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.459 
simple designs that i did a couple of
them<00:00:42.960> actually<00:00:44.660> remember<00:00:45.660> which<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.200> I

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
them actually remember which one was I

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.760 
them actually remember which one was I

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
think yesterday I didn't I think there

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.110 
think yesterday I didn't I think there
was<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> tiger<00:00:50.190> stripe<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.760> something<00:00:51.090> like

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
was a tiger stripe it was something like

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.450 
was a tiger stripe it was something like
this<00:00:51.390> right<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:52.170> looks<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.800> don't<00:00:53.250> know<00:00:53.340> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
this right it looks I don't know it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.639 
this right it looks I don't know it
doesn't<00:00:53.760> look<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.059> hot<00:00:54.500> when<00:00:55.500> it's

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
doesn't look all that hot when it's

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.010 
doesn't look all that hot when it's
without<00:00:56.070> without<00:00:56.460> anything<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.629> once<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
without without anything but once you

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.220 
without without anything but once you
put<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.410> scales<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.219> it<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.230> transforms

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
put the scales on it it just transforms

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
put the scales on it it just transforms
completely<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.160> knife<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.579> wasn't<00:01:02.940> sure

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
completely like this knife I wasn't sure

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.850 
completely like this knife I wasn't sure
when<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.600> started<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.170> how<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:04.530> gonna<00:01:04.650> look

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
when I started like how it's gonna look

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.820 
when I started like how it's gonna look
but<00:01:05.729> once<00:01:06.000> once<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.780> ones<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> handles

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
but once once with the ones the handles

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.980 
but once once with the ones the handles
we're<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.400> think<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.270> turned<00:01:09.630> out<00:01:09.720> pretty

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990

automatically has just super great you

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.849 
automatically has just super great you
know<00:03:19.459> layer<00:03:20.459> for<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.299> epoxy<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.989> create<00:03:22.410> super

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
know layer for the epoxy to create super

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.590 
know layer for the epoxy to create super
good<00:03:23.040> bond<00:03:23.310> if<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:23.640> can<00:03:23.850> get<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.480> know

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
good bond if you can get the you know

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.069 
good bond if you can get the you know
the<00:03:25.019> thicknesses<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.769> need<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:27.079> textured

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
the thicknesses you need in the textured

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.319 
the thicknesses you need in the textured
g10<00:03:29.810> definitely<00:03:30.810> grab<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:33.090> will

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
g10 definitely grab that and it it will

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.539 
g10 definitely grab that and it it will
create<00:03:33.630> super<00:03:34.109> good<00:03:34.290> bone<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.950> will<00:03:35.250> create

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
create super good bone it will create

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.190 
create super good bone it will create
also<00:03:36.030> when<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.299> send<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.660> down<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:37.019> will

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
also when you send it down it will

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.099 
also when you send it down it will
create<00:03:37.440> let<00:03:37.709> me<00:03:37.829> show<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.220> detail<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:39.810> will

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
create let me show you in detail it will

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.319 
create let me show you in detail it will
create<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.920> here<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.489> see<00:03:41.910> that's<00:03:42.180> actually

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
create this here you see that's actually

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.910 
create this here you see that's actually
the<00:03:42.750> bottom<00:03:43.230> of<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:45.239> texture<00:03:45.900> but<00:03:46.709> it

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
the bottom of the of the texture but it

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.210 
the bottom of the of the texture but it
will<00:03:47.100> just<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.519> will<00:03:48.500> maximize<00:03:49.500> your<00:03:49.709> bone<00:03:50.010> of

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
will just it will maximize your bone of

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.849 
will just it will maximize your bone of
the<00:03:50.370> epoxy<00:03:50.819> in<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.120> layers<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.680> that<00:03:52.680> will

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
the epoxy in the layers and that will

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.550 
the epoxy in the layers and that will
now<00:03:53.489> make<00:03:53.700> sure<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.299> will<00:03:54.329> hold<00:03:55.019> stronger

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
now make sure that it will hold stronger

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.930 
now make sure that it will hold stronger
and<00:03:55.680> then<00:03:55.799> whatever<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.250> smooth<00:03:56.549> side<00:03:56.730> is
