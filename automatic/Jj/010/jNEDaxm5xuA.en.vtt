talk about an alternative to shaving so
um<00:00:17.369> usually<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.359> think<00:00:18.510> most<00:00:18.840> people<00:00:19.109> probably

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
um usually I think most people probably

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.580 
um usually I think most people probably
shade<00:00:19.800> their<00:00:20.039> underarms<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:21.350> you<00:00:22.350> know<00:00:22.470> of

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
shade their underarms on you know of

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.140 
shade their underarms on you know of
course<00:00:22.740> girls<00:00:23.990> but<00:00:24.990> some<00:00:25.740> people<00:00:26.039> wax<00:00:26.279> some

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
course girls but some people wax some

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.320 
course girls but some people wax some
people<00:00:27.449> might<00:00:27.689> use<00:00:28.039> like<00:00:29.039> creams<00:00:29.760> such<00:00:30.179> as

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
people might use like creams such as

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.130 
people might use like creams such as
Nair<00:00:30.570> or<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.679> think<00:00:32.040> meat<00:00:32.309> has<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> cream<00:00:33.059> that

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
Nair or I think meat has a cream that

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.209 
Nair or I think meat has a cream that
removes<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> hair<00:00:34.969> but<00:00:35.969> today<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.230> am<00:00:37.829> going<00:00:38.100> to

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219

it's pink and purple and it has tons and
tons<00:02:56.219> of<00:02:57.109> tweezers<00:02:58.219> so<00:02:59.219> as<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.700> can<00:02:59.849> see<00:02:59.909> and

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
it's I believe gold-plated so I don't

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.839 
it's I believe gold-plated so I don't
know<00:03:04.409> if<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.650> makes<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.919> difference<00:03:05.219> but

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
know if that makes a difference but

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.709 
know if that makes a difference but
there's<00:03:06.599> two<00:03:06.840> speeds<00:03:07.139> so<00:03:07.650> one<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.370> two<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.450> of

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
there's two speeds so one and two and of

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.969 
there's two speeds so one and two and of
course<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.169> off<00:03:10.319> um<00:03:12.019> pretty<00:03:13.019> much<00:03:13.109> how<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.620> use

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:13.979
