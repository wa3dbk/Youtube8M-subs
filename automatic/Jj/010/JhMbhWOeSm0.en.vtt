both<00:01:21.030> from<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.480> in<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:22.020> pretty<00:01:22.140> much

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
both from here on in you can pretty much

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.350 
both from here on in you can pretty much
guarantee<00:01:22.500> he's<00:01:23.159> tidy<00:01:23.550> but<00:01:23.820> most<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.150> us<00:01:24.210> on

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
guarantee he's tidy but most of us on

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.610 
guarantee he's tidy but most of us on
this<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.750> let's<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.050> crack<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
this so let's just crack on with the

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.620 
this so let's just crack on with the
transformation<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.430> don't<00:01:26.820> really<00:01:27.420> need<00:01:27.540> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
transformation I don't really need to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:39.110 
transformation I don't really need to
pick<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:28.020> any<00:01:28.230> of<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.409> detail<00:01:33.170> Carolyn<00:01:38.120> and
