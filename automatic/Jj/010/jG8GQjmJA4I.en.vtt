one of my favorite guns he's using the
ak-12<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.450> i'm<00:01:21.540> not<00:01:21.659> sure<00:01:21.720> what<00:01:22.080> attachments

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.770 
or silenced our grip and either of those
setups<00:01:29.159> are<00:01:29.369> pretty<00:01:29.549> good<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.909> personally

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
setups are pretty good I personally

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.210 
setups are pretty good I personally
really<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.110> running<00:01:31.560> grip<00:01:31.770> i<00:01:31.890> think<00:01:32.100> that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
really like running grip i think that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.890 
really like running grip i think that
actually<00:01:32.610> really<00:01:32.880> helps<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.299> with<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
actually really helps out with the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.870 
actually really helps out with the
long-range<00:01:34.439> accuracy<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.250> gun<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:35.850> i

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
long-range accuracy on this gun but i

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.550 
long-range accuracy on this gun but i
guess<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.180> close-quarters<00:01:36.750> naps<00:01:36.960> kind<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.409> I

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
guess for close-quarters naps kind of I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.140 
guess for close-quarters naps kind of I
guess<00:01:37.680> kind<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.220> drummer<00:01:38.490> silencer

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
guess kind of like drummer silencer

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.640 
guess kind of like drummer silencer
extended<00:01:39.509> mags<00:01:39.659> could<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> better<00:01:40.290> setup

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
extended mags could be the better setup

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.289 
extended mags could be the better setup
but<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.369> been<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> while<00:01:41.729> since<00:01:41.939> I've<00:01:42.119> done<00:01:42.150> a

trap<00:02:51.390> them<00:02:51.540> at<00:02:51.660> out<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.080> flag<00:02:52.530> or<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:52.830> C

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
trap them at out of the a flag or the C

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.650 
trap them at out of the a flag or the C
flag<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.580> can<00:02:53.730> get<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.880> lot<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.120> kills<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.600> a

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
flag you can get a lot of kills in a

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.650 
flag you can get a lot of kills in a
pretty<00:02:54.870> short<00:02:55.080> period<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.680> time<00:02:56.330> but<00:02:57.330> i<00:02:57.390> don't

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
pretty short period of time but i don't

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.030 
pretty short period of time but i don't
really<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.110> bee<00:02:58.230> spawn<00:02:58.500> trap<00:02:58.770> on<00:02:58.920> this

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
really like the bee spawn trap on this

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.530 
really like the bee spawn trap on this
map<00:02:59.190> doesn't<00:02:59.400> really<00:02:59.640> ever<00:02:59.760> seem<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.060> work<00:03:00.330> out

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
map doesn't really ever seem to work out

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.660 
map doesn't really ever seem to work out
so<00:03:01.230> tremor<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.770> probably<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.130> first<00:03:02.160> map<00:03:02.520> that

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
so tremor is probably the first map that

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.220 
so tremor is probably the first map that
I<00:03:02.730> really<00:03:03.000> enjoy<00:03:03.030> getting<00:03:03.420> kem<00:03:03.720> strikes<00:03:04.050> on

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
I really enjoy getting kem strikes on

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.870 
I really enjoy getting kem strikes on
another<00:03:04.800> map<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.220> think<00:03:05.490> I've<00:03:05.610> gotten

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
another map that I think I've gotten

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.000 
another map that I think I've gotten
actually<00:03:06.300> pretty<00:03:06.480> good<00:03:06.690> at<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:07.020> whiteout<00:03:07.560> now

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
actually pretty good at is whiteout now

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.010 
actually pretty good at is whiteout now
I<00:03:08.220> feel<00:03:08.550> like<00:03:08.640> whiteout<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.420> map<00:03:09.990> that

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
I feel like whiteout is a map that

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.780 
I feel like whiteout is a map that
people<00:03:10.470> most<00:03:10.830> people<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.250> won't<00:03:11.550> really

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
people most people like won't really

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.220 
people most people like won't really
enjoy<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.180> much<00:03:12.510> but<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.720> feel<00:03:12.960> like<00:03:12.990> it

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
enjoy that much but I feel like it

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.470 
enjoy that much but I feel like it
Flay's<00:03:13.590> pretty<00:03:14.220> well<00:03:14.490> like<00:03:14.760> if<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.240> can<00:03:15.360> get

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
Flay's pretty well like if you can get

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.600 
Flay's pretty well like if you can get
them<00:03:15.600> at<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> spawn<00:03:16.380> trap<00:03:16.680> on<00:03:16.890> domination

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
them at the a spawn trap on domination

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.270 
them at the a spawn trap on domination
it's<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.209> pretty<00:03:18.420> solid<00:03:18.660> map<00:03:18.959> um<00:03:19.200> one<00:03:20.040> an<00:03:20.130> app

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
it's a pretty solid map um one an app

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.830 
it's a pretty solid map um one an app
that<00:03:20.310> has<00:03:20.550> really<00:03:20.820> started<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.300> grown<00:03:21.510> on<00:03:21.660> that

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
that has really started to grown on that

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.050 
that has really started to grown on that
grow<00:03:22.050> on<00:03:22.080> me<00:03:22.320> is<00:03:22.640> Stonehaven<00:03:23.640> believe<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.000> or

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
grow on me is Stonehaven believe it or

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.940 
grow on me is Stonehaven believe it or
not<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:24.480> know<00:03:24.540> everyone<00:03:25.260> probably<00:03:25.560> hates

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
not and I know everyone probably hates

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.050 
not and I know everyone probably hates
Stonehaven<00:03:26.520> because<00:03:26.670> there's<00:03:26.850> so<00:03:26.970> many

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
Stonehaven because there's so many

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.910 
Stonehaven because there's so many
snipers<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.660> whatnot<00:03:28.080> but<00:03:28.560> if<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.770> can

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
snipers and whatnot but if you can

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.460 
snipers and whatnot but if you can
actually<00:03:29.100> get<00:03:29.340> them<00:03:29.520> in<00:03:29.730> either<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.840> B<00:03:31.140> flag

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
actually get them in either the B flag

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.790 
actually get them in either the B flag
or<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:32.430> C<00:03:32.640> flag<00:03:32.940> on<00:03:33.209> Stonehaven<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.900> preferably

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
or the C flag on Stonehaven I preferably

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.729 
or the C flag on Stonehaven I preferably
the<00:03:35.010> B<00:03:35.190> flag<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:36.180> Stonehaven<00:03:37.170> can<00:03:37.290> actually

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
the B flag but Stonehaven can actually

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.070 
the B flag but Stonehaven can actually
be<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.890> decent<00:03:38.370> spawn<00:03:38.850> trap<00:03:39.120> like<00:03:39.330> I<00:03:39.390> think<00:03:39.630> when

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
be a decent spawn trap like I think when

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.160 
be a decent spawn trap like I think when
and<00:03:40.530> if<00:03:41.100> people<00:03:41.430> are<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:42.180> start<00:03:42.480> support<00:03:42.930> again

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
and if people are to start support again

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.750 
and if people are to start support again
you<00:03:43.320> know<00:03:43.410> maybe<00:03:43.620> in<00:03:43.739> another<00:03:43.830> six<00:03:44.280> months<00:03:44.370> or

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
you know maybe in another six months or

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.350 
you know maybe in another six months or
so<00:03:44.840> hopefully<00:03:45.840> um<00:03:46.130> well<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.640> know<00:03:47.730> I'm<00:03:48.120> saying

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
so hopefully um well you know I'm saying

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.449 
so hopefully um well you know I'm saying
hopefully<00:03:48.510> than<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.140> it's<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.920> while<00:03:50.130> from

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
hopefully than that it's a while from

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.270 
hopefully than that it's a while from
now<00:03:50.550> um<00:03:50.970> if<00:03:51.600> people<00:03:52.230> start<00:03:52.440> support<00:03:52.830> in<00:03:53.010> six

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
now um if people start support in six

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.100 
now um if people start support in six
months<00:03:53.430> or<00:03:53.640> whatever<00:03:53.790> stonehaven<00:03:54.660> i<00:03:54.810> think<00:03:55.019> is

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
months or whatever stonehaven i think is

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.570 
months or whatever stonehaven i think is
going<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.320> be<00:03:55.350> a<00:03:55.440> good<00:03:55.620> map<00:03:55.830> i'm<00:03:56.190> going<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.400> call

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
going to be a good map i'm going to call

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.729 
going to be a good map i'm going to call
it<00:03:56.610> right<00:03:56.880> now<00:03:57.060> people<00:03:57.660> probably<00:03:58.110> drop<00:03:58.410> quad

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
it right now people probably drop quad

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.130 
it right now people probably drop quad
kem<00:03:59.070> strikes<00:03:59.430> on<00:03:59.610> Stonehaven<00:04:00.090> but<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:00.989> guess

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
kem strikes on Stonehaven but I guess

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.350 
kem strikes on Stonehaven but I guess
we'll<00:04:01.290> see<00:04:01.470> right<00:04:01.680> um<00:04:01.890> but<00:04:02.400> Stonehaven<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.180> B

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
we'll see right um but Stonehaven the B

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.199 
we'll see right um but Stonehaven the B
flag<00:04:04.080> is<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.320> pretty<00:04:04.590> good<00:04:04.860> flag<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.550> trap<00:04:06.030> them

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
flag is a pretty good flag to trap them

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.850 
flag is a pretty good flag to trap them
at<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.600> I<00:04:06.930> definitely<00:04:07.110> recommend<00:04:07.410> giving

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
at and I definitely recommend giving

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.590 
at and I definitely recommend giving
that<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.160> shot<00:04:08.519> if<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.030> have<00:04:09.239> them<00:04:09.390> at<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.570> a

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
that a shot if you have them at the a

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.680 
that a shot if you have them at the a
flag<00:04:10.019> Stonehaven<00:04:10.590> is<00:04:10.709> really<00:04:11.220> bad<00:04:11.430> hate<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.269> if

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
flag Stonehaven is really bad hate it if

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.540 
flag Stonehaven is really bad hate it if
you<00:04:12.840> ever<00:04:12.870> met<00:04:13.110> seat<00:04:13.410> can<00:04:13.620> be<00:04:13.650> okay<00:04:14.160> but

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
you ever met seat can be okay but

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.220 
you ever met seat can be okay but
preferably<00:04:15.300> if<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.570> can<00:04:15.690> get<00:04:15.780> them<00:04:15.900> at<00:04:15.989> be

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
preferably if you can get them at be

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.080 
preferably if you can get them at be
it's<00:04:16.620> actually<00:04:16.980> a<00:04:17.010> nice<00:04:17.190> little<00:04:17.459> trap<00:04:17.790> you<00:04:17.970> can

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
it's actually a nice little trap you can

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.630 
it's actually a nice little trap you can
get<00:04:18.239> going<00:04:18.600> so<00:04:19.169> I'd<00:04:19.680> recommend<00:04:19.859> checking<00:04:20.340> that

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
get going so I'd recommend checking that

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.790 
get going so I'd recommend checking that
out<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:21.660> then<00:04:21.690> other<00:04:21.989> ones<00:04:22.229> that<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.410> like<00:04:22.650> you

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
out and then other ones that I like you

sort<00:04:27.389> of<00:04:27.479> reminds<00:04:27.750> me<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.960> dome<00:04:28.889> from<00:04:29.099> mw3<00:04:29.580> it

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
sort of reminds me of dome from mw3 it

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.930 
sort of reminds me of dome from mw3 it
is<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.360> same<00:04:30.539> exact<00:04:30.960> map<00:04:31.229> layout<00:04:31.669> are<00:04:32.669> very

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
is the same exact map layout are very

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.659 
is the same exact map layout are very
similar<00:04:33.270> map<00:04:33.660> layout<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:35.490> thing<00:04:35.610> about

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
similar map layout and the thing about

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.309 
similar map layout and the thing about
dome<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.210> that<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:36.509> just<00:04:36.780> didn't<00:04:36.990> really<00:04:37.169> like

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
dome is that I just didn't really like

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.140 
dome is that I just didn't really like
how<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.500> played<00:04:37.830> in<00:04:37.979> mw3<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.729> I'm<00:04:38.789> not<00:04:38.940> the

how it played in mw3 and I'm not the

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.480 
how it played in mw3 and I'm not the
biggest<00:04:39.419> fan<00:04:39.569> of<00:04:39.690> it<00:04:39.900> either<00:04:40.020> an<00:04:40.349> incall<00:04:41.190> duty

biggest fan of it either an incall duty

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.950 
biggest fan of it either an incall duty
ghosts<00:04:41.669> look<00:04:41.880> sometimes<00:04:42.240> old<00:04:42.419> although<00:04:42.930> I

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
ghosts look sometimes old although I

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.800 
ghosts look sometimes old although I
quite<00:04:43.380> out<00:04:43.560> over<00:04:43.889> it<00:04:44.009> or<00:04:44.190> although<00:04:44.520> like

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
quite out over it or although like

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.749 
quite out over it or although like
octane<00:04:45.810> over<00:04:46.139> it<00:04:46.259> as<00:04:46.380> well<00:04:46.530> like<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.430> don't<00:04:47.639> know

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
octane over it as well like I don't know

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.059 
octane over it as well like I don't know
is<00:04:47.940> what<00:04:48.120> um<00:04:48.419> strike<00:04:48.870> zones<00:04:49.110> okay<00:04:49.380> but<00:04:49.650> for<00:04:49.979> me

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
is what um strike zones okay but for me

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.550 
is what um strike zones okay but for me
there<00:04:50.460> are<00:04:50.550> better<00:04:50.669> maps<00:04:50.970> so<00:04:51.960> those<00:04:52.410> are<00:04:52.530> some

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
there are better maps so those are some

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.659 
there are better maps so those are some
of<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:52.860> maps<00:04:53.009> that<00:04:53.190> I've<00:04:53.340> been<00:04:53.520> enjoying

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
lately octane as good as well flooded is

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.330

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
recommended to me that a lot of people

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.430 
recommended to me that a lot of people
don't<00:05:20.280> know<00:05:20.460> about<00:05:20.490> or<00:05:20.970> you<00:05:21.569> know<00:05:21.659> or<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.199> seems

don't know about or you know or it seems

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.960 
don't know about or you know or it seems
like<00:05:22.560> not<00:05:22.710> that<00:05:22.919> many<00:05:23.009> people<00:05:23.099> use<00:05:23.520> is<00:05:23.699> the<00:05:23.849> F

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
like not that many people use is the F

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.089 
like not that many people use is the F
ad<00:05:24.449> and<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.990> f<00:05:25.110> ed<00:05:25.259> it's<00:05:25.650> kind<00:05:25.919> of<00:05:25.949> like<00:05:26.039> a

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
ad and the f ed it's kind of like a

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.890 
ad and the f ed it's kind of like a
laser<00:05:26.430> beam<00:05:26.699> like<00:05:26.849> it<00:05:26.970> shoots<00:05:27.150> really<00:05:27.539> quickly

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
laser beam like it shoots really quickly

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.809 
laser beam like it shoots really quickly
very<00:05:28.530> little<00:05:28.830> recoil<00:05:29.190> and<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:29.490> kills<00:05:29.699> them

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
very little recoil and it kills them

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.029 
very little recoil and it kills them
pretty<00:05:30.060> quickly<00:05:30.360> and<00:05:30.659> it's<00:05:30.840> I<00:05:31.050> like<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.620> ak-12

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
pretty quickly and it's I like the ak-12

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.070 
pretty quickly and it's I like the ak-12
generally<00:05:32.610> for<00:05:32.789> like<00:05:32.909> bigger<00:05:33.120> maps<00:05:33.389> like<00:05:33.690> for

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
generally for like bigger maps like for

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.860 
generally for like bigger maps like for
whiteout<00:05:34.380> i'll<00:05:34.770> use<00:05:34.949> the<00:05:35.130> ak-12<00:05:35.539> but<00:05:36.539> for<00:05:36.750> like

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
whiteout i'll use the ak-12 but for like

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.709 
whiteout i'll use the ak-12 but for like
a<00:05:36.900> smaller<00:05:37.409> map<00:05:37.620> like<00:05:37.860> strike<00:05:38.430> zone<00:05:38.699> or<00:05:39.000> maybe

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:39.719 
a smaller map like strike zone or maybe

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.860 
a smaller map like strike zone or maybe
even<00:05:39.810> Warhawk<00:05:40.349> i'll<00:05:40.560> use<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:42.150> f<00:05:42.270> ad<00:05:42.509> or

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
even Warhawk i'll use the the f ad or

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.499 
even Warhawk i'll use the the f ad or
tremor<00:05:43.440> actually<00:05:43.860> tremors<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.340> very<00:05:44.639> good<00:05:44.880> very

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
tremor actually tremors a very good very

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.980 
tremor actually tremors a very good very
good<00:05:45.690> map<00:05:46.349> for<00:05:46.919> using<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.610> f<00:05:47.699> ad<00:05:48.060> I<00:05:48.270> like<00:05:48.840> the

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
good map for using the f ad I like the

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.870 
good map for using the f ad I like the
FAA<00:05:49.229> and<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.650> cool<00:05:50.039> thing<00:05:50.070> about<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.460> f<00:05:50.550> ed<00:05:50.699> is

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
FAA and the cool thing about the f ed is

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.459 
FAA and the cool thing about the f ed is
that<00:05:51.120> you<00:05:51.210> don't<00:05:51.419> need<00:05:51.570> to<00:05:51.810> use<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:52.080> use

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
that you don't need to use to use

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.080 
that you don't need to use to use
extended<00:05:52.949> mags<00:05:53.130> because<00:05:53.370> it<00:05:53.490> has<00:05:53.639> 40<00:05:54.060> two

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
extended mags because it has 40 two

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.089 
extended mags because it has 40 two
bullets<00:05:54.570> in<00:05:54.630> its<00:05:54.780> clip<00:05:55.110> so<00:05:55.710> you<00:05:55.770> can<00:05:55.979> use

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
well so those are probably my two
