00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.949

 learn the profession of the frappant 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.279
 mechanic and for coating technology 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.090
 and I'm currently in the second 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.800
 year of training in my education 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.349
 to know such all basic areas 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.040
 special in our department is then 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.559
 polish masking tapes 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.410
 hand jobs and of course 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.780
 then hang up with help on the front of the band 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.789
 Depend yourself on many pictures 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.920
 search 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:47.230
 in the first year of education has you not 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.630
 and courses metal sheet welding motor vehicle 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.160
 mechatronics electrical engineering so really 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.870
 in all areas to take a look at the 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.870
 bmw offers as a vocational training 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.660
 we're running two others here 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.310
 Automatically , he was wise to another hand 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.540
 Lackiererei course due to the 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.100
 speed of the robot become very 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.740
 Much more parts made out during the day 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.360
 circa 5000 and in hand paint shop 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.150
 also because of more craftsmanship 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.710
 we're talking about 1,200 to 1,300 parts of 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.490
 The trainee should be with us otherwise 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.250
 Awareness of quality must be there 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.650
 to be able to bring along and recognize one's eye 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.960
 the order of the coating is the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.430
 not just done so that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.869
 at the end you get a part out what 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.869
 a premium quality 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.840
 My name is Christian KlÃ¶cker and I am 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.550
 already four and a half years here at bmw 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.009
 I like it very much that you are there 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.229
 I have to work as a craftsman 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.479
 So I think smaller-scale type 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.910
 also a bit the eyes of the hand 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.660
 That's why coordination is needed 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.560
 actually here too is actually 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.899
 none of them are painted individually 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.970
 of course, express his preferences 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.840
 where he wants to be used and it 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.880
 will of course be taken into account 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.320
 especially like that with real values 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.909
 Colleagues if you work together and 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.010
 that prevails in a relaxed mood 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.979
 and you also have a lot of freedom for his 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.230
 own work one has just in so 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.120
 a department like ours actually 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.890
 a small family so everyone knows 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.450
 anyone can talk to him about 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.600
 But private things are talking as well 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.580
 ask questions professionally that's the same 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.140
 Financial value no matter how much work 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.000
 Finally, on the desk 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.620
 for the masters always pick one 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.150
 open ear 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.519
 I am glad that I am here at bmw 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.340
 I landed that meanwhile, too 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.500
 i can say i am a part of bmw 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.090
 ask the company too and then 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.000
 when I bring myself to bmi 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.629
 either abroad or another 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.629
 a bit further up
