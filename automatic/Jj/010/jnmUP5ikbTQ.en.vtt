00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.169 
detail and I can say that ninja
escapades<00:02:06.509> mode<00:02:06.780> would<00:02:06.959> be<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.439> I'm<00:02:07.649> most

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
escapades mode would be the one I'm most

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.449 
escapades mode would be the one I'm most
anticipating<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.569> game<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:10.459> having

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
anticipating in the game because having

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.059 
anticipating in the game because having
seen<00:02:11.760> ninja<00:02:12.209> world<00:02:12.450> tournament<00:02:13.230> mode<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.680> the

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
seen ninja world tournament mode and the

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.190 
seen ninja world tournament mode and the
free<00:02:14.340> battle<00:02:14.580> everything<00:02:15.420> basically<00:02:15.930> looks

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
free battle everything basically looks

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.589 
free battle everything basically looks
the<00:02:16.440> same<00:02:16.680> as<00:02:16.980> storm<00:02:17.310> through<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.640> mean<00:02:17.849> you

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
the same as storm through I mean you

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.569 
the same as storm through I mean you
probably<00:02:18.870> can't<00:02:19.200> even<00:02:19.290> sprint<00:02:19.859> in<00:02:20.100> ninja

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
probably can't even sprint in ninja

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
world tournament mode which is just

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.060 
world tournament mode which is just
running<00:02:22.940> stupid<00:02:23.940> errands<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.840> really<00:02:25.739> have

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
running stupid errands that really have

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.620 
running stupid errands that really have
no<00:02:26.370> value<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:27.359> have<00:02:27.540> no<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:28.470> depth<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.880> it's

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
no value and have no in depth like it's

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.500 
no value and have no in depth like it's
just<00:02:30.959> shallow<00:02:31.350> as<00:02:31.799> a<00:02:31.829> whole<00:02:32.280> modes<00:02:33.000> like<00:02:33.239> that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
just shallow as a whole modes like that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.630 
just shallow as a whole modes like that
to<00:02:33.720> me<00:02:33.870> unless<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.380> like<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.530> storm<00:02:34.950> one<00:02:35.250> style

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
to me unless it's like a storm one style

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.190 
to me unless it's like a storm one style
where<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:35.970> can<00:02:36.120> actually<00:02:36.299> jump<00:02:36.690> around<00:02:37.049> and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
where you can actually jump around and

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.710 
where you can actually jump around and
stuff<00:02:37.410> but<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.620> seems<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:38.910> not<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.510> case

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
stuff but that seems to not be the case

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.979 
stuff but that seems to not be the case
in<00:02:40.019> this<00:02:40.680> Ninja<00:02:41.160> world<00:02:41.790> tournament<00:02:42.450> mode<00:02:42.600> so

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
in this Ninja world tournament mode so

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.470 
in this Ninja world tournament mode so
the<00:02:43.459> regular<00:02:44.459> battles<00:02:44.940> they<00:02:45.090> did<00:02:45.269> a<00:02:45.299> couple

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
the regular battles they did a couple

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.240 
the regular battles they did a couple
regular<00:02:45.930> battles<00:02:46.290> like<00:02:46.380> free<00:02:46.680> battles<00:02:47.130> and

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
regular battles like free battles and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.059 
regular battles like free battles and
they<00:02:47.790> basically<00:02:48.030> look<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.569> same<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.049> mean<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
they basically look the same I mean the

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.460 
they basically look the same I mean the
character<00:02:50.340> roster<00:02:50.760> if<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.750> guys<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.170> seen

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
character roster if you guys have seen

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.370 
character roster if you guys have seen
it<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.859> it<00:02:53.400> might<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.630> official<00:02:54.959> roster<00:02:55.109> but

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
it I it might be the official roster but

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.140 
it I it might be the official roster but
I'm<00:02:55.530> not<00:02:55.680> we're<00:02:55.859> not<00:02:55.980> sure<00:02:56.310> yet<00:02:56.340> at<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.819> point

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
I'm not we're not sure yet at this point

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.360 
I'm not we're not sure yet at this point
but<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.750> character<00:02:58.230> roster<00:02:58.440> really<00:02:59.069> looked

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
but the character roster really looked

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.330 
but the character roster really looked
weak<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.450> my<00:03:00.750> point<00:03:01.109> of<00:03:01.200> view<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.680> think<00:03:02.220> they

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
weak in my point of view I think they

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.220 
weak in my point of view I think they
could<00:03:02.519> have<00:03:02.549> done<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.819> lot<00:03:03.209> more<00:03:03.750> with<00:03:04.079> the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
could have done a lot more with the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.780 
could have done a lot more with the
roster<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.829> I<00:03:04.920> personally<00:03:05.280> don't<00:03:05.579> like<00:03:05.639> the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
roster and I personally don't like the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.910 
roster and I personally don't like the
design<00:03:06.299> either<00:03:06.569> just<00:03:06.959> makes<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.290> look<00:03:07.470> like<00:03:07.680> I

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
design either just makes it look like I

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.640 
design either just makes it look like I
like<00:03:08.010> vibrant<00:03:08.819> colors<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.780> my<00:03:09.959> character

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
like vibrant colors and my character

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.620 
like vibrant colors and my character
selection<00:03:11.010> screen<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:11.609> their<00:03:12.060> character

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
selection screen so their character

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.289 
selection screen so their character
roster<00:03:12.780> wasn't<00:03:13.290> up<00:03:13.380> my<00:03:13.530> alley<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.910> just

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
roster wasn't up my alley and it just

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.800

talking about relays versus guard break
pills<00:03:33.250> when<00:03:33.700> we<00:03:33.849> first<00:03:34.180> saw<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.480> trailer<00:03:34.870> we

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
pills when we first saw the trailer we

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.050 
pills when we first saw the trailer we
thought<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.950> guard<00:03:36.250> break<00:03:36.430> pill<00:03:36.489> was

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
thought that the guard break pill was

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.690 
thought that the guard break pill was
actually<00:03:37.659> a<00:03:37.689> relay<00:03:38.319> but<00:03:38.560> it<00:03:38.680> turns<00:03:38.920> out<00:03:39.159> relays

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
actually a relay but it turns out relays

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.850 
actually a relay but it turns out relays
have<00:03:39.730> been<00:03:40.329> erased<00:03:41.140> from<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.650> game

in the last entry has been erased from

in the last entry has been erased from
the<00:03:47.500> series<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:48.370> feel<00:03:48.819> that<00:03:49.150> that<00:03:49.420> was<00:03:49.659> really

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
the series I feel that that was really

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.130 
the series I feel that that was really
just<00:03:50.500> not<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.519> good<00:03:51.760> move<00:03:52.090> on<00:03:52.510> their<00:03:53.110> part

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
just not a good move on their part

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.800 
just not a good move on their part
because<00:03:53.890> I<00:03:54.250> become<00:03:54.790> accustomed<00:03:55.420> to<00:03:55.480> using

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
because I become accustomed to using

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.839 
because I become accustomed to using
relays<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:56.799> much<00:03:57.010> that<00:03:57.220> it's<00:03:57.340> basically

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
relays so much that it's basically

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.599 
relays so much that it's basically
second<00:03:58.480> nature<00:03:58.689> to<00:03:59.200> relay<00:03:59.709> when<00:04:00.099> I<00:04:00.189> feel<00:04:00.430> the

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
second nature to relay when I feel the

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.399 
second nature to relay when I feel the
time<00:04:00.640> is<00:04:01.030> necessary<00:04:01.599> and<00:04:01.780> with<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.109> guard

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
time is necessary and with the guard

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.119 
time is necessary and with the guard
break<00:04:02.769> pill

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
break pill

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.819 
break pill
it<00:04:03.670> just<00:04:04.120> seems<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:05.140> doesn't<00:04:05.409> seem<00:04:05.799> natural

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
it just seems it doesn't seem natural

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.940 
it just seems it doesn't seem natural
because<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:06.819> have<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.329> press<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.959> directional

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
because I have to press the directional

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.649 
because I have to press the directional
button<00:04:09.280> on<00:04:09.549> my<00:04:09.700> controller<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.359> that<00:04:10.450> just

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
with the Susanoo armour quit because

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.840 
with the Susanoo armour quit because
both<00:05:51.260> of<00:05:51.470> them<00:05:51.650> would<00:05:51.860> actually<00:05:51.920> have<00:05:52.460> a<00:05:52.490> part

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
both of them would actually have a part

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.030 
both of them would actually have a part
in<00:05:53.030> the<00:05:53.180> awakening<00:05:53.690> now<00:05:53.960> it's<00:05:54.350> kind<00:05:54.650> of<00:05:54.680> a<00:05:54.800> good

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
in the awakening now it's kind of a good

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.100 
in the awakening now it's kind of a good
idea<00:05:55.430> because<00:05:55.580> if<00:05:56.000> you<00:05:56.150> think<00:05:56.420> about<00:05:56.720> it<00:05:56.930> all

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110

what<00:06:10.580> I<00:06:10.610> mean

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
what I mean

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.540 
what I mean
so<00:06:11.120> I<00:06:11.150> think<00:06:11.300> that<00:06:11.630> this<00:06:11.780> would<00:06:11.960> really<00:06:11.990> be

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
so I think that this would really be

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.600 
so I think that this would really be
amazing<00:06:13.550> it<00:06:13.760> just<00:06:14.120> add<00:06:14.660> on<00:06:14.930> to<00:06:15.380> the<00:06:15.620> the

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
amazing it just add on to the the

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.760 
amazing it just add on to the the
wellness<00:06:17.300> factor<00:06:17.750> in<00:06:17.870> this<00:06:17.990> game<00:06:18.110> I<00:06:18.290> know<00:06:18.500> they

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
wellness factor in this game I know they

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.200 
wellness factor in this game I know they
have<00:06:18.890> already<00:06:19.010> done<00:06:19.310> team<00:06:19.610> ultimate<00:06:20.090> jutsus

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
have already done team ultimate jutsus

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.480 
have already done team ultimate jutsus
but<00:06:20.600> once<00:06:20.900> you've<00:06:21.500> got<00:06:21.680> the<00:06:21.830> team<00:06:22.070> ultimate

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
but once you've got the team ultimate

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.550 
but once you've got the team ultimate
jutsus<00:06:22.640> on<00:06:23.030> deck<00:06:23.330> maybe<00:06:23.840> you<00:06:24.050> can<00:06:24.200> just<00:06:24.410> add

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.710 
jutsus on deck maybe you can just add
team<00:06:24.980> awakenings<00:06:25.610> maybe<00:06:25.820> it<00:06:26.000> has<00:06:26.180> to<00:06:26.390> wait<00:06:26.570> to

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:30.880 
the next entry in the game but I think
it<00:06:29.480> would<00:06:29.600> be<00:06:29.720> cool<00:06:29.930> the<00:06:30.080> ones<00:06:30.320> that<00:06:30.500> I<00:06:30.620> thought

it would be cool the ones that I thought

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.590

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
that much but the ones that I thought of

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.220 
that much but the ones that I thought of
could<00:06:35.180> be<00:06:35.210> also<00:06:36.169> ideas<00:06:37.130> is<00:06:37.450> minato<00:06:38.450> and<00:06:38.630> also
