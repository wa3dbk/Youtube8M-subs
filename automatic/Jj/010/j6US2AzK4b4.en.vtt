00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
to be at a disadvantage as far as

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.830 
to be at a disadvantage as far as
upgrades<00:01:09.040> go<00:01:09.280> I<00:01:09.550> have<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.180> lot<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.390> archers<00:01:10.810> and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
upgrades go I have a lot of archers and

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.870 
upgrades go I have a lot of archers and
he<00:01:11.050> made<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.229> intelligent<00:01:11.860> move<00:01:12.009> of<00:01:12.340> quickly

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
he made the intelligent move of quickly

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.120 
he made the intelligent move of quickly
engaging<00:01:13.240> me<00:01:13.540> but<00:01:14.200> I'm<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.410> not<00:01:14.710> so<00:01:14.890> intelligent

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
engaging me but I'm a not so intelligent

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.920 
engaging me but I'm a not so intelligent
move<00:01:15.520> was<00:01:15.700> allowing<00:01:16.090> his<00:01:16.270> failings<00:01:16.660> as<00:01:16.840> to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
move was allowing his failings as to

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.790 
move was allowing his failings as to
become<00:01:17.050> isolated<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:19.060> lose<00:01:19.240> their<00:01:19.800> single

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
become isolated and to lose their single

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.920 
become isolated and to lose their single
integrated<00:01:21.490> line<00:01:21.940> which<00:01:22.479> is<00:01:22.630> their<00:01:22.750> best

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
integrated line which is their best

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.170 
integrated line which is their best
defense<00:01:23.520> because<00:01:24.520> I<00:01:24.580> wouldn't<00:01:24.790> had<00:01:24.940> enough

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
defense because I wouldn't had enough

you<00:02:28.640> can<00:02:28.730> see<00:02:28.850> this<00:02:28.970> unit<00:02:29.270> wasn't<00:02:29.510> even<00:02:29.660> hardly

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
you can see this unit wasn't even hardly

touched<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.350> they<00:02:30.440> r<00:02:30.620> at<00:02:30.770> it<00:02:30.920> anyway

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
touched and they r at it anyway

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.280

something<00:02:31.670> try<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.630> kill<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> bunch<00:02:33.050> of<00:02:33.170> them

something try and kill a bunch of them

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.970 
something try and kill a bunch of them
so<00:02:33.680> they<00:02:33.770> don't<00:02:33.860> come<00:02:34.070> back<00:02:34.220> into<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.610> fight

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
so they don't come back into the fight

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.710 
so they don't come back into the fight
so<00:02:36.980> that's<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.790> problem<00:02:38.030> with<00:02:38.180> bringing<00:02:38.420> an

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
so that's the problem with bringing an

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.420 
so that's the problem with bringing an
upgraded<00:02:39.170> infantry<00:02:39.620> against<00:02:39.950> elite<00:02:40.190> infantry

upgraded infantry against elite infantry
especially<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.270> lead<00:02:41.450> Roman<00:02:41.900> infantry<00:02:42.410> is

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
especially the lead Roman infantry is

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.500 
especially the lead Roman infantry is
that<00:02:42.680> they<00:02:42.830> were<00:02:42.890> out<00:02:43.160> very<00:02:43.610> easily<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.270> they

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
that they were out very easily and they

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.510 
that they were out very easily and they
have<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.750> be<00:02:44.870> managed<00:02:45.260> very<00:02:45.650> well<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:46.370> be<00:02:46.489> able

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
have to be managed very well to be able

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.430 
have to be managed very well to be able
to<00:02:46.730> win<00:02:46.880> like<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.630> said<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.930> think<00:02:48.200> if<00:02:48.290> my

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
to win like I said I think if my

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.460 
to win like I said I think if my
opponent<00:02:48.650> would<00:02:48.890> have<00:02:49.010> come<00:02:49.160> at<00:02:49.310> me<00:02:49.430> in<00:02:49.520> one

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
opponent would have come at me in one

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.650 
opponent would have come at me in one
congruent<00:02:51.470> non-stop<00:02:52.130> line<00:02:52.459> he<00:02:53.360> would<00:02:53.510> have

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
congruent non-stop line he would have

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.380 
congruent non-stop line he would have
been<00:02:54.500> able<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.860> fix<00:02:55.070> my<00:02:55.250> troops<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:55.880> surround

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.530 
been able to fix my troops and surround
me<00:02:56.570> would<00:02:57.170> possibly<00:02:57.410> if<00:02:57.860> one<00:02:58.070> victory<00:02:58.730> but<00:02:59.480> in

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
me would possibly if one victory but in

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.420 
me would possibly if one victory but in
this<00:02:59.690> case<00:02:59.870> you<00:03:00.019> can<00:03:00.170> see<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.650> won<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.130> victory

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
this case you can see I won the victory

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.370 
this case you can see I won the victory
fairly<00:03:02.330> quick<00:03:03.100> um
