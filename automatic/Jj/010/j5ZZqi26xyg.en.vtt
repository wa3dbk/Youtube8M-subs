trap<00:01:24.210> works<00:01:25.460> here's<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.549> bait<00:01:26.759> chamber<00:01:27.210> back<00:01:27.390> in

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
trap works here's a bait chamber back in

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.840 
trap works here's a bait chamber back in
here<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.619> there's<00:01:28.890> an<00:01:29.009> elevator<00:01:29.400> arm<00:01:29.640> right

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
here and there's an elevator arm right

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.830 
here and there's an elevator arm right
here<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> bird<00:01:31.530> goes<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> food<00:01:32.840> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
here so the bird goes for the food and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.600 
here so the bird goes for the food and
it's<00:01:34.049> weight<00:01:34.670> pushes<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.790> down<00:01:37.130> which<00:01:38.130> lowers

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
it's weight pushes it down which lowers

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.580 
it's weight pushes it down which lowers
it<00:01:40.250> down<00:01:41.250> move<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.579> here<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:45.420> bird<00:01:45.960> pushes

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
it down move out here and bird pushes

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.730 
it down move out here and bird pushes
its<00:01:46.740> way<00:01:47.119> through<00:01:48.119> right<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.899> hole<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
its way through right at this hole and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.980 
its way through right at this hole and
for<00:01:50.700> whatever<00:01:50.850> reason<00:01:51.450> they<00:01:51.540> cannot<00:01:51.780> figure

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
for whatever reason they cannot figure

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.969 
for whatever reason they cannot figure
out<00:01:52.110> how<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.470> back<00:01:52.530> through<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> hole

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
out how to get back through the hole

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.679 
out how to get back through the hole
obviously<00:01:55.979> because<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> only<00:01:56.549> pushes<00:01:56.909> this

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
obviously because it only pushes this

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.760 
obviously because it only pushes this
direction
