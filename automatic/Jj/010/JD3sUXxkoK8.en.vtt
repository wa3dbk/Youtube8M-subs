 we want our little town 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.340
 bit spread this culture level 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.250
 because ballet nobody is going so well because 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.729
 now more like art and of course if 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.100
 the little kids all polka to 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.869
 example, the small that it sees 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.360
 a little different and we wanted 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.759
 Just show that first because that 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.539
 really chance of art for us 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:11.080
 personally and maybe the children 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.500
 I 'm looking forward to a little bit of my pleasure 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.650
 dance like that and that was ours 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.930
 the most important idea for the organizers is 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.140
 succeeded ballet personalities as 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.120
 to bring jury of experts to bad krozingen 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.930
 among others elpida charr alan boss 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.020

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.910
 Tatiana Graz Nova from Russia professor 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.280
 olga melnikova from the palucca 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.830
 college for dance in dresden was the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.990
 expand bonner and become jury president 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.800
 Michael Shannon the director of the Royal 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.599
 academy antwerp from belgium 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.050
 all of the jury has lessons too 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.780
 Made with with children and that is very 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.440
 I think that's very good because we can 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.590
 do not even see the kids on the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.100
 stage but the whole week and then 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.230
 we work together 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.890
 then we can open our last time 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:09.970
 The stage then wants to be such a good one 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.970
 understood yes but like dance one way or the other
