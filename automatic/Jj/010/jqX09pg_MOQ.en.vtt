the conclusion that unless we find a way

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.130 
the conclusion that unless we find a way
not<00:05:35.710> only<00:05:36.370> to<00:05:36.610> mix<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.120> oils<00:05:37.450> but<00:05:37.660> to<00:05:37.810> mix<00:05:37.990> our

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
not only to mix the oils but to mix our

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.170 
not only to mix the oils but to mix our
lives<00:05:38.500> there<00:05:38.800> is<00:05:38.920> no<00:05:39.100> future<00:05:39.310> for<00:05:39.550> neither<00:05:39.910> of

lives there is no future for neither of
us<00:05:40.390> I<00:05:40.600> think<00:05:41.500> blending<00:05:42.960> olive<00:05:43.960> oil<00:05:44.170> from

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
us I think blending olive oil from

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.810 
us I think blending olive oil from
Palestine<00:05:44.950> and<00:05:45.130> Israel<00:05:46.200> is<00:05:47.200> a<00:05:47.260> symbolic<00:05:47.820> but

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
Palestine and Israel is a symbolic but

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.890 
Palestine and Israel is a symbolic but
significant<00:05:49.860> contribution<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:51.900> promoting

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
significant contribution to promoting

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
the concept of coexistence and

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.520 
the concept of coexistence and
cooperation<00:05:55.720> in<00:05:55.990> this<00:05:56.110> area<00:05:56.610> we<00:05:57.610> feel<00:05:57.910> that

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
cooperation in this area we feel that

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.140 
cooperation in this area we feel that
supporting<00:05:59.530> these<00:05:59.650> farmers<00:06:00.130> is<00:06:00.370> particularly

supporting these farmers is particularly

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.250 
supporting these farmers is particularly

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
important also because it is quite

products in the West which is what we

products in the West which is what we
believe<00:06:48.550> is<00:06:48.880> very<00:06:49.450> crucial<00:06:49.720> to<00:06:50.260> support

sustainable agriculture in the West Bank
and<00:06:54.310> ultimately<00:06:55.180> make<00:06:55.420> a<00:06:55.450> little

we believe it is very important to bring

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.480 
we believe it is very important to bring
to<00:07:20.050> the<00:07:20.169> attention<00:07:20.260> of<00:07:20.680> the<00:07:20.740> consumer<00:07:21.370> the

to the attention of the consumer the

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.490 
to the attention of the consumer the
fact<00:07:21.730> that<00:07:21.820> they<00:07:22.090> can<00:07:22.360> make<00:07:22.540> a<00:07:22.570> difference<00:07:23.139> by

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
fact that they can make a difference by

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.740 
fact that they can make a difference by
purchasing<00:07:24.190> raw<00:07:24.460> materials<00:07:25.060> or<00:07:25.330> products

environmentally and socially sustainable
way<00:07:29.260> and<00:07:29.500> we<00:07:30.010> believe<00:07:30.310> that<00:07:30.340> beyond<00:07:31.030> our<00:07:31.360> own

way and we believe that beyond our own
sphere<00:07:32.980> of<00:07:33.190> economic<00:07:33.850> influence<00:07:34.389> we<00:07:35.290> can

sphere of economic influence we can

to do the same and basically look at
