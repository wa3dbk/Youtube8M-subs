00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.009 
edge of the deck can hang your feet into
the<00:02:35.739> koi<00:02:35.890> pond<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:37.269> we<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:37.720> edge<00:02:37.900> is

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
the koi pond so we this edge is

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.869 
the koi pond so we this edge is
uncomplete<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.680> want<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.950> put<00:02:39.159> the<00:02:39.250> observation

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
uncomplete I want to put the observation

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.030 
uncomplete I want to put the observation
deck<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.239> first<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:40.840> make<00:02:41.500> sure<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.680> can<00:02:41.920> work

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
deck in first and make sure I can work

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.530 
deck in first and make sure I can work
everything<00:02:42.489> else<00:02:42.640> around<00:02:42.909> it<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.299> we're<00:02:43.450> going

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
everything else around it so we're going

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.600 
everything else around it so we're going
to<00:02:43.599> solve<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:43.900> right<00:02:44.110> now<00:02:45.659> yeah<00:02:46.659> your<00:02:46.870> way

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
to solve that right now yeah your way

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.000 
to solve that right now yeah your way
watch<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.760> rocks<00:02:48.909> Rosie

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.370 

come<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.130> me<00:02:59.390> okay<00:03:00.390> rotate<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:01.020> a<00:03:01.110> little<00:03:01.260> bit

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
come to me okay rotate it a little bit

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.050 
come to me okay rotate it a little bit
this<00:03:01.470> way<00:03:01.650> yeah<00:03:02.010> yeah<00:03:02.040> yeah<00:03:04.820> can<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.850> go<00:03:05.940> that

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
this way yeah yeah yeah can I go that

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:25.710 
this way yeah yeah yeah can I go that
way<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.180> little<00:03:11.660> check<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.810> out<00:03:12.900> Josh

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.580 

that<00:03:26.320> looks<00:03:26.470> good<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.900> observation<00:03:32.080> deck

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
that looks good so the observation deck

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.530 
that looks good so the observation deck
we<00:03:32.740> just<00:03:32.920> have<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.190> positioned<00:03:33.340> here<00:03:34.030> we're

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
we just have it positioned here we're

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
we just have it positioned here we're
going<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.720> put<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:34.930> couple<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:35.320> rocks

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
going to put a couple of rocks

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.350 
going to put a couple of rocks
underneath<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.400> support<00:03:36.820> beams<00:03:37.000> underneath

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
underneath the support beams underneath

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.170 
underneath the support beams underneath
it<00:03:37.600> just<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:38.230> stabilize<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:38.980> it's<00:03:39.580> not<00:03:39.700> exactly

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
it just to stabilize it it's not exactly

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.430 
it just to stabilize it it's not exactly
where<00:03:40.480> it's<00:03:40.600> going<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.750> go<00:03:40.930> we're<00:03:41.110> still<00:03:41.320> going

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
where it's going to go we're still going

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.140 
where it's going to go we're still going
to<00:03:41.500> have<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.740> put<00:03:41.890> some<00:03:41.920> posts<00:03:42.460> to<00:03:42.640> support<00:03:43.030> it

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
to have to put some posts to support it

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.970 
to have to put some posts to support it
but<00:03:43.750> for<00:03:43.900> now<00:03:44.020> we<00:03:44.080> just<00:03:44.320> want<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.560> keep<00:03:44.710> it<00:03:44.830> here

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
but for now we just want to keep it here

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.160 
but for now we just want to keep it here
for<00:03:45.190> inspiration<00:03:45.490> and<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.240> so<00:03:46.690> we<00:03:46.810> can<00:03:46.960> tie

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
for inspiration and and so we can tie

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.290 
for inspiration and and so we can tie
everything<00:03:47.440> around<00:03:48.070> next<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.550> it<00:03:48.670> if<00:03:48.850> you'll

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
everything around next to it if you'll

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.370 
everything around next to it if you'll
notice<00:03:49.600> we're<00:03:49.750> putting<00:03:49.990> some<00:03:50.140> rock<00:03:50.350> work

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
notice we're putting some rock work

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.830 
notice we're putting some rock work
behind<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.040> deck<00:03:51.250> that'll<00:03:51.910> help<00:03:52.030> accent<00:03:52.660> it

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
behind the deck that'll help accent it

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.730 
behind the deck that'll help accent it
and<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:55.110> think<00:03:56.110> this<00:03:56.200> is<00:03:56.260> going<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.410> be<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.560> real

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
and I think this is going to be a real

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.520 
and I think this is going to be a real
showpiece<00:03:57.100> for<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.340> pond
