00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
which means that this is not a final

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.070 
which means that this is not a final
roster<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.760> also<00:00:21.060> not<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.570> final

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
things and change things around as far

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.990 
things and change things around as far
as<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.289> game<00:00:25.470> goes<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> preview

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
roster is pretty big I think there's

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.840

thirty<00:00:34.559> four<00:00:34.829> characters<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.489> build<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
thirty four characters in this build and

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.630 
thirty four characters in this build and
this<00:00:36.000> isn't<00:00:36.270> even<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.450> most<00:00:36.660> recent<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.640> also

cross<00:01:33.270> counter<00:01:33.810> or<00:01:33.990> something<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.380> mean<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> have

this game
you<00:02:07.549> lose<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:08.240> round<00:02:08.709> no<00:02:09.709> matter<00:02:09.890> what<00:02:10.429> your

you lose that round no matter what your

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.880 
you lose that round no matter what your
health<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:10.970> on<00:02:11.240> your<00:02:11.360> other<00:02:11.420> character<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.620> the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
health is on your other character so the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.760 
health is on your other character so the
reason<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.480> fact<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.900> it's<00:02:15.500> a

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
reason that I like the fact that it's a

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.280 
reason that I like the fact that it's a
it's<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.280> tag<00:02:16.520> game<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.180> there's<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.569> two

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
it's a tag game and there's a two

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.750 
it's a tag game and there's a two
players<00:02:18.500> on<00:02:18.680> each<00:02:18.740> team<00:02:18.800> it's<00:02:19.520> because<00:02:19.730> my

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
players on each team it's because my

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.940 
players on each team it's because my
biggest<00:02:20.240> pet<00:02:20.510> peeve<00:02:20.810> in<00:02:21.080> fighting<00:02:21.470> games<00:02:21.500> is

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
biggest pet peeve in fighting games is

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.090 
biggest pet peeve in fighting games is
the<00:02:22.430> whole<00:02:22.610> tiered<00:02:23.300> system<00:02:23.660> like<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.980> know

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
the whole tiered system like you know

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.040 
the whole tiered system like you know
this<00:02:25.670> character<00:02:26.090> is<00:02:26.120> topped<00:02:26.480> here<00:02:26.750> in<00:02:26.930> this

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
this character is topped here in this

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.570 
this character is topped here in this
character's<00:02:27.470> bottom<00:02:27.800> T<00:02:27.950> or<00:02:28.069> whatever<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:28.520> is

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
character's bottom T or whatever this is

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.840 
character's bottom T or whatever this is
kind<00:02:28.850> of<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.970> mid-tier<00:02:29.330> character<00:02:30.489> because<00:02:31.489> I

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
kind of a mid-tier character because I

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.090 
kind of a mid-tier character because I
think<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.330> when<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.840> add<00:02:33.230> in<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:33.890> whole

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
think that when you add in this whole

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.690 
think that when you add in this whole
sort<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:35.110> partner<00:02:36.110> system<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.950> really<00:02:37.340> opens

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
sort of partner system it really opens

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.720 
sort of partner system it really opens
it<00:02:37.850> up<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.590> including<00:02:39.590> maybe<00:02:40.100> a<00:02:40.220> character

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
it up to including maybe a character

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.479 
it up to including maybe a character
that<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:41.000> in<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.810> what<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:42.800> would<00:02:42.920> call<00:02:43.070> a<00:02:43.130> lower

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
that is in a what you would call a lower

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.530 
that is in a what you would call a lower
tier<00:02:43.850> into<00:02:44.750> your<00:02:44.870> combo<00:02:45.320> just<00:02:45.560> because<00:02:46.540> you

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
tier into your combo just because you

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.390 
tier into your combo just because you
know<00:02:47.660> your<00:02:48.260> character<00:02:48.500> in<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.040> character

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
know your character in that character

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.920 
know your character in that character
that<00:02:49.610> is<00:02:49.640> on<00:02:49.820> a<00:02:49.850> lower<00:02:50.060> tier<00:02:50.330> just<00:02:50.630> happen<00:02:50.870> to

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
that is on a lower tier just happen to

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.070 
that is on a lower tier just happen to
combo<00:02:51.260> really<00:02:51.500> well<00:02:51.650> together<00:02:51.860> so<00:02:52.840> I'm<00:02:53.840> sure

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
combo really well together so I'm sure

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.210 
combo really well together so I'm sure
there's<00:02:54.230> going<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.440> be<00:02:54.470> like<00:02:54.650> top<00:02:54.860> tiered

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
there's going to be like top tiered

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.979 
there's going to be like top tiered
combinations<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.060> stuff<00:02:56.239> as<00:02:56.390> well<00:02:56.569> but<00:02:56.780> I

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
combinations and stuff as well but I

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.900 
combinations and stuff as well but I
think<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.530> keeps<00:02:57.980> things<00:02:58.130> interesting<00:02:58.519> and

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
think it keeps things interesting and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.610 
think it keeps things interesting and
sort<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.239> mixes<00:02:59.540> it<00:02:59.690> up<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.230> other<00:03:00.260> thing<00:03:00.590> that

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
sort of mixes it up the other thing that

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.500 
sort of mixes it up the other thing that
is<00:03:00.830> included<00:03:01.489> that<00:03:01.819> you'll<00:03:01.940> see<00:03:02.180> in<00:03:02.209> this

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
is included that you'll see in this

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.630 
is included that you'll see in this
build<00:03:02.840> which<00:03:03.590> will<00:03:03.890> be<00:03:04.010> in<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.190> final<00:03:04.489> game

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
build which will be in the final game

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.690 
build which will be in the final game
i'm<00:03:04.790> pretty<00:03:05.060> sure<00:03:05.319> is<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.860> gem<00:03:07.100> system<00:03:07.550> that

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
i'm pretty sure is the gem system that

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.270 
i'm pretty sure is the gem system that
is<00:03:07.790> sort<00:03:07.970> of<00:03:08.000> like<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.269> whole<00:03:08.390> new<00:03:08.600> thing<00:03:08.630> here

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
is sort of like the whole new thing here

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.000 
is sort of like the whole new thing here
and<00:03:10.280> with<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.120> gems<00:03:11.420> basically<00:03:11.989> i'm<00:03:12.500> not<00:03:12.769> sure

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
and with the gems basically i'm not sure

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.090 
and with the gems basically i'm not sure
exactly<00:03:13.400> what<00:03:13.579> all<00:03:13.790> of<00:03:13.820> them<00:03:14.180> do<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:15.380> there

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
exactly what all of them do but there

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.949 
exactly what all of them do but there
are<00:03:16.190> things<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.610> attack<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.510> speed<00:03:17.750> and

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
are things like attack and speed and

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.870 
are things like attack and speed and
defense<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.340> activate<00:03:19.700> them<00:03:19.760> in

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
defense so you activate them in

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.310 
defense so you activate them in
different<00:03:20.000> ways<00:03:20.209> for<00:03:20.450> instance<00:03:20.750> attack<00:03:21.049> you

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
different ways for instance attack you

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.660 
different ways for instance attack you
have<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.620> land<00:03:21.799> a<00:03:21.920> certain<00:03:22.160> number<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.370> tax

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
have to land a certain number of tax

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.130 
have to land a certain number of tax
before<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.150> activate<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.570> gym<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:23.930> think

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
before you activate the gym and I think

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.380 
before you activate the gym and I think
you<00:03:24.200> just<00:03:24.230> get<00:03:24.500> bonus<00:03:24.860> damage<00:03:25.209> speed<00:03:26.209> and

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
you just get bonus damage speed and

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.240 
you just get bonus damage speed and
defense<00:03:26.720> also<00:03:27.079> pretty<00:03:27.440> obvious<00:03:27.890> think<00:03:28.160> it's

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
defense also pretty obvious think it's

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.949 
defense also pretty obvious think it's
probably<00:03:28.459> if<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:28.760> you<00:03:29.269> know<00:03:29.360> defense<00:03:29.810> would

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
probably if you you know defense would

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.539 
probably if you you know defense would
activate<00:03:30.350> for<00:03:30.620> instance<00:03:30.950> if<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.160> blocked<00:03:31.430> a

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
activate for instance if you blocked a

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.039 
activate for instance if you blocked a
certain<00:03:31.790> number<00:03:31.850> or<00:03:32.090> tax<00:03:32.299> like<00:03:32.480> those<00:03:32.720> kinds

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
certain number or tax like those kinds

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.400 
certain number or tax like those kinds
of<00:03:33.110> things<00:03:33.850> so<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.209> you<00:03:35.420> can<00:03:35.570> pick<00:03:35.780> different

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
of things so and you can pick different

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.680 
of things so and you can pick different
gem<00:03:37.010> combinations<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:38.060> right<00:03:38.390> now<00:03:38.420> I<00:03:38.570> just

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
gem combinations so right now I just

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.539 
gem combinations so right now I just
have<00:03:38.930> I'm<00:03:39.320> kind<00:03:39.500> of<00:03:39.530> boring<00:03:39.769> in<00:03:40.040> this<00:03:40.220> clip<00:03:40.430> I

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
have I'm kind of boring in this clip I

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.970 
have I'm kind of boring in this clip I
just<00:03:40.730> have<00:03:40.850> all<00:03:41.060> three<00:03:41.420> as<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:41.690> tack<00:03:42.410> gems<00:03:42.739> but

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
just have all three as a tack gems but

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.470 
just have all three as a tack gems but
you<00:03:43.100> can<00:03:43.220> have<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.519> know<00:03:43.549> one<00:03:43.820> attack<00:03:44.120> one

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
you can have you know one attack one

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.590 
you can have you know one attack one
defense<00:03:45.019> in<00:03:45.230> one<00:03:45.380> speed<00:03:45.709> or<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.760> know<00:03:46.880> there's

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
defense in one speed or you know there's

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.849 
defense in one speed or you know there's
more<00:03:47.780> gems<00:03:48.049> than<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:48.410> but<00:03:48.590> those<00:03:48.709> are<00:03:48.799> just

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
more gems than that but those are just

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.500 
more gems than that but those are just
the<00:03:49.010> ones<00:03:49.070> that<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.430> can<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:50.090> know<00:03:50.180> name<00:03:50.359> off

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
the ones that I can you know name off

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.810 
the ones that I can you know name off
the<00:03:50.630> top<00:03:50.690> of<00:03:50.840> my<00:03:50.959> head<00:03:51.250> but<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.310> reason<00:03:52.489> I<00:03:52.640> like

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
the top of my head but the reason I like

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.810 
the top of my head but the reason I like
that<00:03:53.000> is<00:03:53.209> because<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:53.900> know<00:03:54.350> maybe<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.950> for

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
that is because you know maybe a for

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.520 
that is because you know maybe a for
instance<00:03:55.940> this<00:03:56.630> is<00:03:56.810> just<00:03:56.959> an<00:03:57.019> example<00:03:57.109> this

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
instance this is just an example this

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.110 
instance this is just an example this
isn't<00:03:57.829> actually<00:03:57.980> how<00:03:58.250> it<00:03:58.400> is<00:03:58.489> i'm<00:03:58.730> not<00:03:58.910> sure

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
isn't actually how it is i'm not sure

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.229 
isn't actually how it is i'm not sure
but<00:03:59.329> for<00:04:00.079> example<00:04:00.530> say<00:04:01.519> yoshimitsu<00:04:02.090> was<00:04:02.209> a

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
but for example say yoshimitsu was a

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.789 
but for example say yoshimitsu was a
really<00:04:02.480> low<00:04:02.600> to<00:04:02.660> your<00:04:02.870> character<00:04:03.140> but<00:04:03.530> i<00:04:03.680> know

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
really low to your character but i know

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.440 
really low to your character but i know
that<00:04:03.890> i<00:04:04.070> could<00:04:04.280> activate<00:04:04.700> that<00:04:04.850> attack<00:04:05.180> gem

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
that i could activate that attack gem

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.330 
that i could activate that attack gem
really<00:04:05.690> easily<00:04:06.049> if<00:04:06.200> I<00:04:06.290> limb<00:04:06.470> that<00:04:06.650> tornado<00:04:07.010> I

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
really easily if I limb that tornado I

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.099 
really easily if I limb that tornado I
might<00:04:07.700> include<00:04:08.000> him<00:04:08.180> in<00:04:08.269> my<00:04:08.420> combination

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
might include him in my combination

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.810 
might include him in my combination
because<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.739> can<00:04:09.890> activate<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:10.340> gem<00:04:10.609> really

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
because I can activate that gem really

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.890 
because I can activate that gem really
easily<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:11.239> then

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
easily and then

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.170 
easily and then
you<00:04:12.049> know<00:04:12.140> get<00:04:12.319> that<00:04:12.470> off<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:12.860> switch<00:04:13.250> out<00:04:13.459> to

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
you know get that off and switch out to

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.640 
you know get that off and switch out to
a<00:04:14.209> character<00:04:14.599> that<00:04:14.629> it's<00:04:14.870> maybe<00:04:15.019> better<00:04:15.110> and

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
a character that it's maybe better and

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.300 
a character that it's maybe better and
deals<00:04:15.950> heavier<00:04:16.280> damage<00:04:17.919> so<00:04:18.919> that's<00:04:19.070> just<00:04:19.130> an

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
deals heavier damage so that's just an

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.890 
deals heavier damage so that's just an
example<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.790> why<00:04:20.780> I<00:04:21.220> enjoy<00:04:22.220> it<00:04:22.250> see<00:04:23.030> I'm<00:04:23.180> uh<00:04:23.210> not

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
example of why I enjoy it see I'm uh not

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.710 
example of why I enjoy it see I'm uh not
terrible<00:04:24.620> fighting<00:04:25.160> games<00:04:25.370> I<00:04:25.639> just<00:04:26.000> am<00:04:26.389> not

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
terrible fighting games I just am not

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.150 
terrible fighting games I just am not
that<00:04:26.900> great<00:04:27.139> you<00:04:27.470> know<00:04:27.560> I<00:04:27.590> can<00:04:27.740> land<00:04:27.889> very

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
that great you know I can land very

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.340 
that great you know I can land very
basic<00:04:28.580> combos<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.000> that's<00:04:29.270> about<00:04:29.419> it<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:30.169> what

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
basic combos and that's about it so what

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.240 
basic combos and that's about it so what
I<00:04:30.380> did<00:04:30.470> was<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:31.400> took<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.940> game<00:04:32.150> into<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.259> versus

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
I did was I took the game into a versus

I did was I took the game into a versus
match<00:04:34.430> against<00:04:34.759> the<00:04:34.880> computer<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.419> I<00:04:35.479> put<00:04:35.660> the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
match against the computer and I put the

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.840 
match against the computer and I put the
computer<00:04:35.870> on<00:04:36.110> hardest<00:04:36.560> difficulty<00:04:36.949> thinking

difficulty right now for the computer

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.140 
difficulty right now for the computer
feels<00:04:48.620> like<00:04:48.860> it's<00:04:49.039> like<00:04:49.250> a<00:04:49.430> really<00:04:49.820> good

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
feels like it's like a really good

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.360 
feels like it's like a really good
tournament<00:04:50.720> player<00:04:50.930> that<00:04:51.590> plays<00:04:51.830> on<00:04:52.010> a<00:04:52.070> fight

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
would link them and you see him landing

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.050 
would link them and you see him landing
some<00:05:03.080> decent<00:05:03.380> ones<00:05:03.410> right<00:05:03.680> there<00:05:03.889> but<00:05:04.490> they

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
some decent ones right there but they

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.550 
some decent ones right there but they

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
interesting and I was actually able to

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.460 
interesting and I was actually able to
beat<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.419> computer<00:05:08.570> on<00:05:08.810> hard<00:05:09.050> difficulty

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
beat the computer on hard difficulty

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.890 
beat the computer on hard difficulty
most<00:05:09.860> of<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.039> time<00:05:10.280> just<00:05:11.240> by<00:05:11.360> using<00:05:11.509> some

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
most of the time just by using some

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.159 
most of the time just by using some
basic<00:05:11.960> tricks<00:05:12.680> like<00:05:12.979> with<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.630> crossover

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
basic tricks like with the the crossover

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.980 
basic tricks like with the the crossover
moves<00:05:15.380> and<00:05:15.560> such<00:05:16.479> also<00:05:17.479> included<00:05:17.840> in<00:05:17.930> this

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
moves and such also included in this

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.730 
moves and such also included in this
game<00:05:18.229> there<00:05:19.130> are<00:05:19.370> ultra<00:05:20.330> moves<00:05:20.630> that<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.410> use

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
game there are ultra moves that that use

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.529 
game there are ultra moves that that use
both<00:05:22.099> of<00:05:22.130> your<00:05:22.400> characters<00:05:22.820> i<00:05:22.970> believe<00:05:23.210> which

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
both of your characters i believe which

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.629 
both of your characters i believe which
is<00:05:23.720> I<00:05:23.990> think<00:05:24.199> called<00:05:24.650> a<00:05:24.740> cross<00:05:24.979> assault<00:05:25.370> hence

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
is I think called a cross assault hence

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.420 
is I think called a cross assault hence
the<00:05:25.789> upcoming<00:05:26.750> online<00:05:27.110> reality<00:05:28.010> show<00:05:28.159> for

the upcoming online reality show for
this<00:05:28.610> game<00:05:30.190> but<00:05:31.190> you<00:05:31.729> also<00:05:31.880> have<00:05:32.060> your<00:05:32.180> normal

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479

this game but you also have your normal
ultra<00:05:32.840> so<00:05:33.050> if<00:05:33.169> you<00:05:33.289> knew<00:05:33.680> your<00:05:33.800> ultra<00:05:34.280> in<00:05:34.430> the

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
ultra so if you knew your ultra in the

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.120 
ultra so if you knew your ultra in the
first<00:05:35.000> game<00:05:35.180> then<00:05:35.360> you<00:05:35.620> know<00:05:36.620> it<00:05:36.740> in<00:05:36.830> this<00:05:36.949> one

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
first game then you know it in this one

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.920 
first game then you know it in this one
so<00:05:37.400> for<00:05:38.090> instance<00:05:38.120> I'm<00:05:38.570> not<00:05:38.690> sure<00:05:38.810> if<00:05:38.900> it's

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
so for instance I'm not sure if it's

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
there you have it so my first

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.640 
there you have it so my first
impressions<00:06:02.599> of<00:06:02.659> the<00:06:02.780> game<00:06:02.900> it's<00:06:03.169> cool<00:06:03.440> I

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
impressions of the game it's cool I

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.189 
impressions of the game it's cool I
definitely<00:06:04.159> digg<00:06:05.000> it<00:06:05.030> it<00:06:05.300> feels<00:06:05.539> a<00:06:05.780> lot<00:06:05.930> like

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
definitely digg it it feels a lot like

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.439 
definitely digg it it feels a lot like
street<00:06:06.919> fighter<00:06:06.949> 4<00:06:07.430> but<00:06:07.669> it's<00:06:07.820> definitely<00:06:08.030> it

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
street fighter 4 but it's definitely it

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.719 
street fighter 4 but it's definitely it
also<00:06:08.960> feels<00:06:09.139> different<00:06:09.620> so<00:06:10.250> you'll<00:06:10.370> notice

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
also feels different so you'll notice

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.010 
also feels different so you'll notice
right<00:06:10.789> when<00:06:11.000> you<00:06:11.060> start<00:06:11.270> playing<00:06:11.389> that<00:06:11.690> sort

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
right when you start playing that sort

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.990 
right when you start playing that sort
of<00:06:12.110> the<00:06:12.470> way<00:06:12.500> that<00:06:12.650> it<00:06:13.039> moves<00:06:13.310> and<00:06:13.550> feels<00:06:13.789> is<00:06:13.970> a

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
of the way that it moves and feels is a

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.750 
of the way that it moves and feels is a
little<00:06:14.300> different<00:06:14.770> but<00:06:15.770> I<00:06:15.830> like<00:06:16.159> the<00:06:16.430> tag

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
little different but I like the tag

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.279 
little different but I like the tag
system<00:06:17.030> because<00:06:17.389> I<00:06:17.479> think<00:06:17.539> it<00:06:17.720> opens<00:06:18.020> up<00:06:18.139> the

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
system because I think it opens up the

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:20.680 
system because I think it opens up the
whole<00:06:18.590> tier<00:06:18.949> thing<00:06:19.280> a<00:06:19.430> lot<00:06:19.550> more<00:06:19.789> and<00:06:20.029> i<00:06:20.510> like

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
whole tier thing a lot more and i like

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.450 
whole tier thing a lot more and i like
the<00:06:20.840> gem<00:06:21.050> system<00:06:21.440> because<00:06:21.740> i<00:06:21.770> think<00:06:22.070> that<00:06:22.250> that

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
the gem system because i think that that

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.420 
the gem system because i think that that
sort<00:06:23.300> of<00:06:23.389> increases<00:06:24.080> the<00:06:24.380> range<00:06:24.650> of<00:06:24.979> viable

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
sort of increases the range of viable

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.990 
sort of increases the range of viable
