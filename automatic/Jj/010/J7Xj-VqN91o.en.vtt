the 60 Hertz monitor anyway anyway I

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.380 
the 60 Hertz monitor anyway anyway I
would<00:00:35.100> decide<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> do<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.880> because<00:00:36.270> they

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
would decide to do this because they

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.790 
would decide to do this because they
didn't<00:00:36.660> want<00:00:36.840> people<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.260> encounter<00:00:37.440> issues

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.549 
didn't want people to encounter issues
with<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.430> lip-sync<00:00:38.879> small<00:00:39.719> problem<00:00:40.379> buyer

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
with the lip-sync small problem buyer

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.280 
with the lip-sync small problem buyer
because<00:00:40.950> people<00:00:41.219> have<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.579> many<00:00:41.730> different

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
because people have so many different

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.600 
because people have so many different
hardware<00:00:43.290> setups<00:00:43.739> you're<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:44.399> fixing

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
hardware setups you're not fixing

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.160 
hardware setups you're not fixing
anything<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.450> not<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> console

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
anything this is not like a console

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.569 
anything this is not like a console
where<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.649> put<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> static<00:00:47.280> number

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
where we can just put the static number

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.549 
where we can just put the static number
and<00:00:47.730> that's<00:00:47.850> that's<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.660> solution<00:00:48.840> no<00:00:49.230> putting

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
and that's that's a solution no putting

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.010 
and that's that's a solution no putting
a<00:00:49.739> static<00:00:50.100> number<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.550> PC<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:50.969> 30<00:00:51.449> or<00:00:51.600> 60<00:00:51.780> or

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
a static number on PC like 30 or 60 or

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.560 
a static number on PC like 30 or 60 or
something<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.800> forcing<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.910> just

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
something like and forcing it just

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.000 
something like and forcing it just
during<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.870> specific<00:00:55.440> part<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> game

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
during a specific part of the game

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.920 
during a specific part of the game
that's<00:00:56.190> really<00:00:56.460> terrible<00:00:57.149> because<00:00:57.719> these

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
that's really terrible because these

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.900 
that's really terrible because these
cinematics<00:00:58.649> these<00:00:58.800> dialogue<00:00:59.219> scenes<00:00:59.460> they're

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
in game they're something that runs

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
running in the same cinematics I might

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.789 
running in the same cinematics I might

this how do you fix this issue well it's
a<00:01:40.710> fixed<00:01:41.189> people<00:01:41.700> crate<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.060> 24<00:01:42.570> speed<00:01:42.810> rivals

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
a fixed people crate to 24 speed rivals

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.499 
a fixed people crate to 24 speed rivals
because<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:44.070> game<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.399> kept<00:01:44.670> at<00:01:44.970> first<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
because that game was kept at first the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.710 
because that game was kept at first the
overall<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:47.130> basically<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.270> add<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
overall and basically you just add the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.300 
overall and basically you just add the
console<00:01:49.110> command<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> short<00:01:49.950> cut<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.220> the

of this the lip synching is the same as

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.580 
of this the lip synching is the same as
with<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.100> 30fps<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.330> we<00:03:02.630> don't<00:03:02.900> see<00:03:03.140> terrible
