auto industry I think that what's ended
up<00:01:53.549> happening<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.119> people<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.869> become

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
up happening is people have become

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.560 
up happening is people have become
chained<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.399> their<00:01:56.520> car<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.119> want<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.390> say

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
chained to their car if we want to say

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.959 
chained to their car if we want to say
that<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:59.250> Bible<00:01:59.549> would<00:01:59.700> say<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:01.670> borrower<00:02:02.670> is

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
that the Bible would say the borrower is

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.170 
that the Bible would say the borrower is
servant<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.079> lender<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.700> case<00:02:05.969> I
