the tape all over and it's drying now

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.229 
the tape all over and it's drying now
and<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:35.620> have<00:00:35.769> this<00:00:35.890> huge<00:00:36.129> gap<00:00:36.220> that<00:00:36.790> we<00:00:36.879> see<00:00:37.059> on

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
and we have this huge gap that we see on

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
going that way on both of these builds

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.100 
going that way on both of these builds
over<00:00:42.940> here<00:00:43.120> on<00:00:43.210> this<00:00:43.329> side<00:00:43.390> you<00:00:43.719> see<00:00:43.870> it's<00:00:43.989> not

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
over here on this side you see it's not

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.250 
over here on this side you see it's not
nearly<00:00:44.350> as<00:00:44.469> bad<00:00:44.800> but<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:46.570> okay<00:00:46.899> we'll<00:00:47.050> take

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
nearly as bad but that's okay we'll take

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.139 
nearly as bad but that's okay we'll take
care<00:00:47.440> of<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.680> with<00:00:47.890> some<00:00:48.070> ever<00:00:48.640> coat<00:00:48.969> and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
got the impulse deck mounted on here now

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.880 
got the impulse deck mounted on here now
and<00:01:20.670> everything<00:01:21.670> looks<00:01:21.820> really<00:01:22.090> nice<00:01:22.299> on<00:01:22.600> it

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.690 
really happy with it all and we've got a
couple<00:01:26.619> little<00:01:26.770> light<00:01:26.979> leaks<00:01:27.189> here<00:01:27.400> and<00:01:27.520> there

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
couple little light leaks here and there

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.020 
couple little light leaks here and there
there's<00:01:28.330> 100<00:01:28.930> eath<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.610> shuttle<00:01:30.610> bay<00:01:30.759> here

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
there's 100 eath of the shuttle bay here

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.679 
there's 100 eath of the shuttle bay here
above<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.540> impulse<00:01:31.900> ports<00:01:32.320> I've<00:01:32.890> got<00:01:33.159> some

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
above the impulse ports I've got some

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.580 
above the impulse ports I've got some
filling<00:01:34.689> to<00:01:34.780> do<00:01:34.900> there<00:01:35.079> but<00:01:35.259> it's<00:01:35.380> really

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
filling to do there but it's really

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.980 
filling to do there but it's really
minor<00:01:35.829> and<00:01:36.130> it'll<00:01:37.000> be<00:01:37.119> easily<00:01:37.329> solved<00:01:37.810> and

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
minor and it'll be easily solved and

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.350 
minor and it'll be easily solved and
then<00:01:38.710> you<00:01:39.700> can<00:01:39.850> see<00:01:40.030> we've<00:01:40.180> got<00:01:40.299> our

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
then you can see we've got our

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.179 
then you can see we've got our
disrupters<00:01:41.200> on<00:01:41.439> the<00:01:41.590> bottom<00:01:41.829> of<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:41.979> wing<00:01:42.159> the

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
disrupters on the bottom of the wing the

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.460 
disrupters on the bottom of the wing the
forward<00:01:42.729> edges<00:01:42.850> mounted<00:01:43.420> up<00:01:43.509> there<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:43.960> couple

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
forward edges mounted up there a couple

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.810 
forward edges mounted up there a couple
light<00:01:44.619> leaks<00:01:44.799> around<00:01:44.950> them<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.369> take<00:01:45.549> care<00:01:45.700> of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
light leaks around them to take care of

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.460 
light leaks around them to take care of
as<00:01:45.939> well<00:01:45.970> but<00:01:46.420> they're<00:01:47.020> all<00:01:47.170> lit<00:01:47.350> up<00:01:47.439> like

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
as well but they're all lit up like

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.469 
as well but they're all lit up like
they're<00:01:47.740> supposed<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.040> be<00:01:48.189> and<00:01:49.060> I've<00:01:49.180> got<00:01:49.329> some

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
they're supposed to be and I've got some

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.560 
they're supposed to be and I've got some
canopy<00:01:49.869> glue<00:01:50.049> inside<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:51.090> engine<00:01:52.090> ports

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
canopy glue inside the engine ports

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.480 
canopy glue inside the engine ports
they're<00:01:52.840> drying<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.680> there's<00:01:54.130> tape<00:01:54.340> over
