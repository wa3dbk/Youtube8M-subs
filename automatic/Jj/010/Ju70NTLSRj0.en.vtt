00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
replaced you have to cut it off so then

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.950 
replaced you have to cut it off so then
you<00:00:37.770> go<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> store<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:39.149> purchase<00:00:39.629> a

you go to the store and you purchase a
new<00:00:40.320> end<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.860> need<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.550> lot<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.030> times

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
new end that you need and a lot of times

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.760 
new end that you need and a lot of times
you'll<00:00:42.390> find<00:00:42.450> these<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.110> are<00:00:43.140> barbed<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
you'll find these that are barbed and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.910 
you'll find these that are barbed and
they<00:00:44.670> are<00:00:44.820> theoretically<00:00:45.500> friction<00:00:46.500> fit<00:00:46.680> you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
they are theoretically friction fit you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.410 
they are theoretically friction fit you
just<00:00:47.129> push<00:00:47.309> them<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.910> barbs<00:00:48.210> hold

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
just push them on and the barbs hold

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.750 
just push them on and the barbs hold
them<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.690> place<00:00:48.800> I've<00:00:49.800> never<00:00:49.860> had<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.399> work

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
them in place I've never had that work

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639 
them in place I've never had that work
for<00:00:51.059> me<00:00:51.180> yet<00:00:51.390> they'll<00:00:51.629> hold<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> little

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
for me yet they'll hold for a little

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.500 
for me yet they'll hold for a little
while<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.070> they<00:00:53.280> leak<00:00:53.520> pretty<00:00:53.850> quickly<00:00:54.149> so

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
while but they leak pretty quickly so

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.439 
while but they leak pretty quickly so
then<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> end<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:55.739> doing<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.250> putting<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
then what I end up doing is putting a

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.049 
then what I end up doing is putting a
hose<00:00:57.840> clamp<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.129> I'd<00:00:59.250> buy<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> handful<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
hose clamp on so I'd buy a handful of

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.479 
hose clamp on so I'd buy a handful of
these<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.510> keep<00:01:00.629> them<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:00.930> my<00:01:01.079> truck<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.530> so

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
these and keep them in my truck and so

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.460 
these and keep them in my truck and so
that<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> could<00:01:03.090> repair<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> hose<00:01:03.960> whenever<00:01:04.409> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that I could repair a hose whenever I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.679 
that I could repair a hose whenever I
needed<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.580> problem<00:01:05.909> with<00:01:06.060> these<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.450> one

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
needed to the problem with these is one

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.120 
needed to the problem with these is one
you<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.320> them<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:07.950> buy

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you have to have them you have to go buy

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.510 
you have to have them you have to go buy
them<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.970> other<00:01:09.119> thing<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.920> after<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.250> clamp

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
them the other thing is after you clamp

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.859 
them the other thing is after you clamp
them<00:01:11.729> all<00:01:11.820> down<00:01:12.030> there's<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> little<00:01:12.540> tongue

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
them all down there's a little tongue

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.359 
them all down there's a little tongue
sticking<00:01:12.900> out<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.710> you've<00:01:13.799> either<00:01:13.920> got<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.220> cut

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
sticking out so you've either got to cut

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.570 
sticking out so you've either got to cut
that<00:01:14.520> off<00:01:14.580> which<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.240> not<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.840> easy<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.290> do

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
that off which is not that easy to do

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.859 
that off which is not that easy to do
the<00:01:17.580> other<00:01:17.700> thing<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.210> sharp<00:01:18.600> edges

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the other thing is you have sharp edges

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.890 
the other thing is you have sharp edges
if<00:01:19.710> you're<00:01:19.920> pulling<00:01:20.280> your<00:01:20.460> hoses<00:01:20.909> around<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
if you're pulling your hoses around the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.899 
if you're pulling your hoses around the
house<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:22.860> scuff<00:01:23.310> things<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
house it can it can scuff things up and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.850 
house it can it can scuff things up and
it's<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.060> something<00:01:24.600> else<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.020> cause<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
it's just something else to cause a

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.920 
it's just something else to cause a
problem<00:01:26.159> they<00:01:26.610> work<00:01:26.790> really<00:01:27.030> well<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.630> far<00:01:27.659> as

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
problem they work really well as far as

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.969 
problem they work really well as far as
holding<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:29.100> ends<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:31.290> didn't<00:01:31.829> like

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
holding the ends on but I didn't like

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.940 
holding the ends on but I didn't like
them<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.460> also<00:01:32.850> tried<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.630> putting<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
them I also tried just putting the the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.219 
them I also tried just putting the the
ends<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.000> then<00:01:36.270> taping<00:01:36.900> them<00:01:37.079> with

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
ends on and then taping them with

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.109 
ends on and then taping them with
electricians<00:01:37.799> tape<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.310> little<00:01:38.520> extra<00:01:38.790> help

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
electricians tape for little extra help

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.649 
electricians tape for little extra help
I<00:01:39.329> tried<00:01:39.960> heat-shrink<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.430> again<00:01:42.150> nothing

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
I tried heat-shrink and again nothing

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.200 
I tried heat-shrink and again nothing
worked<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.259> well<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.610> saw<00:01:44.909> this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
worked that well and then I saw this

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.440 
worked that well and then I saw this
tool<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.710> designed<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.450> car

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450

bit<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.800> waste<00:02:54.040> but<00:02:54.430> they<00:02:54.790> say<00:02:55.090> 15<00:02:55.600> times<00:02:55.960> the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
bit of a waste but they say 15 times the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
about a half inch hose there so we're

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.980 
about a half inch hose there so we're
looking<00:03:02.560> at<00:03:02.650> about<00:03:03.330> seven<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.510> half<00:03:04.540> eight

looking at about seven and a half eight

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.520 
looking at about seven and a half eight
inches<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.590> then<00:03:06.250> another<00:03:06.550> foot<00:03:07.350> they<00:03:08.350> need

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
inches and then another foot they need

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.530 
inches and then another foot they need
to<00:03:08.620> simply<00:03:09.040> put<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.400> two<00:03:09.580> ends<00:03:09.760> together<00:03:10.030> fold

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
to simply put the two ends together fold

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.840 
to simply put the two ends together fold
it<00:03:10.720> right<00:03:10.870> in<00:03:11.050> half<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.620> then<00:03:12.280> either<00:03:12.460> tape

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
it right in half and then either tape

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.390 
it right in half and then either tape
the<00:03:13.060> ends<00:03:13.330> together<00:03:13.530> or<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:15.040> can<00:03:15.190> use<00:03:15.370> a

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
the ends together or you can use a

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.790 
the ends together or you can use a
little<00:03:15.730> wire<00:03:16.510> nut<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.380> that's<00:03:17.560> just

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
little wire nut and that's just

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.520 
little wire nut and that's just
temporary<00:03:18.280> just<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.550> hold<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.850> together<00:03:19.000> for

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
temporary just to hold it together for

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.320 
temporary just to hold it together for
feeding<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:20.770> use<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.010> basic<00:03:21.670> double<00:03:22.150> wrap

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
feeding and I use a basic double wrap

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.810 
feeding and I use a basic double wrap
the<00:03:23.080> instructions<00:03:23.650> all<00:03:23.830> kind<00:03:24.100> of<00:03:24.190> fancy<00:03:24.550> wraps

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
the instructions all kind of fancy wraps

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.050

the<00:03:41.110> ends<00:03:42.510> nice<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.720> parallel<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.320> each<00:03:44.440> other

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
the ends nice and parallel to each other

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.380 
the ends nice and parallel to each other
feed<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.720> through<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:47.020> loop<00:03:47.170> once<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.400> then

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
feed it through the loop once and then

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.960 
feed it through the loop once and then
feed<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.050> through<00:03:50.080> one<00:03:50.680> more<00:03:50.890> time<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.520> then

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
feed it through one more time and then

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.880 
feed it through one more time and then
just<00:03:52.209> sort<00:03:52.390> of<00:03:52.510> take<00:03:53.050> a<00:03:53.080> couple<00:03:53.530> of<00:03:53.590> minutes

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
just sort of take a couple of minutes

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.940 
just sort of take a couple of minutes
and<00:03:54.130> and<00:03:54.520> line<00:03:54.940> them<00:03:55.120> up<00:03:55.270> I'm<00:03:56.110> sure<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.709> guys

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
and and line them up I'm sure that guys

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.130 
and and line them up I'm sure that guys
that<00:03:57.160> do<00:03:57.310> this<00:03:57.489> all<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.700> time<00:03:57.850> can<00:03:58.360> be<00:03:58.540> really

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
that do this all the time can be really

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.870 
that do this all the time can be really
quick<00:03:59.350> at<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.590> obviously<00:04:00.130> I<00:04:00.160> don't<00:04:00.430> have<00:04:00.580> to<00:04:00.730> do

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
quick at it obviously I don't have to do

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.350 
quick at it obviously I don't have to do
it<00:04:01.000> as<00:04:01.140> frequently<00:04:02.140> that<00:04:02.320> I've<00:04:02.500> become<00:04:03.250> very

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
it as frequently that I've become very

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.360 
it as frequently that I've become very
proficient<00:04:04.360> at<00:04:04.660> it<00:04:04.720> but<00:04:05.590> everyone<00:04:06.070> works

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
proficient at it but everyone works

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.360 
proficient at it but everyone works
every<00:04:06.820> time<00:04:07.380> so<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.470> can<00:04:08.680> see<00:04:08.860> all<00:04:09.010> I've<00:04:09.190> done

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
every time so you can see all I've done

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.060 
every time so you can see all I've done
is<00:04:09.430> just<00:04:09.640> loop<00:04:10.150> it<00:04:10.270> through<00:04:10.600> twice<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:11.350> each

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
is just loop it through twice and each

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.270 
is just loop it through twice and each
time<00:04:12.340> they<00:04:12.459> come<00:04:12.489> came<00:04:13.209> through<00:04:13.660> I<00:04:14.100> put<00:04:15.100> the

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
time they come came through I put the

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.430 
time they come came through I put the
the<00:04:15.310> neck<00:04:15.910> strap<00:04:16.090> inside<00:04:16.810> of<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.020> previous

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
the neck strap inside of the previous

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.690 
the neck strap inside of the previous
wrap<00:04:17.650> so<00:04:17.919> that's<00:04:18.100> twice<00:04:18.400> around<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:21.370> you<00:04:21.549> can

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
wrap so that's twice around and you can

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.020 
wrap so that's twice around and you can
take<00:04:21.910> off<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.800> wire<00:04:23.800> tie<00:04:24.100> or<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.400> tape

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
take off the wire tie or the tape

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.080 
take off the wire tie or the tape
and<00:04:25.500> then<00:04:26.500> place<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:28.000> tip<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.390> the<00:04:28.480> tool<00:04:30.090> right

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
and then place the tip of the tool right

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.080 
and then place the tip of the tool right
on<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.540> right<00:04:32.050> put<00:04:32.410> that<00:04:32.610> detent<00:04:33.610> or<00:04:33.910> that

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
on the right put that detent or that

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.040 
on the right put that detent or that
little<00:04:34.390> lob<00:04:34.800> split<00:04:35.800> on<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.100> end<00:04:36.250> of<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.460> tool

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
little lob split on the end of the tool

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.970 
little lob split on the end of the tool
right<00:04:38.050> on<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.320> loop<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.740> then<00:04:38.830> I'm<00:04:38.950> just

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
right on the loop and then I'm just

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.030 
right on the loop and then I'm just
going<00:04:39.310> to<00:04:39.370> crank<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.880> tool<00:04:40.090> down<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.980> this<00:04:41.980> is

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
going to crank the tool down and this is

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.400 
going to crank the tool down and this is
tightening<00:04:42.820> that<00:04:42.970> loop<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.840> double<00:04:44.200> loop

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
tightening that loop that double loop

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.010 
tightening that loop that double loop
and<00:04:44.700> it's<00:04:45.700> just<00:04:45.910> continuing<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.540> pull<00:04:46.870> the

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
and it's just continuing to pull the

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.840 
and it's just continuing to pull the
slack<00:04:47.290> out<00:04:47.560> of<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:47.860> and<00:04:48.010> then<00:04:48.370> when<00:04:48.490> I<00:04:48.520> get<00:04:48.700> down

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
slack out of it and then when I get down

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.350 
slack out of it and then when I get down
when<00:04:49.090> it's<00:04:49.240> nice<00:04:49.390> and<00:04:49.420> tight<00:04:50.820> all<00:04:51.820> I<00:04:51.880> have<00:04:52.180> to

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
when it's nice and tight all I have to

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.540 
when it's nice and tight all I have to
do<00:04:52.510> now<00:04:52.780> is<00:04:52.810> flip<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.650> tool<00:04:53.860> over<00:04:53.890> it<00:04:54.310> takes<00:04:54.490> a

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
do now is flip the tool over it takes a

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.840 
do now is flip the tool over it takes a
little<00:04:54.670> force<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:56.710> last<00:04:57.010> little<00:04:57.460> bend

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
little force and that last little bend

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.980 
little force and that last little bend
and<00:04:58.200> clamps<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.740> wire<00:05:00.010> so<00:05:00.970> once<00:05:01.360> that's<00:05:01.600> done

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
and clamps the wire so once that's done

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.030 
and clamps the wire so once that's done
all<00:05:02.710> I<00:05:02.770> need<00:05:03.340> to<00:05:03.460> do<00:05:03.610> is<00:05:04.740> release<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:05.770> tool<00:05:06.660> and

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
all I need to do is release the tool and

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.400 
all I need to do is release the tool and
then<00:05:09.040> you<00:05:09.190> can<00:05:09.370> see<00:05:09.610> I've<00:05:09.880> got<00:05:10.450> a<00:05:10.510> perfect

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
then you can see I've got a perfect

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.570 
then you can see I've got a perfect
clamp<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.750> all<00:05:13.750> I<00:05:13.780> have<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:13.990> do<00:05:14.260> is<00:05:14.470> snip<00:05:15.400> the

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
clamp and all I have to do is snip the

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.520 
clamp and all I have to do is snip the
ends<00:05:15.850> off<00:05:16.000> they're<00:05:16.360> just<00:05:16.630> bent<00:05:16.960> over<00:05:17.230> that

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
ends off they're just bent over that

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.690 
ends off they're just bent over that
gives<00:05:18.130> you<00:05:18.250> all<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.580> hold<00:05:18.790> you<00:05:19.000> need<00:05:20.490> so<00:05:21.490> if<00:05:21.610> I

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
gives you all the hold you need so if I

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.250 
gives you all the hold you need so if I
take<00:05:21.910> a<00:05:21.940> little<00:05:22.150> pair<00:05:22.450> of<00:05:22.540> wire<00:05:22.750> nippers<00:05:23.169> so

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
take a little pair of wire nippers so

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.600 
take a little pair of wire nippers so
I'll<00:05:23.350> leave<00:05:23.500> about<00:05:23.770> a<00:05:23.830> quarter<00:05:24.160> of<00:05:24.340> an<00:05:24.460> inch

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
I'll leave about a quarter of an inch

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.280 
I'll leave about a quarter of an inch
and<00:05:24.850> then<00:05:25.030> I'll<00:05:25.150> take<00:05:25.390> a<00:05:25.419> pair<00:05:25.690> of<00:05:25.720> pliers<00:05:25.930> and

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
and then I'll take a pair of pliers and

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.250 
and then I'll take a pair of pliers and
just<00:05:26.470> bend<00:05:26.710> those<00:05:27.190> down<00:05:27.930> so<00:05:28.930> you<00:05:29.020> can<00:05:29.140> see

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
just bend those down so you can see

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.219 
just bend those down so you can see
you've<00:05:29.350> got<00:05:29.410> this<00:05:29.680> very<00:05:29.800> slim<00:05:30.630> clamp<00:05:31.630> did<00:05:32.080> have

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
you've got this very slim clamp did have

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.310 
you've got this very slim clamp did have
custom<00:05:32.650> made<00:05:32.890> and<00:05:33.720> this<00:05:34.720> won't<00:05:34.900> rub<00:05:35.200> on

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
custom made and this won't rub on

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.320 
custom made and this won't rub on
anything<00:05:35.830> and<00:05:36.040> I<00:05:36.100> could<00:05:36.280> also<00:05:36.430> tape<00:05:36.820> this<00:05:37.060> if<00:05:37.240> I

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
anything and I could also tape this if I

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.550 
anything and I could also tape this if I
wanted<00:05:37.600> to<00:05:37.690> make<00:05:37.870> sure<00:05:38.020> that<00:05:38.200> it<00:05:38.350> didn't

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
wanted to make sure that it didn't

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.080 
wanted to make sure that it didn't
scratch<00:05:38.800> anything<00:05:39.070> but<00:05:39.340> it's<00:05:39.460> all<00:05:39.669> smooth

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
scratch anything but it's all smooth

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.450 
scratch anything but it's all smooth
surfaces<00:05:40.690> now<00:05:40.930> just<00:05:41.710> round<00:05:41.950> it<00:05:42.010> over<00:05:42.280> wire

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
surfaces now just round it over wire
