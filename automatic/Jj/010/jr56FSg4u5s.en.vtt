we<00:00:01.079> have<00:00:01.319> yet<00:00:01.620> another<00:00:01.770> massive<00:00:02.700> object<00:00:03.330> being

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
we have yet another massive object being

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.680 
we have yet another massive object being
recorded<00:00:04.740> by<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.190> Sun<00:00:05.609> some<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.540> may

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
recorded by the Sun some of you may

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.110 
recorded by the Sun some of you may
remember<00:00:06.799> the<00:00:07.799> video<00:00:08.099> I<00:00:08.189> put<00:00:08.490> out<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.910> the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
remember the video I put out of the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.879 
remember the video I put out of the
massive<00:00:09.570> object<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.260> was<00:00:10.380> basically

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
massive object that was basically

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.419 
massive object that was basically
connected<00:00:11.610> by<00:00:11.820> tether<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.750> Sun<00:00:13.190> it<00:00:14.190> looked

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
connected by tether to the Sun it looked

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.730 
connected by tether to the Sun it looked
like<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.820> was<00:00:14.940> feeding<00:00:15.269> off<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.440> sun's

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
like it was feeding off of the sun's

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.230 
like it was feeding off of the sun's
energy<00:00:17.480> at<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.720> point<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.560> clip<00:00:20.240> this

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
energy at this point in this clip this

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.450 
energy at this point in this clip this
one<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.810> unique<00:00:22.080> because<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.890> leaves<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.430> very

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
one is unique because it leaves a very

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.170 
one is unique because it leaves a very
long<00:00:24.119> trail<00:00:24.570> behind<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.380> yes<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.939> would

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
long trail behind it and yes this would

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.460 
long trail behind it and yes this would
be<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.539> size<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.930> Earth<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:29.160> object<00:00:29.429> is

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
be the size of Earth and this object is

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.540 
be the size of Earth and this object is
would<00:00:31.470> be<00:00:31.650> about<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> size<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> moon<00:00:33.149> over

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
would be about the size of the moon over

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.959 
would be about the size of the moon over

SDO all these other satellites that
watch<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.370> Sun<00:00:59.670> only<00:01:00.120> give<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.640> shots<00:01:02.640> in

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
watch the Sun only give you shots in

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.679 
watch the Sun only give you shots in
increments<00:01:03.619> of<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:05.040> 5<00:01:05.850> minutes<00:01:06.180> 7<00:01:06.659> minutes

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689

12 minutes

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.520 
12 minutes
however<00:01:09.299> they<00:01:09.479> end<00:01:09.630> up<00:01:09.720> putting<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.260> there

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
however they end up putting it out there

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.160 
however they end up putting it out there
and<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:12.600> made<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.869> getting<00:01:14.900> your<00:01:15.900> day's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
and you made up getting your day's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.969 
and you made up getting your day's
progress<00:01:17.130> through<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.759> those<00:01:18.979> little

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
progress through all of those little

progress through all of those little
bits<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:20.729> put<00:01:20.970> out<00:01:21.830> but<00:01:22.830> there's<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.369> lot

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
bits that they put out but there's a lot

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.660 
bits that they put out but there's a lot
of<00:01:23.970> data<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.780> always<00:01:25.080> missing<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.070> when

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
of data that is always missing so when

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.460 
of data that is always missing so when
one<00:01:26.909> slips<00:01:27.240> through<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.450> cracks<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:28.140> always

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
one slips through the cracks it's always

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.730 
one slips through the cracks it's always
good<00:01:28.880> always<00:01:29.880> good<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.390> see<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.500> share

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
good always good to see and to share

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.340 
good always good to see and to share
with<00:01:31.890> everyone<00:01:32.250> else<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:33.780> show<00:01:34.049> them<00:01:34.320> that

with everyone else and to show them that
there<00:01:34.860> are<00:01:35.070> indeed<00:01:35.390> other<00:01:36.390> objects<00:01:37.350> out<00:01:37.530> there

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
there are indeed other objects out there

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.020 
there are indeed other objects out there
some<00:01:38.900> roughly<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.049> size<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.590> moon<00:01:41.030> that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
some roughly the size of the moon that

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.560 
some roughly the size of the moon that
our<00:01:42.240> zipping<00:01:42.780> past<00:01:43.259> past<00:01:44.100> our<00:01:44.340> Sun<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.880> as

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
our zipping past past our Sun and as

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.530 
our zipping past past our Sun and as
I've<00:01:45.780> shown<00:01:45.960> before<00:01:45.990> others<00:01:46.799> using<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.909> much

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
I've shown before others using it much

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.030 
I've shown before others using it much
like<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> gas<00:01:49.140> station<00:01:49.470> or<00:01:50.369> feeding<00:01:50.820> off<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.270> it

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
like a gas station or feeding off of it

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.469 
like a gas station or feeding off of it
but<00:01:53.040> there<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.340> go<00:01:53.490> I'll<00:01:53.759> leave<00:01:53.970> links<00:01:54.000> you

but there you go I'll leave links you

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.749 
but there you go I'll leave links you
can<00:01:54.630> watch<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.979> video<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.790> its<00:01:57.420> entirety

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
can watch the video in its entirety

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.780 
can watch the video in its entirety
until<00:01:59.759> next<00:01:59.880> time<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.149> has<00:02:00.360> been<00:02:00.540> dr.<00:02:00.719> 7<00:02:01.790> eyes
