00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.750
 first thunderstorm in this hell first thunder 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.750
 we can see these shots 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.440
 and so here again I want to say that 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.670
 first base 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:38.750
 all bitch do this year here and want 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.410
 tell you how you can 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.700
 approximately now will be next 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.239
 approximately know the distance then 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.760
 thunderstorms 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.940
 that is, from your location we 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.650
 we know that the speed of sound is 330 meters 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.340
 give me a sec 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.760
 that is, we only saw lightning 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.760
 seconds slow 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:10.400
 123 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:21.570
 so here if there are just two three 4 5 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:24.030
 6 7 8 9 10 10 com that is, we know what 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.150
 three when we are ready to count it will be 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.300
 kilometer 10 seconds about three 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.590
 kilometers to 3,300 somewhere three with 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.190
 half a kilometer away is 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.800
 break the mummies like this 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.620
 we can find out where are on what 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.830
 the distance will tear us apart 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.830
 distance 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.120
 after the lightning, we count that second 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.110
 I think it is clear when 330 meters per second and 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:04.020
 that's when we three seconds pass approximately 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:13.650
 kilometer will we have six seconds this 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:19.500
 already two kilometers 9 seconds one two three 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.760
 four five six seven eight nine 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:30.989
 1011 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:34.530
 the length I probably go stopped counting 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.530
 let's all 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.230
 so now 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.970
 change the font to a larger one to 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.820
 I could see you better once again all 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:00.590
 I will tell that is, see the speed of sound 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:03.630
 about 330 meters 330 meters per second 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:08.070
 write so meter per second that is for 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.590
 three seconds if we count you 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:15.800
 to three as we saw mania with you 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:19.590
 get about 330 meters multiply 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:26.660
 multiply by 3 seconds and we have with you 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:30.739
 it will turn out 3 990 here 990 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.840
 meters this is 990 meters will be 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.940
 distance to thunderstorms 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.220
 approximately here we also consider a 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.920
 if there is more cheek more seconds 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.890
 also can the number of seconds at 330 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.959
 roughly 300 to do such here with us 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.080
 already approximate distance will be 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.160
 that is, in this way you can count 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.160
 approximate distance to thunderstorms
