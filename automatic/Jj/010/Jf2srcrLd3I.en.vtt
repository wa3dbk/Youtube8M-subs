00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.750 
interesting snatch it and it just
floated<00:02:21.120> out<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.599> Balkan<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.760> difficult

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
floated out this Balkan the difficult

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.259 
floated out this Balkan the difficult
thing<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.440> cool<00:02:25.680> spit<00:02:25.980> off<00:02:26.269> around

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
thing is that the cool spit off around

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.520 
thing is that the cool spit off around
the<00:02:27.569> other<00:02:27.750> man

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
the other man

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.610 
the other man
so<00:02:29.129> what<00:02:29.370> if<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.610> was<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.200> really<00:02:31.200> figure<00:02:31.500> out

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
so what if it was I really figure out

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.380 
so what if it was I really figure out
which<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.370> not<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.700> best<00:02:32.910> thing<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.390> closest

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
which is not the best thing the closest

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.810 
which is not the best thing the closest
and<00:02:34.540> first<00:02:34.900> what<00:02:35.080> they<00:02:35.200> just<00:02:35.380> saw<00:02:35.620> was<00:02:36.580> good

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
and first what they just saw was good

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.980 
and first what they just saw was good
thing<00:02:37.030> because<00:02:37.210> it's<00:02:37.630> all<00:02:37.780> about<00:02:37.870> what

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
thing because it's all about what

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.200 
thing because it's all about what
children<00:02:38.710> only<00:02:39.010> did<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:39.580> test<00:02:39.820> come<00:02:40.030> back

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
children only did the you test come back

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.360 
children only did the you test come back
and<00:02:40.960> it<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:41.590> split<00:02:41.770> up<00:02:41.890> again<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.540> that's<00:02:43.690> it

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
and it is split up again so that's it

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.630 
and it is split up again so that's it
and<00:02:45.370> now<00:02:45.700> go<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:45.910> pine<00:02:46.240> trees<00:02:46.420> ready
