he<00:05:58.349> is<00:05:58.500> so<00:05:59.159> that<00:05:59.190> you<00:05:59.759> know<00:05:59.880> this<00:06:00.000> still<00:06:00.360> works

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
he is so that you know this still works

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.570 
he is so that you know this still works
but<00:06:00.810> I<00:06:00.870> think<00:06:01.139> this<00:06:01.380> is<00:06:01.530> better<00:06:01.800> I<00:06:02.070> just<00:06:02.130> like

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
but I think this is better I just like

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.959 
but I think this is better I just like
how<00:06:02.729> this<00:06:03.180> size<00:06:03.979> difference<00:06:04.979> works<00:06:05.759> between

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:05.969 
how this size difference works between

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.180 
how this size difference works between
series<00:06:06.780> 6<00:06:06.990> Wolverine<00:06:07.440> and<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:07.740> saber-tooth

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
series 6 Wolverine and the saber-tooth

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.350 
series 6 Wolverine and the saber-tooth
that's<00:06:08.370> how<00:06:08.490> I<00:06:08.520> have<00:06:08.729> it<00:06:08.759> set<00:06:08.880> up<00:06:09.120> in<00:06:09.240> my

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
that's how I have it set up in my

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.120 
that's how I have it set up in my
display<00:06:09.690> just<00:06:09.960> think<00:06:10.139> that's<00:06:10.320> perfect<00:06:10.830> I<00:06:10.949> love

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
display just think that's perfect I love

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.450 
display just think that's perfect I love
it

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
it

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.550 
it
I<00:06:11.490> think<00:06:11.969> that's<00:06:12.150> really<00:06:12.330> really<00:06:12.419> cool<00:06:12.840> the

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
I think that's really really cool the

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.920 
I think that's really really cool the
series<00:06:13.889> 3<00:06:14.280> Wolverine<00:06:14.820> works<00:06:15.419> really<00:06:15.690> well

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
series 3 Wolverine works really well

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.040 
series 3 Wolverine works really well
with<00:06:16.440> this<00:06:16.620> saber-tooth<00:06:17.130> also<00:06:17.880> I<00:06:18.090> feel<00:06:18.930> like

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
with this saber-tooth also I feel like

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.020 
with this saber-tooth also I feel like
the<00:06:19.169> series<00:06:19.440> 3<00:06:19.650> Wolverine<00:06:20.039> is<00:06:20.159> too<00:06:20.490> big<00:06:20.789> for

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
the series 3 Wolverine is too big for

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.980 
the series 3 Wolverine is too big for
the<00:06:21.150> Marvel<00:06:21.539> Legends<00:06:21.919> Sabretooth<00:06:22.919> but<00:06:23.990> great

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
the Marvel Legends Sabretooth but great

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.540 
the Marvel Legends Sabretooth but great
with<00:06:25.289> the<00:06:25.409> Select<00:06:25.830> I<00:06:25.979> think<00:06:26.190> that's<00:06:26.340> just

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
with the Select I think that's just

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.310 
with the Select I think that's just
perfect<00:06:27.210> that<00:06:27.270> that<00:06:27.780> that<00:06:27.900> works<00:06:28.110> out<00:06:28.259> really

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
perfect that that that works out really

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.310 
perfect that that that works out really
well<00:06:28.800> too<00:06:29.419> that's<00:06:30.419> some<00:06:30.599> actually<00:06:31.020> that<00:06:31.139> may

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
well too that's some actually that may

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.230 
well too that's some actually that may
work<00:06:31.620> a<00:06:31.710> little<00:06:31.830> bit<00:06:31.979> better<00:06:32.190> than<00:06:32.430> the<00:06:32.759> series

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
work a little bit better than the series

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.990 
work a little bit better than the series
6<00:06:33.509> I<00:06:33.719> don't<00:06:33.840> know<00:06:33.900> it's<00:06:34.080> up<00:06:34.169> to<00:06:34.289> you<00:06:34.409> guys<00:06:35.000> and

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
6 I don't know it's up to you guys and

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.689 
6 I don't know it's up to you guys and
then<00:06:36.740> then<00:06:37.740> there's<00:06:37.979> the<00:06:38.250> astonishing

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
then then there's the astonishing

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.659 
then then there's the astonishing
Wolverine<00:06:39.240> which<00:06:39.990> i<00:06:40.349> think<00:06:40.469> is<00:06:40.740> too<00:06:41.039> small<00:06:41.430> for

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:41.669 
Wolverine which i think is too small for

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.689 
Wolverine which i think is too small for
this<00:06:41.820> Sabretooth<00:06:42.330> that's<00:06:42.570> just<00:06:42.840> too<00:06:43.139> tiny<00:06:43.349> but

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:43.699 
this Sabretooth that's just too tiny but

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:46.219 
this Sabretooth that's just too tiny but
again<00:06:44.699> works<00:06:44.940> better<00:06:45.630> with<00:06:45.840> the<00:06:45.870> Marvel

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:46.229 
again works better with the Marvel

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:48.050 
again works better with the Marvel
Legends<00:06:46.530> 1<00:06:46.710> so<00:06:47.219> you<00:06:47.310> can<00:06:47.370> see<00:06:47.460> that<00:06:47.789> right

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
Legends 1 so you can see that right

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.830 
Legends 1 so you can see that right
there<00:06:48.590> and<00:06:49.590> then<00:06:49.740> to<00:06:50.159> compare<00:06:50.550> him<00:06:50.729> it<00:06:50.849> if<00:06:51.570> you

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
there and then to compare him it if you

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.240 
there and then to compare him it if you
want<00:06:51.990> to<00:06:52.050> put<00:06:52.169> them<00:06:52.289> in<00:06:52.320> your<00:06:52.440> Brotherhood<00:06:52.770> set

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
want to put them in your Brotherhood set

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.219 
want to put them in your Brotherhood set

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:57.290 
up just I have a couple of the heavy
hitters<00:06:55.589> right<00:06:55.830> here<00:06:56.190> a<00:06:56.310> couple<00:06:56.940> of<00:06:57.029> the<00:06:57.120> other

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
hitters right here a couple of the other

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.279 
hitters right here a couple of the other
big<00:06:57.539> guys<00:06:57.750> they're<00:06:57.960> using

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
big guys they're using

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:00.589 
big guys they're using
to<00:06:58.469> juggernut<00:06:58.919> so<00:06:59.129> he's<00:06:59.279> not<00:06:59.550> taller<00:07:00.360> than

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 
to juggernut so he's not taller than

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:02.809 
to juggernut so he's not taller than
juggernaut<00:07:01.139> which<00:07:01.469> I<00:07:01.589> like<00:07:01.800> I<00:07:02.099> don't<00:07:02.520> want<00:07:02.729> him

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 
juggernaut which I like I don't want him

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:04.070 
juggernaut which I like I don't want him
to<00:07:02.879> be<00:07:02.969> bigger<00:07:03.240> than<00:07:03.419> juggernaut<00:07:03.869> but<00:07:03.990> he's

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
to be bigger than juggernaut but he's

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.359 
to be bigger than juggernaut but he's
still<00:07:04.289> pretty<00:07:04.529> damn<00:07:04.740> big

00:07:05.359 --> 00:07:05.369 
still pretty damn big

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:09.100 
still pretty damn big
so<00:07:06.240> that's<00:07:06.449> neat<00:07:06.779> and<00:07:06.990> then<00:07:07.110> next<00:07:07.289> to<00:07:07.469> the<00:07:07.589> blob

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
so that's neat and then next to the blob

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:14.329 
so that's neat and then next to the blob
he's<00:07:10.110> still<00:07:10.439> whoa<00:07:11.960> he's<00:07:12.960> still<00:07:13.319> shorter<00:07:14.189> than

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:14.339 
he's still whoa he's still shorter than

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:16.040 
he's still whoa he's still shorter than
the<00:07:14.430> blob<00:07:14.699> so<00:07:15.240> I<00:07:15.270> think<00:07:15.389> that's<00:07:15.719> good<00:07:16.020> that

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050 
the blob so I think that's good that

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.589 
the blob so I think that's good that
he's<00:07:16.349> not<00:07:16.499> taller<00:07:16.889> than<00:07:17.249> the<00:07:17.999> other<00:07:18.149> big<00:07:18.389> guys

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 
he's not taller than the other big guys

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:20.629 
he's not taller than the other big guys
you<00:07:19.139> know<00:07:19.289> that<00:07:19.860> he<00:07:20.009> shouldn't<00:07:20.309> be<00:07:20.399> taller

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 
you know that he shouldn't be taller

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.820 
you know that he shouldn't be taller
than<00:07:20.759> so<00:07:21.659> yeah<00:07:21.899> if<00:07:22.020> you<00:07:22.110> guys<00:07:22.229> get<00:07:22.439> a<00:07:22.499> chance<00:07:22.529> to

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
than so yeah if you guys get a chance to

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.350 
than so yeah if you guys get a chance to
pick<00:07:22.979> this<00:07:23.099> guy<00:07:23.309> up<00:07:23.339> he<00:07:23.639> should<00:07:23.789> not<00:07:23.999> be<00:07:24.149> hard

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
pick this guy up he should not be hard

to<00:07:24.419> find<00:07:24.719> and<00:07:25.020> I<00:07:25.080> think<00:07:25.110> 20<00:07:25.559> bucks<00:07:25.770> is<00:07:25.949> more

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:26.159 
to find and I think 20 bucks is more
