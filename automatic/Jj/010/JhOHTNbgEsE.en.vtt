straight<00:01:34.880> also<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.600> white<00:01:36.810> list<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.439> be<00:01:37.470> made

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
straight also the white list can be made

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.020 
straight also the white list can be made
with<00:01:39.930> any<00:01:40.079> colored<00:01:40.740> lining<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.820> white

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
with any colored lining so it's white

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.910 
with any colored lining so it's white
lace<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.689> lightning<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.380> any<00:01:43.619> color
