 move around here we push go to 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.730
 car since at the moment gps 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.000
 I have disabled we just remove 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.880
 last known position and as you can see 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.860
 miscalculation begins routes that me

 really like this thing that saidik always 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.600

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.790
 navigation and navigation begins 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.920
 as you will see at the moment navigation 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.470
 didn't start just because 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.410
 there is no gps signal in the second part 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.170

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.310
 navigation system that I really 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.460
 like this one big plus which i 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.310
 I 'll call it right away that everything on the map 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.680
 routes are shown in purple 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.800
 this color separates very well 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.180
 from the rest of the map so the route immediately 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.180
 very well visible
