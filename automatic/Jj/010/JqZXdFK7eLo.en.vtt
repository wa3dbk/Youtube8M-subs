00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.100
 and the desire for it to rain tonight 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:04.530
 of the orbit that works well laid 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.290
 reduces the orbital generator 25% 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.610
 affirmative reducing 25 enable the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.610

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.400
 I think that captures one very well confirms the 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.409
 desire and wait for more data has the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.130
 coordinated sir the coding kit 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:29.780
 the black data I want to confirm what 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:32.970

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.230
 Y 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.610

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.160

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.960

 I do not know anything 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.610
 If we're not together, well, I think that 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.610
 nothing 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.950

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.510
 we have everything we need to 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.150
 build a huge cloud 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.090
 proportions right here within the 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.550
 ship 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.830
 because with our knowledge it is 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:31.270
 true true putting everything 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.270
 our heart 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.150
 is that we are waiting for work 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.409
 I present to you the machine that makes 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.080
 300 luxury torment clouds 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:03.259
 knights start the sequence of 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.259
 ignition 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.110
 activate active capacitors like 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.730
 thinkers 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.730
 slow slow 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.530
 and it became a reality 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.539
 we achieve 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:46.830
 the promotion I can feel the no more than 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.830
 this horrible asteroid 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:52.050
 orbital failing 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.729
 It's very simple to see this little device 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.710
 good since we use it to build the 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:59.430
 cloud machine we can not keep ourselves 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.430
 in orbit 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.220
 If that 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.800
 look, that's something you do not see every day 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.380

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:33.650

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.289
 Farmer desire 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:41.559
 they made their dreams come true 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:44.469
 yes but unfortunately that our 

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:46.659
 work will see everyone have a 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:49.839
 responsibility assigned here in 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:53.619
