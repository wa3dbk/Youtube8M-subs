 hello it's pauline of the little 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.040
 grocery store and today I present to you 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.440
 my little origami boat postcard 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 for that you will need your 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.090
 image found on the internet of a map 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.820
 post of a needle with a big cat 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:29.010
 to be able to pass the film I chose 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.679
 navy a compass a pencil a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.489
 pen a pair of scissors a small 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:40.890
 rule of the macintosh buffers and a 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:44.040
 inkwell so we will start with 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.730
 cuts and our picture then I 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.309
 take about two centimeters to 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.320
 side of each edge 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:56.910
 you go then for them to go there 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.129
 too stupid to make small holes 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.250
 after that we will spend our sons 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.150
 It's okay 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.310
 you draw the boat so we do not 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.420
 not very well but you all have 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.330
 the little dots and here we go 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:17.050
 needle with the film and we will follow 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.160
 our points we can also help the image 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.160
 to not skip a point 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.190
 and we make 1 1 not tight for good 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.190
 maintain the whole 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.890
 it's for you 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.080
 the groups 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.380
 we will finish we cut everything 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.640
 and you have a nice boat then we 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.330
 will choose to write on our map 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.869
 mail with stamps so we print 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:16.300
 good for his brand and after we 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:20.170
 iron for a more natural effect 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.640
 frame you decorate you have a pretty 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.640
