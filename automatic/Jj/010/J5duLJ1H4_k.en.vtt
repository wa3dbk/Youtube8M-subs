00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:31.500
 a new hope a password I am 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.369
 but nothing happens to me that repeats 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.369
 book out of your bag 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.770
 Wrong password 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.210
 she opens the rune page 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.810
 taught 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.480
 Well, I already tried that 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:56.730
 they concentrate 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:01:00.680
 suddenly stands behind her vincent 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.610
 should you contract again 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.290
 Sorry I did not want you 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.550
 scare 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.229
 what do you mean with side panels 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.610
 be transferred from stones to paper 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:23.400
 they are sometimes reversed 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:25.850
 mirrored thank you bands are the same as 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.850
 last time 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.210
 I'm going to her room 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.190
 She sits down at her desk and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:47.280
 try the rounds with a mirror too 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:52.920
 read whatever works that's it 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:56.060
 but what does that mean he presses on the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.060
 stone of her bangle 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.590
 the other girls are standing outside 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.899
 The corridor in front of the door quickly strikes me 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.540
 close the book and hiding in the 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:18.020
 storeroom and she tries it 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:19.880
 again when the ears sound formal 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:27.830
 new hope becomes a shrill sound 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:30.230
 bring closer the magic transforms mia 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.560
 and bring them up really fast after ten 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.150
 topia, however, is not landing 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.150
 gentler than the last time 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.910
 but I still have to go to London 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.209
 work 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:55.900
 na good ears above work spitz 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.900
 still too short 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.310
 I'm really back in the center 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.880
 and now I get through the wind of 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.670
 sam tobey 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.090
 as beautiful as a picture 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.260
 I understand how to put a book 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.260
 fulfillment goes
