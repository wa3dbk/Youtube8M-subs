she<00:00:40.360> would<00:00:40.600> lose<00:00:40.720> attention<00:00:40.870> so<00:00:41.620> we're<00:00:41.890> gonna

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
she would lose attention so we're gonna

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.790 
she would lose attention so we're gonna
look<00:00:42.370> on<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.610> electrodes<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:44.500> may<00:00:44.710> have

look on the electrodes you may have
heard<00:00:44.949> of<00:00:45.100> an<00:00:45.190> EEG<00:00:45.550> that's<00:00:45.910> what<00:00:46.030> this<00:00:46.120> is<00:00:46.180> like

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.290 
heard of an EEG that's what this is like
oh

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.480 

now<00:00:51.300> we'll<00:00:51.780> turn<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> machine<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.380> I<00:00:52.890> will<00:00:53.370> see

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
now we'll turn the machine on I will see

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.860 
now we'll turn the machine on I will see
if<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.760> get<00:00:53.850> addy<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.180> pay<00:00:54.330> attention<00:00:54.450> to

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
if we can get addy to pay attention to

if we can get addy to pay attention to
this<00:00:54.990> this<00:00:55.410> machine<00:00:55.830> is<00:00:56.010> looking<00:00:56.280> at<00:00:56.400> what<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
this this machine is looking at what the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.670 
this this machine is looking at what the
brain<00:00:57.000> guessed<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.870> will<00:00:58.080> tell<00:00:58.290> us<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
brain guessed this will tell us if the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.140 
brain guessed this will tell us if the
two<00:00:58.860> eyes<00:00:59.040> aren't<00:00:59.400> functioning<00:00:59.580> the<00:00:59.850> same

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.130 
and we've got the eye charts and stuff
and<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.790> course<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.390> can't<00:01:33.630> tell<00:01:33.840> me<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.050> you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
and of course you can't tell me if you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.350 
and of course you can't tell me if you
see<00:01:34.320> see<00:01:34.770> any<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.160> that<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.550> you<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:36.180> that's

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
see see any of that can you and that's

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.730 
see see any of that can you and that's
the<00:01:36.420> problem<00:01:36.660> we<00:01:36.840> don't<00:01:37.170> know<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> eyes

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the problem we don't know if the eyes

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.560 
the problem we don't know if the eyes
are<00:01:37.770> communicating<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> brain<00:01:39.090> these

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
are communicating with the brain these

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.260 
are communicating with the brain these
kids<00:01:39.869> around<00:01:40.410> to<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.160> is<00:01:41.369> not<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.880> time<00:01:42.090> we

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
kids around to this is not the time we

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.210 
kids around to this is not the time we
call<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.660> terrific<00:01:43.229> tues<00:01:43.619> right<00:01:44.040> i<00:01:44.070> mean

call it the terrific tues right i mean

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.980 
call it the terrific tues right i mean
this<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.610> hard<00:01:44.940> time<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.330> examine<00:01:45.570> someone

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
this is a hard time to examine someone

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.380 
this is a hard time to examine someone
addys<00:01:46.590> awesome<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.220> she<00:01:47.369> let<00:01:47.520> look<00:01:47.759> yeah<00:01:48.060> only

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
addys awesome and she let look yeah only

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.969 
addys awesome and she let look yeah only
about<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.960> out<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.140> every<00:01:49.290> three<00:01:49.410> kids<00:01:49.800> ever

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
about one out of every three kids ever

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.280 
about one out of every three kids ever
gets<00:01:50.160> checked<00:01:50.430> because<00:01:50.729> it's<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.180> hard<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.110> our

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
gets checked because it's so hard so our

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.139 
gets checked because it's so hard so our
job<00:01:52.530> was<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.800> give<00:01:53.009> new<00:01:53.430> tools<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
job was to give new tools to the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.550 
job was to give new tools to the
pediatrician<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.810> allow<00:01:54.990> them<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.259> check

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
pediatrician to allow them to check

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.080 
pediatrician to allow them to check
what's<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.700> eyes<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
what's going on with the eyes of the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.200 
what's going on with the eyes of the
brain<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:58.200> one<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.280> things<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.640> I<00:02:00.030> want

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
brain and one of the things that I want

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.609 
brain and one of the things that I want
you<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.330> look<00:02:00.420> at<00:02:00.569> this<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:00.899> an<00:02:01.020> animation<00:02:01.410> of

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
you to look at this is an animation of

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.040 
you to look at this is an animation of
an<00:02:01.740> optic<00:02:02.100> nerve<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.580> what<00:02:02.759> happens<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
an optic nerve and what happens is the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.990 
an optic nerve and what happens is the
optic<00:02:04.410> nerve<00:02:04.440> travels<00:02:05.069> from<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.459> eye<00:02:05.580> and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
optic nerve travels from the eye and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.260 
optic nerve travels from the eye and
sends<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.479> signal<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.959> your<00:02:07.590> brain<00:02:07.830> if<00:02:08.270> it's

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
sends a signal to your brain if it's

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.390 
sends a signal to your brain if it's
working<00:02:09.479> properly<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.500> that's<00:02:10.890> essentially

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
working properly and that's essentially

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.280 
working properly and that's essentially
what<00:02:11.760> you're<00:02:11.880> measuring<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.630> signal

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
what you're measuring is that signal

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.199 
what you're measuring is that signal
that<00:02:13.890> should<00:02:14.280> be<00:02:14.430> working<00:02:14.640> equally<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.180> both

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
that should be working equally in both

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.480 
that should be working equally in both
eyes<00:02:15.600> right<00:02:15.990> absolutely<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.220> camera

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
eyes right absolutely I is just a camera

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.190 
eyes right absolutely I is just a camera
and<00:02:17.819> then<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:18.690> get<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.870> back<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
and then you have to get it back to the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.199 
and then you have to get it back to the
CPU<00:02:19.770> back<00:02:20.069> here<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.640> central<00:02:21.030> processing

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
CPU back here the central processing

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.420 
CPU back here the central processing
system<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.020> computer<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.800> need<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.980> cable<00:02:23.190> to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
system the computer you need a cable to

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.460 
system the computer you need a cable to
connect<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.480> way<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.630> need<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.930> know<00:02:25.230> is

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
connect and the way you need to know is

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.260 
connect and the way you need to know is
if<00:02:25.890> she<00:02:26.130> see<00:02:26.370> or<00:02:26.550> not<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.030> put<00:02:27.180> an

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
if she see or not is you put an

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.030 
if she see or not is you put an
electrode<00:02:27.569> back<00:02:27.810> there<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.560> brainwaves

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
electrode back there and the brainwaves

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.410 
electrode back there and the brainwaves
tell<00:02:29.280> us<00:02:29.370> what<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:29.670> see<00:02:30.060> here<00:02:30.090> what<00:02:30.300> she

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
tell us what you can see here what she

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.940 
tell us what you can see here what she
can<00:02:30.600> see<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.140> need<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.350> identify<00:02:31.500> these

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
can see so you need to identify these

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.010 
can see so you need to identify these
problems<00:02:32.490> as<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.640> kid<00:02:32.910> we<00:02:33.420> need<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.660> treat<00:02:33.959> them

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
problems as a kid we need to treat them

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.080

when he was a kid he wouldn't had neck
surgery<00:02:41.030> imagine<00:02:42.030> he<00:02:42.180> had<00:02:42.420> spine<00:02:42.900> surgery<00:02:43.410> for

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
surgery imagine he had spine surgery for

surgery imagine he had spine surgery for
a<00:02:44.069> problem<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.640> was<00:02:44.760> detected<00:02:45.209> at<00:02:45.300> this

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
a problem that it was detected at this

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.330 
a problem that it was detected at this
age<00:02:45.720> never<00:02:46.319> would<00:02:46.500> have<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.890> think<00:02:47.190> there's

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
age never would have I think there's

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.010 
age never would have I think there's
four<00:02:47.670> million<00:02:47.970> people<00:02:48.120> out<00:02:48.510> there<00:02:48.569> that<00:02:48.840> are

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
four million people out there that are

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.570 
four million people out there that are
blind<00:02:49.349> in<00:02:49.470> one<00:02:49.500> eye<00:02:49.680> because<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.340> amblyopia

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
blind in one eye because of amblyopia

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.400 
blind in one eye because of amblyopia
cuz<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.240> didn't<00:02:51.510> get<00:02:51.599> caught<00:02:51.870> soon<00:02:52.200> enough

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
cuz it didn't get caught soon enough

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.660 
cuz it didn't get caught soon enough
that's<00:02:52.709> absolutely<00:02:53.099> right<00:02:53.220> about<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.459> hundred

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
that's absolutely right about a hundred

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.630 
that's absolutely right about a hundred
thousand<00:02:54.120> kids

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
thousand kids

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.330 
thousand kids
and<00:02:55.060> it's<00:02:55.720> it's<00:02:56.110> unconscionable<00:02:56.800> almost

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
and it's it's unconscionable almost

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.370 
and it's it's unconscionable almost
because<00:02:57.700> we<00:02:58.150> have<00:02:58.360> ways<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.569> treat<00:02:58.930> these<00:02:59.080> kids

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
because we have ways to treat these kids

screening tool though right so this

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.130 
screening tool though right so this

could<00:03:49.030> be<00:03:49.060> something<00:03:49.480> wrong<00:03:49.780> we<00:03:50.080> need<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.320> take

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
could be something wrong we need to take

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.500 
could be something wrong we need to take
a<00:03:50.560> closer<00:03:50.890> look<00:03:51.060> absolutely<00:03:52.060> this<00:03:52.300> is<00:03:52.360> a

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
a closer look absolutely this is a

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.360 
a closer look absolutely this is a
screening<00:03:52.870> test<00:03:53.080> like<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.320> mammography<00:03:53.680> or

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
screening test like a mammography or

screening test like a mammography or
hearing<00:03:54.760> test<00:03:55.000> so<00:03:55.540> what<00:03:55.900> this<00:03:56.019> means<00:03:56.350> is<00:03:56.530> that

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
hearing test so what this means is that
