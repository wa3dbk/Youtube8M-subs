00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
and math score becomes 10 mascot becomes

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.460 
and math score becomes 10 mascot becomes
10<00:04:23.510> so<00:04:24.110> basically<00:04:25.210> you<00:04:26.210> have<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:26.810> win<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.050> set

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
10 so basically you have to win a set

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.640 
10 so basically you have to win a set
and<00:04:27.740> enough<00:04:28.580> said<00:04:28.880> you<00:04:29.570> have<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:30.110> win<00:04:30.260> six

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
and enough said you have to win six

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.520 
and enough said you have to win six
games<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:31.670> in<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.030> game<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.900> have<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.380> win

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
games and in the game you have to win

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.380 
games and in the game you have to win
four<00:04:33.980> points<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.610> is<00:04:34.780> 1534<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.960> end<00:04:36.200> game

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
four points that is 1534 the end game

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.270 
four points that is 1534 the end game
the<00:04:38.390> size<00:04:38.690> of<00:04:38.930> food<00:04:39.200> are<00:04:39.530> changed<00:04:40.130> when

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
the size of food are changed when

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.720 
the size of food are changed when
somewhat<00:04:40.760> gain<00:04:41.090> some<00:04:41.930> of<00:04:42.200> game<00:04:42.590> of<00:04:42.860> every<00:04:43.430> set

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
somewhat gain some of game of every set

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.870 
somewhat gain some of game of every set
is<00:04:43.940> odd<00:04:44.330> that<00:04:44.750> is<00:04:45.380> that<00:04:45.650> 10<00:04:45.920> then<00:04:46.370> some<00:04:46.550> is<00:04:46.700> one

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
is odd that is that 10 then some is one

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.260 
is odd that is that 10 then some is one
then<00:04:47.120> cyber<00:04:47.360> chain<00:04:47.780> have<00:04:48.290> said<00:04:48.590> score<00:04:48.980> is<00:04:49.270> 21

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
then cyber chain have said score is 21

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.580 
then cyber chain have said score is 21
then<00:04:50.780> 73<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.950> is<00:04:52.100> odd<00:04:52.280> side<00:04:52.610> walls<00:04:52.850> in<00:04:53.030> a<00:04:53.590> 305

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
then 73 that is odd side walls in a 305

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.580 
then 73 that is odd side walls in a 305
forth<00:04:54.920> and<00:04:55.130> so<00:04:55.370> on<00:04:55.720> so<00:04:56.720> that<00:04:57.080> is<00:04:57.230> all<00:04:57.350> about

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
forth and so on so that is all about

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.030 
forth and so on so that is all about
tennis<00:04:57.920> and<00:04:58.510> I<00:04:59.510> will<00:05:00.140> tell<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:00.530> that<00:05:00.560> general

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
game you have to win four point so that

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.659 
game you have to win four point so that
is<00:05:55.850> a<00:05:55.880> game<00:05:56.270> score<00:05:56.690> and<00:05:56.930> if<00:05:57.260> you<00:05:57.410> win<00:05:57.680> a<00:05:57.710> game<00:05:58.070> so

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
is a game score and if you win a game so

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.620 
is a game score and if you win a game so

its assets code because you want to win

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.630 
its assets code because you want to win
a<00:06:05.090> set<00:06:05.419> then<00:06:05.720> you<00:06:05.810> have<00:06:06.020> to<00:06:06.169> win<00:06:06.350> six<00:06:06.650> games<00:06:06.980> so

the middle one is sets code and match go

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.330 
the middle one is sets code and match go
that<00:06:11.750> is<00:06:11.900> if<00:06:12.110> you<00:06:12.230> want<00:06:12.470> to<00:06:12.590> win<00:06:12.800> a<00:06:12.830> match<00:06:13.100> you
