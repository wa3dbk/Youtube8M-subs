00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hi everyone I am a wikileaks site e 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.910
 today I'm here with the dg tomorrow which 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.500
 I will talk about the 1.09 patch unfortunately i 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.420
 changes to this patch are useless 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.130
 there is no relevant new feature at 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.570
 example and closing the contents is not 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.830
 been updated 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.120
 if you don't know what I mean dates 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.890
 take a look at the video description or 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.779
 click on the screen rotation is 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.029
 a video where I talk about these 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.560
 content creator updates 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.960
 or that they have added new ones 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.760
 really very very nice features 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.599
 which should add the note 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.540
 in the next peace since in the patch 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:36.540
 1.091 there is also the robberies are not 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.399
 been added I hoped that at least 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.079
 in improving the content creator 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.840
 but there was not even mine 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.059
 this therefore this peace is not one 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.219
 there is no great news 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.460
 great change anyway 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.320
 passing just to little news 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.520
 relevant to this peace as far as 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.890
 regards the official note of the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.719
 rockstar this note says very little 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.730
 practically the anti cheat measures are 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.170
 been improved and the gta exploit 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.300
 online real fashions you could 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.860
 get via dns codes or a 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.960
 method to mount we went back through the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.549
 computers have been removed 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.189
 speaking instead of changes not 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.799
 but officials who tried various 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.590
 these are the players on online sites 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.810
 then first the tone balls file 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.119
 dot design or that file of yours 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.979
 character that if you went to open 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.259
 you could modify this values 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.570
 file is therefore become immortal to have 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.250
 a lot of money rank so you don't 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.360
 call more you neighbors do the joy sun 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.070
 in serving the rock star cloud and not yes 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.170
 knows if they have deleted it or have it 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.470
 changed however this time the file is 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.290
 stuck in rockstar's cloud servers 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.750
 therefore in simple terms now mount 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.700
 online city is very difficult if not 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.340
 impossible precisely because this 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.560
 file the money obtained was covered 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.820
 from modders in your character to 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.369
 cities have not been removed 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.110
 as well as the increase in rank by 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.070
 so these fashions have not balanced 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.070
 still nothing 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.920
 regarding the appearance of these 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.810
 two things the visibility of the landscape 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.390
 or thief distance has been reduced 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.340
 both in single player that you raise online 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.390
 this means that if you were successful before 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.860
 see certain things from afar 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.170
 these are the things from afar now 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.250
 you can only see if you approach 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.140
 a little more 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.760
 however, I advise you to look for the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.040
 term drop distance on the internet because 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.020
 in Italian it is quite complicated by 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.240
 definitely explain the internet will give you 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.860
 more details on this then it was 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.410
 made a change on one 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.570
 supercar overall infernus I don't have well 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.810
 understand what has changed but says 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.020
 something about the brakes certainly some 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.430
 aesthetic aspect 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.950
 there have also been changes in the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.850
 chases with the police and I noticed 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.830
 these changes also personally 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.709
 in the checkpoints or those places of 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.780
 block appearing in the event that 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.150
 have three or more stars 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.630
 the vehicles have increased so it will be more 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.550
 difficult to evade these checkpoints 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.260
 the spots where policemen are generated 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.320
 have been improved and therefore will be a 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.550
 it is also easier to evade time 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.320
 to make the level disappear 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.420
 suspicion has dropped compared to before 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.140
 so it will take less time to escape 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.000
 by police 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.519
 as for the clicks I have 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.799
 posted in my channel I had done 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.530
 in previous paci that work 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.480
 still in the 1.09 patch you can 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.040
 find in the description as well as the 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.650
 unofficial information they are 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.049
 been tested by the players is the first 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.040
 link and obviously it is in English 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.200
 I in the video anyway if I spoke 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.030
 only changes in the notes 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.280
 new networks also that there are written 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.980
 other things that are not 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.170
 changes seemed useless to talk about 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.239
 of things that haven't changed 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.799
 having said that please let me like it 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.209
 it will take if you have two second ones click 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.680
 that blue button let me like it 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.239
