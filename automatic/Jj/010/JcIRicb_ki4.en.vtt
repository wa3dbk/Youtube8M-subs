is<00:00:53.760> basically<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> trap<00:00:56.960> okay<00:00:57.960> I'm<00:00:58.079> going<00:00:58.170> to

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
is basically the trap okay I'm going to

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.540 
is basically the trap okay I'm going to
go<00:00:58.289> away<00:00:58.410> from<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:58.800> making<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.370> whole

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
go away from that's making it the whole

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.760 
go away from that's making it the whole
thing<00:00:59.579> lag<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.390> basically<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.530> way<00:01:01.620> this

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
thing lag and basically the way this

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.350 
thing lag and basically the way this
works<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.500> select<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.159> want

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
works is you get to select what you want

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.200 
works is you get to select what you want
to<00:01:06.360> kill<00:01:06.840> basically<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.950> get<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.000> loot

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
to kill basically so you get the loot

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.570 
to kill basically so you get the loot
you<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.040> it's<00:01:11.040> quite<00:01:11.250> efficient

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
you one and it's quite efficient

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.450 
you one and it's quite efficient
actually<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.180> here's<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> key<00:01:13.260> up<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:14.189> closed

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
actually so here's the key up for closed

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.630 
actually so here's the key up for closed
and<00:01:14.820> down<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.869> open<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> zombie

I<00:02:39.560> could<00:02:40.220> let<00:02:40.910> me<00:02:41.000> just<00:02:41.180> do<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.480> little<00:02:41.810> example

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
I could let me just do a little example

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.120 
I could let me just do a little example
see<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.790> creepers<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.239> now<00:02:44.660> I<00:02:45.049> can<00:02:46.010> maybe

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
see the creepers and now I can maybe

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.930 
see the creepers and now I can maybe
that<00:02:46.310> failed<00:02:46.640> drive<00:02:47.090> neva<00:02:47.840> yes<00:02:51.489> this<00:02:52.489> is<00:02:52.790> why

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
that failed drive neva yes this is why

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.110 
that failed drive neva yes this is why
instant<00:02:53.360> mine<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.630> annoying<00:02:53.930> sometimes<00:02:55.120> you

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
instant mine is annoying sometimes you

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.000 
instant mine is annoying sometimes you
fell<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.720> then<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:56.959> end<00:02:57.170> up<00:02:57.290> destroying<00:02:57.709> your

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
fell and then you end up destroying your

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.960 
fell and then you end up destroying your
creations<00:03:01.090> damn<00:03:03.100> was<00:03:04.100> not<00:03:04.280> supposed<00:03:04.820> to

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
creations damn was not supposed to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.100 
creations damn was not supposed to
happen

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.440 

it<00:03:08.710> means<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.070> my<00:03:09.160> nan<00:03:09.340> know<00:03:09.610> off<00:03:09.850> there<00:03:10.330> we

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
it means that my nan know off there we

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.440 
it means that my nan know off there we
go<00:03:14.280> see<00:03:15.280> then<00:03:15.730> they<00:03:15.880> fall<00:03:15.940> down<00:03:16.240> that's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
go see then they fall down that's

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.330 
go see then they fall down that's
basically<00:03:16.810> how<00:03:16.930> would<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.440> thing<00:03:17.650> works<00:03:20.340> and

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
basically how would the thing works and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.880 
basically how would the thing works and
yeah<00:03:21.730> so<00:03:22.240> now<00:03:22.540> Adelle<00:03:22.840> ok<00:03:23.350> maybe<00:03:23.470> there<00:03:23.710> was<00:03:23.860> a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
yeah so now Adelle ok maybe there was a

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.170 
yeah so now Adelle ok maybe there was a
lot<00:03:24.160> there<00:03:24.210> now<00:03:25.210> they<00:03:25.330> all<00:03:25.450> going<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.720> go<00:03:25.960> die

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
lot there now they all going to go die

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.460 
lot there now they all going to go die
and<00:03:28.680> yeah<00:03:29.680> that's<00:03:29.980> cuz<00:03:30.310> I<00:03:30.720> like<00:03:31.720> switched<00:03:32.170> on

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
and yeah that's cuz I like switched on

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.880 
and yeah that's cuz I like switched on
there<00:03:32.890> but<00:03:33.310> yeah<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:35.170> can<00:03:35.200> see<00:03:35.560> they're<00:03:35.770> all

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
there but yeah you can see they're all

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.500 
there but yeah you can see they're all
gonna<00:03:36.040> go<00:03:36.250> down<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.490> stream<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:36.820> water<00:03:37.000> and

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
gonna go down the stream of water and

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.199 
gonna go down the stream of water and
eventually<00:03:38.140> die<00:03:38.290> so<00:03:38.530> anyway<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.850> question

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
eventually die so anyway the question

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.000 
eventually die so anyway the question
now<00:03:40.240> is<00:03:40.330> going<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.690> ask<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.170> is<00:03:41.350> should<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.770> make

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
now is going to ask you is should I make

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
now let's open all the gates bearing in

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.720 
now let's open all the gates bearing in
my<00:04:08.350> mind<00:04:08.560> i'm<00:04:08.620> recording<00:04:09.040> open<00:04:09.459> all<00:04:09.580> the<00:04:09.700> gates

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
my mind i'm recording open all the gates

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.400 
my mind i'm recording open all the gates
I'm<00:04:10.330> just<00:04:10.570> hoping<00:04:10.720> this<00:04:10.900> doesn't<00:04:11.020> overheat

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
I'm just hoping this doesn't overheat

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.630 
I'm just hoping this doesn't overheat
and<00:04:11.820> or<00:04:12.820> like<00:04:13.209> corrupt<00:04:13.840> my<00:04:14.019> world<00:04:14.260> again

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
and or like corrupt my world again

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.960 
and or like corrupt my world again
because<00:04:15.640> is<00:04:16.380> CPU<00:04:17.380> intensive<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:18.250> when<00:04:18.850> you

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
because is CPU intensive and when you

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.280 
because is CPU intensive and when you
don't<00:04:19.090> open<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.450> gate<00:04:19.630> through<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:19.900> long<00:04:20.049> time

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
don't open the gate through a long time

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.290 
don't open the gate through a long time
they<00:04:20.470> start<00:04:20.890> to<00:04:21.010> get<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.220> bit<00:04:21.250> brave<00:04:21.580> they'll

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
they start to get a bit brave they'll

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.440 
they start to get a bit brave they'll
get<00:04:22.450> back<00:04:22.570> down<00:04:22.750> if<00:04:23.350> you<00:04:23.860> push<00:04:24.100> them<00:04:24.340> or<00:04:24.669> just

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
get back down if you push them or just

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.100 
get back down if you push them or just
walk<00:04:25.810> away<00:04:26.190> so<00:04:27.190> as<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:27.460> can<00:04:27.610> see<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:28.630> skeleton

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
walk away so as you can see the skeleton

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.510 
walk away so as you can see the skeleton
these<00:04:30.360> brave<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:32.130> doesn't<00:04:33.130> really<00:04:33.250> matter<00:04:33.430> if

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
these brave and doesn't really matter if

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.680 
these brave and doesn't really matter if
you<00:04:33.610> kill<00:04:33.790> it<00:04:33.820> there<00:04:34.090> because<00:04:34.210> if<00:04:34.419> it<00:04:34.510> fall

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
you kill it there because if it fall

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.850 
you kill it there because if it fall
into<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:34.990> water<00:04:35.020> stream<00:04:35.470> you're<00:04:35.650> going<00:04:35.800> to

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
into the water stream you're going to

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.770 
into the water stream you're going to
get<00:04:35.979> anywhere<00:04:36.280> okay<00:04:37.180> then<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.419> frame<00:04:37.600> rates

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
get anywhere okay then the frame rates

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.100 
get anywhere okay then the frame rates
