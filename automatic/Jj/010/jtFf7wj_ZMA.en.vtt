00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.830
 1% to think 3 40% 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.710
 I tell you must suffer to make 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.839
 good tablets at the beginning of the month paul 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.789
 bulcke managing director at 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.980
 Nestle said the top chocolate 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.470
 range but it's my little frustration 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.250
 the news of the day is cocoa 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.930
 but in very big at the highest since 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.500
 almost three years in the markets 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.600
 good then you will tell me but why 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.350
 this sudden outbreak of the bean and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.510
 you will be right 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.360
 while in europe consumption has 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.239
 decreased by 1% as a result of the fashion of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.219
 skinny jeans waist down even 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.469
 that some are fighting to boost the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.219
 consumption or asians finds the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.719
 chocolate 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.899
 more and more beautiful be the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.610
 consumption there has exploded + 29% 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.590
 five years old but market worries mostly 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.420
 of long-term production viability 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.199
 term of the raw material of the good 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.149
 old crunch itaste go ahead gives names 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.970
 among the biggest producing countries 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.740
 found the Ivory Coast with 1.7 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.840
 million tons this season and the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.880
 ghana at 900 thousand tons of fat 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.299
 heavy figures and the production of 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.460
 cocoa 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.380
 it's an industry that represents 120 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.509
 billions of dollars a year to but 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.820
 here are the cocoa trees nor was it beginning at all 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.380
 rotten all old all withered worse the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.580
 farmers who exploit them who 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.619
 exploits small parcels of 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.360
 cacao trees also age they 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.950
 are all withered they are 50 years old in 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.869
 average and the younger generation 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.909
 but we have nothing to beat she will kill me 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.790
 by another thing alain understands suddenly 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.560
 there is little writing and on 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.950
 markets it's all tense because the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.740
 cocoa 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.450
 he starts to end the trader because 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.890
 that near ars they want to chew his 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.810
 capital gain 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.369
 because he comes to greet us with cocoa and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.790
 by bringing the price of a ton of cocoa 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.229
 has soared from 40% to over $ 3100 the 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.600
 true ton for cocoa butter 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.979
 it's even worse the main ingredient 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.290
 used in making the right 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.939
 old chocolate bar a flambÃ© of 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.729
 70% in one year 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.729

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.060
 zack wright 70% cocoa 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.720
 I love it when cocoa takes more 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.720
 70% 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:34.390
 we can more infinite 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:39.940
 we finished eating pure chocolate you 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:43.660
 could not have been horrible I do not 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:52.980
 ate a table and finish at the table 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:52.980
 and never have the truth was not the case
