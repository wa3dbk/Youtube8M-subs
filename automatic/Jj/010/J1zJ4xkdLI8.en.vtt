virtual<00:00:37.140> worlds<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.670> think<00:00:38.879> that's<00:00:39.030> where

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
virtual worlds and I think that's where

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.970 
virtual worlds and I think that's where
this<00:00:39.329> question<00:00:39.570> comes<00:00:39.960> from<00:00:40.050> taking<00:00:40.469> our<00:00:40.739> time

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
this question comes from taking our time

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.610 
this question comes from taking our time
away<00:00:41.520> from<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> real<00:00:42.210> world<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.750> actually<00:00:43.590> I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
away from the real world but actually I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.440 
away from the real world but actually I
think<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.070> virtual<00:00:44.460> worlds<00:00:44.789> become<00:00:45.149> bigger

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
think as virtual worlds become bigger

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.389 
think as virtual worlds become bigger
and<00:00:45.780> more<00:00:46.020> complex<00:00:46.530> than<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> real<00:00:47.129> world

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and more complex than the real world

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.580 
and more complex than the real world
it'll<00:00:48.180> almost<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.660> opposite<00:00:49.170> we'll<00:00:49.379> worry

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it'll almost be the opposite we'll worry

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.670 
it'll almost be the opposite we'll worry
if<00:00:49.950> people<00:00:50.309> are<00:00:50.399> spending<00:00:50.520> too<00:00:50.940> much<00:00:50.969> time

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
if people are spending too much time

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.959 
if people are spending too much time
locked<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.129> just<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> place<00:00:53.640> where<00:00:53.670> they

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
locked in to just the place where they

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
live in the real world where they might

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.529 
live in the real world where they might

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
they might have less diversity around

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.889 
they might have less diversity around
them<00:00:59.129> than<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.670> find<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> virtual

which<00:01:06.000> they<00:01:06.210> will<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.750> think<00:01:07.290> we're<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
which they will I think we're going to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.700 
which they will I think we're going to
see<00:01:07.799> them<00:01:08.040> as<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.909> place<00:01:09.330> where<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.990> school<00:01:10.320> we

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
see them as a place where like school we

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.050 
see them as a place where like school we
want<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> make<00:01:11.070> sure<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.400> actually<00:01:11.790> spend

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
want to make sure we actually spend

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.080 
want to make sure we actually spend

enough time in as a matter of fact
there's<00:01:15.659> been<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> lot<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:15.990> studies<00:01:16.409> even

brain<00:01:54.790> on<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.540> future<00:01:56.290> virtual<00:01:56.799> grid<00:01:57.070> will

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
brain on a future virtual grid will

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.940 
brain on a future virtual grid will
there<00:01:57.970> be<00:01:58.090> virtual<00:01:58.479> jobs<00:01:58.810> well<00:01:59.649> there's<00:01:59.770> two

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
there be virtual jobs well there's two

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.370 
there be virtual jobs well there's two
questions<00:02:00.430> they're<00:02:00.670> moving<00:02:01.240> our<00:02:01.360> brains<00:02:01.750> into

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
questions they're moving our brains into

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.320 
questions they're moving our brains into
the<00:02:02.470> virtual<00:02:02.649> world<00:02:02.920> kind<00:02:03.549> of<00:02:03.640> confronts<00:02:04.240> a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
the virtual world kind of confronts a

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.389 
the virtual world kind of confronts a
series<00:02:04.659> of<00:02:04.690> tough<00:02:05.229> questions<00:02:05.440> about<00:02:05.890> biology

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
series of tough questions about biology

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.120 
series of tough questions about biology
and<00:02:06.939> about<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.330> way<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:08.110> human<00:02:08.619> brain<00:02:08.950> is

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
and about the way the human brain is

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.559 
and about the way the human brain is
designed<00:02:09.520> that<00:02:09.789> are<00:02:09.880> pretty<00:02:10.030> challenging

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
designed that are pretty challenging

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.509 
designed that are pretty challenging
ones<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:10.989> personally<00:02:11.739> think<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.100> we're<00:02:12.340> going

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
ones I personally think that we're going

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.050 
ones I personally think that we're going
to<00:02:12.610> see<00:02:13.140> very<00:02:14.140> very<00:02:14.230> human<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.099> eyes<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.880> are

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
to see very very human a eyes that are

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.780 
to see very very human a eyes that are
able<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.390> talk<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.840> us<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.260> have<00:02:17.790> intelligence

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
able to talk to us and have intelligence

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.340 
able to talk to us and have intelligence
initially<00:02:19.360> comparable<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.930> ours<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.140> then

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
initially comparable to ours and then

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.780 
initially comparable to ours and then
greater<00:02:20.590> than<00:02:20.800> ours<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.220> think<00:02:21.550> we're<00:02:21.640> going<00:02:21.730> to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
greater than ours I think we're going to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.850 
greater than ours I think we're going to
see<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.120> happen<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.569> lot<00:02:22.600> sooner<00:02:23.110> than<00:02:23.290> we<00:02:23.590> see

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
see that happen a lot sooner than we see

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.340 
see that happen a lot sooner than we see
this<00:02:24.069> ability<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.580> sort<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:25.090> upload<00:02:25.959> yourself

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
this ability to sort of upload yourself

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.890 
this ability to sort of upload yourself
completely<00:02:26.590> into<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.670> virtual<00:02:28.209> environment<00:02:28.390> I

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
completely into a virtual environment I

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.210 
completely into a virtual environment I
think<00:02:29.230> it's<00:02:29.319> a<00:02:29.380> good<00:02:29.500> question<00:02:29.980> for<00:02:30.130> the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
think it's a good question for the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.530 
think it's a good question for the
future<00:02:30.580> but<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:30.850> one<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.180> don't<00:02:31.269> know

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
future but it's one that I don't know

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.850 
future but it's one that I don't know
how<00:02:31.660> easy<00:02:31.840> it's<00:02:32.049> going<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.230> be<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.470> do<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.769> I<00:02:32.799> do

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
how easy it's going to be to do and I do

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.289 
how easy it's going to be to do and I do
I<00:02:33.040> don't<00:02:33.220> have<00:02:33.310> as<00:02:33.459> much<00:02:33.610> confidence<00:02:34.209> that

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
I don't have as much confidence that

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.880 
I don't have as much confidence that
it'll<00:02:34.630> be<00:02:34.750> straightforward<00:02:35.019> as<00:02:35.560> some<00:02:35.739> of<00:02:35.830> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
it'll be straightforward as some of the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.470 
it'll be straightforward as some of the
other<00:02:36.069> crazy<00:02:36.370> things<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.970> are<00:02:37.060> happening

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
example who make their real-world living

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.009 
example who make their real-world living
from<00:03:00.850> building<00:03:01.329> things<00:03:01.600> in<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.870> virtual

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
from building things in the virtual

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.870 
from building things in the virtual
world<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.680> selling<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.220> other<00:03:03.250> people<00:03:03.549> in

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
world and selling it to other people in

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.490 
world and selling it to other people in
there<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:04.060> virtual<00:03:04.600> jobs<00:03:04.870> are<00:03:05.019> going<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.230> be<00:03:05.320> a

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
there so virtual jobs are going to be a

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.890 
there so virtual jobs are going to be a
dominant<00:03:06.220> part<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.459> our<00:03:06.579> future<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.000> would<00:03:07.120> go

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
dominant part of our future I would go

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.130 
dominant part of our future I would go
so<00:03:08.049> far<00:03:08.200> as<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.380> say<00:03:08.650> they'll<00:03:09.160> probably<00:03:09.400> be<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
so far as to say they'll probably be the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.900 
so far as to say they'll probably be the
biggest<00:03:11.320> place<00:03:11.769> where<00:03:12.040> we<00:03:12.160> work<00:03:12.370> bigger<00:03:12.700> than

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
biggest place where we work bigger than

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.650 
biggest place where we work bigger than
the<00:03:13.000> real<00:03:13.150> world

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
the real world

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.920 
the real world
I<00:03:13.690> think<00:03:14.019> another<00:03:14.410> tweet<00:03:18.359> all<00:03:19.359> right<00:03:19.540> Andrew

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
I think another tweet all right Andrew

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.670

say this we started early
Second<00:03:38.380> Life<00:03:38.410> was<00:03:38.950> barely<00:03:39.760> able<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.180> work<00:03:40.359> on

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
Second Life was barely able to work on

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.640 
Second Life was barely able to work on
the<00:03:40.660> computers<00:03:41.079> we<00:03:41.170> had<00:03:41.290> at<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.470> time<00:03:41.620> I

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
the computers we had at the time I

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.099 
the computers we had at the time I
started<00:03:42.160> second<00:03:42.519> life<00:03:42.639> right<00:03:42.970> when<00:03:43.180> broadband

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
started second life right when broadband

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.720 
started second life right when broadband
had<00:03:44.290> come<00:03:44.500> around<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:45.069> there<00:03:45.370> was<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.489> little

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
had come around and there was a little

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.729 
had come around and there was a little
bit<00:03:45.819> of<00:03:45.910> 3d<00:03:46.060> capability<00:03:46.720> on<00:03:46.840> computers<00:03:47.319> but

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
bit of 3d capability on computers but

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.530 
bit of 3d capability on computers but
because<00:03:48.040> computers<00:03:48.489> double<00:03:48.850> in<00:03:49.000> their<00:03:49.329> power

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
because computers double in their power

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.840 
because computers double in their power
and<00:03:49.870> so<00:03:50.139> does<00:03:50.319> network<00:03:50.650> bandwidth<00:03:51.069> every<00:03:51.549> two

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
and so does network bandwidth every two

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.300 
and so does network bandwidth every two
years<00:03:51.880> approximately<00:03:52.739> it's<00:03:53.739> only<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.129> matter

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
years approximately it's only a matter

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.020 
years approximately it's only a matter
of<00:03:54.519> waiting<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:55.120> it's<00:03:55.659> 15<00:03:56.019> years<00:03:56.290> later

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
of waiting and it's 15 years later

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.610 
of waiting and it's 15 years later
now<00:03:57.330> than<00:03:57.600> when<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.750> originally<00:03:58.260> started

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
now than when I originally started

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.440 
now than when I originally started
second<00:03:58.980> life<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.400> what<00:03:59.880> that<00:04:00.000> means<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.420> that

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
second life and what that means is that

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.590 
second life and what that means is that
we<00:04:00.660> have<00:04:00.690> computers<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.709> are<00:04:02.060> about<00:04:03.060> 50<00:04:03.420> or

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
of an animal cell that works that

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.000 
of an animal cell that works that
actually<00:04:33.690> has<00:04:33.840> moving<00:04:34.230> parts<00:04:34.260> you<00:04:34.890> know

actually has moving parts you know

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.280 
actually has moving parts you know
inside<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.720> teachers<00:04:36.720> can<00:04:36.930> take<00:04:37.080> their

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
inside it and teachers can take their

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.560 
inside it and teachers can take their
students<00:04:37.680> actually<00:04:38.520> into<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.000> space<00:04:39.300> on<00:04:39.540> a

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
students actually into that space on a

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.510 
students actually into that space on a
sort<00:04:39.840> of<00:04:39.870> a<00:04:39.990> magic<00:04:40.320> school<00:04:40.560> bus<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:41.370> drives

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
sort of a magic school bus that drives

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.000 
sort of a magic school bus that drives
around<00:04:41.760> in<00:04:42.090> it<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.440> lets<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:43.620> look<00:04:43.770> at<00:04:43.919> the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
around in it and lets you look at the

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.070 
around in it and lets you look at the
cell<00:04:44.250> from<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.520> inside<00:04:44.880> out<00:04:44.910> that's<00:04:45.780> an

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
cell from the inside out that's an

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.409 
cell from the inside out that's an
example<00:04:46.350> of<00:04:46.650> what<00:04:46.830> we<00:04:46.919> can<00:04:47.040> do<00:04:47.190> with<00:04:47.340> VR<00:04:47.640> that

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
example of what we can do with VR that

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.930 
example of what we can do with VR that
is<00:04:49.350> just<00:04:49.650> going<00:04:49.770> to<00:04:49.830> be<00:04:49.950> world-changing<00:04:50.700> and

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
is just going to be world-changing and

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.050 
is just going to be world-changing and
is<00:04:51.900> only<00:04:52.320> just<00:04:52.979> becoming<00:04:53.310> possible<00:04:53.820> with<00:04:53.970> the

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
is only just becoming possible with the

asks<00:05:02.520> why<00:05:03.260> and<00:05:04.260> I<00:05:04.380> think<00:05:04.410> that's<00:05:04.710> a<00:05:04.800> great

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
asks why and I think that's a great

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.530 
asks why and I think that's a great
question<00:05:05.490> well<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.000> think<00:05:06.680> virtual<00:05:07.680> worlds<00:05:08.040> and

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
question well I think virtual worlds and

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.860 
question well I think virtual worlds and
generally<00:05:09.540> technology<00:05:10.229> is<00:05:11.100> is<00:05:11.640> our

those things with the world up till now

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.190 
those things with the world up till now
you<00:05:20.280> know<00:05:20.669> the<00:05:20.880> kind<00:05:21.180> of<00:05:21.270> world<00:05:21.510> around<00:05:21.750> us<00:05:21.990> has

you know the kind of world around us has

can go inside that space I guess rather

the<00:05:39.800> general<00:05:40.249> B<00:05:40.399> why<00:05:40.939> wouldn't<00:05:41.360> we<00:05:41.860> explore<00:05:42.860> it

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
the general B why wouldn't we explore it

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.249 
the general B why wouldn't we explore it
in<00:05:43.069> the<00:05:43.369> same<00:05:43.610> way<00:05:43.819> we've<00:05:44.119> explored<00:05:44.599> and<00:05:45.019> built

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
in the same way we've explored and built

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.589 
in the same way we've explored and built
and<00:05:45.499> changed<00:05:46.249> everything<00:05:46.519> else<00:05:46.849> around<00:05:46.999> us<00:05:47.330> so

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
and changed everything else around us so

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.209 
and changed everything else around us so
that's<00:05:47.929> why<00:05:48.139> that's<00:05:48.529> what<00:05:48.649> keeps<00:05:48.739> me<00:05:48.949> getting

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
that's why that's what keeps me getting

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:50.619 
that's why that's what keeps me getting
