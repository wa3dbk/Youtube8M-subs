00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
financial blog that because fuel is so

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.250 
financial blog that because fuel is so
low<00:00:07.740> that<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.820> actual<00:00:09.210> mining<00:00:09.540> costs<00:00:10.110> for

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
low that the actual mining costs for

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.200 
low that the actual mining costs for
silver<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.740> approximately<00:00:11.490> eight<00:00:11.700> dollars

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
silver is approximately eight dollars

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.600 
silver is approximately eight dollars
per<00:00:12.389> ounce<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.900> gold<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.860> approximately

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
per ounce and gold is approximately

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.400 
per ounce and gold is approximately
eight<00:00:14.880> hundred<00:00:15.299> dollars<00:00:15.330> per<00:00:15.750> ounce<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.230> mine

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
eight hundred dollars per ounce to mine

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.439 
eight hundred dollars per ounce to mine
so<00:00:17.130> what<00:00:17.580> do<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.760> think<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.119> these<00:00:18.210> numbers

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
so what do you think of these numbers

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.510 
so what do you think of these numbers
and<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.930> guess<00:00:19.109> we<00:00:19.260> can<00:00:19.380> start<00:00:19.590> with<00:00:19.650> Chris<00:00:20.010> well

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
and I guess we can start with Chris well

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.550 
and I guess we can start with Chris well
I<00:00:20.820> mean<00:00:21.000> fuel<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:21.720> one<00:00:21.900> part<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.439> I

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
I mean fuel is just one part of it I

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.500 
I mean fuel is just one part of it I
mean<00:00:22.710> but<00:00:23.130> you've<00:00:23.400> got<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.850> take<00:00:24.300> into

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
mean but you've got to take into

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.410 
mean but you've got to take into
consideration<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.939> all<00:00:26.939> these<00:00:27.150> mining

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
consideration that all these mining

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.150 
consideration that all these mining
companies<00:00:27.869> have<00:00:28.080> been<00:00:28.199> suffering<00:00:28.680> for<00:00:28.920> with<00:00:29.130> a

market in the precious metals and
they're<00:00:33.870> hurting<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.250> are<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.760> do

cash<00:00:37.500> Li<00:00:37.800> shut<00:00:37.980> down<00:00:38.160> production<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.790> start

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
cash Li shut down production they start

high<00:00:39.149> grading<00:00:39.739> you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.860> they're<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:41.370> or

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
high grading you know they're there or

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.600 
high grading you know they're there or
which<00:00:42.809> means<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.140> they're<00:00:43.350> mining<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.340> easy

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
which means that they're mining the easy

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.270 
which means that they're mining the easy
easiest<00:00:45.390> stuff<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.719> get<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.070> big

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
easiest stuff to get and the the big

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.270 
easiest stuff to get and the the big
problem<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.690> know<00:00:48.840> these<00:00:49.530> miners<00:00:49.950> can't

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
problem is you know these miners can't

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.790 
problem is you know these miners can't
just<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:51.180> know<00:00:51.300> swing<00:00:51.840> things<00:00:52.170> around<00:00:52.500> just

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
just you know swing things around just

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.160 
just you know swing things around just
because<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:54.210> know<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> oil

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
because of you know the you know the oil

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.200 
because of you know the you know the oil
prices<00:00:55.829> go<00:00:55.980> down<00:00:56.010> over<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> last<00:00:56.760> six<00:00:57.030> months

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
prices go down over the last six months

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.799 
prices go down over the last six months
you<00:00:57.750> know<00:00:57.840> there's<00:00:58.050> these<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.680> big<00:00:59.010> heavy

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
you know there's these are big heavy

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.209 
you know there's these are big heavy
long-term<00:01:00.809> investments<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.710> think<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
long-term investments I think one of the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.609 
long-term investments I think one of the
most<00:01:02.430> important<00:01:02.820> articles<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.300> read<00:01:03.449> recently

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
most important articles I read recently

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.640 
most important articles I read recently
was<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> release<00:01:05.640> from<00:01:05.820> Gold<00:01:06.150> Corp<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:07.409> said

was a release from Gold Corp that said
gold<00:01:08.130> discovery<00:01:08.640> happened<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.090> 1995<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
gold discovery happened in 1995 and it

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.289 
gold discovery happened in 1995 and it
takes<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.710> average<00:01:10.890> 20<00:01:11.430> years<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.850> develop<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
takes on average 20 years to develop a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.910 
takes on average 20 years to develop a
site<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.720> mean<00:01:12.840> that's<00:01:12.960> 20<00:01:13.560> years<00:01:13.799> of

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
site I mean that's 20 years of

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.280 
site I mean that's 20 years of
investment<00:01:14.490> time<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.450> money<00:01:15.600> before<00:01:16.170> they

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
investment time and money before they

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.920 
investment time and money before they
start<00:01:16.560> getting<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.860> return<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.340> these<00:01:17.520> things

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
start getting a return on these things

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.880 
start getting a return on these things
and<00:01:18.930> ever<00:01:19.470> since<00:01:19.710> 1995<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.850> discovery<00:01:21.689> of

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
and ever since 1995 the discovery of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.130 
and ever since 1995 the discovery of
mines<00:01:23.030> has<00:01:24.030> been<00:01:24.210> dropping<00:01:24.479> dramatically

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
mines has been dropping dramatically

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.890 
mines has been dropping dramatically
over<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.130> next<00:01:26.430> seven<00:01:26.729> years<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.630> they're

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
over the next seven years so they're

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.700 
over the next seven years so they're
predicting<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:29.490> year<00:01:29.820> 2015<00:01:30.720> will<00:01:31.470> see

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
predicting that this year 2015 will see

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.270 
predicting that this year 2015 will see
peak<00:01:32.040> gold<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.780> that's<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.860> thing<00:01:35.100> that's

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
peak gold and that's the thing that's

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.940 
peak gold and that's the thing that's
not<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.060> go<00:01:36.180> away<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.290> you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
put in the you know the price of oil

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.840 
put in the you know the price of oil
coming<00:01:40.650> down<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.250> also<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> remember

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
coming down you also have to remember

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.359 
coming down you also have to remember
that<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.329> energy<00:01:42.479> producers<00:01:43.409> now<00:01:43.979> are<00:01:44.189> going

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
that the energy producers now are going

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.649 
that the energy producers now are going
to<00:01:44.430> suffer<00:01:44.579> from<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.030> same<00:01:45.060> thing<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.570> the

to suffer from the same thing that the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.090 
to suffer from the same thing that the
mining<00:01:45.990> companies<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.500> had<00:01:46.680> over<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> last

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
mining companies have had over the last

mining companies have had over the last
four<00:01:47.579> years<00:01:47.610> with<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> bear<00:01:48.810> market<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.350> there

that going to do that's going to cause a
bankruptcies<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.409> cause

production to get shut down and I and I

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.859 
production to get shut down and I and I
would<00:01:58.770> tend<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.369> say<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.939> while<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.479> miners

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
would tend to say that while the miners

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.749 
would tend to say that while the miners
have<00:02:01.140> been<00:02:01.170> weathered<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.950> fairly<00:02:02.399> well

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
have been weathered this fairly well

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.910 
have been weathered this fairly well
because<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.810> slow-moving<00:02:04.259> nature<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.799> the

because of the slow-moving nature of the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
know to hedge and do all that other

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.460 
know to hedge and do all that other
thing<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.239> energy<00:02:09.629> companies<00:02:10.080> are<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.349> to

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
thing the energy companies are going to

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.500 
thing the energy companies are going to
blow<00:02:10.709> up<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.979> lot<00:02:11.160> quicker<00:02:11.400> because<00:02:11.790> they<00:02:12.239> can't

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
blow up a lot quicker because they can't

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.580 
blow up a lot quicker because they can't
react<00:02:12.900> as<00:02:13.140> quick<00:02:13.379> as

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
react as quick as

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.290 
react as quick as
as<00:02:13.769> this<00:02:14.190> they<00:02:14.459> don't<00:02:14.849> think<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.180> they

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
as this they don't think that they

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.330 
as this they don't think that they
planned<00:02:15.629> on<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.019> I<00:02:16.140> think<00:02:16.170> there's<00:02:16.470> I've

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
planned on this I think there's I've

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.369 
planned on this I think there's I've
read<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.849> there's<00:02:18.030> more<00:02:18.390> debt<00:02:18.959> associated

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
read that there's more debt associated

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.100 
read that there's more debt associated
with<00:02:20.030> in<00:02:21.030> all<00:02:21.209> these<00:02:21.360> companies<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:21.959> have

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
with in all these companies that have

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.800 
with in all these companies that have
been<00:02:22.290> fracking<00:02:22.879> you<00:02:23.879> know<00:02:24.000> energy<00:02:24.390> up<00:02:24.569> there

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
been fracking you know energy up there

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.740 
been fracking you know energy up there
and<00:02:25.519> we're<00:02:26.519> going<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.760> see<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.269> lot<00:02:27.720> of

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
and we're going to see a lot of

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.740 
and we're going to see a lot of
bankruptcies<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.410> lot<00:02:28.739> of<00:02:28.890> shutdown<00:02:29.700> of

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
bankruptcies a lot of shutdown of

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.119 
bankruptcies a lot of shutdown of
production<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.900> would<00:02:31.049> assume<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.920> know<00:02:32.040> if

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
production I would assume you know if

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.320 
production I would assume you know if
the<00:02:32.220> price<00:02:32.340> keeps<00:02:32.670> falling<00:02:32.970> it's<00:02:33.150> going<00:02:33.269> to

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
the price keeps falling it's going to

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.300 
the price keeps falling it's going to
price<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.569> lot<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.959> these<00:02:34.110> more<00:02:34.769> marginal

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
price a lot of these more marginal

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.850 
price a lot of these more marginal
producers<00:02:35.819> out<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.209> way<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.739> know

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
producers out of the way and in you know

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.530 
producers out of the way and in you know
six<00:02:38.220> seven<00:02:38.519> months<00:02:38.760> time<00:02:38.940> we<00:02:39.180> could<00:02:39.330> see

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
six seven months time we could see

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.839 
six seven months time we could see
golino<00:02:40.170> oil<00:02:40.410> but<00:02:40.739> way<00:02:40.950> back<00:02:41.190> up<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.549> where<00:02:41.580> it

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
golino oil but way back up to where it

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.789 
golino oil but way back up to where it
was<00:02:41.879> and<00:02:42.299> even<00:02:42.720> higher<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.379> I<00:02:43.440> think<00:02:43.650> that's

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
was and even higher and I think that's

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.819 
was and even higher and I think that's
part<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.280> strategy<00:02:44.630> that<00:02:45.630> Saudi<00:02:46.380> Arabia

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
part of the strategy that Saudi Arabia

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.380 
part of the strategy that Saudi Arabia
is<00:02:46.890> dangerously<00:02:47.489> playing<00:02:47.849> right<00:02:48.060> now<00:02:48.090> by

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
is dangerously playing right now by

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.300 
is dangerously playing right now by
overproducing<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.560> market<00:02:49.980> into<00:02:50.280> a

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
overproducing this market into a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.809 
overproducing this market into a
weakening<00:02:50.849> economy<00:02:51.290> into<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.650> credit<00:02:53.340> crisis

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
weakening economy into a credit crisis

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.640 
weakening economy into a credit crisis
where<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.630> know<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.900> doesn't<00:02:55.290> matter<00:02:55.440> what

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
where you know it doesn't matter what

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.740 
where you know it doesn't matter what
the<00:02:55.829> energy<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.640> know<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.940> return<00:02:57.420> on<00:02:57.569> energy

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the energy you know the return on energy

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.309 
the energy you know the return on energy
invested<00:02:58.379> or<00:02:58.920> taken<00:02:59.579> out<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.879> ground<00:03:00.319> you

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
invested or taken out of the ground you

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.470 
invested or taken out of the ground you
throw<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.769> currency<00:03:02.280> crisis<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:02.879> this<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.360> then

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
throw a currency crisis on this and then

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.180 
throw a currency crisis on this and then
you<00:03:03.569> got<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.750> major<00:03:04.110> problem<00:03:04.260> then<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.099> got

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
you got a major problem then you got

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.470 
you got a major problem then you got
labor<00:03:05.459> problems<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.120> then<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.360> have

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
labor problems and then you have

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.850 
labor problems and then you have
governments<00:03:06.989> wanting<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.379> tax<00:03:07.650> and

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
governments wanting to tax and

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.259 
governments wanting to tax and
nationalize<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.640> do<00:03:08.730> all<00:03:08.879> this<00:03:09.000> other<00:03:09.180> stuff

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
nationalize and do all this other stuff

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.229 
nationalize and do all this other stuff
this<00:03:10.110> is<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.319> major<00:03:10.709> major<00:03:11.069> thing<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.790> again<00:03:12.209> I

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
this is a major major thing and again I

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.699 
this is a major major thing and again I
think<00:03:12.450> it's<00:03:12.780> back<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.110> what<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.290> said<00:03:13.379> before

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
think it's back to what I said before

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.160 
think it's back to what I said before
this<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.579> not<00:03:15.030> something<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.079> know

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
this is not something that you know

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.800 
this is not something that you know
people<00:03:16.200> need<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:17.060> start<00:03:18.060> playing<00:03:18.299> cute<00:03:18.630> with

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
people need to start playing cute with

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.390 
people need to start playing cute with
and<00:03:19.019> thinking<00:03:19.319> that<00:03:19.440> they<00:03:19.590> could<00:03:19.799> you<00:03:20.280> know

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
and thinking that they could you know

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.699 
and thinking that they could you know
old<00:03:20.700> because<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.540> oil<00:03:21.569> price<00:03:21.900> down<00:03:22.170> now<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.440> can

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
old because the oil price down now I can

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.129 
old because the oil price down now I can
go<00:03:22.859> into<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.700> know<00:03:23.790> some<00:03:24.030> gold<00:03:24.420> mining<00:03:24.720> stock

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
go into you know some gold mining stock

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.710 
go into you know some gold mining stock
