00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
 Opening debut 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.400
 Dear friends, everyone, we have to learn the opening line in this class. 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.420
 When it is generally accelerated, there will be a circle inside. 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.200
 Now this class is going to learn how to open this circle, so there is no loop in it. 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.700
 This state is also called "open line" or "empty bell" 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.880
 Let's see it again. 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.580
 After opening, both hands open 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.600
 This state can also be used for ringing or other actions. 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.700
 Of course, we are not throwing the bell to teach this lesson focus, we first learn it open line 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.840
 (basic work) 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.480
 Part of the basic skills, students must first learn the basic acceleration, we will learn to open the line again. 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.560
 The basic acceleration is best to train the bell that can pull 30, and the bell will not fall off. 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.800
 And it can be turned steadily, letâ€™s learn to open the line again. 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.620
 (decomposition teaching) 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.040
 Ok! We step by step 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.180
 At the beginning we are going back to acceleration. When accelerating, we usually use the right hand to make a circle. 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:40.320
 When we see that the speed of the bell is almost the same, pull the left hand high, the right hand gently untie it, and the bell will become an empty bell. 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.840
 At this time, try to put the sticks of the two sticks up, the two lines open, let the bells on our chests. 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.740
 At this time, try to count and see if the bell can be turned over for more than five seconds. 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.840
 Congratulations! Take back the same as the left hand, and the right hand gently rounds back, you can come back and continue to accelerate. 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.560
 Congratulations, finished 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.500
 Let's change the angle and remind some of the key points. 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.720
 At the beginning, we used our right hand to make a circle and started to accelerate. 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:27.020
 When you want to unlock, don't speed up first, raise your left hand, gently unravel your right hand, and open the club with your head up. 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.780
 At this time, we must pay attention to our line and the bell, we must present the cross so positive, and the bell can turn for a long time. 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.480
 If our line is awkward, the bell will soon be paralyzed! By grasping these principles, you can do a good job. 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.400
 If you are proficient, it is best to practice for more than 10 seconds, which will be very helpful for learning afterwards. 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.020
 (common mistakes) 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.440
 Generally speaking, when we are studying, we start from the right hand. 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.780
 But some students may have a habit of using their left hand to go around. 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.240
 At this time, you should pay attention, if you still open with your right hand. 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.500
 You will find that there is a knot inside! How to do it? 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.400
 It doesn't matter, we will wrap our right hand back at this time and open it with our left hand. 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:24.300
 If you can, it is best to close and open your left and right hands. It is very comfortable, so it will be fine. 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.260
 (extension action) 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.820
 The extended part, if you have about 10 seconds of strength, you can challenge these more difficult moves. 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.180
 Our class is here. Class!
