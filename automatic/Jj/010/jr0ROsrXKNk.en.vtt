of dangerous thing versus war factory so
if<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.740> watched<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.160> first<00:00:26.340> episode<00:00:26.490> you

if you watched the first episode you

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.609 
if you watched the first episode you
know<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.240> i've<00:00:27.420> jumped<00:00:27.660> into<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.289> little

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
know that i've jumped into it a little

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.470 
know that i've jumped into it a little
too<00:00:28.920> late<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.429> even<00:00:29.699> though<00:00:29.849> i<00:00:29.880> had<00:00:30.119> three

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
too late and even though i had three

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.950 
too late and even though i had three
attacks<00:00:31.160> left<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.579> attack<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.300> war<00:00:33.450> factory<00:00:33.870> i

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
attacks left to attack the war factory i

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.540 
attacks left to attack the war factory i
actually<00:00:34.500> only<00:00:34.680> could<00:00:34.950> take<00:00:34.980> advantage<00:00:35.430> of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
actually only could take advantage of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.729 
actually only could take advantage of
the<00:00:35.700> two<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.690> time<00:00:36.960> when<00:00:37.200> were<00:00:37.350> factored

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
the two so this time when were factored

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.340 
the two so this time when were factored
appeared<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.309> my<00:00:38.460> map<00:00:38.640> i<00:00:38.850> wasted<00:00:39.510> no<00:00:39.750> time<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
appeared on my map i wasted no time and

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.369 
appeared on my map i wasted no time and
one<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.040> old<00:00:41.340> strategy<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.510> basically<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
one in old strategy so basically the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.630 
one in old strategy so basically the
base<00:00:43.530> looks<00:00:43.770> very<00:00:44.010> different<00:00:44.160> from<00:00:44.430> what<00:00:44.520> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
base looks very different from what it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.250 
base looks very different from what it
did<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> first<00:00:44.940> time<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.629> popped<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.230> my

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
did the first time it popped up on my

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.049 
did the first time it popped up on my
map<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.770> i<00:00:46.980> spent<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.550> little<00:00:47.640> bit<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.820> time

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
map so i spent a little bit of time

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.299 
map so i spent a little bit of time
studying<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.590> defense<00:00:49.890> buildings

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
studying all of the defense buildings

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.920 
studying all of the defense buildings
the<00:00:50.430> splash<00:00:50.700> damage<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.239> health<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.629> whatnot

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the splash damage to health and whatnot

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.709 
the splash damage to health and whatnot
and<00:00:52.170> as<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.100> see<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.550> level<00:00:54.120> 90<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.690> is

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
and as you can see it is level 90 it is

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.689 
and as you can see it is level 90 it is
still<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> mystery<00:00:55.320> city<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.800> i<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.610> be

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
still a mystery city so i have to be

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.920 
still a mystery city so i have to be
really<00:00:56.940> realistic<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.449> myself<00:00:57.780> i'm

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
really realistic with myself i'm

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.139 
really realistic with myself i'm
probably<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:58.469> gonna<00:00:58.890> get<00:00:59.160> all<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> way

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
probably not gonna get all the way

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.880 
probably not gonna get all the way
through<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.930> know<00:01:01.020> clear<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.620> but

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
through and you know clear it up but

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.439 
through and you know clear it up but
what<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.160> really<00:01:02.579> want<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> accomplish<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.329> this

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
what I really want to accomplish in this

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
what I really want to accomplish in this
video<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:03.989> want<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.409> get<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> third

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
video is I want to get to a third

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.000 
video is I want to get to a third
threshold<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.479> reward<00:01:06.869> because<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.409> really

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
threshold of the reward because I really

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.640 
threshold of the reward because I really
want<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> 90k<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.240> rock<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.810> really<00:01:10.170> 109

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
want the 90k in rock and I really 109

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.980 
want the 90k in rock and I really 109
decay<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.189> metal<00:01:12.030> where<00:01:12.210> Iran<00:01:12.450> whatever<00:01:12.750> you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
decay in metal where Iran whatever you

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.050 
decay in metal where Iran whatever you
want<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> call<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:14.610> I'm<00:01:14.729> gonna<00:01:14.850> do

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
want to call it so what I'm gonna do

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.940 
want to call it so what I'm gonna do
here<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.509> I'm<00:01:15.630> gonna<00:01:15.780> clean<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.200> all<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.619> these

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
here is I'm gonna clean up all of these

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.520 
here is I'm gonna clean up all of these
mines<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.580> boom<00:01:17.729> mines<00:01:18.000> right<00:01:18.689> over<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
mines and boom mines right over here and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
mines and boom mines right over here and
i'm<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.460> my<00:01:20.820> favorite

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
i'm going in with my favorite

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.330 
i'm going in with my favorite
combination<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.320> guessed<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.830> I'm<00:01:22.979> deploying

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
combination you guessed it I'm deploying

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.030 
combination you guessed it I'm deploying
my<00:01:23.810> 12<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.960> my<00:01:25.140> heavies<00:01:25.680> 17<00:01:26.520> riflemen<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:29.810> 27

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
my 12 of my heavies 17 riflemen and 27

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.149 
my 12 of my heavies 17 riflemen and 27
26<00:01:32.040> 27<00:01:32.840> Lucas<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.990> cannot<00:01:34.320> do<00:01:34.560> math<00:01:34.770> right<00:01:34.979> now

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
26 27 Lucas I cannot do math right now

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.030 
26 27 Lucas I cannot do math right now
so<00:01:35.400> my<00:01:35.640> blend<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.360> basically<00:01:37.320> try<00:01:37.979> to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
so my blend here is basically try to

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.080 
so my blend here is basically try to
clear<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.430> as<00:01:38.610> many<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:40.250> you<00:01:41.250> know<00:01:41.400> storage

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
clear up as many of the you know storage

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.910 
clear up as many of the you know storage
buildings<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.659> possible<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.439> get<00:01:43.740> to

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
buildings as possible so I can get to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.100 
buildings as possible so I can get to
the<00:01:44.009> threshold<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.790> reward<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.570> what<00:01:46.079> I

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the threshold of the reward and what I

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.440 
the threshold of the reward and what I
realize<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:47.159> know<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.640> video<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.240> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
realize you know in this video is that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.050 
realize you know in this video is that
because<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.470> my<00:01:49.590> gumbo<00:01:49.950> energy<00:01:50.460> level<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
because of my gumbo energy level and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.319 
because of my gumbo energy level and
because<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.200> level<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.740> my<00:01:53.100> artillery<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
because of the level of my artillery and

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.319 
because of the level of my artillery and
and<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.860> missiles<00:01:56.250> I'm<00:01:56.549> really<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.270> to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and and missiles I'm really not going to

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.969 
and and missiles I'm really not going to
do<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> whole<00:01:57.780> lot<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.020> damage<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.560> any<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
do a whole lot of damage to any of the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.399 
do a whole lot of damage to any of the
defense<00:01:59.250> building<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.850> my<00:02:00.329> plan<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:00.960> not

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
defense building so my plan here is not

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.899 
defense building so my plan here is not
to<00:02:01.439> waste<00:02:01.770> those<00:02:01.979> artillery<00:02:02.369> shots<00:02:02.610> unless

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
to waste those artillery shots unless

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.569 
to waste those artillery shots unless
you<00:02:03.240> know<00:02:03.360> nothing<00:02:03.840> else<00:02:04.020> remains<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.680> save

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
you know nothing else remains and save

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.470 
you know nothing else remains and save
up<00:02:05.759> until<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.540> actually<00:02:07.049> show

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
up until I can actually show

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.060 
up until I can actually show
those<00:02:07.630> buildings<00:02:07.900> because<00:02:08.500> as<00:02:08.710> you<00:02:08.890> can<00:02:08.920> see

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
those buildings because as you can see

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.430 
those buildings because as you can see
those<00:02:09.700> boom<00:02:09.940> cannons<00:02:10.300> are<00:02:10.480> taking<00:02:10.810> out<00:02:10.930> my

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
those boom cannons are taking out my

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.860 
those boom cannons are taking out my
Zukas<00:02:11.890> like<00:02:12.220> crazy<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.210> doom<00:02:13.420> cannons

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
Zukas like crazy and the doom cannons

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.110 
Zukas like crazy and the doom cannons
and<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.500> know<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.520> know<00:02:15.640> zip<00:02:15.850> in<00:02:16.000> them

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
and you know just you know zip in them

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.810 
and you know just you know zip in them
one<00:02:16.360> after<00:02:16.570> another<00:02:16.810> so<00:02:17.440> for<00:02:18.130> future<00:02:18.310> attacks

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
one after another so for future attacks

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.220 
one after another so for future attacks
i<00:02:18.970> think<00:02:19.240> i'm<00:02:19.360> going<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.570> regroup<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:20.020> little

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
i think i'm going to regroup a little

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.050 
i think i'm going to regroup a little
bit<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.500> just<00:02:20.710> save<00:02:21.100> up<00:02:21.280> all<00:02:21.460> that<00:02:21.790> energy

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
bit and just save up all that energy

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.480 
bit and just save up all that energy
from<00:02:22.450> artillery<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.320> barrage<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.920> save

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
from artillery in the barrage and save

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.780 
from artillery in the barrage and save
it<00:02:24.640> up<00:02:24.760> for<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:26.260> guessed<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.650> shocker<00:02:27.250> so

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
it up for you guessed it shocker so

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.990 
it up for you guessed it shocker so
right<00:02:28.570> now<00:02:28.600> we<00:02:29.290> got<00:02:29.500> through<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.490> first<00:02:30.700> two

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
right now we got through the first two

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.490 
right now we got through the first two
levels<00:02:31.210> and<00:02:31.630> we<00:02:31.870> got<00:02:32.050> 103<00:02:32.950> k<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:33.550> rock<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.840> we

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
levels and we got 103 k in rock and we

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.520 
levels and we got 103 k in rock and we
got<00:02:35.530> one<00:02:36.100> of<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.460> parts<00:02:36.850> for<00:02:37.060> our<00:02:37.350> weapon<00:02:38.350> lab

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
got one of the parts for our weapon lab

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.040 
got one of the parts for our weapon lab
so<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:39.120> retrain<00:02:40.120> my<00:02:40.240> troops<00:02:40.540> i'm<00:02:40.720> not<00:02:40.870> going<00:02:41.020> to

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
so I retrain my troops i'm not going to

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.450

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.460 
out some of these sniper towers but
actually<00:03:06.580> it<00:03:06.760> doesn't<00:03:07.000> look<00:03:07.690> old<00:03:07.990> too<00:03:08.230> hot<00:03:08.440> on

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
actually it doesn't look old too hot on

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.250

me<00:03:08.860> i'm<00:03:09.100> already<00:03:09.430> down<00:03:09.760> one<00:03:09.820> boat<00:03:10.420> two<00:03:11.020> boats

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
me i'm already down one boat two boats

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.340 
me i'm already down one boat two boats
of<00:03:11.940> tough<00:03:12.940> tanks<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.510> now<00:03:13.660> three<00:03:13.990> boats<00:03:14.170> of

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
of tough tanks and now three boats of

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.710 
of tough tanks and now three boats of
tanks<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.770> own<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.340> opposite<00:03:15.970> Amos<00:03:16.240> I<00:03:16.300> have<00:03:16.540> two

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
tanks I own the opposite Amos I have two

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.080 
tanks I own the opposite Amos I have two
tanks<00:03:16.990> remaining<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:17.920> have<00:03:18.190> one<00:03:18.490> medic<00:03:18.910> so

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
tanks remaining and I have one medic so

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.850 
tanks remaining and I have one medic so
definitely<00:03:19.540> this<00:03:19.660> was<00:03:20.080> really<00:03:20.410> poor<00:03:20.590> strategy

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
definitely this was really poor strategy

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.910 
definitely this was really poor strategy
on<00:03:21.280> my<00:03:21.550> end<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.090> if<00:03:23.080> you<00:03:23.260> watching<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:23.650> do

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
on my end and if you watching this do

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.650 
on my end and if you watching this do
not<00:03:24.100> make<00:03:24.370> this<00:03:24.520> mistake<00:03:24.730> learn<00:03:25.239> from<00:03:25.450> my

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
not make this mistake learn from my

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.380 
not make this mistake learn from my
mistakes<00:03:26.050> so<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.500> still<00:03:27.070> have<00:03:27.280> one<00:03:27.390> attack

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
mistakes so I still have one attack

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.660 
mistakes so I still have one attack
remaining<00:03:28.870> I'm<00:03:29.020> all<00:03:29.590> trained<00:03:29.890> up<00:03:30.040> once<00:03:30.489> again

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
remaining I'm all trained up once again

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.850 
remaining I'm all trained up once again
going<00:03:31.300> with<00:03:31.450> my<00:03:31.600> favorite<00:03:31.989> combination<00:03:32.620> and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
going with my favorite combination and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.130 
going with my favorite combination and
let's<00:03:33.160> see<00:03:33.400> if<00:03:33.610> we<00:03:34.150> can<00:03:34.330> get<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.930> next

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
let's see if we can get to the next

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.890 
let's see if we can get to the next
threshold<00:03:35.620> of<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.100> reward<00:03:36.520> level<00:03:37.090> because<00:03:37.720> I

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
threshold of the reward level because I

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.140 
threshold of the reward level because I
really<00:03:38.350> really<00:03:38.709> really<00:03:38.739> want<00:03:38.980> that<00:03:39.280> metal<00:03:39.640> so

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
really really really want that metal so

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.479 
really really really want that metal so
I<00:03:40.660> am<00:03:41.290> I'm<00:03:41.500> actually<00:03:41.709> now<00:03:41.980> going<00:03:42.280> in<00:03:42.370> without

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
I am I'm actually now going in without

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.670 
I am I'm actually now going in without
medics<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.300> I'm<00:03:43.480> going<00:03:43.810> in<00:03:43.930> with<00:03:43.959> three

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
medics so I'm going in with three

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.830 
medics so I'm going in with three
landing<00:03:45.160> crafts<00:03:45.520> of<00:03:45.610> heavy<00:03:45.910> swell<00:03:46.330> and<00:03:46.480> crafts

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
we can reach rework threshold for but

you<00:04:08.140> know<00:04:08.260> we're<00:04:08.680> still<00:04:08.950> here<00:04:09.220> where's<00:04:09.489> the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
you know we're still here where's the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.449 
you know we're still here where's the
good<00:04:09.880> number<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:10.480> let's<00:04:10.720> see<00:04:10.959> if<00:04:11.170> we<00:04:11.350> can<00:04:11.560> at

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
good number so let's see if we can at

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.670 
good number so let's see if we can at
this<00:04:12.640> point<00:04:12.720> Lucas<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:13.840> gettin<00:04:14.140> close<00:04:14.380> enough
