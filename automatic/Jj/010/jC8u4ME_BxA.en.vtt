00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.430
 stereo headphones are one of the components of the day 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.309
 their qualitative perception of music 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.920
 phonograms of numerous audio systems and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.330
 players any radio engineering 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.580
 device is intended to 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.070
 playback including even 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.339
 ordinary audio player has a jack 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.410
 to connect external head 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.490
 phones 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.480
 high-quality assembly of a complete set 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.270
 stereo headphones 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.660
 does not always guarantee their long and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.550
 reliable work sometimes careless 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.420
 attitude to the operation of headphones 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.340
 leads to damage their performance 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.190
 weak spot it pleases conductors in 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.340
 base plugs it happens 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.330
 by pulling out the plug 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.210
 holds the connecting cable 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.520
 they are the plug body itself removing it from 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.560
 nests 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.930
 audio systems we will help you 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.240
 home conditions produce this 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.110
 quite simple repair on replacement 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:12.170
 plugs for this you need a spare 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.170
 plug having a collapsible structure 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.070
 cutting at the base of the plugs 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.700
 connecting cable approximately 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.360
 leaving a small conclusion 20 25 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.659
 millimeters 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.210
 we clean the contacts start 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.830
 servicing the findings now lay you 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.830
 pins and plugs 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:48.300
 on the connecting cable and dress 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.300
 protective cover new plug 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.380
 now we start the pinout 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.900
 we steam the general conclusion 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:09.619
 now let's cook two short cambric 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:12.750
 on the insulation between the pins of the plug when 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.080
 undesired circuit inside each 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.080
 friend 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.800
 we put on cambrets 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:41.879
 we compress a cable and we insert a cover on itself 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.239
 plug twist it now with 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.000
 multimeter 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.769
 put in half a meter in advance 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.840
 check the integrity of the voice coil and 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.970
 Now we will check our work in the working 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.970
 mode with audio player 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.750
 the main phones are OK and ready for 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.750
 operation
