00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.419 
and it's a great like bonding and that
really<00:01:59.959> happens<00:02:00.349> I<00:02:00.590> think<00:02:00.860> what<00:02:01.009> you<00:02:01.130> put<00:02:01.310> into

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
really happens I think what you put into

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.279 
really happens I think what you put into
it<00:02:01.610> you'll<00:02:01.789> get<00:02:01.970> out<00:02:02.119> of<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.390> you're<00:02:02.780> coming<00:02:03.140> in

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
it you'll get out of it you're coming in

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.359 
it you'll get out of it you're coming in
with<00:02:03.890> these<00:02:04.310> ideas<00:02:04.729> of<00:02:05.509> how<00:02:05.660> you<00:02:05.979> perceive<00:02:06.979> the

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
with these ideas of how you perceive the

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.180 
with these ideas of how you perceive the
world<00:02:07.399> but<00:02:08.000> you're<00:02:08.149> open<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.750> accepting<00:02:09.560> all

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
world but you're open to accepting all

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.130 
world but you're open to accepting all
of<00:02:10.250> these<00:02:10.610> changes<00:02:11.090> then<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:11.660> can<00:02:11.870> really

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
of these changes then you can really

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.690 
of these changes then you can really
grow<00:02:12.319> from<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.590> experience<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.459> think

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
grow from that experience and I think

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.540 
grow from that experience and I think
that<00:02:13.880> that's<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.209> best<00:02:14.390> part<00:02:14.660> about<00:02:15.550> being

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
that that's the best part about being

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.820 
that that's the best part about being
here<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.420> working<00:02:17.569> here<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.080> learning<00:02:18.620> from

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
here and working here is learning from

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.970 
here and working here is learning from
that

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.040
