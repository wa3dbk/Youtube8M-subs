00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
but once a video with commentary that

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.579 
but once a video with commentary that
actually<00:00:03.060> means<00:00:03.270> these<00:00:04.259> are<00:00:04.380> going<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.529> be

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
actually means these are going to be

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.280 
actually means these are going to be
things<00:00:04.650> that<00:00:05.009> you<00:00:05.220> need<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.400> remember

things that you need to remember

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.620 
things that you need to remember
throughout<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:08.010> rebuild<00:00:10.370> that<00:00:11.370> uh<00:00:11.630> you

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
throughout the rebuild that uh you

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.330 
throughout the rebuild that uh you
should<00:00:12.870> definitely<00:00:13.110> take<00:00:13.590> note<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:19.279> how<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
should definitely take note of how the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.679 
should definitely take note of how the
Pistons<00:00:20.880> line<00:00:21.180> up<00:00:25.730> how<00:00:26.730> everything<00:00:27.180> fits

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
Pistons line up how everything fits

Pistons line up how everything fits
together<00:00:28.010> bushings<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.160> need<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.490> be

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
together bushings that need to be

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:41.930 
together bushings that need to be
changed<00:00:31.550> how<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.610> tire<00:00:33.030> set<00:00:33.480> up<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:40.879> how<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
changed how the tire set up is how the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.290 
changed how the tire set up is how the
steering<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> work<00:00:43.879> this<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> good

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
steering is going to work this is a good

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.920 
steering is going to work this is a good
setup<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.870> feels<00:00:46.110> good<00:00:47.450> this<00:00:48.450> whole<00:00:48.660> setup

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
setup it feels good this whole setup

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.900 
setup it feels good this whole setup
needs<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.469> replaced<00:00:50.840> but<00:00:52.610> it's<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.789> one

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
needs to be replaced but it's just one

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.420 
needs to be replaced but it's just one
piece<00:00:54.410> there<00:00:55.410> are<00:00:55.559> set<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.739> connections<00:00:56.010> are

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
piece there are set of connections are

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.389 
piece there are set of connections are
good<00:00:56.969> enough<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> reuse<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:58.739> replacing<00:00:59.190> all

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
good enough to reuse just replacing all

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:07.789 
good enough to reuse just replacing all
the<00:00:59.430> little<00:01:00.210> bushings<00:01:06.080> more<00:01:07.080> bushings<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the little bushings more bushings to

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:15.530 
the little bushings more bushings to
replace<00:01:09.860> replacing<00:01:10.860> all<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.010> suspension<00:01:14.540> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
replace replacing all the suspension the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.200 
replace replacing all the suspension the
front<00:01:15.810> piece<00:01:16.020> doesn't<00:01:16.320> look<00:01:16.530> too<00:01:16.680> damaged<00:01:17.210> it

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
front piece doesn't look too damaged it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.770 
front piece doesn't look too damaged it
looks<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:19.020> was<00:01:19.140> oiled<00:01:19.590> regularly

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
looks like this was oiled regularly

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.230 
looks like this was oiled regularly
so<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.810> shouldn't<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> problem<00:01:23.240> still

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
so that shouldn't be a problem still

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.240 
so that shouldn't be a problem still
replacing<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> front<00:01:25.170> end<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:29.070> be

we're<00:01:34.140> gonna<00:01:34.200> move<00:01:35.270> we<00:01:36.270> may<00:01:36.509> move<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.590> for

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
we're gonna move we may move it just for

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
good setup you can see how that's wired

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.370 
good setup you can see how that's wired
real<00:01:59.460> easy<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.119> back<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.509> bike<00:02:00.659> as

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
real easy to the back of the bike as

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.789 
real easy to the back of the bike as
back<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.040> buggy<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.899> way<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.229> wiring<00:02:04.680> is

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
back of the buggy the way the wiring is

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.249 
back of the buggy the way the wiring is
set<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.670> hose<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.659> hose<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
set up I like this hose this hose is a

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.080 
set up I like this hose this hose is a
good<00:02:07.439> idea<00:02:07.530> maybe<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.819> spray-paint<00:02:09.420> it

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
good idea maybe just spray-paint it

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.479 
good idea maybe just spray-paint it
you've<00:02:12.090> got<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.390> brake<00:02:12.599> cylinder<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.590> how

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
you've got the brake cylinder and how

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.369 
you've got the brake cylinder and how
that<00:02:14.970> set<00:02:15.180> up<00:02:15.209> we've<00:02:15.930> already<00:02:16.140> got<00:02:16.349> the

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
that set up we've already got the

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.160 
that set up we've already got the
brake<00:02:16.620> idea<00:02:16.980> from<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.459> other<00:02:17.670> bike<00:02:18.019> so<00:02:19.019> that

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
brake idea from the other bike so that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.899 
brake idea from the other bike so that
shouldn't<00:02:19.439> be<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> big<00:02:19.799> issue<00:02:20.810> there's<00:02:21.810> no

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
shouldn't be a big issue there's no

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.910 
shouldn't be a big issue there's no
brakes<00:02:23.909> in<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.180> front<00:02:24.470> from<00:02:25.470> what<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.709> looks

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
brakes in the front from what it looks

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.300 
brakes in the front from what it looks
like<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:27.420> may<00:02:27.659> have<00:02:27.689> been<00:02:28.079> at<00:02:28.470> one<00:02:28.709> point<00:02:29.010> with

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
like it may have been at one point with

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.520 
like it may have been at one point with
the<00:02:29.400> way<00:02:29.519> this<00:02:29.700> line<00:02:30.569> is<00:02:30.810> running<00:02:31.170> from<00:02:31.379> the

the way this line is running from the
brake<00:02:31.769> cylinder<00:02:32.220> but<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:33.859> don't<00:02:34.859> think<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:38.000> don't

think<00:02:39.150> we're<00:02:39.269> going<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.480> treat<00:02:39.659> that<00:02:39.950> cause<00:02:40.950> i

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
think we're going to treat that cause i

different but it'll stay I'll maybe
figure<00:02:56.159> out<00:02:56.310> how<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:57.500> set<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.530> up<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.829> where<00:02:58.859> I

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
figure out how to set it up to where I

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.770 
figure out how to set it up to where I
can<00:02:59.280> use<00:02:59.459> that<00:02:59.489> stick<00:02:59.849> shift<00:03:00.120> even<00:03:00.510> with<00:03:00.659> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
can use that stick shift even with the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:14.119 
can use that stick shift even with the
new<00:03:00.810> motor<00:03:01.579> the<00:03:02.579> rear<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.430> garbage<00:03:13.129> the

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
new motor the rear this is garbage the

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.250 
new motor the rear this is garbage the
back<00:03:14.310> frame<00:03:14.549> isn't<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:15.480> back<00:03:15.629> frame<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.109> going

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
back frame isn't the back frame is going

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.250 
back frame isn't the back frame is going
to<00:03:16.319> stay<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.650> same<00:03:16.829> junkie<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:19.079> has<00:03:19.230> to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
to stay the same junkie so it has to

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:28.129 
to stay the same junkie so it has to
stay<00:03:22.669> I<00:03:24.709> want<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:26.190> way<00:03:26.419> this<00:03:27.419> is<00:03:27.480> set<00:03:27.690> up<00:03:27.900> I

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
stay I want the way this is set up I

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.559 
stay I want the way this is set up I
like<00:03:28.470> how<00:03:28.500> high<00:03:28.919> it<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.419> thinking<00:03:30.419> about

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
like how high it is thinking about

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.559 
like how high it is thinking about
making<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.019> higher<00:03:31.230> but<00:03:31.709> who<00:03:31.859> knows<00:03:32.569> still

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
making it higher but who knows still

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.220 
making it higher but who knows still
many<00:03:33.659> options<00:03:34.199> to<00:03:34.530> deal<00:03:34.919> with<00:03:36.109> replacing<00:03:37.109> the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
many options to deal with replacing the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.069 
many options to deal with replacing the
back<00:03:38.239> shocks<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:41.190> arm<00:03:41.400> looks<00:03:41.699> okay

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
back shocks the the arm looks okay

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.110 
back shocks the the arm looks okay
there's<00:03:43.079> not<00:03:43.349> a<00:03:43.590> lot<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:43.799> rust<00:03:44.099> damage<00:03:44.340> that's

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
there's not a lot of rust damage that's

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.469 
there's not a lot of rust damage that's
the<00:03:45.419> worst<00:03:45.690> I've<00:03:45.959> seen<00:03:45.989> on<00:03:46.409> the<00:03:46.500> whole<00:03:46.680> bike

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
the worst I've seen on the whole bike

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.939 
the worst I've seen on the whole bike
but<00:03:48.479> you<00:03:48.720> could<00:03:48.870> just<00:03:49.079> replace<00:03:49.769> like

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
but you could just replace like

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:53.119 
but you could just replace like
that<00:03:49.979> I<00:03:51.169> mean<00:03:52.169> I<00:03:52.260> might<00:03:52.470> just<00:03:52.709> replace<00:03:53.099> it

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
that I mean I might just replace it

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.589 
that I mean I might just replace it
anyways<00:03:53.609> because<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.940> pipe<00:03:54.120> comes<00:03:54.329> out<00:03:54.479> the

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
anyways because the pipe comes out the

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.960 
anyways because the pipe comes out the
side<00:03:54.859> so<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.949> whole<00:03:56.129> thing<00:03:56.159> might<00:03:56.609> just<00:03:56.819> come

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
side so the whole thing might just come

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.520 
side so the whole thing might just come
right<00:03:57.239> off<00:03:57.889> with<00:03:58.889> a<00:03:58.919> couple<00:03:59.099> of<00:03:59.280> bolts<00:04:00.530> this

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
right off with a couple of bolts this

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.520 
right off with a couple of bolts this
side<00:04:01.709> doesn't<00:04:01.949> have<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.400> shot<00:04:03.109> lights<00:04:04.109> it'll

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
side doesn't have the shot lights it'll

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.830 
side doesn't have the shot lights it'll
have<00:04:04.680> custom<00:04:05.190> LED

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.809 

again<00:04:09.840> with<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.110> brake<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:11.069> brakes<00:04:11.520> back

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
there's going to be a chain here may be

there's going to be a chain here may be
in<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.600> center<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:23.030> then<00:04:24.410> it's<00:04:25.410> going<00:04:25.500> to

have the disc brakes set up to the foot

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.730 
have the disc brakes set up to the foot
brake<00:04:31.950> up<00:04:32.190> there<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.690> that's<00:04:33.690> how<00:04:33.960> that's

brake up there and that's how that's
going<00:04:34.919> to<00:04:34.979> work<00:04:36.410> um<00:04:38.210> it'll<00:04:39.210> have<00:04:39.510> reverse

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
going to work um it'll have reverse

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.590 
going to work um it'll have reverse
it'll<00:04:40.229> have<00:04:40.380> all<00:04:40.550> everything<00:04:41.550> the

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.800 
there's already set up for reverse but i
don't<00:04:44.280> think<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.760> engine<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:45.210> I<00:04:45.270> got<00:04:45.570> with

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
don't think the engine that I got with

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.530 
don't think the engine that I got with
it<00:04:45.990> is<00:04:46.169> going<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:46.979> work<00:04:47.100> at<00:04:47.280> all<00:04:50.240> there's<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.330> lot

it is going to work at all there's a lot

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.219 
it is going to work at all there's a lot

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
of damage but everything I mean it looks

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:00.800 
of damage but everything I mean it looks
ok<00:04:55.590> is<00:04:55.919> just<00:04:57.470> not<00:04:58.470> in<00:04:58.740> good<00:04:59.070> condition<00:04:59.810> I've

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
ok is just not in good condition I've

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.570 
ok is just not in good condition I've
got<00:05:01.020> a<00:05:01.050> custom<00:05:01.440> motor<00:05:01.590> for<00:05:01.860> it<00:05:01.889> anyway<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:02.310> I'm

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
got a custom motor for it anyway so I'm

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.570 
got a custom motor for it anyway so I'm
not<00:05:02.729> really<00:05:02.880> concerned<00:05:04.220> just<00:05:05.220> use<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.550> for

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
not really concerned just use it for

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.760 
not really concerned just use it for
ideas<00:05:06.060> I've<00:05:06.330> got<00:05:06.479> an<00:05:06.600> extra<00:05:06.990> front<00:05:07.290> end<00:05:07.560> piece

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
ideas I've got an extra front end piece

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.010 
ideas I've got an extra front end piece
for<00:05:10.770> it<00:05:11.000> just<00:05:12.000> in<00:05:12.150> case<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.540> found<00:05:12.780> something

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
for it just in case I found something

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.690 
for it just in case I found something
wrong<00:05:13.289> with<00:05:13.440> that<00:05:13.470> I<00:05:13.620> think<00:05:14.010> that<00:05:14.190> one's<00:05:14.370> in<00:05:14.610> a

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
wrong with that I think that one's in a

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.830 
wrong with that I think that one's in a
lot<00:05:14.970> worse<00:05:15.000> condition<00:05:15.870> considering<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:17.039> rust

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
lot worse condition considering the rust

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.779 
lot worse condition considering the rust
it<00:05:18.840> already<00:05:19.200> ate<00:05:19.320> through<00:05:19.710> one<00:05:19.740> of<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.550> shots

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
it already ate through one of the shots

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.260 
it already ate through one of the shots
over<00:05:21.210> there<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:23.010> brakes<00:05:23.310> seem<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.729> be<00:05:23.880> okay

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
over there the brakes seem to be okay

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.900 
over there the brakes seem to be okay
but<00:05:24.800> still<00:05:25.800> it's<00:05:26.190> all<00:05:26.340> getting<00:05:26.520> replaced

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
but still it's all getting replaced

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.180 
but still it's all getting replaced
anyways<00:05:27.330> if<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:28.050> can<00:05:28.200> use<00:05:28.380> spare<00:05:28.620> pieces<00:05:28.889> on

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
anyways if I can use spare pieces on

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.990 
anyways if I can use spare pieces on
this<00:05:29.370> i<00:05:29.490> will<00:05:29.669> if<00:05:29.880> not<00:05:30.060> no<00:05:31.050> hard<00:05:31.289> feelings<00:05:32.000> it's
