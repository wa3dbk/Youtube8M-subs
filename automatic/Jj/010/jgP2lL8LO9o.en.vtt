you<00:03:44.350> might<00:03:44.650> encounter<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:45.070> dragon<00:03:45.850> which<00:03:46.270> is

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
you might encounter a dragon which is

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.110 
you might encounter a dragon which is
what<00:03:46.570> I<00:03:46.600> also<00:03:46.870> do<00:03:47.080> I<00:03:47.260> encountered<00:03:48.120> because

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
what I also do I encountered because

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.370 
what I also do I encountered because
they<00:03:49.300> just<00:03:49.450> let<00:03:49.570> me<00:03:49.660> show<00:03:49.810> up<00:03:49.930> like<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.230> best

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
they just let me show up like the best

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.080 
they just let me show up like the best
times<00:03:50.680> right

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
times right

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.820 
times right
so<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:52.510> guess<00:03:52.660> kill<00:03:52.870> them<00:03:53.020> then<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.380> start<00:03:53.800> the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
so I guess kill them then you start the

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.380 
so I guess kill them then you start the
next<00:03:53.980> part<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.460> quest<00:03:54.820> which<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.210> death

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
next part of quest which is death

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.690 
next part of quest which is death
incarnate
