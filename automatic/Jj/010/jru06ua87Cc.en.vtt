00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
just put on one of these web pages and
see<00:04:45.210> what<00:04:45.330> happens<00:04:45.830> um<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:47.659> guess<00:04:48.659> I<00:04:48.780> really

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
see what happens um I guess I really

wouldn't need to zoom in because it's

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.850 
wouldn't need to zoom in because it's

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
built for a mobile browser but it's kind

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.550 
built for a mobile browser but it's kind
of<00:04:52.889> nice<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.370> also<00:04:54.000> Firefox<00:04:54.690> is<00:04:54.930> coming<00:04:55.289> for

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
of nice and also Firefox is coming for

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.890 
of nice and also Firefox is coming for
the<00:04:55.830> Android<00:04:56.490> platform<00:04:56.599> so<00:04:57.599> you<00:04:57.690> can<00:04:57.810> look

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
the Android platform so you can look

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.749 
the Android platform so you can look
forward<00:04:58.139> to<00:04:58.259> that<00:04:58.289> if<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.650> like<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:59.159> Firefox

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759

forward to that if you like the Firefox
browser<00:05:00.860> um<00:05:02.570> now<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:03.599> guess<00:05:03.930> we<00:05:04.080> will<00:05:04.169> go<00:05:04.349> on<00:05:04.590> to

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
browser um now I guess we will go on to

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.560 
browser um now I guess we will go on to
the<00:05:04.919> speed<00:05:05.190> test<00:05:05.430> between<00:05:05.639> the<00:05:06.180> default

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
the speed test between the default

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.959 
the speed test between the default
browser<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:07.199> the<00:05:07.650> iphone<00:05:07.949> or<00:05:08.669> ipod<00:05:09.120> touch

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:10.969 
browser and the iphone or ipod touch

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.700 
browser and the iphone or ipod touch
okay<00:05:11.969> so<00:05:12.030> here<00:05:12.389> we<00:05:12.509> have<00:05:12.539> the<00:05:12.810> ipod<00:05:13.139> touch<00:05:13.169> and

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
okay so here we have the ipod touch and

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.339 
okay so here we have the ipod touch and
the<00:05:14.060> nexus<00:05:15.060> one<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.570> next<00:05:15.719> one<00:05:15.900> does<00:05:16.139> have<00:05:16.289> a

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
the nexus one the next one does have a

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:17.810 
the nexus one the next one does have a
faster<00:05:16.680> processor<00:05:17.250> but<00:05:17.430> they're<00:05:17.550> both<00:05:17.669> using

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
faster processor but they're both using

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.050 
faster processor but they're both using
the<00:05:18.060> WebKit<00:05:18.479> toolkit<00:05:19.259> for<00:05:19.440> both<00:05:20.130> browsers<00:05:20.430> the

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
the WebKit toolkit for both browsers the

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.820 
the WebKit toolkit for both browsers the
Safari<00:05:21.750> browser<00:05:22.020> and<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.440> default<00:05:22.680> browser

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
Safari browser and the default browser

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.920 
Safari browser and the default browser
on<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.159> nexus<00:05:23.430> one<00:05:23.669> so<00:05:24.479> we're<00:05:24.599> going<00:05:24.690> to<00:05:24.780> try

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
on the nexus one so we're going to try

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.839 
on the nexus one so we're going to try
to<00:05:24.960> go<00:05:25.110> at<00:05:25.229> about<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:25.530> same<00:05:25.590> time<00:05:25.800> these<00:05:26.639> boats

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
to go at about the same time these boats

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.550 
to go at about the same time these boats
have<00:05:26.969> been<00:05:27.030> loading<00:05:27.389> on<00:05:27.479> both<00:05:27.659> browser<00:05:27.960> both

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
have been loading on both browser both

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.700 
have been loading on both browser both
phones

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
phones

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.280 
phones
and<00:05:30.090> products<00:05:31.090> before<00:05:31.270> so<00:05:31.930> we'll<00:05:31.990> see<00:05:32.170> which

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
and products before so we'll see which

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.890 
and products before so we'll see which
one<00:05:32.410> goes<00:05:32.530> faster<00:05:33.010> and<00:05:33.220> going<00:05:34.030> down<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.940> so

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
one goes faster and going down and so

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.800 
one goes faster and going down and so
the<00:05:38.050> nexus<00:05:38.350> one<00:05:38.500> did<00:05:38.680> finish<00:05:39.430> first<00:05:39.790> but<00:05:40.060> it

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
the nexus one did finish first but it

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.900 
the nexus one did finish first but it
wasn't<00:05:41.080> too<00:05:41.230> far<00:05:41.470> behind<00:05:41.500> on<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.370> Safari

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
wasn't too far behind on the Safari

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.510 
wasn't too far behind on the Safari
browser<00:05:43.240> so<00:05:44.140> you<00:05:44.650> asked<00:05:44.950> which<00:05:45.070> one<00:05:45.100> was

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
browser so you asked which one was

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.100 
browser so you asked which one was
faster<00:05:45.970> I'm<00:05:46.240> probably<00:05:46.450> going<00:05:46.720> to<00:05:46.810> say<00:05:46.960> the

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
faster I'm probably going to say the

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.900 
faster I'm probably going to say the
nexus<00:05:47.410> one<00:05:47.680> but<00:05:47.860> like<00:05:47.980> i<00:05:48.100> said<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:48.430> processor

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
nexus one but like i said the processor

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.820 
nexus one but like i said the processor
is<00:05:48.940> a<00:05:49.060> lot<00:05:49.360> faster<00:05:49.980> um<00:05:50.980> maybe<00:05:51.820> not<00:05:52.120> as<00:05:52.300> much<00:05:52.330> on

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
is a lot faster um maybe not as much on

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.700 
is a lot faster um maybe not as much on
iphone<00:05:53.830> 3gs<00:05:54.310> but<00:05:54.670> i<00:05:55.380> think<00:05:56.380> it<00:05:56.440> was<00:05:56.530> a<00:05:56.560> pretty

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
iphone 3gs but i think it was a pretty

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.760 
iphone 3gs but i think it was a pretty
good<00:05:56.800> pic<00:05:57.070> comparison<00:05:57.640> and<00:05:57.850> if<00:05:58.690> you<00:05:59.500> want<00:05:59.650> my

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
good pic comparison and if you want my

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.440 
good pic comparison and if you want my
opinion<00:05:59.860> on<00:06:00.250> what<00:06:00.430> browser<00:06:00.610> from<00:06:01.060> the<00:06:01.150> nexus

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
opinion on what browser from the nexus

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.380 
opinion on what browser from the nexus
one<00:06:01.600> you<00:06:01.750> should<00:06:01.900> use<00:06:02.110> i<00:06:02.520> really<00:06:03.520> like<00:06:04.120> the

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
one you should use i really like the

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.540 
one you should use i really like the
default<00:06:04.720> browser<00:06:04.900> and<00:06:05.350> i<00:06:05.470> think<00:06:05.770> oh<00:06:06.040> priya
