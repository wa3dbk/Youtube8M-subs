00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
swirling around in the galaxy like

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.930 
swirling around in the galaxy like
collection<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.840> cells<00:02:16.400> trying<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.489> avoid<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
collection of cells trying to avoid the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.369 
collection of cells trying to avoid the
sunlight<00:02:18.390> cell<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.989> middle<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.319> the

cluster luckily the game does provide a

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.289 
cluster luckily the game does provide a
trajectory<00:02:22.500> arc<00:02:23.129> so<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:23.879> tell<00:02:24.090> when

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
trajectory arc so you can tell when

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.170 
trajectory arc so you can tell when
you're<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:24.900> out<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.170> orbit<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.670> stages

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
you're in and out of orbit the stages

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.589 
you're in and out of orbit the stages
can<00:02:27.510> get<00:02:27.810> quite<00:02:28.049> large<00:02:29.030> quite<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.060> few<00:02:30.150> cells

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
can get quite large quite a few cells

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.539 
can get quite large quite a few cells
swirling<00:02:31.290> around<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.799> this<00:02:31.950> puddle<00:02:32.250> of

boils<00:02:36.480> down<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.989> sacrificing<00:02:37.860> size<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.670> gain

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
boils down to sacrificing size to gain

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.160 
boils down to sacrificing size to gain
speed<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.829> subsequently<00:02:40.829> gain<00:02:41.160> size<00:02:41.549> again
