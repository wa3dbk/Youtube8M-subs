00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.609
 so next must first the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:11.730
 show change 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:15.089
 this is a kind nc20 this can be rebuilt 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 So 544 megahertz from home 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:25.529
 but in addition, 2.8 gg i think so 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.939
 Since doughs are these parts 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.590
 additionally used up here 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.739
 that works as I said or you 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.540
 can take both things theoretically 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.030
 you can also run 40 and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.829
 at the same time the other frequency 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.170
 take or only one 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.530
 as I said one on the C20 a bit 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.250
 You can climb the internet 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.030
 Buy is the manufacturer is used 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.039
 for tank model tank is at 40 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.800
 euro you will see the distant we 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.640
 I have always got the ball aside 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.170
 here are without construction without arms now 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:11.030
 I also build my battery now 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.030
 It was a bit loud 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.979
 front is light on the excavator what everyone 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.710
 one can see taken over one can see 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:26.450
 but sounds and following sketch I do 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.009
 me the long distance thereby the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:39.429
 Remote control is started here via 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:39.429
 started the gravel 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.950
 with sound 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.850
 and here you can see the spot as 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.850
 theoretically 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.810
 proud 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.650
 what is still in the burger I what 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.130
 I hear I can do it today 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:10.080
 or what does the truth do when it is 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.720
 the smog and visconti robben the come 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.330
 Out 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.030
 Of course, you need the lid 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.010
 make nation 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.010
 but as I said not again 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.420
 what i could not look at 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.730
 to understand properly as I said nonsense 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.450
 blackboard volume and for the smoker 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.490
 the moca is also from the tank and how 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.270
 said the whole plant in it is the 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.860
 receiver in it 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.680
 the recipient is from dough to 2 4 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.650
 gigahertz and as I said the fittings 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:54.810
 Here I have additionally installed 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:58.890
 I'll put it on the side of the one now 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.400
 Excavator silver is a big deal so no 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.770
 brother but a big bigger with cable 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.000
 remote control there is the remote control 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.920
 taken out were the cables 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.750
 remote control and is of dough 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.360
 theoretically replaced by a 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:18.650
 radio remote control of the arm I here 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:21.600
 I have for the excavator but is from brother 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.480
 almost identical to this excavator 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.640
 Also on it so the components are 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.530
 it's a bit identical for one thing 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.080
 unlike the chains below 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.970
 but the nice thing about the big league is that 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.660
 already has all the engines in it and 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.959
 so is around 50 euros 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.510
 and as I said here you see the hub 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:47.760
 cylinder here 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:50.480
 as I said as regulator takes you hold 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.380
 servus the electronics i have to 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.530
 try it out for yourself 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.060
 show and me to the skies and 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.890
 toggle switch forward backwards so 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.519
 no speed limit but 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.870
 just right left and as I said this 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.870
 I have now connected target here 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:14.790
 but what you can see well 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.790
 after all, the air is but so 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.320
 excellent 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.130
 I'm a bit higher you 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.130
 think better 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.630
 the same is up here with the 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.690
 shovel but here is not a meter 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.990
 more in it then goes on too much for us 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.320
 said and poor I have the woman the 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.490
 close by and has a 19 countries 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.560
 used medium 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.770
 that's enough for the one too 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.680
 to lift the cylinder less power 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.120
 then I showed you 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.740
 The excavator is theoretically already as 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.460
 twitter if you like 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:05.160
 with this message and the complete one 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.210
 arm of brother and the spindle cylinder 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.710
 built myself that I have before you 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.260
 normal rather shown how easily 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.160
 is done and as I said the whole 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:18.490
 bagage the excavator 50 euro the 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.420
 remote control 40 euro then come three 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.090
 motors at a 15 euro plus material 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.180
 only aluminum and you need it 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.370
 So we at 150 euro material costs around 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.130
 to equip this excavator completely 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.260
 also to cheap excavator it also nothing with 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:40.030
 reinforced aluminum or so is the 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:43.140
 original as he was so i hope that 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.140
 many can copy that
