00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.610 
far as the way it works it's basically
just<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.850> ratchet<00:04:50.300> it's<00:04:50.510> on<00:04:50.600> a<00:04:50.630> wrench<00:04:50.840> the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
just a ratchet it's on a wrench the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.250 
just a ratchet it's on a wrench the
simple<00:04:52.100> that<00:04:52.340> you<00:04:52.760> can<00:04:53.600> actually<00:04:53.750> feel<00:04:53.930> the

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
simple that you can actually feel the

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.010 
simple that you can actually feel the
the<00:04:54.770> ratcheting<00:04:55.550> motion<00:04:55.940> just<00:04:56.210> a<00:04:56.360> really<00:04:56.690> nice

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
the ratcheting motion just a really nice

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.190 
the ratcheting motion just a really nice
firm<00:04:57.560> feel<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.360> ratchet<00:05:02.200> gearwrench

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
firm feel of the ratchet gearwrench

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.010 
firm feel of the ratchet gearwrench
devised<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:04.040> wider<00:05:04.310> beam<00:05:04.640> for<00:05:05.000> more<00:05:05.300> power<00:05:05.570> with

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
devised a wider beam for more power with

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.250 
devised a wider beam for more power with
less<00:05:06.350> hand<00:05:06.650> stress<00:05:07.930> one<00:05:08.930> thing<00:05:09.050> I<00:05:09.080> like<00:05:09.229> about

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
less hand stress one thing I like about

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.590 
less hand stress one thing I like about
the<00:05:09.530> eggs<00:05:09.680> being<00:05:09.919> with<00:05:10.100> one<00:05:10.340> when<00:05:10.910> I'm<00:05:11.030> loosing

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
the eggs being with one when I'm loosing

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.240 
the eggs being with one when I'm loosing
a<00:05:11.660> bolt<00:05:11.840> actually<00:05:12.260> put<00:05:12.380> my<00:05:12.470> palm<00:05:12.680> into<00:05:12.919> it<00:05:13.100> and

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
a bolt actually put my palm into it and

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.010 
a bolt actually put my palm into it and
I<00:05:13.340> can<00:05:13.520> actually<00:05:13.640> break<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.000> bolt<00:05:14.330> or<00:05:14.540> not

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
I can actually break the bolt or not

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.500 
I can actually break the bolt or not
easier<00:05:15.740> or<00:05:16.160> finding<00:05:16.520> Italian<00:05:16.910> I<00:05:17.000> can<00:05:17.180> grab<00:05:17.360> it

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
easier or finding Italian I can grab it

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.820 
easier or finding Italian I can grab it
so<00:05:17.630> better<00:05:17.840> grab<00:05:18.080> that<00:05:18.110> a<00:05:18.290> normal<00:05:18.470> wrench

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
so better grab that a normal wrench

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.430 
so better grab that a normal wrench
