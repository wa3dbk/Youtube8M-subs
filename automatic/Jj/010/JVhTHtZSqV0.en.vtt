like so followed by the bottom half and

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.330 
like so followed by the bottom half and
the<00:02:38.450> middle<00:02:38.720> part<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:39.080> just<00:02:39.350> slide<00:02:40.130> in<00:02:42.340> we

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
the middle part you just slide in we

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.730 
the middle part you just slide in we
like<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.670> think<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:44.000> as<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.120> bone<00:02:44.510> in<00:02:45.380> between

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
like to think of it as a bone in between

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:59.640 
like to think of it as a bone in between
the<00:02:45.830> two

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.630 

like<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:01.860> what<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:02.950> recursion<00:03:03.250> stopper

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
like so so what the recursion stopper

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.880 
like so so what the recursion stopper
does<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:04.060> on<00:03:04.330> if<00:03:04.629> you<00:03:04.750> guessed<00:03:04.930> night<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.379> your

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
does is on if you guessed night and your

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.130 
does is on if you guessed night and your
line<00:03:06.099> gets<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.580> your<00:03:06.849> line<00:03:06.970> snaps<00:03:07.269> on<00:03:07.840> give<00:03:08.110> a

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
line gets and your line snaps on give a

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.509 
line gets and your line snaps on give a
chance<00:03:08.319> that<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.769> will<00:03:08.830> get<00:03:08.950> your<00:03:09.069> foot<00:03:09.310> back

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
chance that you will get your foot back

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.740 
chance that you will get your foot back
as<00:03:09.730> well<00:03:10.510> as<00:03:11.280> being<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.519> down<00:03:12.790> for<00:03:13.090> some<00:03:13.420> device

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
as well as being a down for some device

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.720 
as well as being a down for some device
which<00:03:14.110> actually<00:03:14.319> helps<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:15.010> think<00:03:15.430> your<00:03:15.580> rig

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
which actually helps you think your rig

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.750 
which actually helps you think your rig
and<00:03:15.909> it<00:03:16.090> keeps<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.390> down<00:03:16.510> there<00:03:17.579> followed<00:03:18.579> by

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
and it keeps it down there followed by

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.580 
and it keeps it down there followed by
the<00:03:18.819> recursion<00:03:19.299> stopper<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:20.110> can<00:03:20.260> connect

port race move onto your hook right at
the<00:04:07.419> bottom<00:04:07.720> I'm<00:04:07.870> you<00:04:08.500> can<00:04:08.620> use<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:08.769> normal<00:04:09.160> book

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
the bottom I'm you can use a normal book

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.870 
the bottom I'm you can use a normal book
or<00:04:09.549> these<00:04:10.540> are<00:04:10.569> two<00:04:11.019> different<00:04:11.230> ISO<00:04:11.739> hooks<00:04:12.040> as

you<00:04:13.000> can<00:04:13.120> see<00:04:13.269> I'm<00:04:13.480> they<00:04:13.900> have<00:04:14.019> no<00:04:14.169> I<00:04:14.349> said<00:04:14.739> you

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
you can see I'm they have no I said you

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.949 
you can see I'm they have no I said you

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
have to snail them on you'll notice that

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.680 
have to snail them on you'll notice that
a<00:04:17.079> lot<00:04:17.349> of<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.829> hooks<00:04:18.669> that<00:04:19.120> may<00:04:19.239> form<00:04:19.450> is<00:04:19.539> a

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
a lot of the hooks that may form is a

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.690 
a lot of the hooks that may form is a
fishing<00:04:19.900> down<00:04:20.019> from<00:04:20.229> overseas<00:04:20.650> they<00:04:21.340> actually

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
fishing down from overseas they actually

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.250 
fishing down from overseas they actually
have<00:04:21.940> no<00:04:22.120> I<00:04:22.150> so<00:04:22.599> you're<00:04:22.720> gonna<00:04:22.810> have<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:22.960> snow

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
have no I so you're gonna have to snow

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.440 
have no I so you're gonna have to snow
on<00:04:23.410> most<00:04:23.710> of<00:04:23.830> them<00:04:23.979> arm<00:04:24.190> occasionally<00:04:25.180> you<00:04:25.300> can

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
on most of them arm occasionally you can

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.350 
on most of them arm occasionally you can
find<00:04:25.690> some<00:04:26.349> hooks<00:04:26.530> with<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.800> I<00:04:26.979> bar<00:04:27.360> the

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
find some hooks with the I bar the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.860 
find some hooks with the I bar the
chances<00:04:28.690> are<00:04:28.750> very<00:04:28.900> slim<00:04:30.660> followed<00:04:31.660> by<00:04:31.810> the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
chances are very slim followed by the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
hook to complete the I say Rick um we

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.659 
hook to complete the I say Rick um we
have<00:04:34.690> your<00:04:34.810> split<00:04:35.020> shots<00:04:35.280> these<00:04:36.280> are<00:04:36.490> rubber

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
have your split shots these are rubber

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.150 
have your split shots these are rubber
created<00:04:37.120> so<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:37.990> can<00:04:38.139> actually<00:04:38.440> undo<00:04:39.010> them

created so you can actually undo them

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.740 
created so you can actually undo them
and<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:39.580> can<00:04:39.760> move<00:04:39.880> them<00:04:40.000> around<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.570> then<00:04:40.690> I

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
and you can move them around and then I

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.480 
and you can move them around and then I
sketch<00:04:40.990> your<00:04:41.110> line<00:04:41.289> it's<00:04:41.710> actually<00:04:41.800> reusable

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
sketch your line it's actually reusable

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.100 
sketch your line it's actually reusable
as<00:04:42.580> well<00:04:43.830> so<00:04:44.830> when<00:04:45.010> matching<00:04:45.870> especiall<00:04:46.870> to

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
as well so when matching especiall to

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.770 
as well so when matching especiall to
your<00:04:47.229> first<00:04:47.440> size<00:04:47.650> as<00:04:47.919> this<00:04:48.610> is<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.849> to<00:04:49.060> be<00:04:49.210> you

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
your first size as this is a to be you

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.719 
your first size as this is a to be you
match<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:49.990> with<00:04:50.199> it<00:04:50.320> to<00:04:50.470> be<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:51.340> what<00:04:51.490> you<00:04:51.550> want

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
match it with it to be so what you want

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.400 
match it with it to be so what you want
to<00:04:51.789> do<00:04:51.910> is<00:04:52.060> you<00:04:52.270> neutralize<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:53.110> balance

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
to do is you neutralize the balance

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.740 
to do is you neutralize the balance
between<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:54.039> float<00:04:54.280> with<00:04:54.940> this<00:04:55.090> with<00:04:55.419> a<00:04:55.449> split

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
between the float with this with a split

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.820 
between the float with this with a split
shot<00:04:55.900> if<00:04:56.500> it<00:04:56.680> was<00:04:56.800> a<00:04:57.010> be<00:04:58.440> four<00:04:59.440> that<00:04:59.500> we<00:04:59.620> fills

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
shot if it was a be four that we fills

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.920 
shot if it was a be four that we fills
that<00:04:59.979> be<00:05:00.190> float<00:05:01.030> then<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.419> match<00:05:01.599> it<00:05:01.750> with<00:05:01.840> a

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
that be float then you match it with a

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.850 
that be float then you match it with a
base<00:05:02.169> pressure

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
base pressure

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.990 
base pressure
I'm<00:05:03.430> also<00:05:04.120> attaching<00:05:04.510> the<00:05:04.690> special<00:05:05.199> on<00:05:05.349> on<00:05:06.000> the

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
I'm also attaching the special on on the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.330 
I'm also attaching the special on on the
leader<00:05:07.599> is<00:05:07.780> also<00:05:08.020> important<00:05:08.469> as<00:05:08.560> where<00:05:09.219> you

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
leader is also important as where you

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.920 
leader is also important as where you
place<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.760> will<00:05:09.940> change<00:05:10.390> the<00:05:10.510> movement<00:05:10.810> of

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
place it will change the movement of

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:11.440 
place it will change the movement of
your<00:05:11.050> bay

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
your bay

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.430

I'm<00:05:12.450> as<00:05:12.750> I<00:05:12.900> say<00:05:13.080> fishing<00:05:13.380> often<00:05:13.620> arm<00:05:14.070> is<00:05:15.440> very

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
I'm as I say fishing often arm is very

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.200 
I'm as I say fishing often arm is very
effective<00:05:16.830> due<00:05:17.130> to<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.310> fact<00:05:17.490> that<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.850> press

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
effective due to the fact that it press

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.710 
effective due to the fact that it press
a<00:05:18.480> natural<00:05:18.990> bait<00:05:19.280> as<00:05:20.280> you<00:05:20.550> as<00:05:21.240> you<00:05:21.419> place<00:05:21.600> your

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
a natural bait as you as you place your

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.360 
a natural bait as you as you place your
special<00:05:22.110> further<00:05:22.320> down<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.740> trace<00:05:22.950> towards
