00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:05.240
 Trainingsauftakt at Sportfreunde Lotte after weeks of recovery and the 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.470
 Football break it finally starts again as Zaungast next to numerous 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.940
 regional media representatives also known locally from the Bundesliga 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.959
 the face 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.439
 Ex-goalkeeper Georg Koch of his career at the Spielvereinigung Erkenschwick 19 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.480
 91 began and then, inter alia, Barnier Bielefeld and the MSV Duisburg 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.640
 Since 2009 Koch is manager and coach at SC Herford and has been successful 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.930
 was in Leubsdorf today not only because he knows coach Maik Walpurgis well and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.760
 already he is not up to this percent previously young man was impelled to watch today 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.469
 so order points in the 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.329
 to a player of Arminia Bielefeld 2 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.510
 Highest marks were filmed &amp; Volkmer informed about him we were able to inform 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.039
 certainly it is not sporty interested in this Friday 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.780
 Of course, the numerous new additions of the club out loud 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.550
 the first time to the photo session had 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.600
 but more on that later than today was finally an exciting for Lotte 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.940
 Day one day of directional decision West or North 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.940
 that was the big question or pushing where to play in the future 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.690
 would be either in the regional league 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.510
 Murder or we stay in the Regionalliga West and we can farm 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.240
 Take influence 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.360
 the protect b values 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.360
 the crucial location percent of TuS Koblenz is classified in it 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.600
 former West 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.189
 Umlauts dfb-Satzung percent are 18 clubs for the Laga Mali Ghana was 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.150
 required 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.450
 while an exception is made only 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.250
 it was a change of statute to be carried out that 19 teams 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.880
 playing there will think that he can not be the case 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.980
 the main work ans what is her case 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.190
 Percent Koblenz gets the license for the West 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.780
 because they are overhanging from northwest on one 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.010
 Coming to the north I find everything liberating 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.240
 For financial and escape plan they had planned for the contents of the West 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.760
 the trips around the costs for the other are as usual 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.580
 in Halle Nord and I think that's going to be a big problem too 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.480
 Principle costs which if you have less minutes there what I turn on from 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.060
 must and around 2 4 and in wishing that will be proteins 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.529
 Overnight toys will stay in Milan until late at night 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:19.249
 he has to say you always said you were through it 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:23.760
 Percent Bayern Munich prove Vinzenz lapses and that's something you always have 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.889
 still good 2 and have our product react accordingly 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:32.529
 Great wait in the Lotter so on message from the DFB and the decision 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.139
 and the first time coming this time 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:39.609
 so you could then focus on football first 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.739
 However, the new players presented themselves at the photo shoot 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.799
 I'm interviewing Minhoff and defenders, and especially on the field 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.189
 can be used for my participation in the 6th 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.879
 Consumers see theirs 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.049
 Amman dpa - in the final sprint to build the game 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.789
 in Compton Hassfurt 2 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:00.929
 can be used with the on the outside positions by the way as 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:04.010
 unfair if anything in Munster London we want 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.889
 Red white Ahlen 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.379
 not at all but you can also be used in the defensive midfield 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.409
 I'm the moment myself from Dario Fo Messe Bolzano Münster 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.429
 and if so, if players 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:19.799
 the storm is one of the problem areas at Sportfreunde Lotte in the past 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:20.550
 season 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.870
 and so you have one in addition to the offensive youngster Maddente 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.739
 well-known retrieved 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.790
 The 32-year-old striker Markus Fischer last season at SV Elversberg 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.969
 Candles Old site back Markus has, of course, take over 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:36.119
 Quality because 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:37.770
 in the offensive area 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.250
 Percent of students in the moor is a very young player from Prussia 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.360
 Münster build the construction monthly and was there for a good conditions 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.990
 We enjoyed a good education at Preußen Münster and we want them 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.409
 continue the natural and hope 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.400
 For the adopted for 2 5 left many young players now in the team of Maik 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.990
 Walpurgis with us 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.980
 which compensate both the storm weakness of last season and the 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.050
 Graduates especially the regulars Timo Kunert and Tobias Willers 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.170
 should compensate 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.520
 Of course we are already very thin now 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.570
 mostly except for Markus Fischer only 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.540
 u23 players brought the boys have to prove themselves first 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:17.049
 have first 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.620
 big challenge ahead of you 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.900
 and you have to wait and see how strong he is there and I hope 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.430
 Of course, this year still on the fact that we still change the other ICE 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.650
 But players can win for us because we have of course 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.819
 with the service providers 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.749
 for important departures but also many players of a wide range of lore ours 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:40.430
 I also want to have brought much higher quality than team on Friday 

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:44.419
 not yet active in training while midfielder Christian Schlösser 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.180
 he was 2 days ago ten days ago 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.379
 her joints break away at the knee 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.060
 For security reasons, NPOs will be out for a few days now 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.710
 to start training on Wednesday 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.780
 also painfully misses the former Kotrainer of Maik Walpurgis 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.969
 Ramiro Almeida r 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.650
 in the list very large gap which is also very difficult to close because 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.800
 he already has a great deal of communication and performance 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.729
 worked to optimize the area and I find it very much a pity that they 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.740
 do not miss coaching team 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.160
 Tomorrow on Saturday is the first test 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.170
 against second division SC Paderborn next week then that 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.340
 Football highlight in Lotte against Scottish record champion Glasgow 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.340
 Rangers the next test matches will show if the sports friends the 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.980
 right squad mix has it together or whether it's on one or the other 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.250
 Position still needed gives Regionalliga state is on the fifth of July and in 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.740
 which regional league the coach would rather compete 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.530
 he makes no secret of that 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.120
 Of course I would rather stay in the West 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.439
 Odin in the Regionalliga Nord we have around with the BOL 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.409
 in Leipzig 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.460
 an association of already two winners there are already two songs 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.110
 Ai quality at players 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.349
 Percent and so far 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.279
 It will certainly be very difficult, but we wait and decide 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.929
 Of course, then we will meet the new challenge whether Regionalliga Nord 

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:12.539
 or Regionalliga West then certainly well prepared
