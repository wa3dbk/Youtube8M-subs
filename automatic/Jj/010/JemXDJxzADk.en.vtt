00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.830 

for<00:00:22.670> me<00:00:22.820> this<00:00:23.030> project<00:00:23.150> has<00:00:23.540> a<00:00:23.570> particular

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
for me this project has a particular

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.410 
for me this project has a particular
poignancy<00:00:24.260> in<00:00:24.920> that<00:00:25.310> I<00:00:25.490> recently<00:00:25.790> acquired<00:00:26.270> a

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
poignancy in that I recently acquired a

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.180 
poignancy in that I recently acquired a
file<00:00:26.570> in<00:00:26.750> one<00:00:27.440> of<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:27.650> things<00:00:27.830> that<00:00:27.950> I<00:00:27.980> love

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
file in one of the things that I love

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.070 
file in one of the things that I love
about<00:00:28.220> it<00:00:28.520> is<00:00:28.610> it's<00:00:28.730> real<00:00:28.940> ability<00:00:29.450> to<00:00:29.660> carry<00:00:29.960> a

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
about it is it's real ability to carry a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.810 
about it is it's real ability to carry a
voice<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:30.920> I<00:00:31.160> think<00:00:31.340> that's<00:00:31.550> one<00:00:31.700> of<00:00:31.730> the

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
voice and I think that's one of the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.640 
voice and I think that's one of the
things<00:00:31.970> that<00:00:32.119> really<00:00:32.239> connects<00:00:32.810> through<00:00:33.410> time

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
things that really connects through time

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.200 
things that really connects through time
and<00:00:33.860> generation<00:00:34.400> is<00:00:34.520> music<00:00:34.880> as<00:00:34.970> a<00:00:35.000> language

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
and generation is music as a language

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.479 
and generation is music as a language
and<00:00:35.690> that's<00:00:36.380> going<00:00:36.559> to<00:00:36.620> be<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:36.739> very<00:00:36.980> central

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
and that's going to be a very central

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.900 
and that's going to be a very central
idea<00:00:38.000> to<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.809> composition<00:00:39.790> she<00:00:40.790> had<00:00:40.879> just

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
idea to the composition she had just

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.240 
idea to the composition she had just
completed<00:00:41.480> this<00:00:41.870> string<00:00:42.530> orchestra<00:00:43.010> piece

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250

for<00:00:43.760> Los<00:00:43.940> Angeles<00:00:44.390> Phil<00:00:44.600> it's<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.350> most

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
for Los Angeles Phil it's the most

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.090 
for Los Angeles Phil it's the most
beautiful<00:00:46.190> music<00:00:46.940> that<00:00:47.480> I'd<00:00:47.870> heard<00:00:48.320> in<00:00:48.500> a<00:00:48.620> long

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
beautiful music that I'd heard in a long

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.040 
beautiful music that I'd heard in a long
time<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:49.699> there<00:00:50.030> was<00:00:50.090> this<00:00:50.270> beautiful<00:00:50.570> kind

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
time and there was this beautiful kind

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.200 
time and there was this beautiful kind
of<00:00:51.110> emotional<00:00:51.620> content<00:00:52.040> to<00:00:52.250> it<00:00:52.370> I<00:00:52.580> emailed<00:00:53.059> her

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
of emotional content to it I emailed her

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.200 
of emotional content to it I emailed her
immediately<00:00:53.629> I<00:00:54.400> think<00:00:55.400> we<00:00:55.580> first<00:00:55.760> met<00:00:56.030> for

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
immediately I think we first met for

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.729 
immediately I think we first met for
coffee<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:56.600> cake<00:00:56.750> followed<00:00:57.140> by<00:00:57.260> ice<00:00:57.409> cream

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
coffee and cake followed by ice cream

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.210 
coffee and cake followed by ice cream
which<00:00:58.670> was<00:00:59.000> also<00:00:59.510> a<00:00:59.839> point<00:01:00.170> of<00:01:00.320> commonality<00:01:00.979> I

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
which was also a point of commonality I

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.649 
which was also a point of commonality I
think<00:01:01.400> we<00:01:01.460> were<00:01:01.550> destined<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.150> collaborate

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
think we were destined to collaborate

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.810 
think we were destined to collaborate
based<00:01:02.989> on<00:01:03.199> this<00:01:03.350> one<00:01:03.920> of<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.250> beautiful

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820

based on this one of the beautiful
things<00:01:04.850> that<00:01:05.000> collaboration<00:01:05.510> is<00:01:05.720> meeting

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
things that collaboration is meeting

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
Jenny talked about this project in the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.280 
Jenny talked about this project in the
context<00:01:32.090> of<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.330> bark<00:01:32.510> double<00:01:32.870> by<00:01:32.990> Lincoln

chetak to be able to take this familiar
vocabulary<00:01:37.040> into<00:01:37.340> this<00:01:37.640> piece<00:01:37.970> it's<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.510> really

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
vocabulary into this piece it's a really

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.360 
vocabulary into this piece it's a really
nice<00:01:38.870> starting<00:01:39.350> point<00:01:39.410> I<00:01:39.800> think<00:01:40.070> you're<00:01:40.250> going

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
nice starting point I think you're going

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.950 
nice starting point I think you're going
to<00:01:40.460> experiment<00:01:40.760> with<00:01:41.060> deconstructing<00:01:41.840> the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
to experiment with deconstructing the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.470 
to experiment with deconstructing the
ensemble<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:42.830> then<00:01:43.400> reconstructing<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:44.330> so

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
ensemble and then reconstructing it so

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.080 
ensemble and then reconstructing it so
finding<00:01:44.870> sort<00:01:45.080> of<00:01:45.140> soloistic<00:01:46.090> dialogues

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
finding sort of soloistic dialogues

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.940 
finding sort of soloistic dialogues
within<00:01:47.480> the<00:01:47.630> ensemble<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.290> then<00:01:48.440> building<00:01:48.830> it

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
within the ensemble and then building it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.350 
within the ensemble and then building it
back<00:01:49.100> up<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:49.310> that<00:01:49.550> we<00:01:49.700> can<00:01:49.790> get<00:01:49.970> lots<00:01:50.150> of

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
back up so that we can get lots of

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.990 
back up so that we can get lots of
really<00:01:50.720> some<00:01:51.590> powerful<00:01:51.950> contrast<00:01:52.640> within<00:01:52.820> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
really some powerful contrast within the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.289 
really some powerful contrast within the
piece

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.499 

we<00:01:55.810> could<00:01:55.990> be<00:01:56.259> on<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.439> same<00:01:56.740> page<00:01:57.609> and<00:01:58.119> very

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
we could be on the same page and very

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.120 
we could be on the same page and very
