00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:05.240
 In January, the presidency was held. 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.000
 It will be opened. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.080
 With the opening of Line 9, up to 1200 won 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.809
 Down 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.650
 The simple picture is because it is back in 30 minutes until the arithmetic 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.909
 Whiskey is not Saemangeum. 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.289
 I caught the ankle of subway line 9 before the opening ceremony last June 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.689
 The kt card recognizing the traffic card is wrong 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.689
 Use some transportation cards to transfer from subway to bus. 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:28.720
 Occation 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.159
 It was a problem that charges were wrong. 

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.230
 The Seoul metropolitan area is connected to the subway line 9 

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:36.490
 For buses 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.120
 There are a variety of birth scenarios and errors in the collection of freight 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.690
 Check if there is a place. 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.240
 Who in Koscom 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.840
 Assuming a dangerous situation 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.770
 It is wrong. Integrate 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.770
 I studied. On the other hand 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.270
 Kim Kyung - Han is a national candidate. 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.500
 Or the subway line 9, which was called the Gold Line and attracted attention, 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.210
 At the end of this twist, 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.740
 The basic fare based on traffic card is the same as existing subway 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.170
 900 won 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.580
 The metropolitan railway fare is also the maximum 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.040
 It's up to 200 won. 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.320
 As long as subway fare is based on the shortest distance 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.790
 As the moving distance to the opening of line 9 becomes shorter, 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.050
 It is. 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.650
 If you go to Gimpo Airport from work, the proverb at 200 won 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.980
 Cheap 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.530
 From Samsung Electronics, it is twice as big as before. 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.230
 You can go down to a thousand won 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.690
 Citizens commuting to Gangbuk from Gangnam in Seoul 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.160
 It looks like you're going to have a lot of travel time. 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.990
 The first express train to skip a few stops 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.170
 because of. 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.120
 If you take the express train, you can do it within 30 minutes from Gangnam to Gimpo Airport. 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.780
 There is 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.440
 I knew him well and he changed a lot. 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.400
 To be able to produce safely, 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.610
 Diversified 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.050
 And 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.220
 There was no anger of the pharmacist society. 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.610
 I put it on the lcd screen in my pocket. 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.610
 It showed the place name associated with the outgoing station. 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:13.539
 Will it be possible next year 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:15.069
 I love you 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.049
 Eldon, 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.329
 should. Because I have not left 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.819
 right. I have a powder room and a diaper changer. 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.159
 Children's toilet 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.159
 The exit map is also available for easy identification 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.119
 Utilizing flight maps 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.489
 On the Coca-Cola side, the color of the vending machine is red 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.849
 Instead it was grayed out. 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.849
 To enhance unity in history 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.209
 Instead of getting rid of the ticket office to save labor costs 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.529
 Train tickets are sold at convenience stores 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.939
 The Seoul Metropolitan City is planning to expand the ecological facilities and cultural space by subway 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.409
 To make history a place for citizens to relax 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:58.339
 Planning 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:59.569
 Dong-A Ilbo is a hope
