00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Spanish researchers find out soup and 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.670
 cause of the train crash on 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.080
 entering santiago de compostela today 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.360
 can get an answer to the main question 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.250
 why did the lineup go with an unacceptably high 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.750
 the speed they have to interrogate 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.340
 machinist who is now in 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.500
 hospital under police guard 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.270
 first track check at the scene of the accident 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.710
 revealed defects about serviceability 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.010
 the locomotive can only be judged 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.660
 after decoding black boxes in direct 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.849
 On air from the scene of our tragedy 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.660
 correspondent anton volsky anton as 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.279
 investigating progress you know 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.020
 here on the train tracks where 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.910
 there was a work disaster not yet 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.559
 over in particular still lies 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.210
 twisted locomotive which else 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.710
 only to be raised and it will be 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.719
 one of the hardest tasks is just 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.910
 because the locomotive is big and heavy 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.039
 Nevertheless, this morning two trains 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.010
 already passed by themselves on the same 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.539
 the path that went and ended 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.730
 tragedy is the journey of finding you 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.030
 crashed here a day and a half ago 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.520
 so the ways are absolutely working 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.500
 absolutely working and not in them 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.719
 became the cause of the disaster now everything 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.430
 focuses on 50 two-year 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.460
 machinist whose name is francisco 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.369
 Francisco Jose Garcon 50 2 year old 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.250
 a man who has been driving trains for 30 years 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.710
 somehow for some reason he broke up 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.780
 This composition is not allowed speed 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.470
 as the newspaper el pais writes today 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.479
 yes employees 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.549
 trustworthy source 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.110
 information here in spain machinists already 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.850
 on the first interrogation which was carried out 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.560
 the hospital confirmed indeed that 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.110
 drove with not acceptable speed to the same 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.479
 it is known that immediately after the disaster he 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.790
 pressed the button to communicate with the dispatchers said 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.220
 what's on this site where the speed is 80 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.290
 kilometers per hour I drive and said in 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.740
 This time, I probably experiencing shock 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.000
 food 180 190 kilometers per hour why he 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.130
 did exactly that way now 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.170
 will have to install the investigators 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.220
 it is known that in March of this year on its 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.350
 Facebook page 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.119
 he already boasted that he broke up 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.710
 locomotive up to 200 kilometers an hour and 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.329
 posted a special photo 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.130
 speedometer on which is really 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.439
 froze speed of 200 kilometers per hour but 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.840
 I wonder what the train that crashed is not 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.630
 is speed it's not a search for truth 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.000
 and you 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.440
 it may just train increased 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.539
 comfort them in technical 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.880
 characteristic locomotives said that 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.440
 its maximum speed is 200 kilometers 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.849
 in an hour that is bragging machinists 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.730
 can be explained by the fact that he 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.760
 dispersed this train max 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.110
 maximum performance why the un 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.750
 acted on so now 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.390
 still unknown by the way is still important 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.440
 moment investigators have established that 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.090
 about a few kilometers to 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.790
 this dangerous section where the road does 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.860
 rotate 90 degrees on the panel 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.420
 devices on the locomotive button lit up 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.489
 warning driver that he 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.650
 goes with increased sleep speed 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.540
 permissible speed and the driver pressed 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.489
 button thus confirming that yes I am 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.440
 I know that I need to slow down but 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.910
 did not slow down why it was done 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.830
 yo just criminal negligence 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.780
 or for some technical reason he 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.220
 I could not slow down this 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.110
 the main question that should be 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.049
 note the investigator since the reasons 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.870
 unknown and the consequences are not yet 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.750
 changed 80 people died almost all 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.420
 they are dangerous more than hundreds suffered 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.010
 Elena yes thank you Anton was live 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.630
 our special correspondent Anton 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.720
 Volsky from the train crash site in 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.720
 spain
