00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
from just the visuals looking much

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.539 
from just the visuals looking much
better<00:01:16.060> than<00:01:16.210> it<00:01:16.270> did<00:01:16.360> on<00:01:16.420> last<00:01:16.960> gen<00:01:17.049> consoles

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
better than it did on last gen consoles

there's a whole lot there's more control
options<00:01:20.289> there<00:01:20.469> so<00:01:20.590> you<00:01:20.649> have<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:21.610> biggest

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
options there so you have the biggest

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.639 
natural you can get around faster and
there's<00:01:40.750> just<00:01:40.929> there's<00:01:41.140> more<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.469> do<00:01:41.619> more

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
there's just there's more to do more

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.440 
there's just there's more to do more
ways<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.189> do<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.340> as<00:01:42.490> opposed<00:01:42.759> to<00:01:42.820> you<00:01:43.179> know

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
ways to do it as opposed to you know

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.569 
ways to do it as opposed to you know
your<00:01:43.840> standard<00:01:44.079> old<00:01:44.439> old<00:01:45.009> school<00:01:45.369> type

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
your standard old old school type

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:46.950 
your standard old old school type
shooter<00:01:45.909> and<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:46.210> know<00:01:46.299> with<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.509> tactical

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
shooter and you know with the tactical

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.569 
shooter and you know with the tactical
edge<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.530> actually<00:01:47.890> brings<00:01:48.009> a<00:01:48.159> whole<00:01:48.340> lot

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
edge this actually brings a whole lot

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:49.800 
edge this actually brings a whole lot
more<00:01:48.759> tactics<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.329> it<00:01:49.390> because<00:01:49.539> you<00:01:49.600> have<00:01:49.689> to

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
more tactics to it because you have to

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.749 
more tactics to it because you have to
take<00:01:49.960> cover<00:01:50.170> figure<00:01:51.100> out<00:01:51.189> your<00:01:51.280> best<00:01:51.429> routes

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
take cover figure out your best routes

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.219 
take cover figure out your best routes
now<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.390> repelling<00:01:52.780> gives<00:01:52.899> you<00:01:52.960> more<00:01:53.049> options

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
now the repelling gives you more options

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.899 
now the repelling gives you more options
on<00:01:53.469> that<00:01:53.679> so<00:01:54.399> there's<00:01:54.549> a<00:01:54.609> whole<00:01:54.759> lot<00:01:54.880> more

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
on that so there's a whole lot more

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.999 
on that so there's a whole lot more
variety<00:01:55.179> there<00:01:55.570> as<00:01:55.689> far<00:01:56.380> as<00:01:56.439> changes<00:01:56.890> between

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
variety there as far as changes between

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.709 
variety there as far as changes between
the<00:01:57.219> ps3<00:01:57.789> version<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.329> other<00:01:58.479> ones

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
the ps3 version and the other ones

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.810 
the ps3 version and the other ones
there's<00:01:59.200> not<00:01:59.380> really<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.679> whole<00:02:00.039> lot<00:02:00.100> aside

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
there's not really a whole lot aside

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.800 
there's not really a whole lot aside
from<00:02:00.909> those<00:02:01.030> additions<00:02:01.509> of<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:02.289> Maps

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
from those additions of the Maps

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.370 
from those additions of the Maps
you<00:02:03.590> can<00:02:03.710> use<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:03.979> sixaxis<00:02:04.369> controller<00:02:05.380> to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
you can use the sixaxis controller to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.309 
you can use the sixaxis controller to
control<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.740> snake<00:02:06.979> ham<00:02:07.220> which<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.450> know<00:02:08.569> you

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
control the snake ham which you know you

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.839 
control the snake ham which you know you
know<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.619> works<00:02:09.890> well<00:02:10.099> but<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.489> know<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.640> can

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
know it works well but you know you can

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.160 
know it works well but you know you can
turn<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.150> off<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.300> go<00:02:11.540> back<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.900> great

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
little disappointing but you know it's

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.570 
little disappointing but you know it's

there it's not quite as it doesn't look
quite<00:02:36.440> as<00:02:36.530> good<00:02:36.650> as<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.920> 360<00:02:37.400> game<00:02:37.519> though

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670

many effects on some things like there's

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.000 
many effects on some things like there's
not<00:02:47.780> as<00:02:47.900> much<00:02:48.019> bloom<00:02:48.290> lighting<00:02:48.590> for<00:02:48.709> instance

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
not as much bloom lighting for instance

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.070 
not as much bloom lighting for instance
which<00:02:49.160> some<00:02:49.370> people<00:02:49.610> like<00:02:49.760> but<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.720> game<00:02:50.870> just

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
which some people like but the game just

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.120 
which some people like but the game just
overall<00:02:51.349> doesn't<00:02:51.590> look<00:02:51.680> quite<00:02:51.830> as<00:02:51.950> sharp

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
overall doesn't look quite as sharp

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.070 
overall doesn't look quite as sharp
still<00:02:52.760> nice<00:02:52.940> looking<00:02:53.239> game<00:02:53.390> but<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:54.049> know

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
still nice looking game but you know

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.449 
still nice looking game but you know
it's<00:02:54.290> not<00:02:54.440> really<00:02:54.590> amazing<00:02:55.010> by<00:02:55.130> any<00:02:55.250> means

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
it's not really amazing by any means

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.520 
it's not really amazing by any means
there's<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.180> couple<00:02:56.360> little<00:02:56.510> weird<00:02:56.870> bugs<00:02:57.170> but

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
there's a couple little weird bugs but

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.990 
there's a couple little weird bugs but
they<00:02:58.220> don't<00:02:58.340> really<00:02:58.459> detract<00:02:58.849> from<00:02:58.880> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
they don't really detract from the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.640 
they don't really detract from the
gameplay<00:02:59.299> too<00:02:59.360> much<00:02:59.630> so<00:02:59.840> you<00:03:00.080> know

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
gameplay too much so you know

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.839 
gameplay too much so you know
technically<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.160> holds<00:03:01.340> up<00:03:01.430> pretty<00:03:01.459> well<00:03:01.640> even

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
technically it holds up pretty well even

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:02.860 
technically it holds up pretty well even
if<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.060> doesn't<00:03:02.269> look<00:03:02.330> quite<00:03:02.420> as<00:03:02.540> good<00:03:02.720> as<00:03:02.780> the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
if it doesn't look quite as good as the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.680 
if it doesn't look quite as good as the
