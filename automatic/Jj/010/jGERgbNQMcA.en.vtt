00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
some new strategy there's a nice

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.169 
some new strategy there's a nice
variation<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.739> moves<00:01:55.979> between<00:01:56.189> combatant

combatant<00:01:57.569> the<00:01:57.750> lineup<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> little<00:01:58.409> bit

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
combatant the lineup is a little bit

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.229 
combatant the lineup is a little bit
small<00:01:58.799> there's<00:01:58.979> only<00:01:59.099> about<00:01:59.280> 18<00:01:59.819> fighters

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239 
small there's only about 18 fighters

fighters that we had in the last game

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.880 
fighters that we had in the last game
that's<00:02:03.899> because<00:02:04.170> there's<00:02:04.380> been<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> lot<00:02:04.860> of

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that's because there's been a lot of

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.889 
that's because there's been a lot of
time<00:02:05.130> balancing<00:02:05.670> these<00:02:05.849> guys<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.479> making

time balancing these guys and making

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.020 
time balancing these guys and making
sure<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.110> they've<00:02:07.380> played<00:02:08.030> differently

fans<00:02:43.230> there's<00:02:43.980> two<00:02:44.160> problems<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.730> come<00:02:45.269> to

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
fans there's two problems that come to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.509 
fans there's two problems that come to
mind<00:02:45.569> number<00:02:46.139> one<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.560> yes<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.430> a

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
mind number one is that yes it is a

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.280 
mind number one is that yes it is a
tactile<00:02:47.940> game<00:02:48.150> it's<00:02:48.420> fast<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.959> it's<00:02:49.019> quick

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
tactile game it's fast and it's quick

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.990 
tactile game it's fast and it's quick
but<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.950> doesn't<00:02:50.250> have<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.370> depth<00:02:50.639> of<00:02:50.760> moves

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
but it doesn't have the depth of moves

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.640 
but it doesn't have the depth of moves
at<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.209> lot<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.599> newer<00:02:51.750> fighters<00:02:52.170> do<00:02:52.290> if<00:02:52.530> you

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
at a lot of the newer fighters do if you

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.860 
at a lot of the newer fighters do if you
look<00:02:52.799> at<00:02:52.950> even<00:02:53.400> budokai<00:02:53.940> from<00:02:54.180> last<00:02:54.359> year<00:02:54.630> it's

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
look at even budokai from last year it's

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.240 
look at even budokai from last year it's
Patrick<00:02:55.290> as<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.500> might<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.769> been<00:02:55.920> there<00:02:56.130> are

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
Patrick as it might have been there are

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.740 
Patrick as it might have been there are
quite<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.819> number<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:57.150> things<00:02:57.389> that<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.569> could

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
quite a number of things that you could

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.059 
quite a number of things that you could
do<00:02:57.870> with<00:02:58.019> your<00:02:58.200> fighters<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:58.829> really

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
do with your fighters that you really

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.920 
do with your fighters that you really
can't<00:02:59.310> do<00:02:59.459> here<00:02:59.819> even<00:03:00.419> if<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.569> can<00:03:00.720> put

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
can't do here even if you can put

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.659 
can't do here even if you can put
compared<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.500> something<00:03:01.680> really<00:03:02.280> new<00:03:02.400> like

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
compared to something really new like

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.479 
compared to something really new like
tekken<00:03:03.389> dark<00:03:03.690> resurrection<00:03:03.930> on<00:03:04.260> PSP<00:03:04.859> then

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
tekken dark resurrection on PSP then

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.979 
tekken dark resurrection on PSP then
you're<00:03:05.639> really<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:05.970> disadvantage<00:03:06.599> because<00:03:06.750> it

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
you're really a disadvantage because it

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.120 
you're really a disadvantage because it
has<00:03:07.109> nowhere<00:03:07.349> near<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.650> moves<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:07.919> have

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
has nowhere near the moves you have

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.830 
has nowhere near the moves you have
there<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.579> comparatively<00:03:08.940> don't<00:03:09.299> expect<00:03:09.690> a

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
there so comparatively don't expect a

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.199 
there so comparatively don't expect a
huge<00:03:10.109> abundance<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.880> fighting<00:03:11.880> maneuvers

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
huge abundance of fighting maneuvers

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.789 
huge abundance of fighting maneuvers
compared<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.690> other<00:03:12.810> games<00:03:13.049> in<00:03:13.169> the<00:03:13.260> genre<00:03:13.290> the

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
compared to other games in the genre the

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.110 
compared to other games in the genre the
second<00:03:14.099> thing<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.370> because<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.730> game<00:03:15.000> is

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
second thing is that because the game is

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.580 
second thing is that because the game is
so<00:03:15.269> fighting<00:03:15.599> focused<00:03:16.169> that<00:03:16.290> there's<00:03:16.440> not<00:03:16.560> a

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
so fighting focused that there's not a

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.589 
so fighting focused that there's not a
lot<00:03:16.769> of<00:03:16.799> modes<00:03:17.069> to<00:03:17.220> choose<00:03:17.280> from<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:18.269> while<00:03:18.419> in

over-the-top<00:04:23.850> production<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:25.000> most

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
over-the-top production that most

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.810 
over-the-top production that most
budokai<00:04:25.750> Tenkaichi<00:04:26.440> games<00:04:26.650> are<00:04:26.889> so<00:04:27.550> because

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
budokai Tenkaichi games are so because

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.490 
budokai Tenkaichi games are so because
of<00:04:28.000> that<00:04:28.150> you're<00:04:28.419> kind<00:04:28.600> of<00:04:28.660> left<00:04:28.900> trying<00:04:29.440> to

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
of that you're kind of left trying to

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.020 
of that you're kind of left trying to
figure<00:04:29.770> out<00:04:29.800> exactly<00:04:30.220> where<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.490> fits<00:04:30.729> and

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
figure out exactly where it fits and

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.090 
figure out exactly where it fits and
that's<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.660> good<00:04:32.229> way<00:04:32.380> to<00:04:32.440> explain<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.919> game

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
that's a good way to explain the game

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.170 
that's a good way to explain the game
really<00:04:33.340> because<00:04:33.639> you're<00:04:33.790> not<00:04:33.910> quite<00:04:34.150> sure

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
really because you're not quite sure

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.760 
really because you're not quite sure
