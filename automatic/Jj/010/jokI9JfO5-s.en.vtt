way<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.639> move<00:00:14.849> forward<00:00:14.910> here<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.289> most

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
way to move forward here is the most

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.170 
way to move forward here is the most
direct<00:00:16.740> path<00:00:16.859> which<00:00:17.340> obviously<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.850> water<00:00:18.000> is

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
direct path which obviously the water is

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.420 
direct path which obviously the water is
taking<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.779> only<00:00:18.930> problem<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.439> it's<00:00:19.590> off<00:00:20.369> a

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
taking the only problem is it's off a

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.269 
taking the only problem is it's off a
cliff<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.689> basically<00:00:22.289> we<00:00:22.920> rigged<00:00:23.070> up<00:00:23.100> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
cliff so basically we rigged up the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.720 
cliff so basically we rigged up the
canoe<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.789> start<00:00:24.510> repelling<00:00:28.519> it<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:29.699> a

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
canoe and start repelling it was a

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.460 
canoe and start repelling it was a
little<00:00:30.000> bit<00:00:30.119> sketchy<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.779> little<00:00:30.960> bit<00:00:31.050> hairy<00:00:31.260> in

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
little bit sketchy a little bit hairy in

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.650 
little bit sketchy a little bit hairy in
