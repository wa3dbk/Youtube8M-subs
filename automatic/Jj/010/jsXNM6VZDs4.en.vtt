different scenario or different things
you<00:04:14.829> have<00:04:14.859> to<00:04:14.979> do<00:04:15.159> but<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.459> idea<00:04:15.759> is<00:04:15.849> kind<00:04:16.209> of

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
you have to do but the idea is kind of

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.279 
you have to do but the idea is kind of
the<00:04:16.479> same<00:04:16.720> really<00:04:18.419> it's<00:04:19.419> it's<00:04:19.779> kind<00:04:19.989> of<00:04:20.049> dull

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
the same really it's it's kind of dull

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.810 
the same really it's it's kind of dull
the<00:04:20.500> graphics<00:04:20.919> are<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.159> high<00:04:21.310> point<00:04:21.609> of<00:04:21.669> the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
the graphics are the high point of the

game
the<00:04:22.850> music<00:04:23.210> may<00:04:23.390> seem<00:04:23.660> nice<00:04:23.930> but<00:04:24.290> after<00:04:24.710> a

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
the music may seem nice but after a

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.860 
the music may seem nice but after a
while<00:04:25.070> you<00:04:25.730> realize<00:04:25.940> that<00:04:26.270> there<00:04:26.390> is<00:04:26.420> actually

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
while you realize that there is actually

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.780 
while you realize that there is actually
only<00:04:26.930> like<00:04:27.260> four<00:04:27.530> or<00:04:27.650> five<00:04:27.680> trucks<00:04:28.190> of<00:04:28.430> music

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
only like four or five trucks of music

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.970 
only like four or five trucks of music
and<00:04:28.940> will<00:04:29.060> probably<00:04:29.390> get<00:04:29.750> on<00:04:29.900> your<00:04:30.080> nerves

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.250 

it's<00:04:33.980> a<00:04:34.070> lot<00:04:34.220> like<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.610> sims<00:04:34.910> but<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.870> sims<00:04:36.080> is

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
it's a lot like the sims but the sims is

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.560 
it's a lot like the sims but the sims is
better<00:04:36.470> in<00:04:36.800> my<00:04:36.980> opinion<00:04:37.100> or<00:04:37.550> actually<00:04:38.300> no<00:04:38.420> it's

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
better in my opinion or actually no it's

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.650 
better in my opinion or actually no it's
more<00:04:38.750> like<00:04:38.900> my<00:04:39.140> sims<00:04:39.880> but<00:04:40.880> like<00:04:41.120> I<00:04:41.210> said<00:04:41.450> in<00:04:41.630> my

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
more like my sims but like I said in my

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.760 
more like my sims but like I said in my
opinion<00:04:42.140> my<00:04:42.410> sims<00:04:42.680> is<00:04:42.860> better<00:04:43.660> so<00:04:44.660> it's<00:04:45.440> still

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
opinion my sims is better so it's still

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.160 
opinion my sims is better so it's still
pretty<00:04:46.040> good<00:04:46.370> for<00:04:46.640> 800<00:04:47.120> points<00:04:47.570> after<00:04:47.720> all<00:04:47.960> my

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
pretty good for 800 points after all my

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.700 
pretty good for 800 points after all my
sims<00:04:48.500> will<00:04:48.770> cost<00:04:49.040> you<00:04:49.310> what<00:04:50.060> $30<00:04:50.780> 35<00:04:51.320> not

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
sims will cost you what $30 35 not

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.940 
sims will cost you what $30 35 not
exactly<00:04:52.130> sure<00:04:52.400> I<00:04:52.670> mean<00:04:53.180> for<00:04:53.390> the<00:04:53.480> DS<00:04:53.630> anyway<00:04:54.080> so

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
exactly sure I mean for the DS anyway so

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.460 
exactly sure I mean for the DS anyway so
it's<00:04:55.490> not<00:04:55.640> that<00:04:55.700> bad<00:04:56.150> but<00:04:56.600> it's<00:04:56.780> it's<00:04:57.050> not<00:04:57.200> that

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
it's not that bad but it's it's not that

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.990 
it's not that bad but it's it's not that
good<00:04:57.680> either<00:04:58.300> I<00:05:00.550> really<00:05:01.550> don't<00:05:01.730> know<00:05:01.850> what

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
good either I really don't know what

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.210 
good either I really don't know what
else<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.240> say<00:05:02.540> so<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:03.860> guess<00:05:04.270> that's<00:05:05.270> about<00:05:05.420> it

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
else to say so I guess that's about it

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.680 
else to say so I guess that's about it
the<00:05:07.220> like<00:05:07.850> I<00:05:07.970> said<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.270> music's<00:05:08.660> nice<00:05:09.070> kind<00:05:10.070> of

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
the like I said the music's nice kind of

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.040 
the like I said the music's nice kind of
except<00:05:11.690> there's<00:05:11.960> like<00:05:12.370> four<00:05:13.370> tracks<00:05:14.050> the

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
except there's like four tracks the

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.320 
except there's like four tracks the
graphics<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.920> graphics<00:05:16.040> are<00:05:16.460> obviously<00:05:16.790> the

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
graphics the graphics are obviously the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.730 
graphics the graphics are obviously the
high<00:05:17.450> point<00:05:17.690> there's<00:05:17.900> a<00:05:17.990> lot<00:05:18.110> of<00:05:18.260> detail<00:05:18.590> in

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
high point there's a lot of detail in

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.650 
high point there's a lot of detail in
the<00:05:18.830> graphics<00:05:19.220> in<00:05:19.370> fact<00:05:19.580> I<00:05:19.700> like<00:05:19.880> them<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:20.120> lot

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
the graphics in fact I like them a lot

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.820 
the graphics in fact I like them a lot
the<00:05:21.290> gameplay<00:05:21.680> could<00:05:22.100> be<00:05:22.400> better<00:05:23.830> and

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
the gameplay could be better and

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.810 
the gameplay could be better and
certainly<00:05:25.190> longer<00:05:27.100> like<00:05:28.100> especially<00:05:28.460> if<00:05:28.700> they

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
certainly longer like especially if they

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.310 
certainly longer like especially if they
actually<00:05:28.970> gave<00:05:29.360> you<00:05:29.510> something<00:05:29.780> else<00:05:30.110> you

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
actually gave you something else you

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.380 
actually gave you something else you
could<00:05:30.470> do<00:05:30.650> after<00:05:30.890> you<00:05:31.190> get<00:05:31.340> your<00:05:31.520> dream<00:05:31.850> job<00:05:31.880> or

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
could do after you get your dream job or

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.260 
could do after you get your dream job or
whatever<00:05:33.310> like<00:05:34.310> for<00:05:34.490> example<00:05:34.820> then<00:05:34.970> it<00:05:35.090> just

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
whatever like for example then it just

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.150 
whatever like for example then it just
says<00:05:35.419> you<00:05:35.840> can<00:05:36.020> still<00:05:36.380> customize<00:05:36.590> your<00:05:37.040> house

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
says you can still customize your house

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:44.350 
says you can still customize your house
or<00:05:37.430> make<00:05:37.550> new<00:05:37.760> friends<00:05:38.590> whoo-hoo<00:05:42.760> yeah<00:05:43.760> it's

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
or make new friends whoo-hoo yeah it's

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.540 
or make new friends whoo-hoo yeah it's
just<00:05:44.510> not<00:05:44.720> too<00:05:44.900> much<00:05:45.110> to<00:05:45.320> do<00:05:45.470> unfortunately

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
just not too much to do unfortunately

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.820 
just not too much to do unfortunately
and<00:05:46.669> so<00:05:48.669> it's<00:05:49.669> I<00:05:50.410> don't<00:05:51.410> know<00:05:51.470> what<00:05:51.620> else<00:05:51.740> to

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
and so it's I don't know what else to

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.620 
and so it's I don't know what else to
say<00:05:52.070> I<00:05:52.100> guess<00:05:52.550> that's<00:05:52.910> just<00:05:53.270> about<00:05:53.450> it<00:05:53.510> for

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
say I guess that's just about it for

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.480 
say I guess that's just about it for
this<00:05:53.840> review<00:05:54.020> so<00:05:54.860> if<00:05:54.919> you<00:05:55.040> liked<00:05:55.220> it<00:05:55.370> please
