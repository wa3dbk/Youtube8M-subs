00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
the black American experience for me it

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.140 
the black American experience for me it

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
is political in certain a certain way

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.540 
is political in certain a certain way
because<00:04:34.419> when<00:04:34.720> you<00:04:34.840> lose<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.260> music<00:04:35.620> you<00:04:36.130> lose
