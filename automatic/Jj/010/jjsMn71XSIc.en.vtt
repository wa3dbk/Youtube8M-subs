like that but no oh we don't I mean we
talked<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.370> through<00:02:19.400> do<00:02:19.760> we<00:02:19.910> fight<00:02:20.180> no<00:02:20.570> not

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
talked it through do we fight no not

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.730 
talked it through do we fight no not
actually<00:02:21.590> not<00:02:21.830> do<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.160> say<00:02:22.400> anything<00:02:23.290> no<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.320> mean

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
actually not do I say anything no I mean

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.110 
actually not do I say anything no I mean
we're<00:02:24.920> usually<00:02:25.040> no<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:26.030> think<00:02:26.210> we're<00:02:26.540> extremely

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
we're usually no I think we're extremely

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.610 
we're usually no I think we're extremely
respectful<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.330> each<00:02:29.360> other<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.900> kind<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.260> we

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
respectful to each other and kind of we

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.050 
respectful to each other and kind of we
listen<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.010> each<00:02:31.130> other<00:02:31.400> we<00:02:31.460> respect<00:02:31.970> each

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
listen to each other we respect each

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.270 
listen to each other we respect each
other's<00:02:32.360> opinion<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.860> know<00:02:33.980> if<00:02:34.100> there's

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
other's opinion so you know if there's

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.880 
other's opinion so you know if there's
something<00:02:34.730> we<00:02:35.230> we<00:02:36.230> would<00:02:36.470> talk<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.860> through

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
something we we would talk it through

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.400 
something we we would talk it through
and<00:02:37.130> it's<00:02:37.490> not<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.420> never<00:02:38.600> gets<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.110> point

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
and it's not it never gets to the point

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.340 
and it's not it never gets to the point
where<00:02:39.820> but<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.030> other<00:02:41.210> thing<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.540> let<00:02:41.870> me<00:02:41.930> put

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
where but the other thing is let me put

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.170 
where but the other thing is let me put
it<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.500> this<00:02:42.650> context<00:02:43.310> because<00:02:43.580> I<00:02:43.610> think<00:02:43.970> it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
it in this context because I think it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.480 
it in this context because I think it
sounds<00:02:44.540> like<00:02:44.930> oh<00:02:45.110> jeez<00:02:45.380> it's<00:02:45.860> like<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.070> fairy

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
sounds like oh jeez it's like a fairy

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.430 
sounds like oh jeez it's like a fairy
tale<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.970> it's<00:02:47.120> it's<00:02:47.360> life<00:02:47.600> it's<00:02:47.870> not<00:02:47.990> it's

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
tale and it's it's life it's not it's

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.710 
tale and it's it's life it's not it's
not<00:02:48.620> necessarily<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.310> fairy<00:02:49.550> tale<00:02:49.760> life<00:02:50.420> has

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
not necessarily a fairy tale life has

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.480 
not necessarily a fairy tale life has
pressures<00:02:51.170> life<00:02:51.380> has<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.920> lot<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.280> challenges

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
pressures life has a lot of challenges

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.910 
pressures life has a lot of challenges
but<00:02:52.960> one<00:02:53.960> thing<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.200> we<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.470> think<00:02:54.650> we<00:02:54.710> both

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
but one thing that we I think we both

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.000 
but one thing that we I think we both
have<00:02:55.670> learned<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.540> through<00:02:57.320> tennis<00:02:57.740> maybe

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
have learned is through tennis maybe

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.590 
have learned is through tennis maybe
through<00:02:58.490> our<00:02:58.640> own<00:02:58.820> experiences<00:02:59.360> through

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
through our own experiences through

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.360 
through our own experiences through
living<00:02:59.810> abroad<00:02:59.960> life<00:03:00.230> is<00:03:00.440> that<00:03:00.950> it's<00:03:01.100> so

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
living abroad life is that it's so

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.390 
living abroad life is that it's so
important<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.090> not<00:03:02.390> react<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:03.980> need<00:03:04.250> to

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
important to not react so you need to

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.730 
important to not react so you need to
give<00:03:04.610> responses<00:03:05.360> not<00:03:05.510> reactions<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:06.590> if

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
give responses not reactions and so if

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.560 
give responses not reactions and so if
there's<00:03:06.920> anything<00:03:07.130> that's<00:03:07.570> that's

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
there's anything that's that's

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.520 
there's anything that's that's
unsettling<00:03:09.460> between<00:03:10.460> us<00:03:10.670> we<00:03:11.450> both<00:03:11.660> show<00:03:12.230> such

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
unsettling between us we both show such

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.040 
unsettling between us we both show such
a<00:03:12.560> discipline<00:03:13.280> in<00:03:13.520> that<00:03:13.670> field<00:03:14.210> and<00:03:14.570> it's<00:03:14.840> so

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
a discipline in that field and it's so

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.650 
a discipline in that field and it's so
crucial<00:03:15.680> when<00:03:16.550> it<00:03:16.640> comes<00:03:16.850> to<00:03:17.090> communication

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
crucial when it comes to communication

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.600 
crucial when it comes to communication
and<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.320> know<00:03:18.410> we're<00:03:18.560> no<00:03:18.709> we're<00:03:19.459> no

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
and you know we're no we're no

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.850 
and you know we're no we're no
psychologist<00:03:20.000> but<00:03:20.709> communication<00:03:21.709> is

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
psychologist but communication is

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.860 
psychologist but communication is
obviously<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.820> big<00:03:23.060> part<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.570> so<00:03:23.690> if<00:03:23.750> you

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
obviously a big part of it so if you

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.540 
obviously a big part of it so if you
have<00:03:23.900> those<00:03:24.170> fundamentals<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:25.070> communicate

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
have those fundamentals to communicate

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.090 
have those fundamentals to communicate
and<00:03:25.760> not<00:03:26.420> sort<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.840> react<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.530> makes<00:03:27.800> a<00:03:27.920> big

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
and not sort of react it makes a big

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.010 
and not sort of react it makes a big
difference<00:03:28.130> so<00:03:28.520> that<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.540> there's<00:03:29.810> not<00:03:29.930> many

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
difference so that and there's not many

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.900 
difference so that and there's not many
intersections<00:03:30.440> where<00:03:30.740> that's<00:03:30.980> needs<00:03:31.610> to<00:03:31.760> be

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
intersections where that's needs to be

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.210 
intersections where that's needs to be
implemented<00:03:32.270> but<00:03:32.930> when<00:03:33.320> you<00:03:33.500> can<00:03:33.709> think<00:03:33.980> of

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
implemented but when you can think of

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.010 
implemented but when you can think of
those<00:03:34.550> times<00:03:34.910> where<00:03:35.209> how<00:03:35.360> do<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:35.540> avoid<00:03:35.810> it

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
those times where how do you avoid it

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.730 
those times where how do you avoid it
those<00:03:36.860> disciplines<00:03:37.400> kick<00:03:37.580> in
