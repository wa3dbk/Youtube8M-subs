cycle<00:01:11.729> there<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.330> plug<00:01:12.630> located<00:01:13.260> down<00:01:13.439> in

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
cycle there is the plug located down in

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.590 
cycle there is the plug located down in
the<00:01:13.650> front<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.280> removes<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.180> plug<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the front here removes the plug the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.210 
the front here removes the plug the
water<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:16.020> drain<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.680> put<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> container

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
water can drain out just put a container

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.399 
water can drain out just put a container
underneath<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.810> doesn't<00:01:19.140> go<00:01:19.229> everywhere

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
