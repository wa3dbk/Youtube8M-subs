Heartbreak<00:01:47.220> Ridge<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.700> was<00:01:47.909> always<00:01:48.180> pretty

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
Heartbreak Ridge it was always pretty

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.310 
Heartbreak Ridge it was always pretty
even<00:01:49.610> Zerg<00:01:50.610> maybe<00:01:51.090> slightly<00:01:51.720> has<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
even Zerg maybe slightly has the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.100 
even Zerg maybe slightly has the
advantage<00:01:52.799> over<00:01:53.009> Protoss<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.540> again<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.990> was

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
advantage over Protoss but again it was

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.929 
advantage over Protoss but again it was
at<00:01:55.229> maybe<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.680> fifty<00:01:56.070> five<00:01:56.250> percent<00:01:56.280> zorg

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
at maybe like fifty five percent zorg

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.120 
at maybe like fifty five percent zorg
wins<00:01:57.149> versus<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:57.899> being<00:01:58.829> something

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
wins versus you know being something

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.679 
wins versus you know being something
like<00:01:59.310> seventy<00:01:59.700> percent<00:01:59.820> of<00:02:00.030> Sun<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.479> so

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
like seventy percent of Sun like that so

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.389 
like seventy percent of Sun like that so
a<00:02:00.899> lot<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.409> people<00:02:01.590> try<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.829> say<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.310> an

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
a lot of people try to say this is an

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.300 
a lot of people try to say this is an
imbalance<00:02:02.549> map<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.270> tend<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.229> disagree<00:02:04.500> with

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
imbalance map I tend to disagree with

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.219 
imbalance map I tend to disagree with
most<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.880> those<00:02:06.000> people<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.540> at<00:02:06.689> least<00:02:06.960> from

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
most of those people just at least from

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.499 
most of those people just at least from
a<00:02:07.350> statistics<00:02:07.890> viewpoint<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.520> map<00:02:08.819> so

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
a statistics viewpoint on this map so

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.540 
a statistics viewpoint on this map so
and<00:02:10.200> certainly<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.679> don't<00:02:10.950> think<00:02:11.099> flash<00:02:11.340> is

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and certainly I don't think flash is

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.090 
and certainly I don't think flash is
going<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.790> any

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
going to have any

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.300 
going to have any
trouble<00:02:12.400> because<00:02:13.180> really<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.810> think<00:02:14.070> flash<00:02:15.070> is

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
trouble because really I think flash is

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.850 
trouble because really I think flash is
imbalanced<00:02:15.610> because<00:02:16.540> he<00:02:17.020> just<00:02:17.260> owns<00:02:17.560> players

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
imbalanced because he just owns players

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.320 
imbalanced because he just owns players
so<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:19.320> think<00:02:20.320> flashes<00:02:20.860> inba<00:02:21.130> but<00:02:21.880> again<00:02:22.090> calm

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
so I think flashes inba but again calm

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.990 
so I think flashes inba but again calm
is<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.570> good<00:02:22.690> player<00:02:22.930> I'm<00:02:23.380> I'm<00:02:24.010> hoping<00:02:24.490> we<00:02:24.850> don't

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
is a good player I'm I'm hoping we don't

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.360 
is a good player I'm I'm hoping we don't
see<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.330> sweep<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.840> really<00:02:26.200> i<00:02:26.230> want<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.680> see<00:02:26.830> see

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
for a more economical build on this map

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.550 
for a more economical build on this map
here<00:03:52.270> this<00:03:52.420> map<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.870> course<00:03:53.050> being<00:03:53.290> fairly

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
here this map of course being fairly

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.790 
here this map of course being fairly
long<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.970> it's<00:03:55.180> it's<00:03:55.450> it's<00:03:56.230> a<00:03:56.500> little<00:03:56.710> bit

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
long so it's it's it's a little bit

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.910 
long so it's it's it's a little bit
harder<00:03:57.100> I<00:03:57.160> found<00:03:57.460> to<00:03:57.640> go<00:03:57.790> more<00:03:58.000> aggressive<00:03:58.450> I<00:03:58.920> I

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
harder I found to go more aggressive I I

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.620 
harder I found to go more aggressive I I
think<00:04:00.400> they're<00:04:00.520> showing<00:04:00.850> that<00:04:00.970> space<00:04:01.330> of<00:04:01.540> the

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
think they're showing that space of the

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.150 
think they're showing that space of the
observer<00:04:01.960> was<00:04:02.080> showing<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.410> possible<00:04:02.890> space

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
observer was showing the possible space

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.910 
observer was showing the possible space
behind<00:04:03.490> the<00:04:04.090> secondary<00:04:04.780> mineral<00:04:05.110> patch<00:04:05.320> one

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
behind the secondary mineral patch one

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.980 
behind the secondary mineral patch one
thing<00:04:06.100> on<00:04:06.220> this<00:04:06.340> map<00:04:06.520> that<00:04:07.300> we<00:04:07.510> haven't<00:04:07.780> seen

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
thing on this map that we haven't seen

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.630 
thing on this map that we haven't seen
used<00:04:08.230> a<00:04:08.410> lot<00:04:08.530> recently<00:04:08.830> but<00:04:09.160> there<00:04:09.490> is<00:04:09.610> that

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
used a lot recently but there is that

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.000 
used a lot recently but there is that
mineral<00:04:10.090> patch<00:04:10.300> that<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.660> can<00:04:10.810> mine<00:04:11.080> out<00:04:11.290> that

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
mineral patch that you can mine out that

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.180 
mineral patch that you can mine out that
is<00:04:12.160> on<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.450> that<00:04:13.450> is<00:04:13.630> behind<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.440> expansion

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
is on the that is behind the expansion

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.130 
is on the that is behind the expansion
so<00:04:15.700> if<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:16.000> other<00:04:16.210> player<00:04:16.390> can<00:04:16.720> mine<00:04:16.870> out<00:04:16.989> that

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
so if the other player can mine out that

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.870 
so if the other player can mine out that
mineral<00:04:17.470> patch<00:04:17.590> oh<00:04:17.770> and<00:04:18.310> they're<00:04:18.460> showing

against<00:05:39.910> calm<00:05:40.060> so<00:05:40.210> if<00:05:40.330> flash<00:05:40.570> wins<00:05:40.930> this<00:05:41.110> next

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
against calm so if flash wins this next

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.550 
against calm so if flash wins this next
game<00:05:41.620> he<00:05:42.430> will<00:05:42.670> be<00:05:42.880> even<00:05:43.120> with<00:05:43.840> the<00:05:43.990> games<00:05:44.230> as

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
far as wins and losses so so that's

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.850
