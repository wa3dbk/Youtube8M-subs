for<00:01:25.229> twitch<00:01:25.439> when<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:25.890> were<00:01:25.979> rumors<00:01:26.310> about

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
twitch being bought by Google I was

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.109 
twitch being bought by Google I was
freaking<00:01:29.189> out<00:01:29.280> because<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.759> knew<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:29.939> it

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
freaking out because you knew that it

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.390 
freaking out because you knew that it
would<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.470> molded<00:01:31.470> up<00:01:31.560> into<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:31.920> awful

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.870 
would be molded up into this awful
YouTube<00:01:33.090> Google+<00:01:33.869> integration<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.610> think

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
YouTube Google+ integration and I think

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.429 
YouTube Google+ integration and I think

is a wholly owned separate subsidiary to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.899 
is a wholly owned separate subsidiary to
which<00:01:46.770> stated<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.159> they<00:01:47.369> are<00:01:47.490> keeping<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.940 
which stated that they are keeping the
same<00:01:48.180> brand<00:01:48.509> office<00:01:49.079> employees<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.829> most

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
same brand office employees and most

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.679 
same brand office employees and most
importantly<00:01:50.460> their<00:01:50.880> independence<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.630> I

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
importantly their independence and I

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.910 
importantly their independence and I
think<00:01:51.869> that's<00:01:52.049> really<00:01:52.350> cool<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.740> think

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
think that's really cool and I think

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.649 
think that's really cool and I think
that<00:01:53.040> shows<00:01:53.340> how<00:01:53.970> their<00:01:54.180> corporate<00:01:54.509> mindset

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
that shows how their corporate mindset

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.899 
that shows how their corporate mindset
is<00:01:55.079> how<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.649> want<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> expand<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.579> they<00:01:56.700> want

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
is how they want to expand but they want

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.639 
is how they want to expand but they want
to<00:01:57.030> keep<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> real<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.079> twitch<00:01:58.320> wants<00:01:58.560> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
to keep it real you know twitch wants to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.959 
to keep it real you know twitch wants to
get<00:01:58.770> bigger<00:01:58.979> you've<00:01:59.219> seen<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.549> you've<00:01:59.670> seen<00:01:59.880> it

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
get bigger you've seen it you've seen it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.789 
get bigger you've seen it you've seen it
grow<00:02:00.180> exponentially<00:02:00.930> at<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.560> really

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
grow exponentially at it in a really

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.350 
grow exponentially at it in a really
short<00:02:01.829> time<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.579> with<00:02:02.729> Amazon<00:02:03.119> they<00:02:03.240> can

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
short time I think with Amazon they can

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.300 
short time I think with Amazon they can
get<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> funding<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.409> infrastructure<00:02:05.009> to

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
get the funding the infrastructure to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.740 
get the funding the infrastructure to
kind<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.700> invent<00:02:06.060> new<00:02:06.210> things<00:02:06.240> new

kind of like invent new things new

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.749

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
around copyright I don't think it's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.600 
around copyright I don't think it's
going<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.709> be<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.890> big<00:02:35.099> deal<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.250> don't<00:02:35.370> think

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
going to be a big deal I don't think

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.430 
going to be a big deal I don't think
it's<00:02:35.730> gonna<00:02:35.819> be<00:02:35.970> as<00:02:36.120> big<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.629> as<00:02:36.750> crushing<00:02:37.260> as

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
it's gonna be as big and as crushing as

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.430 
it's gonna be as big and as crushing as
YouTube<00:02:38.510> but<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.540> do<00:02:39.750> think<00:02:40.019> it's<00:02:40.200> still<00:02:40.349> an

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
YouTube but I do think it's still an

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.479 
YouTube but I do think it's still an
issue<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.769> think<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.040> something<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.370> we

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
issue and I think it's something that we

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.009 
issue and I think it's something that we
should<00:02:41.640> all<00:02:41.790> be<00:02:42.150> aware<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.420> going<00:02:42.599> forward

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
should all be aware of going forward

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.470 
should all be aware of going forward

is<00:02:47.700> still<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:47.970> big<00:02:48.360> company<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.319> now<00:02:49.739> owns

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
is still a big company that now owns

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.490 
is still a big company that now owns
twitch<00:02:50.459> who<00:02:50.970> had<00:02:51.209> humble<00:02:51.599> beginnings<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.200> now

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
twitch who had humble beginnings and now

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.890 
twitch who had humble beginnings and now
they<00:02:52.769> are<00:02:52.950> exponentially<00:02:53.910> growing<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.480> rules

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
they are exponentially growing and rules

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.059 
they are exponentially growing and rules
are<00:02:55.019> gonna<00:02:55.140> have<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.380> change<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:55.860> what<00:02:55.980> does

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
are gonna have to change so what does

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.410 
are gonna have to change so what does
this<00:02:56.160> mean<00:02:56.340> for<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.700> if<00:02:56.880> you're<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.090> twitch

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
this mean for you if you're a twitch

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.330 
this mean for you if you're a twitch
viewer<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.870> think<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.319> means<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.769> maybe<00:02:59.069> we'll

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
viewer I think it means that maybe we'll

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.160 
viewer I think it means that maybe we'll
have<00:02:59.610> better<00:02:59.790> buffer<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.450> stream<00:03:00.720> rates<00:03:00.959> and

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
have better buffer and stream rates and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.229 
have better buffer and stream rates and
stuff<00:03:01.349> like<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.920> better<00:03:02.519> archiving<00:03:03.150> of

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
stuff like that and better archiving of

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.119 
stuff like that and better archiving of
streams<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.660> think<00:03:03.840> overall<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.440> money<00:03:04.920> will

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
streams I think overall the money will

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.890 
streams I think overall the money will
give<00:03:05.310> twitch<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.819> oomph<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.329> really<00:03:06.660> be

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
give twitch the oomph to really be

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.440 
give twitch the oomph to really be
really<00:03:07.709> good<00:03:07.890> not<00:03:08.190> have<00:03:08.400> as<00:03:08.549> many<00:03:08.730> bugs<00:03:08.970> not<00:03:09.209> as

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
really good not have as many bugs not as

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.000 
really good not have as many bugs not as
many<00:03:09.629> kinks<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.079> I'm<00:03:10.410> sure<00:03:10.560> many<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.890> you

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
many kinks that I'm sure many of you

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.680 
many kinks that I'm sure many of you
encounter<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.579> overall<00:03:11.879> just<00:03:11.910> like<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.209> nicer

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
encounter and overall just like a nicer

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.750 
encounter and overall just like a nicer
streamline<00:03:13.319> experience<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.069> that<00:03:14.280> I'm<00:03:14.459> into

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
streamline experience and that I'm into

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.920 
streamline experience and that I'm into
because<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.120> mean<00:03:15.269> look<00:03:15.420> at<00:03:15.510> them<00:03:15.660> they<00:03:15.750> only

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
because I mean look at them they only

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.390 
because I mean look at them they only
just<00:03:16.019> got<00:03:16.440> their<00:03:16.739> together<00:03:16.920> with<00:03:17.280> the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
just got their together with the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.099 
just got their together with the
iPad<00:03:17.790> app<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.090> that's<00:03:18.329> pretty<00:03:18.630> crazy<00:03:18.810> they

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
iPad app and that's pretty crazy they

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.990 
iPad app and that's pretty crazy they
are<00:03:19.139> growing<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.859> they<00:03:20.010> can't<00:03:20.340> keep<00:03:20.459> up<00:03:20.700> but

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
are growing and they can't keep up but

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.849 
are growing and they can't keep up but
now<00:03:21.180> hopefully<00:03:21.450> with<00:03:21.750> Amazon's<00:03:22.139> money<00:03:22.380> they

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
now hopefully with Amazon's money they

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.559 
now hopefully with Amazon's money they
can<00:03:23.069> what<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.280> do<00:03:23.370> maybe<00:03:23.639> see<00:03:23.910> happening<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.389> an

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
can what I do maybe see happening is an

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:25.789 
can what I do maybe see happening is an
expansion<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.200> twitch<00:03:25.410> Partner<00:03:25.769> Program

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
expansion of the twitch Partner Program

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.620 
expansion of the twitch Partner Program
which<00:03:26.280> as<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.639> right<00:03:26.760> now<00:03:26.819> is<00:03:27.090> pretty

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
which as of right now is pretty

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.449 
which as of right now is pretty
exclusive<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.440> think<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.769> might<00:03:28.950> open<00:03:29.099> up<00:03:29.340> a

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
exclusive I think it might open up a

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.129 
exclusive I think it might open up a
little<00:03:29.609> more<00:03:29.700> because<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.180> think<00:03:30.209> Amazon<00:03:30.540> might

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
little more because I think Amazon might

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.839 
little more because I think Amazon might
want<00:03:31.349> to<00:03:31.410> get<00:03:31.530> in<00:03:31.620> on<00:03:31.799> that<00:03:31.829> whole<00:03:32.069> revenue

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
want to get in on that whole revenue

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.789 
want to get in on that whole revenue
generating<00:03:33.359> thing<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:33.810> partnership<00:03:34.440> type<00:03:34.650> of

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
generating thing and partnership type of

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.500

you think Amazon is going to ruin twitch
personally<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.019> don't<00:03:46.169> think<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:46.799> do<00:03:46.950> think

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
personally I don't think so I do think

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.530 
personally I don't think so I do think
in<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.370> long<00:03:47.609> run<00:03:47.639> though<00:03:47.880> we<00:03:48.000> are<00:03:48.150> going<00:03:48.450> to

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
in the long run though we are going to

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.059 
in the long run though we are going to
see<00:03:48.690> big<00:03:48.840> changes<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.319> do<00:03:49.380> think<00:03:49.739> eventually

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
see big changes I do think eventually

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.039 
see big changes I do think eventually
twitch<00:03:50.609> isn't<00:03:50.940> going<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.180> be<00:03:51.299> just<00:03:51.480> for<00:03:51.870> video

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
twitch isn't going to be just for video

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.839 
twitch isn't going to be just for video
games<00:03:52.260> as<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.590> right<00:03:52.680> now<00:03:52.859> it<00:03:53.010> is<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.639> think

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
games as of right now it is and I think

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.039 
games as of right now it is and I think
it<00:03:53.910> will<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.150> for<00:03:54.359> the<00:03:54.480> long<00:03:54.630> term<00:03:54.870> but

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
it will be for the long term but

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.809 
it will be for the long term but
eventually<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.500> think<00:03:55.590> we<00:03:55.799> can<00:03:55.950> see<00:03:56.099> it<00:03:56.190> expand

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
eventually I think we can see it expand

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.129 
eventually I think we can see it expand
to<00:03:56.940> more<00:03:57.120> but<00:03:57.299> seriously<00:03:57.569> let<00:03:57.780> us<00:03:57.900> know<00:03:58.019> what
