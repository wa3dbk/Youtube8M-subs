00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
that's that for that and then obviously

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.029 
that's that for that and then obviously
with<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.820> improve<00:00:48.500> TIE<00:00:49.500> fighter<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.010> have

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
with the improve TIE fighter you have

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.250 
with the improve TIE fighter you have
the<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.329> button<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.840> which<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.289> press<00:00:54.260> and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the the button here which you press and

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.830 
the the button here which you press and
this<00:00:55.860> side<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:58.039> then<00:00:59.039> checks<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> wing<00:01:00.149> like

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
this side and then checks the wing like

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.470 
this side and then checks the wing like
so<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> functions<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.210> it

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
so so that's it for the functions for it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.509 
so so that's it for the functions for it
basically<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.229> I'll<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.409> go<00:01:04.680> through<00:01:04.949> some

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
basically but I'll just go through some

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.179 
basically but I'll just go through some
of<00:01:05.549> flaws<00:01:06.360> I've<00:01:06.630> picked<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
of flaws I've picked up and it's the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.390 
of flaws I've picked up and it's the
opening<00:01:08.700> canopy<00:01:09.150> which<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.810> found<00:01:10.110> which<00:01:11.070> just

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
as you can see you know it's just when

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.380 
as you can see you know it's just when
you<00:01:16.860> open<00:01:17.130> up<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.240> just

lot<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.810> better<00:02:13.470> vehicles<00:02:13.980> out<00:02:14.160> there<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:15.090> I

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
lot of better vehicles out there so I

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.809 
lot of better vehicles out there so I
will<00:02:15.900> probably<00:02:16.140> wait<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.650> these<00:02:16.860> darn<00:02:17.550> cheap

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
will probably wait to these darn cheap

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.449 
will probably wait to these darn cheap
or<00:02:18.030> something<00:02:18.410> because<00:02:19.410> at<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> moment

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
or something because at the moment

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.570 
or something because at the moment
they're<00:02:20.610> not<00:02:20.819> quite<00:02:21.569> expensive<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:23.250> prices

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
they're not quite expensive the prices

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.180 
they're not quite expensive the prices
of<00:02:23.940> locks<00:02:24.150> shot<00:02:24.420> up<00:02:24.540> quite<00:02:24.989> quite<00:02:25.650> high<00:02:25.860> here

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
of locks shot up quite quite high here

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.750 
of locks shot up quite quite high here
in<00:02:26.760> Australia<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:28.099> so<00:02:29.099> as<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.459> see<00:02:29.610> for

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
in Australia so so as you can see for

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.250 
in Australia so so as you can see for
the<00:02:29.849> car<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.330> it's<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.630> dirty<00:02:30.900> white

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
the car of it it's like a dirty white

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.160 
the car of it it's like a dirty white
gray<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.010> with<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> bit<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.300> grey<00:02:33.900> for

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
gray and with a bit of grey for

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.990 
gray and with a bit of grey for
weathering<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.680> stuff<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:38.430> overall

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
weathering and stuff so the overall

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.320 
weathering and stuff so the overall
rating<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:40.049> will<00:02:40.200> give<00:02:40.349> this<00:02:40.500> it's<00:02:40.980> probably

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
rating I will give this it's probably

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.800 
rating I will give this it's probably
maybe<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.480> seven<00:02:42.870> seven<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.590> half

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
maybe a seven seven and a half

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.819 
maybe a seven seven and a half
I'm<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.380> glad<00:02:46.530> I'll<00:02:46.739> pick<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.040> up<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:49.290> I

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
I'm so glad I'll pick that up and but I

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.150 
I'm so glad I'll pick that up and but I
had<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.069> choice<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.579> either<00:02:51.620> getting<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.769> or

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
had a choice of either getting this or

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.850 
had a choice of either getting this or
OB<00:02:53.970> ones<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.510> Delta<00:02:55.079> Starfighter<00:02:55.650> I

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
OB ones and the Delta Starfighter I

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.520 
OB ones and the Delta Starfighter I
think<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.660> I'm<00:02:57.660> probably<00:02:58.140> thinking<00:02:58.470> I

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
think it is and I'm probably thinking I

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.740 
think it is and I'm probably thinking I
should<00:02:58.709> have<00:02:58.799> picked<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.069> up<00:02:59.510> pick<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.690> up

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
should have picked that up pick that up

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.390 
should have picked that up pick that up
first<00:03:01.079> and<00:03:01.380> probably<00:03:01.650> wait<00:03:02.099> a<00:03:02.130> little<00:03:02.250> bit

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
first and probably wait a little bit

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.059 
first and probably wait a little bit
longer<00:03:02.780> when<00:03:03.780> prices<00:03:04.290> for<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:04.620> mine<00:03:04.799> came

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
longer when prices for this mine came

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.720 
longer when prices for this mine came
down<00:03:05.310> but<00:03:06.060> overall<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.959> will<00:03:07.709> that's<00:03:08.069> so<00:03:08.400> that's

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
down but overall I will that's so that's

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.270 
down but overall I will that's so that's
rotten<00:03:09.470> still<00:03:10.470> go<00:03:10.620> out<00:03:10.709> or<00:03:10.799> got<00:03:10.920> up<00:03:11.810> hmm
