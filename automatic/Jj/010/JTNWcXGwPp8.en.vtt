00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
actually get into that with oh nevermind

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.590 
actually get into that with oh nevermind
but<00:00:50.100> yeah<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.579> how<00:00:50.850> scrimmage<00:00:51.239> works<00:00:51.449> you

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
but yeah this is how scrimmage works you

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.930 
but yeah this is how scrimmage works you
just<00:00:51.629> access<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.410> through<00:00:52.620> your<00:00:52.860> f4<00:00:53.370> menu<00:00:53.730> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
just access it through your f4 menu and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.610 
just access it through your f4 menu and
that's<00:00:54.449> pretty<00:00:54.629> much<00:00:54.750> how<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.020> works<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.590> how

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
that's pretty much how it works see how

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.610 
that's pretty much how it works see how
I'm<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.100> kind<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.989> now<00:00:58.590> I

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
I'm just kind of in here and now I

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.889 
I'm just kind of in here and now I
notice<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.340> says<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.149> them<00:01:00.539> I'm

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
notice that it says you and them I'm

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.060 
notice that it says you and them I'm
guessing<00:01:01.289> that's<00:01:01.410> probably<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:01.949> because

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
guessing that's probably just because

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.939 
guessing that's probably just because
there's<00:01:02.550> only<00:01:02.609> me<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.000> him<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.899> team<00:01:04.110> but

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
there's only me and him on the team but

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.820 
there's only me and him on the team but
um<00:01:05.689> that's<00:01:06.689> really<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.350> I'm<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:07.770> to

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
um that's really it so I'm just going to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.039 
um that's really it so I'm just going to
go<00:01:07.890> ahead<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.220> leave<00:01:08.840> because<00:01:09.840> there's

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
go ahead and leave because there's

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.600 
go ahead and leave because there's
really<00:01:10.110> no<00:01:10.380> point<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.860> doing<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.189> match<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.549> I

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
really no point in doing a match that I

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.030 
really no point in doing a match that I
really<00:01:12.240> don't<00:01:12.390> even<00:01:12.510> want<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.740> kind

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
to my friends so let's see I don't I

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.979 
to my friends so let's see I don't I
didn't<00:04:01.230> see<00:04:01.380> any<00:04:01.530> like<00:04:01.799> scrimmage<00:04:02.280> match<00:04:02.489> um

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.720 
didn't see any like scrimmage match um
feat<00:04:03.989> so<00:04:04.290> that's<00:04:04.500> pretty<00:04:04.739> much<00:04:04.829> it<00:04:05.160> in<00:04:05.340> terms

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
feat so that's pretty much it in terms

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.099 
feat so that's pretty much it in terms
of<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.030> scrimmage<00:04:06.389> matches<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.870> can<00:04:06.989> pretty

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
of the scrimmage matches you can pretty

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.509 
of the scrimmage matches you can pretty

much just practice with your friends now
which<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:08.760> pretty<00:04:09.359> awesome<00:04:09.480> in<00:04:09.840> my<00:04:09.959> opinion

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
which is pretty awesome in my opinion

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.830

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
let's see another thing in this is the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.800 
let's see another thing in this is the
base<00:04:13.079> kind<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:14.040> thing<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.489> one<00:04:15.480> thing<00:04:15.510> I

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
base kind of thing and one thing I

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.259 
base kind of thing and one thing I
actually<00:04:15.989> noticed<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.889> in<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.340> f4<00:04:17.849> I'm<00:04:18.150> not

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
actually noticed is in the f4 I'm not

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.610 
actually noticed is in the f4 I'm not
sure<00:04:18.329> if<00:04:18.570> that's<00:04:18.690> new<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.320> don't<00:04:19.470> remember

sure if that's new I don't remember

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.000 
sure if that's new I don't remember
bases<00:04:20.630> being<00:04:21.630> an<00:04:21.810> option<00:04:22.229> in<00:04:22.380> this<00:04:22.500> in<00:04:22.860> this

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
bases being an option in this in this

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.900 
bases being an option in this in this
menu<00:04:23.280> but

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
menu but

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.690

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
base so we can see the new nodes that

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.700 
base so we can see the new nodes that
are<00:04:29.250> available<00:04:29.400> I<00:04:30.050> just<00:04:31.050> made<00:04:31.230> like<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.410> quick
