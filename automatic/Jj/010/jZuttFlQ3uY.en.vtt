in the entire series and you know we

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.259 
in the entire series and you know we
still<00:02:48.680> really<00:02:48.859> know<00:02:49.189> nothing<00:02:49.609> about<00:02:49.909> him<00:02:50.180> and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.569 
we've ever learned we know that he was
an<00:02:53.299> orphan<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.870> oddly<00:02:54.680> enough<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:55.370> most

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
an orphan and oddly enough like most

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.240 
an orphan and oddly enough like most
orphans<00:02:55.970> he's<00:02:56.090> picked<00:02:56.329> up<00:02:56.480> by<00:02:56.629> a<00:02:56.659> nun<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.469> ninja

nun who looks suspiciously like him
which<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:00.829> do<00:03:00.889> think<00:03:01.159> is<00:03:01.250> kind<00:03:01.489> of<00:03:01.609> interesting

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
which I do think is kind of interesting

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.300 
which I do think is kind of interesting
