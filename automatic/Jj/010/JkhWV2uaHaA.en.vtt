yeah<00:01:49.799> your<00:01:50.250> wheels<00:01:50.490> too<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.630> these<00:01:51.750> reasons

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259

alternative<00:01:54.780> seen<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.439> often<00:01:55.770> used<00:01:55.950> because

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
alternative seen is often used because

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.560 
alternative seen is often used because
it's<00:01:56.310> cheap<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.790> maybe<00:01:56.969> because<00:01:57.149> folks<00:01:57.360> want

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
it's cheap and maybe because folks want

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510 
it's cheap and maybe because folks want
to<00:01:57.630> avoid<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.930> whole<00:01:58.079> chloride<00:01:58.649> issue<00:01:58.829> thing

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
to avoid the whole chloride issue thing

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.160 
to avoid the whole chloride issue thing
is<00:01:59.729> salts<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> chemical<00:02:00.570> advantage

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
is salts have a chemical advantage

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.810 
is salts have a chemical advantage
because<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.799> get<00:02:01.920> two<00:02:02.070> or<00:02:02.159> more<00:02:02.310> ions<00:02:02.700> when

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
because you get two or more ions when

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.760 
because you get two or more ions when
they<00:02:02.909> dissolve<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.659> get<00:02:03.840> way<00:02:04.110> more<00:02:04.140> melting

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
they dissolve you get way more melting

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620 
they dissolve you get way more melting
power<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.340> same<00:02:05.610> handful<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.119> de-icer

power for the same handful of de-icer

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.449 
power for the same handful of de-icer
so<00:02:06.990> say<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.200> might<00:02:07.409> be<00:02:07.439> cheap<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.340> to

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
so say it might be cheap but you have to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.949 
so say it might be cheap but you have to
use<00:02:08.550> way<00:02:08.759> more<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.149> stuff<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.810> can

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
use way more the stuff and that can

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:10.910 
use way more the stuff and that can
leave<00:02:10.110> quite<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.530> mess

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920
