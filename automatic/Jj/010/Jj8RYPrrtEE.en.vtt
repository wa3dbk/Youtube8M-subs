bring the awareness of why we have to
fight<00:00:21.930> censorship<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.949> think<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.939> people<00:00:24.090> have

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
fight censorship I think the people have

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.259 
fight censorship I think the people have
take<00:00:25.619> your<00:00:25.830> shoe<00:00:26.039> with<00:00:26.340> some<00:00:26.550> books<00:00:26.789> something

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
take your shoe with some books something

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.700 
take your shoe with some books something
or<00:00:27.390> they're<00:00:27.480> trying<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> protect<00:00:28.320> their<00:00:28.500> kids

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
or they're trying to protect their kids

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.460 
or they're trying to protect their kids
and<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.640> understand<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.390> if<00:00:30.810> your<00:00:31.050> child

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
and I understand that and if your child

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.130 
and I understand that and if your child
wants<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.219> read<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:32.809> whether<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:33.989> been

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
wants to read it but whether it's been

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.630 
wants to read it but whether it's been
banned<00:00:34.350> or<00:00:34.500> not<00:00:34.620> they're<00:00:34.980> going<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.219> read<00:00:35.460> it

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
banned or not they're going to read it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.299 
banned or not they're going to read it
so<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:37.020> would<00:00:37.230> make<00:00:37.260> more<00:00:37.590> sense<00:00:37.649> for<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.250> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
so it would make more sense for you to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.910 
so it would make more sense for you to
read<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:39.360> them<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:39.930> talk<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.680> him<00:00:40.800> about

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
read it with them or talk to him about

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.740 
read it with them or talk to him about
it<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.489> guess<00:00:41.790> that's<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> reasons

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
it I guess that's one of the reasons

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.389 
it I guess that's one of the reasons
that<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.930> keep<00:00:43.079> doing<00:00:43.260> these<00:00:43.530> things<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.129> just

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
that we keep doing these things is just

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.680 
that we keep doing these things is just
so<00:00:44.610> even<00:00:44.910> though<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.210> come<00:00:45.390> under<00:00:45.570> attack

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
so even though you do come under attack

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.279 
so even though you do come under attack
to<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.980> show<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.430> world<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:48.600> show<00:00:48.750> kids<00:00:49.020> that

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
to to show the world to show kids that

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.319 
to to show the world to show kids that
their<00:00:49.649> life<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.160> be<00:00:50.250> reflected<00:00:50.789> too<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.239> it

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
their life can be reflected too and it

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.549 
their life can be reflected too and it
is<00:00:51.420> not<00:00:51.600> something<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.079> we've<00:00:52.260> shunned

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
is not something that as we've shunned

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.709 
is not something that as we've shunned
