00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.079

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.090
 computer does not affect anything you can 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.359

 several things you do not use on the day 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.469
 day and then it frees memory and releases 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.049
 processing of your computer and 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:06.139

 Several several times already and I found 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.260

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:47.629
 very weak but very poor memory 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.159
 even so the program will solve my 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.959
