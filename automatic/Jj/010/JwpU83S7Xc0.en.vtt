become a starter I see little bubbles

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.280 
become a starter I see little bubbles
which<00:00:31.650> may<00:00:32.610> not<00:00:32.640> be<00:00:33.000> seen<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.750> camera

fermentation yet but from all the fact
that<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.399> turned<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.940> up<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.570> vigorously<00:00:46.110> so

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
that I was turned it up so vigorously so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.450 
that I was turned it up so vigorously so
nevertheless<00:00:48.320> I'm<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.770> ahead<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:50.219> my

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
second step as I mentioned yesterday I

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.930 
second step as I mentioned yesterday I
do<00:00:53.430> not<00:00:53.850> wait<00:00:54.710> 48<00:00:55.710> hours<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.610> go<00:00:56.820> ahead

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
do not wait 48 hours I just go ahead

do not wait 48 hours I just go ahead
with<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> second<00:00:57.750> step<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.350> add<00:00:58.879> another
