so<00:04:49.600> first<00:04:50.020> thing<00:04:50.140> you<00:04:50.230> use<00:04:50.350> jawbridge<00:04:50.650> drop

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
so first thing you use jawbridge drop

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.570 
so first thing you use jawbridge drop
both<00:04:51.070> your<00:04:51.310> sails<00:04:52.650> my<00:04:53.650> cell<00:04:53.890> doesn't<00:04:54.070> matter

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
both your sails my cell doesn't matter

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:02.910 
both your sails my cell doesn't matter
my<00:04:55.420> lag<00:04:55.660> boat<00:04:56.400> board<00:05:00.960> try<00:05:01.960> that<00:05:02.110> again<00:05:02.200> I<00:05:02.590> want

my lag boat board try that again I want

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.490 
my lag boat board try that again I want
to<00:05:02.950> hit<00:05:03.130> that<00:05:03.190> like<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.790> front<00:05:04.570> middle<00:05:05.110> of<00:05:05.410> his

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
to hit that like the front middle of his

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.070 
to hit that like the front middle of his
ship<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:06.010> knock<00:05:06.880> him<00:05:07.090> backwards

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
ship and knock him backwards

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.410 
ship and knock him backwards
he<00:05:09.040> doesn't<00:05:09.280> do<00:05:09.400> anything<00:05:09.850> does<00:05:10.000> have<00:05:10.210> to<00:05:10.270> hold

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
far to the other side he needs to turn

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.640 
far to the other side he needs to turn
over<00:05:24.870> top<00:05:25.230> of<00:05:25.260> me

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.909 

all<00:05:32.130> right<00:05:32.280> it's<00:05:32.610> about<00:05:32.729> good<00:05:33.530> I'm<00:05:34.530> going<00:05:34.830> to

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
all right it's about good I'm going to

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.100 
all right it's about good I'm going to
cut<00:05:35.100> my<00:05:35.190> harpoon<00:05:35.520> or<00:05:36.449> just<00:05:36.660> hit<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.960> bottom

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
cut my harpoon or just hit the bottom

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.280 
cut my harpoon or just hit the bottom
and<00:05:37.940> I<00:05:38.940> hit<00:05:39.180> him<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.570> will<00:05:39.990> then<00:05:40.110> immediately

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
and I hit him I will then immediately

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.010 
and I hit him I will then immediately
spawn<00:05:40.889> it's<00:05:41.850> very<00:05:42.120> important<00:05:42.510> you<00:05:42.570> don't<00:05:42.750> hit

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
spawn it's very important you don't hit

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.170 
spawn it's very important you don't hit
him<00:05:43.169> again<00:05:43.979> and<00:05:44.570> he<00:05:45.570> will<00:05:45.690> just<00:05:45.900> blend<00:05:46.590> her

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
him again and he will just blend her

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.510 
him again and he will just blend her
typically<00:05:48.180> that's<00:05:48.479> how<00:05:48.600> it<00:05:48.720> happens

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
typically that's how it happens

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.860 
typically that's how it happens
that's<00:05:50.520> what's<00:05:50.729> not<00:05:50.910> working<00:05:51.180> it<00:05:51.449> looks<00:05:51.630> like

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
that's what's not working it looks like

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.390 
that's what's not working it looks like
oh<00:05:52.760> there<00:05:53.760> he<00:05:53.820> goes

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
oh there he goes

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.560 
oh there he goes
no<00:05:56.400> do<00:05:56.580> some<00:05:56.729> flips<00:05:56.940> eventually<00:05:57.419> we'll

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
no do some flips eventually we'll

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.790 
no do some flips eventually we'll
blender<00:05:57.900> unless<00:05:58.050> unless<00:05:58.320> it<00:05:58.470> hits<00:05:58.590> the<00:05:58.680> bottom

ships<00:06:01.020> can<00:06:01.620> stop<00:06:01.979> this<00:06:02.130> process<00:06:02.690> but<00:06:03.690> it's

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
ships can stop this process but it's

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.159 
ships can stop this process but it's
pretty<00:06:05.340> much<00:06:05.639> yes<00:06:06.330> death<00:06:06.600> there<00:06:06.870> it's<00:06:06.990> there

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
pretty much yes death there it's there

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.050 
pretty much yes death there it's there
and<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:08.190> man<00:06:08.370> we're<00:06:08.580> back<00:06:08.610> to<00:06:08.820> the<00:06:08.910> blender

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
and the man we're back to the blender

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.439 
and the man we're back to the blender
this<00:06:09.750> is<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:09.990> easy<00:06:10.169> way<00:06:10.320> to<00:06:10.410> well<00:06:10.949> been

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
this is the easy way to well been

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:18.050 
this is the easy way to well been
through<00:06:12.449> but<00:06:13.380> it's<00:06:13.740> flying<00:06:16.580> though<00:06:17.580> I<00:06:17.789> think

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
through but it's flying though I think

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.710 
through but it's flying though I think
something<00:06:18.510> went<00:06:18.630> wrong<00:06:20.360> you<00:06:21.360> almost<00:06:21.510> had<00:06:21.690> it

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
something went wrong you almost had it

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.620 
something went wrong you almost had it
must<00:06:21.900> hit<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.080> bomb<00:06:22.289> or<00:06:22.530> something<00:06:23.630> but

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
must hit the bomb or something but

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.229 
must hit the bomb or something but
that's<00:06:24.720> how<00:06:24.900> you<00:06:24.960> do<00:06:25.199> it
