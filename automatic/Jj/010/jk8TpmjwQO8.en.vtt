ever had the pleasure of using it's just
a<00:01:19.680> shame<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.250> console<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.790> plugged<00:01:21.060> into

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
a shame that the console is plugged into

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.179 
a shame that the console is plugged into
in<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> games<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.259> plug<00:01:22.500> into<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.009> are

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
in the games that you plug into that are

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.039 
in the games that you plug into that are
absolutely<00:01:23.430> appalling<00:01:24.090> rubbish<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
absolutely appalling rubbish that you

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.569 
absolutely appalling rubbish that you
wouldn't<00:01:25.290> ever<00:01:25.500> want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.830> play<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:28.460> plug<00:01:29.460> on

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
wouldn't ever want to play the plug on

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.840 
wouldn't ever want to play the plug on
the<00:01:29.729> end<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> multi<00:01:30.780> pin<00:01:31.110> din<00:01:31.500> plug<00:01:32.280> type<00:01:32.640> of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the end is a multi pin din plug type of

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.580 
the end is a multi pin din plug type of
thing<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.299> don't<00:01:33.990> know<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.200> there's<00:01:34.380> any<00:01:34.530> other

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
thing I don't know if there's any other

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.899 
thing I don't know if there's any other
system<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.400> would<00:01:35.520> plug<00:01:35.700> straight

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
system that that would plug straight

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.999 
system that that would plug straight
into<00:01:36.030> I'm<00:01:36.780> certainly<00:01:37.320> not<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> try<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
into I'm certainly not going to try and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.880 
into I'm certainly not going to try and
we<00:01:38.250> rewire<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.509> any<00:01:39.630> other<00:01:39.689> system<00:01:40.079> though

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
we rewire it for any other system though

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.380 
we rewire it for any other system though
I<00:01:40.920> might<00:01:41.250> prefer<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.729> system<00:01:42.060> because<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
I might prefer the system because it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.850 
I might prefer the system because it
probably<00:01:42.689> wouldn't<00:01:43.140> work<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.649> then<00:01:43.829> I

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
probably wouldn't work and then I

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.620 
probably wouldn't work and then I
wouldn't<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.579> joystick<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.119> my<00:01:45.360> grand

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
wouldn't have a joystick for my grand

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.350 
wouldn't have a joystick for my grand
stand<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.310> odd<00:01:47.430> occasion<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:48.060> i<00:01:48.149> might

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
stand on the odd occasion that i might

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.139 
stand on the odd occasion that i might
want<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.689> torture<00:01:49.110> myself<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.970> there

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
want to torture myself with it so there

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.249 
want to torture myself with it so there
you<00:01:51.270> are<00:01:51.299> lovely<00:01:52.079> joystick<00:01:52.880> really<00:01:53.880> i<00:01:54.259> mean

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
you are lovely joystick really i mean

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.219 
you are lovely joystick really i mean
yeah<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:57.210> got<00:01:57.479> some<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> design

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
yeah is it's got some of the design

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.289 
yeah is it's got some of the design
flaws<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.770> atari<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.850> button<00:02:00.270> there

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
flaws of the atari in that button there

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.209 
flaws of the atari in that button there
is<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.899> like<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.409> should<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.649> one<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
is just like you should have one on the
