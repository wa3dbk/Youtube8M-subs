the same thing might have three spring

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.039 
the same thing might have three spring
to<00:01:44.640> actually<00:01:44.850> get<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:45.869> just

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
to actually get one but this one just
