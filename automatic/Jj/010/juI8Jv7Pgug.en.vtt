 I am this is my new 99 and 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.110
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.540
 at sea doctorate in this week will 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.340
 I'll give you some nice chocolate eggs 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.260
 present directly before easter 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.449
 started today with a big one 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.939
 Milk chocolate well chocolate eggs 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.300
 Of course, that's all my thing and also 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.140
 this milder with delicious 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.149
 chocolate buttons so how you can easily 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.149
 in this delicious alpine milk chocolate 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.960
 figure alps here is alpine milk 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.079
 chocolate fig with alpine milk 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.730
 chocolate lenses aha na her son stands 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.430
 has good then it will probably be so one 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.890
 protection with chocolate coins how to easily 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.489
 I can just listen 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.820
 start unpacking this so this egg 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.559
 is one and a half times as big as one 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.229
 surprise egg of ferrero so one 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.810
 kids chocolate no 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:09.240
 and that's how it would look like 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.220
 So now the easter bunny on it 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.810
 in front of it that whole here not here 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.009
 it is too short again 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.729
 and yes, that's about as said 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:28.650
 one and a half times the size of 1 of 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:30.420
 ferrero so it's pretty hard on it 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.299
 it opens but it breaks and here 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.549
 then you see in the chocolate so 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.549
 no figures in it but chocolate 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.119
 so smarties yes and that can be so 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.700
 tastes of course typical milka so 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:53.490
 really delicious milton milka alpenmilk 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:58.979
 chocolate was delicious so this micro 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:02.100
 chocolate is the best ever if 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.960
 these would still have these in it 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.619
 surprise eggs then that would be 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.640
 perfect chocolate surprise egg 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.409
 well shed are also a great 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.909
 Idea and well, in any case, perfect 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:18.849
 Perfectly delicious chocolate I can 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:21.219
 not to heavy and delicious 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.709
 mega chocolates 1 for 99 cents I think 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:26.859
 but it would be quite expensive 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.530
 consider that no figure or nothing to 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:32.379
 Nonetheless, collecting would be nonetheless 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.659
 I just will not browse you but 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.519
 less chocolate brand will be this too 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.010
 clearly love chocolate here again 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.480
 milka-chocolate no for me 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.889
 real enjoyment for me it is now off 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.230
 if the couch is watching football 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.450
 and yes, play with them with this one 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.819
 yes enjoy what chocolate from me 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.819
 but the gap until next time
