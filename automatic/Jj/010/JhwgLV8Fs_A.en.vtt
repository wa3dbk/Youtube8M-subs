 Hello dear viewers in this 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:11.250
 video i want to talk about my experience 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.240
 growing a ciffe he these beautiful flowers 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.869
 made a huge impression on me 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.420
 still in youth well then we only knew 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.970
 Christmas tree and nothing more 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.600
 When I first saw or such 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.170
 flower 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.289
 I was shocked but my staff who 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.599
 in whose office he would not give it to anyone 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.390
 gave a very reverent attitude to that 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.660
 so that only they have a flower and only 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.180
 a few years later a completely different place 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.870
 I was given a few twigs and tachyons and 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:48.190
 I started to grow it nothing complicated 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.850
 there is no semi landing and care night 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.980
 landing if you manage to get 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.260
 any leaflet so-called that 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:02.590
 in fact it does not meddle to my place 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.199
 into the water and all he after a while 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.840
 sprouting the roots you plant only 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.869
 what to consider in this beauty is not me 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.130
 very superficial roots therefore for 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:19.979
 they need Ashka 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:22.930
 large surface area and this one 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.840
 like a seed known Christmas carter or 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.540
 differently exactly called schlumbergera 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.509
 in the following pictures you will see 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.820
 ripsalidopsis and no also not very wide 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:38.860
 common miserable enough 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.200
 many but will come back and just like phil i am 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.829

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.030
 on ensuring good flowering 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.740
 for some time 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.159
 hold them in the cold 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.399
 i am keeping the balcony at a temperature of up to 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.409
 plus five degrees here at this time 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:07.530
 laid flower buds if you 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.640
 will be able to hold in such 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.200
 flower terms 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.940
