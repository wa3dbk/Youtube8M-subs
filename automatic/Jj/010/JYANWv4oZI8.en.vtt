00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that isn't built with any flexibility

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.609 
that isn't built with any flexibility
you<00:01:36.060> obviously<00:01:36.479> don't<00:01:36.509> my<00:01:36.840> arms<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.439> able<00:01:37.560> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you obviously don't my arms be able to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.200 
you obviously don't my arms be able to
get<00:01:37.710> above<00:01:37.950> my<00:01:38.100> head<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.759> different

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
get above my head but in different

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.270 
get above my head but in different
places<00:01:39.630> where<00:01:40.229> people<00:01:40.500> might<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.130> different

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
places where people might be different

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.550 
places where people might be different
sizes<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:41.939> nice<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.540> star's<00:01:42.930> has<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
sizes it's nice that a star's has the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.870 
sizes it's nice that a star's has the
attention<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.920> detail<00:01:43.979> seriously<00:01:44.670> especially

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
attention to detail seriously especially

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.039 
attention to detail seriously especially
through<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> sleeves<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.780> mean<00:01:45.899> there's

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
through the sleeves I mean there's

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.660 
through the sleeves I mean there's
nothing<00:01:46.229> more<00:01:46.590> uncomfortable<00:01:46.979> than<00:01:47.310> leather

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
nothing more uncomfortable than leather

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.280 
nothing more uncomfortable than leather
bunching<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.509> decreasing<00:01:48.930> your<00:01:48.960> house<00:01:49.110> so

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
bunching up and decreasing your house so

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.990 
bunching up and decreasing your house so
you<00:01:49.320> can't<00:01:49.829> move<00:01:50.070> them<00:01:50.250> all<00:01:50.369> without<00:01:50.579> rubbing

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
you can't move them all without rubbing

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.880 
you can't move them all without rubbing
so<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.750> definitely<00:01:51.990> makes<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.409> huge<00:01:52.619> difference

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
so it definitely makes a huge difference

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.679 
so it definitely makes a huge difference
but<00:01:53.220> we'll<00:01:53.399> take<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.729> even<00:01:53.820> further<00:01:53.939> will<00:01:54.570> do

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
but we'll take it even further will do

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.840 
but we'll take it even further will do
