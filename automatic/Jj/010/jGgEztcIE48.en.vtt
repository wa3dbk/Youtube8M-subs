me so that like made sense but maybe

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.719 
me so that like made sense but maybe
maybe<00:05:18.669> they<00:05:18.880> shouldn't<00:05:19.180> even<00:05:19.330> spawn<00:05:19.870> um<00:05:20.729> when

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
maybe they shouldn't even spawn um when

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.219 
maybe they shouldn't even spawn um when
they're<00:05:21.880> open<00:05:22.030> I<00:05:22.360> don't<00:05:22.630> know<00:05:22.690> if<00:05:22.780> that's<00:05:22.990> what

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
they're open I don't know if that's what

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.890 
they're open I don't know if that's what
that<00:05:23.349> means<00:05:23.590> but<00:05:23.919> um<00:05:24.180> either<00:05:25.180> way<00:05:25.479> that's<00:05:25.630> good

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
that means but um either way that's good

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.350 
that means but um either way that's good
and<00:05:26.110> lastly<00:05:26.710> for<00:05:27.010> fixes<00:05:27.430> we<00:05:27.729> have<00:05:27.849> fixed<00:05:28.120> for
