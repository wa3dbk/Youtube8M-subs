00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.879
 hello friends the craft that 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.070
 we will learn to do this time is this 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:15.010
 hello kitty that is made with three clean 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:18.640
 pipes two color white and half one 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.910
 in red we will also occupy scissors 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.800
 glue a gemite to put what 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.330
 is the center of the bun so you guys 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.840
 they want it and we will need 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.360
 also a piece of white cardboard or a 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.969
 thick sheet to be able to draw the eyes 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.039
 with yellow and black marker that 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.109
 we will also need good we are going to 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.760
 begin then we will start with a 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.399
 clean white pipes and the first thing that 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.149
 let's do is let's roll it in 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.149
 its total 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.260
 and we will have stayed like this 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.490
 now let's hit him in this part with 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.490
 little bit of glue 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.640
 the end with very little so that it is 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.800
 subject to this part 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.250
 we press so a little bit so that 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.250
 well fixed 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.670
 since it's stuck we're going to bend it a 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.950
 little bit since the equity face is a 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.170
 little oval 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.360
 A) Yes 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.409
 let's continue doing what they are 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.109
 ears 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.080
 for the ears we are going to cut our 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:46.660
 clean pipes in half 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.740
 so for that we're going to start rolling 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.740
 our clean pipes like that 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.149
 and now we're just going to give you a 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.630
 little here to give it that way 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.939
 that we wear the ear we do not 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.069
 completely triangular since the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:12.300
 orejita goes a little nothing else as well as 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.830
 curved and down here if we oppress you 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.959
 and well look at us we will have been the 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.700
 first ear formed we do the same 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.700
 with the other half of clean pipes 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.300
 now let's do what the bun is 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.980
 for the little bun we will occupy half 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.050
 of clean pipes as I had commented 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.050
 and we're going to fold it in half 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.430
 and we're going to start rolling it 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.770
 now from the other end like this 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.700
 since we have it rolled from both 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.250
 sides what we are going to do is we are going to 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.490
 do this part towards the middle so with 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:15.070
 our nail and this will be the central part 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.070
 of our bun we oppress so 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.739
 and we are going to flatten this part 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.560
 so that it is formed what is this 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.560
 bow curve 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.440
 here we oppress and kurt we see in this 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.940
 here the center of the bun it 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.620
 we make triangular type 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.620
 and the same thing on this other side 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.620
 and well look, we will have been 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.610
 formed what is the little bunny now 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.500
 nothing else we are going to put it together 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.500
 let's put the monkey 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.050
 on this side this is what I put on this 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.450
 side but I think it goes on this other good 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.720
 let's put this this other 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:19.900
 end we put a little bit of glue 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.900
 and we are going to apply it here in the mosque 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.889
 we also put some glue 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.889
 here 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.650
 and we put it so that only the 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:44.169
 little tip behind the bow 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.690
 and nothing else is going to put him 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.690
 glue and place it on this other side 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.560
 let's also put a drop of 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.030
 glue to what is acrylic gemite 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.080
 it will go in the center 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.080
 of the monkey 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.760
 and now nothing else, let's draw what 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.200
 they are the eyes we will make two 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.830
 ovals 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.830
 A) Yes 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:44.440
 we also draw the oval of the nose 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:48.190
 a little bit bigger than the eyes 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.950
 and nothing else with what is the tip of the 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:55.120
 marker we are going to make 6 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.120
 stripes like that 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.610
 that we do not get too thick in size 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.830
 that gives us the same point of the marker 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.460
 is fine and now we're just going to 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.460
 cut them out 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.580
 here previously I already have them 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.069
 trimmed 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.650
 here are my little sticks that are going to do 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.700
 the eyes 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.220
 and the whiskers 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.350
 Now let's paste them with our 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.540
 glue and let's take a pair of tweezers 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.850
 of these that are used for eyebrows and 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.320
 that it is not easier for us to take 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.800
 little ones you need to go the 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.800
 waiting 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.350
 and so our hello would be finished 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.600
 kitty good friends, I hope that this 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.190
 craftsmanship has been to your liking if it was 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.450
 so they like you and see you in the 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.450
 next tutorial see you later
