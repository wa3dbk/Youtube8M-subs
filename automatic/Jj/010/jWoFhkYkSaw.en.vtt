in<00:00:07.770> part<00:00:08.160> one<00:00:08.370> we<00:00:08.400> create<00:00:08.880> an<00:00:09.030> armature<00:00:09.469> now<00:00:10.469> we

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
in part one we create an armature now we

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.530 
in part one we create an armature now we
need<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.889> add<00:00:10.980> form<00:00:11.309> on<00:00:11.580> which<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:12.090> apply<00:00:12.269> our

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
need to add form on which to apply our

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.870 
need to add form on which to apply our
clay<00:00:12.889> we're<00:00:13.889> going<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.160> use<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> hot<00:00:14.610> wire

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
clay we're going to use a hot wire

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.700 
clay we're going to use a hot wire
cutter<00:00:15.210> but<00:00:15.599> we<00:00:15.719> could<00:00:15.870> equally<00:00:16.230> do<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.560> with

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
cutter but we could equally do this with

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.050 
cutter but we could equally do this with
a<00:00:16.740> band<00:00:16.920> saw<00:00:17.310> or<00:00:17.520> even<00:00:17.699> with<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.090> manual<00:00:18.480> so

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
a band saw or even with the manual so

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.550 
a band saw or even with the manual so
we're<00:00:21.060> going<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> cut<00:00:21.480> individual<00:00:22.020> layers<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
we're going to cut individual layers to

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.830 
we're going to cut individual layers to
size<00:00:22.800> which<00:00:23.369> will<00:00:23.609> then<00:00:23.880> glue<00:00:24.330> together<00:00:29.840> this

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
size which will then glue together this

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.810 
size which will then glue together this
is<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> very<00:00:31.289> bottom<00:00:31.679> layer<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.640> see

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
is the very bottom layer and you can see

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.209 
is the very bottom layer and you can see
we<00:00:32.940> could<00:00:33.120> an<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> wheel<00:00:33.750> inserts<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.620> go

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
we could an out the wheel inserts and go

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.340 
we could an out the wheel inserts and go
to<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.460> plan<00:00:35.670> shape<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.719> as<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.050> did<00:00:37.200> with

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to the plan shape just as we did with

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.400 
to the plan shape just as we did with
the<00:00:37.500> armature<00:00:41.450> by<00:00:42.450> using<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.780> template<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.350> the

final overall shape that we're looking
for<00:02:38.110> less<00:02:38.860> about<00:02:39.130> 25<00:02:39.730> mil<00:02:40.030> or<00:02:40.240> 1<00:02:40.420> inch<00:02:40.630> this<00:02:40.930> is

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
for less about 25 mil or 1 inch this is

00:02:41.650 --> 00:03:10.589 
for less about 25 mil or 1 inch this is
the<00:02:41.770> area<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.280> clay<00:02:42.580> will<00:02:42.790> occupy

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.089 

this<00:03:11.599> is<00:03:11.780> now<00:03:11.959> very<00:03:11.989> close<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.830> overall

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
this is now very close to the overall

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.729 
this is now very close to the overall
volume<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.790> we<00:03:13.910> require<00:03:14.239> what's<00:03:15.230> needed<00:03:15.440> now

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
volume that we require what's needed now

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.680 
volume that we require what's needed now
we<00:03:15.800> stride<00:03:16.280> shape<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.209> makes<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.540> very

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
we stride shape to it that makes it very

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:26.050 
we stride shape to it that makes it very
close<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.290> our<00:03:18.379> overall<00:03:18.739> final<00:03:19.310> model<00:03:24.940> we<00:03:25.940> will

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
close to our overall final model we will

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.030 
close to our overall final model we will
do<00:03:26.209> this<00:03:26.390> by<00:03:26.599> making<00:03:26.840> constant<00:03:27.200> reference<00:03:27.860> to

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
do this by making constant reference to

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:40.509 
do this by making constant reference to
our<00:03:28.130> package<00:03:28.489> drawing<00:03:38.860> this<00:03:39.860> is<00:03:40.069> now<00:03:40.220> very

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
our package drawing this is now very

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.780 
our package drawing this is now very
close<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:41.060> our<00:03:41.120> final<00:03:41.599> overall<00:03:41.930> shape<00:03:42.790> all

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
close to our final overall shape all

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.220 
close to our final overall shape all
that<00:03:44.000> needs<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.209> be<00:03:44.269> done<00:03:44.480> now<00:03:44.660> is<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.870> prepare

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
that needs to be done now is to prepare

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.479 
that needs to be done now is to prepare
the<00:03:45.380> surface<00:03:45.590> for<00:03:45.799> clay

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
the surface for clay

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.360 
the surface for clay
we<00:03:47.239> do<00:03:47.390> this<00:03:47.480> by<00:03:47.660> scoring<00:03:48.349> and<00:03:48.530> creating<00:03:49.130> holes

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
we do this by scoring and creating holes

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.589 
we do this by scoring and creating holes
in<00:03:49.549> the<00:03:49.640> surface<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.209> will<00:03:50.360> allow<00:03:50.540> the

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
in the surface that will allow the

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:56.289 
in the surface that will allow the
Claire<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.110> add<00:03:51.200> ear<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.680> foam<00:03:53.140> in<00:03:55.299> part

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
Claire to add ear to the foam in part

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.850 
Claire to add ear to the foam in part
three<00:03:56.599> we'll<00:03:56.989> be<00:03:57.110> looking<00:03:57.230> at<00:03:57.470> how<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:57.620> apply

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
three we'll be looking at how to apply

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:07.350 
three we'll be looking at how to apply
the<00:03:58.160> clay<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:58.700> foam<00:03:58.970> core
