weights heavy and a problem that a lot
of<00:00:41.879> guys<00:00:42.000> encounter<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:43.140> they're

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
of guys encounter is because they're

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.720 
of guys encounter is because they're
tight<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> hips<00:00:43.920> specifically<00:00:44.550> in

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
tight in the hips specifically in

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.920 
tight in the hips specifically in
through<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> posterior<00:00:45.390> chain<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
through the posterior chain the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.310 
through the posterior chain the
hamstrings<00:00:46.910> their<00:00:47.910> back<00:00:48.120> around<00:00:48.510> right<00:00:49.200> at

hamstrings their back around right at

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.840 
hamstrings their back around right at
the<00:00:49.410> very<00:00:49.440> bottom<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.070> that's<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.670> most

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the very bottom and that's the most

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.630 
the very bottom and that's the most
critical<00:00:51.090> point<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.640> flexibility

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
critical point to have that flexibility

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.580 
critical point to have that flexibility
mobility<00:00:53.850> because<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:54.899> your<00:00:55.020> back<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.379> rounded

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
mobility because if your back is rounded

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.410 
mobility because if your back is rounded
you're<00:00:55.949> lifting<00:00:56.100> heavy<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:57.149> going<00:00:57.329> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
you're lifting heavy that's going to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.599 
you're lifting heavy that's going to
cause<00:00:57.660> low<00:00:58.410> back<00:00:58.649> pain<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.430> cause

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
cause low back pain it's going to cause

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.360 
cause low back pain it's going to cause
damage<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.870> vertebrae<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> ligaments

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
damage to the vertebrae to the ligaments

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.969 
damage to the vertebrae to the ligaments
muscle<00:01:02.969> strains<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.570> lot<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.680> different<00:01:04.710> things

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
muscle strains a lot of different things

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.649 
muscle strains a lot of different things
a<00:01:05.280> lot<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.640> different<00:01:05.729> bad<00:01:06.090> things<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.600> happen

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
a lot of different bad things can happen

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.620 
a lot of different bad things can happen
so<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.680> want<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> prevent<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:09.240> air<00:01:09.420> size

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
so we want to prevent that this air size

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.010 
so we want to prevent that this air size
will<00:01:09.810> help<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> do<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.320> okay<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.610> a

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
will help you do that okay so this is a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.330 
will help you do that okay so this is a
really<00:01:13.020> powerful<00:01:13.260> sequence<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.220> do

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
really powerful sequence that you can do

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.490 
really powerful sequence that you can do
not<00:01:14.610> only<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.970> improve<00:01:15.299> flexibility<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.350> also

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
not only to improve flexibility but also

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.520 
not only to improve flexibility but also
strength<00:01:17.180> what<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.270> want<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.570> kick<00:01:19.500> that

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
out got the hamstring stretch what I

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.210 
out got the hamstring stretch what I
want<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.819> do<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:17.940> drive<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.720> heel<00:02:19.020> down<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.650> I

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
want to do is drive that heel down and I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.729 
want to do is drive that heel down and I
slowly<00:02:20.810> contract<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.989> muscle<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.380> don't<00:02:22.560> just

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
slowly contract the muscle I don't just

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.010 
slowly contract the muscle I don't just
all<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.400> sudden<00:02:23.700> jam<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.420> because<00:02:24.959> that's

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
all of a sudden jam it because that's

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.839 
all of a sudden jam it because that's
going<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.319> fire<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.800> stretch<00:02:26.069> reflex<00:02:26.550> that

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
going to fire up a stretch reflex that

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.059 
going to fire up a stretch reflex that
will<00:02:26.970> cause<00:02:27.150> contraction<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.349> hamstring

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
will cause contraction of the hamstring

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.010 
will cause contraction of the hamstring
and<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.760> will<00:02:29.850> prevent<00:02:30.180> now<00:02:30.420> muscle<00:02:30.690> from

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
and it will prevent now muscle from

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.530 
and it will prevent now muscle from
Ashley<00:02:31.500> lengthening<00:02:31.920> properly<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.060> slowly

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
Ashley lengthening properly so I slowly

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.300 
Ashley lengthening properly so I slowly
and<00:02:33.780> gradually<00:02:33.959> increase<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.800> contraction

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
and gradually increase the contraction

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.240 
and gradually increase the contraction
of<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.430> hamstring<00:02:36.380> tell<00:02:37.380> them<00:02:37.500> about<00:02:37.590> eighty

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
of the hamstring tell them about eighty

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.640 
of the hamstring tell them about eighty
percent<00:02:38.370> or<00:02:38.819> so<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.269> then<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:40.080> hold<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.470> there

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
percent or so and then I hold it there

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.770 
percent or so and then I hold it there
for<00:02:40.680> five<00:02:41.130> seconds<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.670> after<00:02:45.030> five<00:02:45.209> seconds

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
for five seconds and after five seconds

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.040 
for five seconds and after five seconds
I<00:02:45.959> relax<00:02:46.500> everything<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.190> then<00:02:48.180> probably

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
I relax everything and then probably

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.960 
I relax everything and then probably
you're<00:02:49.920> probably<00:02:50.190> going<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.519> feel<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.760> little

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
you're probably going to feel a little

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.509 
you're probably going to feel a little
bit<00:02:51.150> looser<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.080> can<00:02:52.170> step<00:02:52.380> back<00:02:52.410> or<00:02:52.920> get

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
bit looser so you can step back or get

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.729 
bit looser so you can step back or get
that<00:02:53.730> foot<00:02:54.060> forward<00:02:54.450> more<00:02:54.660> tilt<00:02:55.350> over<00:02:55.709> a

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
that foot forward more tilt over a

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.550 
that foot forward more tilt over a
little<00:02:55.890> more<00:02:56.069> at<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.250> pelvis<00:02:56.670> at<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.810> hinge

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
little more at the pelvis at the hinge

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.559 
little more at the pelvis at the hinge
of<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.830> pelvis<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.790> increase<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.239> stretch

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
of the pelvis to increase that stretch

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.890 
of the pelvis to increase that stretch
and<00:03:00.840> then<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.080> do<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.260> again<00:03:01.819> contract<00:03:02.900> five

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
and then you do it again contract five

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.930 
and then you do it again contract five
seconds<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.650> then<00:03:04.860> relax<00:03:05.190> for<00:03:05.580> five<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.910> ten

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
seconds and then relax for five to ten

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.509 
seconds and then relax for five to ten
seconds<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.630> go<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:07.230> little<00:03:07.410> bit<00:03:07.590> deeper<00:03:07.769> every

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
seconds and go a little bit deeper every

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.539 
seconds and go a little bit deeper every
time<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.819> relax<00:03:09.180> now<00:03:09.930> one<00:03:10.560> little<00:03:10.680> technique

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
time you relax now one little technique

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.509 
time you relax now one little technique
that<00:03:11.790> I'm<00:03:11.880> going<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.060> show<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:13.010> this<00:03:14.010> week<00:03:14.310> to
