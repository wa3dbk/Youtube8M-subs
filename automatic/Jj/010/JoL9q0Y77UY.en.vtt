00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 I will now tell you how it is 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.519
 in fact , therefore, not all 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.000
 would be politically correct well if 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.849
 without a mat canoe, of course I will try 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.920
 people born in the 20th century from the end of the 20s 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.240
 years and until the early sixties this 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.720
 lost generation 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.750
 they are like dying in a war we 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.779
 all these generations prepared the third 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.869
 the world however did not happen all of ours 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.279
 efforts to dragging heavy loads 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.370
 production three energy I will not drill 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.870
 the hole under the fuses were wasted 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.730
 nothing will remain of us 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.430
 material culture except groot 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.710
 secondary raw materials from the processing of military 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.020
 technology more than two hundred million 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.870
 people born in those years studied and 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.350
 worked for the victory in the coming third 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.050
 world 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.899
 for this industry was scattered 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.090
 Mono ga cities were built in the country 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.820
 Imona village where residents now 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.520
 nothing to do was created by the military 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.949
 towns in which perry nobody live like 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.799
 I happened to you all the ears already 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.170
 probably buzzing that talked about 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.850
 how useful for capitalist 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.140
 economy is spending 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.840
 on the arms race 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.630
 but our socialist economy 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.880
 this race didn't need us all the time 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.740
 caught up with our rivals from nato in 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.680
 late forties was taken 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.780
 ruling at the highest level 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.659
 improving the teaching of accurate 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.540
 science jet aircraft rocket 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.390
 nuclear weapons technology demanded people 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.310
 with deep knowledge was built 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.960
 new building mgu on the Sparrow Hills 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.180
 then Lenin's after the death of Stalin 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.610
 the building revealed a great and terrible 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.450
 Lavrentiy Palych Beria when he pulled for 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.110
 pen at the entrance to the main building 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.670
 a massive door handle pulled away 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.920
 all those who were present in the pants 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.689
 it became warm 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.500
 Lavrenty Pavlovich defuse the situation you 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.170
 think the pen is bad it's me so strong 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.110
 cost the country riveted a weapon and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.420
 produced specialists specialists 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.560
 done in excess with the expectation that 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.620
 they will be an officer 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.080
 for the future great war work for them 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.569
 there was no food required 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.380
 so the main occupation of the Soviet 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.690
 to form 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.280
 there was no science and technology but similar 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.030
 work on collective farms about settings 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.640
 we tolerated it because we knew 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.120
 reserve waiting only for signals to throw 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.950
 across europe to the channel 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.769
 the order was about to come 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.510
 will come we will not fail in vain whether we 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.360
 studied military art could after all 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.880
 tell clearly about the bounce 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.489
 Parthian forces this from ancient history 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.450
 or disappeared Tomsk operation is already from 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:57.569
 great patriotic 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:00.060
 and orders all was not we are all engineers and 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.630
 scientists slowly became super 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.250
 positions Vanka Zhukov and Lomonosov 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.950
 digging a carrot on the collective farm fields we 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.709
 reasoned high matters if 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.650
 returning from the field without removing the padded jacket 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.290
 you run the machine room to give the corrected 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.109
 deck of cards about the whole night 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.209
 means you more lomonosov if 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.900
 hacienda and quiet joys friendly 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.790
 feast 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.390
 then the wave function prevails 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.299
 Vanka Zhukov caught up in the military unit 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.000
 America is very fast mostly in the beginning 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.030
 50s attack of the perfect ussr 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.069
 it was already impossible due to the fact that 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.600
 the ussr was a nuclear weapon the Americans are not 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.880
 could prevent blows on their 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.760
 there was little territory on us 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.100
 our Soviet leadership of the ussr 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.650
 accepted the challenge and became involved in the race 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.139
 weapons means we want to win means 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.989
 still there will be a new victorious war 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:58.560
 I will come rare in Paris and tell someone 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.329
 so politely everything in Perm there 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.230
 play and automatic 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.239
 from the shoulder so elegantly with him that's when I 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.850
 I feel that our life is not in vain 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.920
 generation built on the collective farms and 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.880
 kulman of which we traced 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.310
 contoured scary fabulous monster 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.120
 this story we were born to make come true 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.880
 this is the goal of life for our generations of millions 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.500
 two hundred lives spent on it but still 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.280
 a dozen would add on the battlefields 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.740
 third world and there would be a result 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.420
 mid 70s ssr advantage over 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.280
 block nato was a determining factor 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.310
 the result of a future fight 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.110
 during the war in Europe, the United States did not dare 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.420
 would use nuclear weapons according to our 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.510
 the territories and the european forces were 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.390
 insignificant in the east rose china but 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.540
 then he was still weak war by two 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.870
 Russia did not threaten the front and what's next 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.510
 happened we did not understand the word for 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.700
 the word began some contracts x 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.610
 texts preferred not to popularize 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.010
 so unusual military technical 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.630
 regards they were drawn up for example 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.700
 medium and smaller missile treaty 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.770
 distance has been published well so in 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.110
 Journal Herald and Ministries 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.020
 foreign affairs which was sold in 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.590
 the only kiosks to get from him 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.870
 It was necessary to pass the passage Mida then 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.100
 it turned out that the western border of our forces 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.020
 passes not from the Baltic to the Adriatic but 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.990
 east of the border of Russia what was it 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.030
 before the first section of Poland is no more 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.360
 economic cooperation in which 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.490
 lived about half a billion people and 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.320
 all made even bananas to us now 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.330
 it became necessary to join the world 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.180
 the distribution of labor to seek its own in it 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.060
 place and all places are already taken 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.150
 before as germany true only 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:55.180
 Eastern everyone thought they were lucky to buy 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.340
 our car was the final point 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.280
 delivered at the moment when it began 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.370
 the bombardment of Yugoslavia it broke 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.470
 status quo in europe by political 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.900
 logic existed since the beginning 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.460
 the cold war behind this was supposed to 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.440
 follow the use of nuclear weapons 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.190
 against European NATO member countries 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.350
 it was here that we realized that for 50 years the whole country 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.500
 worked magic too much devil Ivanovich 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.790
 they do not call for victory 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.650
 get me right man 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.390
 talking about how to expand 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.840
 powder gases in a narrow space 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.550
 barrel under the bottom of the bullets and not at all 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.950
 urges to send this trunk on 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.880
 man he says general wiki 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:39.380
 and the physics of the process is this military science 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.990
 science is also a science of shame 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.880
 that with my generation so cost me 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.610
 I know how to shoot how to cut off the head 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.390
 Finally, and this has to do 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.160
 Here is nonsense so you really do not blame me 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.470
 help a veteran, that’s the world’s 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.380
 in the end we gave you the life of those 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.260
 that did not fight really come on my 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.550
 VKontakte site to talk about my blog 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.370
 in social networks 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:07.990
 ask questions answer them 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:11.860
 special long with long release 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.860
 but in general all the best to you
