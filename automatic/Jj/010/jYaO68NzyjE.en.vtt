 10 Things to do night 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.150
 fly dangerously between buildings 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.520
 as it is at night and there is no rule 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.800
 not at all of that if the rules but 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.750
 I'm breaking them I'm flying 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.730
 dangerously between the buildings already 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.350
 that no one notices because the plane 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.490
 It looks transparent at night although it is 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.490
 too red 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.410
 fly a gas station ok now it's from 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.720
 night we have the master plan to fly 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.210
 this gas station with gasoline that 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.770
 usually and good that we can 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.489
 turn on this gasoline we follow 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.460
 firing observe that is egg axis in 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.890
 the balls gas stations while not 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.080
 other countries are selling oil 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.010
 to have your gas done or limit the 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.760
 besides the rat 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.119
 which is not true because the mask 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.920
 take with young people that such my friends 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.409

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.060

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.580

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.710
 you because what will you put me 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.270
 drunk is this movement that makes the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.670
 monkey when drinking the beer instead of the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.830
 beer itself looks horrible that 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.299
 movement and if they tell you everything 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.770

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.590

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.380
 armored 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.119

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.520

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.530
 to the truck to steal your money 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.990

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.130

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.680
 when we took the explosive for 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.250
 light 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.710
 playing soccer ok is at night and it's time to 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.320
 to start the most epic game and 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.630
 legendary in the history of football that 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.600
 has been seen in this gta court 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.979
 Well now I only lack players and 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.989
 a non-uniform ball but good I'll 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.510
 imagine that I have all those things like that 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.459
 I'll start playing alone 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.959

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.780
 that my friend walks because it is night 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.069
 I guess it will not bother you 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.599
 practice a technique that I just 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.799
 learning is to faint people and not 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.379
 worry about him is completely 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:45.730

 stand on the roof of the train 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.319
 because we are getting closer 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.819

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.819
