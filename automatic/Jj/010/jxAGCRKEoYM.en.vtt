serious<00:01:12.689> about<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> science<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.590> wood<00:01:13.830> should

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
serious about the science of wood should

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:24.109 
serious about the science of wood should
tell<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.060> something<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:23.520> reason<00:01:23.729> there<00:01:24.030> are

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
tell you something the reason there are

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.789 
tell you something the reason there are
so<00:01:24.240> many<00:01:24.390> steps<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.049> maintain<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
so many steps is to maintain the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.640 
so many steps is to maintain the
manufacturing<00:01:26.549> standard<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.869> manufacturing

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
manufacturing standard the manufacturing

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.810 
manufacturing standard the manufacturing
process<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.909> smartly<00:01:30.650> figured<00:01:31.650> out<00:01:31.829> like

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
process is so smartly figured out like

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.390 
process is so smartly figured out like
that<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.400> economically

become much greater than that's really
not<00:02:26.200> much<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:26.860> could<00:02:27.160> think<00:02:27.490> of<00:02:27.760> like<00:02:28.260> they

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
not much that I could think of like they

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.240 
not much that I could think of like they
didn't<00:02:29.440> think<00:02:29.530> about<00:02:29.620> that

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
didn't think about that

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.690 
didn't think about that
but<00:02:30.730> yes<00:02:31.060> it's<00:02:31.330> kind<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:31.870> this<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.710> didn't

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
but yes it's kind of like this I didn't

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.010 
but yes it's kind of like this I didn't
find<00:02:34.540> any<00:02:35.160> gaps<00:02:36.160> or<00:02:36.580> loopholes<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.480> I'm<00:02:37.960> a

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
find any gaps or loopholes and I'm a

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.440 
find any gaps or loopholes and I'm a
very<00:02:38.320> skeptic<00:02:38.830> person<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:40.000> I'm<00:02:40.210> always

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
very skeptic person so I'm always

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.430
