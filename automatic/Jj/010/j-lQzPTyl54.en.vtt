00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
about a tablespoon of school glue into a

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:27.850 
about a tablespoon of school glue into a
big<00:01:14.630> bowl<00:01:25.119> then<00:01:26.119> we're<00:01:26.450> gonna<00:01:26.540> pour<00:01:26.900> this

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
big bowl then we're gonna pour this

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.180 
big bowl then we're gonna pour this
solution<00:01:28.660> that<00:01:29.660> we<00:01:29.810> made<00:01:30.050> with<00:01:30.380> borax<00:01:30.649> food

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
solution that we made with borax food

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.670 
solution that we made with borax food
clothing<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.640> water<00:01:31.930> on<00:01:32.930> top<00:01:33.200> of<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.500> glue

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
clothing and water on top of the glue

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:43.410 
clothing and water on top of the glue
and<00:01:37.840> then<00:01:38.840> after<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.320> we're<00:01:40.070> gonna<00:01:40.190> add

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:02:06.600 

a<00:01:43.770> tablespoon<00:01:52.500> cornstarch<00:02:05.250> I'm<00:02:06.250> gonna<00:02:06.460> let

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
a tablespoon cornstarch I'm gonna let

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.630 
a tablespoon cornstarch I'm gonna let
that<00:02:06.759> sit<00:02:07.150> so<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.900> can<00:02:08.080> react<00:02:09.070> a<00:02:09.250> little<00:02:09.520> bit

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
that sit so it can react a little bit

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.080 
that sit so it can react a little bit
we're<00:02:09.850> gonna<00:02:09.910> let<00:02:10.209> it<00:02:10.239> sit<00:02:10.330> for<00:02:10.630> about<00:02:11.850> ten<00:02:12.850> and

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
we're gonna let it sit for about ten and

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.760 
we're gonna let it sit for about ten and
15<00:02:13.569> seconds<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:16.150> that's<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.420> be<00:02:16.570> okay<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.650> then

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
15 seconds so that's to be okay and then

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.840 
15 seconds so that's to be okay and then
we're<00:02:17.950> just<00:02:18.100> gonna<00:02:18.220> start<00:02:18.690> mixing<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:20.140> a

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
we're just gonna start mixing it a

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.330 
we're just gonna start mixing it a
little<00:02:21.850> bit<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:23.530> want<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.860> keep<00:02:24.070> mixing

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
little bit and you want to keep mixing

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.930 
little bit and you want to keep mixing
it<00:02:24.640> until<00:02:24.700> it's<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.720> hard<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.410> we<00:02:26.590> can't<00:02:26.940> mix

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
it until it's so hard that we can't mix

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:36.300 
it until it's so hard that we can't mix
any<00:02:28.180> more<00:02:28.420> together<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.690> now<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.290> wanna<00:02:35.590> roll

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
any more together so now you wanna roll

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.560 
any more together so now you wanna roll
this<00:02:36.640> into<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.150> ball<00:02:37.450> shape<00:02:39.209> it'll<00:02:40.209> be<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.360> little

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
this into a ball shape it'll be a little

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.130 
this into a ball shape it'll be a little
hard<00:02:40.690> at<00:02:41.050> first<00:02:41.080> cause<00:02:41.590> it's<00:02:41.769> kind<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.370> moist

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
hard at first cause it's kind of moist

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.630 
hard at first cause it's kind of moist
to<00:02:44.140> get<00:02:44.260> all<00:02:44.440> your<00:02:44.590> honor<00:02:44.830> out<00:02:45.100> it'll<00:02:45.459> be

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
to get all your honor out it'll be

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.979 
to get all your honor out it'll be
easier<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.120> mold<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:47.860> ball<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.940> once<00:02:52.660> we<00:02:52.810> let

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
easier to mold to a ball so once we let

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.680 
easier to mold to a ball so once we let
it<00:02:53.079> dry<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.470> little<00:02:53.709> bit<00:02:53.950> more<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:55.239> should<00:02:55.540> be

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
it dry a little bit more it should be

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.660 
it dry a little bit more it should be
really<00:02:56.200> really<00:02:56.530> hard<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.100> should<00:02:57.400> be<00:02:57.459> able<00:02:57.549> to

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
really really hard and should be able to

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:06.540 
really really hard and should be able to
bounce<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.239> like<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:59.019> ball

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.449 

so<00:03:07.550> just<00:03:08.360> like<00:03:08.599> many<00:03:08.989> things<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.500> life<00:03:09.530> I<00:03:10.040> had

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
so just like many things in life I had

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.180 
so just like many things in life I had
to<00:03:10.489> do<00:03:10.760> this<00:03:10.940> experiment<00:03:11.390> twice<00:03:12.049> before<00:03:12.890> I<00:03:12.920> was

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
to do this experiment twice before I was

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.390 
to do this experiment twice before I was
able<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.549> get<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:13.909> right<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:15.019> we<00:03:15.709> have<00:03:16.069> to<00:03:16.250> learn

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
able to get it right so we have to learn

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.830 
able to get it right so we have to learn
as<00:03:16.700> people<00:03:17.090> that<00:03:17.239> we<00:03:17.360> are<00:03:17.390> going<00:03:17.599> to<00:03:17.690> make

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
as people that we are going to make

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.869 
as people that we are going to make
mistakes<00:03:18.049> and<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:18.950> we<00:03:19.069> can<00:03:19.250> learn<00:03:19.519> from<00:03:19.730> our

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
mistakes and that we can learn from our

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.610 
mistakes and that we can learn from our
mistakes<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:20.510> get<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.930> results<00:03:21.349> that<00:03:21.410> we

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
mistakes and get the results that we

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.380 
mistakes and get the results that we
want<00:03:21.650> in<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.160> end<00:03:22.310> as<00:03:22.790> long<00:03:22.819> as<00:03:23.120> we<00:03:23.209> have

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
want in the end as long as we have

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.160 
want in the end as long as we have
perseverance

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
perseverance

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.800 
perseverance
so<00:03:24.709> together<00:03:24.890> at<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.519> actus<00:03:25.819> summer<00:03:26.030> camp<00:03:26.330> we

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
so together at the actus summer camp we

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.660 
so together at the actus summer camp we
will<00:03:26.930> be<00:03:27.170> doing<00:03:27.379> experiments<00:03:28.099> like<00:03:28.190> this<00:03:28.370> one

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
will be doing experiments like this one

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.970 
will be doing experiments like this one
and<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.360> might<00:03:29.390> go<00:03:29.750> wrong<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.170> first<00:03:30.410> time<00:03:30.650> but

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
and it might go wrong the first time but

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.770 
and it might go wrong the first time but
it<00:03:31.190> will<00:03:31.280> go<00:03:31.459> right<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.849> second<00:03:32.180> time<00:03:32.209> or<00:03:32.599> the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
it will go right the second time or the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.839 
it will go right the second time or the
