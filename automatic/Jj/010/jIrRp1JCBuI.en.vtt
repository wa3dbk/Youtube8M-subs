00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 Good morning friends and subscribers of 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.799
 youtube thanks to the guys from the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.120
 dotcom chopping have sent us this 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.680
 new smartphone in which we are going to 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.300
 do the unboxing but before we go with 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.300
 the logo and let's start with the video 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.800
 and now what we have here in front is 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.720
 the smart band as you see we are going to uncover 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.730
 the one here comes with a presentation 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.430
 quite simple is like a box of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.890
 crystal but it's really plastic go 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.100
 to take it out is marban from here to give it 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.140
 the main specifications of this 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.540
 device let's put a side to it 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.760
 see what he keeps bringing here in the box 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.370
 how do you see this the charger a charger 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.629
 pretty eye-catching because it 's a charger 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.730
 smart much beyond being with 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.059
 USB port is the connection that brings 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.960
 load what we are going to put it towards a 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.960
 side and see here is the manual there's no 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.790
 more nothing here in the box and I 'm going to 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.769
 show bands more closely now 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.680
 they are totally interchangeable in total 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:02.339
 it would be three bands that brings this 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.799
 device to put them to taste that 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.360
 you want now we are going to make you a 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.250
 approach to this brown to see 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.810
 it's totally fine and these are the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.640
 specifications to start as they 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.470
 I said bring three orange black colors and 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.320
 blue totally free has a 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.670
 oled screen to make it easy and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.979
 visible at the time 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.810
 be doing any kind of 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.509
 Exercises has a diameter of 150 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.970
 millimeters wide x 190 millimeters 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.100
 long as I said is pretty 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.080
 pretty pretty light enough that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.240
 that at the time of the exercise is what 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.060
 more we love it because we do not have to 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.070
 be aware of the weight of the hand of 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.680
 a battery life around 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.110
 of 10 days of use and this is amazing 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.180
 because 10 days of use for me is 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.640
 enough not to worry about being the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.810
 loading at all times has a system of 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.550
 bluetooth that connects with your 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.030
 device indistinctly the 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.549
 platform is submersible up to 10 meters 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.530
 of water for any little thing that 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.539
 people who practice swimming 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.899
 swimming can be used without problems 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.149
 It also has a storage of 15 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.060
 data days this also happens 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.810
 this while it is with your device and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.310
 then delete all the information has 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.170
 a mobile application which where 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.200
 let you keep track of all 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.489
 our exercise data that the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.420
 what are these data I will name 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.400
 so they can see how is simple band 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.319
 the difference this elegant band 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.599
 synchronizes all stats 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.700
 daily achievements wirelessly and 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.800
 automatically with the cell phone or a 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.800
 tablet if you want to use it like this 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.890
 data that it reviews or the monitoring of 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.560
 activities that this does is based on a 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.360
 step counter a counter or a 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.970
 travel distance indicator 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.190
 Burned calories and active minutes 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.350
 where you are doing 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.040
 exercise the monitor that is a monitor or 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:59.180
 LED has a duration to withstand the 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.670
 stronger demands of day to day 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.769
 so now I want to show you this 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.600
 device that far beyond the 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.959
 band is this little thing that we are 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.019
 seeing here that it is totally resistant 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.450
 it gets totally easy it's pretty 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.220
 striking is in fashion I think 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.140
 pretty cute how it looks uncle and a 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.260
 smart charger that does the 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.830
 difference compared to the other sportvan
