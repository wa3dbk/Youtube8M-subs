and then move them to the next spot nice
nifty<00:01:58.460> trick<00:01:59.080> once<00:02:00.080> again<00:02:00.320> when<00:02:00.470> you're

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
nifty trick once again when you're

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.200 
nifty trick once again when you're
actually<00:02:00.920> painting<00:02:01.400> these<00:02:01.490> things<00:02:01.790> don't<00:02:02.060> use

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
actually painting these things don't use

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.870 
actually painting these things don't use
any<00:02:02.390> tools<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.500> want<00:02:03.650> to<00:02:03.980> attempt<00:02:04.850> to

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
any tools that you want to attempt to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.220 
any tools that you want to attempt to
clean<00:02:05.150> afterwards<00:02:05.630> because<00:02:05.810> it's<00:02:05.990> just<00:02:06.140> not

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
clean afterwards because it's just not

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.330 
clean afterwards because it's just not
worth<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:06.800> so<00:02:06.980> get<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.520> brush<00:02:07.790> a<00:02:08.119> roller<00:02:08.840> cage

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340

throw away the bucket you can actually

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.160 
throw away the bucket you can actually
let<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.490> set<00:02:13.700> out<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.360> dry<00:02:14.540> for<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.810> couple<00:02:14.840> days
