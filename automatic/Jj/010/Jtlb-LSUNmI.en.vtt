00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 service group dog eats 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.960
 Welcome to a gamings 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.400
 new value concept for the first time from 11.15 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.340
 At least I see new meadows towing 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.580
 or 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.800
 a combination with the combination 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.180
 looks very good that it is the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.500
 madness we'll take a quick look 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.630
 in the shop the name number to because 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.369
 I 'm not sure anymore that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.880
 again for funny name was exactly clear 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.910
 with the parts of the company with it 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.149
 we have here two models a 357 3 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.010
 with five meters working width and two 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.210
 meter sixty rounded up to three 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.180
 meter and only 35 57 stroked 5 so with 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.809
 then five meters working width costs 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.239
 6860 euro vj need 102 ps and costs 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.480
 the new euro in the daytime and the smaller one 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.039
 brother 26 meters 41 ps are needed 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.770
 So, then, almost everyone creates 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.410
 carrier and then only need five euros 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.789
 to put down pictures and logos in the day 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.920
 Absolutely top from there you can not 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.840
 complain 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.590
 and then look at the model 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.560
 a little closer 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.689
 we have beautiful stickers everywhere 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.210
 of the manufacturer as well as warnings and 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.340
 Other information then we have 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.170
 here are the wall boards which are also great 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.960
 you can not complain 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.930
 the texture to you is the hammer that is 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.340
 monochrome that is not pixelated it 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.530
 completely redone as I do this 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.790
 a 15er describes 15 km h one goes from 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.880
 probably not 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.729
 working speed or at least 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.909
 we drive a bit 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:45.350
 little bit then we have here 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.350
 again to look more closely 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.850
 the corner she looks really damn good 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.689
 so if we look at the textures 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.490
 look and the model and the texture 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.250
 together are really knotty however 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.750
 pull the cylinders to fold 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.350
 really great too 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.819
 saddest here super accurate possible for 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.730
 of course, hook up with the companies 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.750
 can and you have the upper handlebar except you 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.940
 on 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.550
 buddy triangle what it is not so 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.260
 often here in 15 or where they are not like that 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.480
 often used we have here 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.890
 a standard from the standard 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.090
 play the German 6000 7250 ttv try 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.090
 times the big meadow niger 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.410
 or the combination of and 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.700
 Let's have a look 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.890
 but technically I take off 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.200
 can you ever say one it sees 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.390
 very good bed for the whole 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.550
 with moderate actually good 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.110
 speed 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.610
 we'll see if he has a function 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.900
 yes we have the lights on 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.530
 work immediately we also have the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.610
 blinker the function synonymous to better 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.330
 and later states are actually there 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.980
 not at all 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.480
 We lower the corner and what then 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.830
 Of course not noticeable now 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.440
 Usually the corners are relative 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.720
 loosely attached that is the let 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.010
 actually usually one 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.360
 bit in the ground we are pushing 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.380
 So not rigid but they would have to 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.910
 actually a bit back and forth 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.610
 actually do something here as well 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.230
 that 's physically natural in ls 15 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.209
 very very difficult to implement that is 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.250
 They are strong here but I think so 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.100
 not bad at first 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.720
 we do not have animation here 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.739
 but have that particle system here 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.470
 the smoke but as I said here no 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.670
 group animation or other the 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.290
 Work pleasure is really neat 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.239
 with five meters and for such a map we 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.780
 of course also from the ps year a good 100 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.590
 ps loose fits in any case 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.959
 Let's take a look at the here 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.400
 the place where the is docked and 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.940
 Of course, that fits here as well 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.230
 Fist on the eye 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.450
 perfect and therefore also here 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.410
 really five stars for these two 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.799
 this close, we look once briefly in 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.850
 Maybe we'll find the loco this time 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:04.170
 the meadow again looks exactly when we 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.790
 but probably not sure again 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.790
 he will then also find the 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.910
 that will be funny everywhere crown have 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.950
 we crown crown crown crown here again 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.549
 Up here we have it with you too 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.080
 After that, there are no more mistakes here 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.700
 I'll go to the top line for a moment 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.800
 then it pulls once here now 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.280
 top line error free including the 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.639
 morning 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.280
 are from a different model or from 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.139
 the other must be from the agrar of kaka 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.710
 and here from the second one too 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.750
 flawless 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.139
 so that must be why there's indeed 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:43.110
 five stars thank you for the murder 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.120
 the motto and we'll see you again 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.540
 an order in the evening until then friends 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.540
 Hello
