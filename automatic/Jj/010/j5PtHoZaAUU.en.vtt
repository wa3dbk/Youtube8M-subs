00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:11.350
 Here we have the bike for those of 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.760
 position before you finish connecting it 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.699
 what I'm going to do is measure the current 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.580
 to verify effectively that I am 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.410
 circulating 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.900
 maximum 100 thousand jumpers that 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.770
 support the LEDs is how are three 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.770
 series will do 300 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.410
 but I think it's a good opportunity 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.050
 to verify the tensions 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.520
 because good as you have already seen that 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:43.300
 set the stop and the stop will vary a lot 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.360
 intensity for example if I have the light 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.550
 low or high on or if I put the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.550
 turns because I just do not know if the 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.550
 battery is voted or what but there's a lot 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.430
 variation when when I turn on the lights 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.210
 I get off a lot so probably 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.519
 finish putting a voltage regulator 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.560
 as to keep the fixed voltage not 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.780
 be at 9 to 8 volt 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.280
 I'll see that now with the little one if 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.869
 copied therefore the one that I have we are going to 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.950
 verify all tensions 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.950
 here we are going to see 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.740
 to see if I 'm going to pay I 'm going to pay the light 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.409
 we have 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.399
 12 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.399
 well fixed constant 11.59 actually 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.369
 and what I'm going to do is verify all 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.899
 these tensions but with the motorcycle in 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.659
 march with the same lit with the 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.170
 turn rods and then finally we're going to 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.170
 comment it 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.850
 11 comma 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.880
 Fifty-odd on the way down us the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.880
 volume 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.930
 13.7 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.180
 at 13 8 or so you should have 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.270
 some little piquitos but pretty 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.580
 constant 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.090
 now what happens always and now I have the 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.090
 profession 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.860
 we'll see 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.860
 the day 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.980
 low 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.400
 12.3 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.220
 enough and if I also put the shot 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.960
 there are known variations 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.140
 it varies between 23 and more or less 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.099
 and also the brake was squeezed 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.320
 nothing happens 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.370
 definitely 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.370
 live 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.450
 308 would be the normal function 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.450
 now let's measure the current 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.819
 position scenarios
