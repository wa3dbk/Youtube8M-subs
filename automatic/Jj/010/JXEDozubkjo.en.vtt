00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:30.200 
for removal are the same 496 201 740s
and<00:00:26.179> 97<00:00:27.179> -<00:00:27.689> all<00:00:27.899> 3<00:00:28.289> 5<00:00:29.159> 40s<00:00:29.609> as<00:00:29.849> long<00:00:29.999> as<00:00:30.119> i<00:00:30.179> have

the<00:00:30.329> same<00:00:30.630> engine<00:00:31.050> it's<00:00:31.919> the<00:00:32.040> same<00:00:32.279> removal

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the same engine it's the same removal

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
the same engine it's the same removal
process<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.879> obviously<00:00:35.879> the<00:00:36.300> engine<00:00:36.750> is

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
process so obviously the engine is

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.529 
process so obviously the engine is
already<00:00:37.170> out<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.410> car<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.609> we're<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
already out of the car so we're going to

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.540 
already out of the car so we're going to
go<00:00:39.690> ahead<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.039> you're<00:00:41.039> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.219> be<00:00:41.339> able<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.779 
see where the bolts are how they look
and<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.030> forth<00:00:45.359> if<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.170> talk<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.980> any<00:00:47.160> mechanic

one of the worst things they they hate
to<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:51.030> starters<00:00:51.859> because<00:00:52.859> of<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> fact

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
to do is starters because of the fact

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.599 
to do is starters because of the fact
that<00:00:53.429> they're<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.300> deep<00:00:54.539> into<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.960> engine<00:00:55.609> you

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
that they're so deep into the engine you

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.180 
that they're so deep into the engine you
got<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.969> long<00:00:57.179> sockets<00:00:58.039> lots<00:00:59.039> of

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
got to have long sockets lots of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.489 
got to have long sockets lots of
patience<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.019> get<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.379> these

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
patience to get one to get one of these

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:05.299 
patience to get one to get one of these
out<00:01:02.390> we<00:01:03.390> left<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.749> headers<00:01:04.050> all<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.649> the<00:01:05.100> car

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
out we left the headers all on the car

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
so you know exactly where the starter is

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.789 
so you know exactly where the starter is
and<00:01:07.619> how<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.369> looks<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:09.210> relation<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.799> when

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the starter you're going to be looking

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.609 
the starter you're going to be looking
from<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> bottom<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:42.079> ok<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.109> you're<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.469> to

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
from the bottom up ok so you're going to

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.039 
from the bottom up ok so you're going to
see<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:43.950> bolt<00:01:44.189> here<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.609> you'll<00:01:45.509> be<00:01:45.659> lucky<00:01:45.840> if

see one bolt here and you'll be lucky if

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.450 
see one bolt here and you'll be lucky if
you<00:01:46.079> see<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.439> bolt<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.219> is<00:01:47.340> how

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
you see this bolt here but this is how

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.130 
you see this bolt here but this is how
it<00:01:47.609> looks<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.439> we<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:49.710> first<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:51.140> go

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
it looks so what we do first is we go

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.740 
it looks so what we do first is we go
ahead<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.500> loosen<00:01:52.590> these<00:01:52.859> up

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
ahead and loosen these up

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.460 
ahead and loosen these up
I<00:01:56.330> already<00:01:57.330> loosened<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.840> muscle<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.260> okay

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
I already loosened a muscle it okay

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.890 
I already loosened a muscle it okay
there<00:01:58.650> were<00:01:58.710> pretty<00:01:59.070> tight<00:01:59.340> next<00:01:59.910> to<00:02:00.060> muscle

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
there were pretty tight next to muscle

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.710 
there were pretty tight next to muscle
little<00:02:01.140> that's<00:02:02.010> one<00:02:02.250> right<00:02:02.430> there<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.660> is

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
little that's one right there this is

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.800 
little that's one right there this is
another<00:02:04.170> one<00:02:04.410> right<00:02:04.620> here

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
another one right here

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.889 
another one right here
and<00:02:06.810> again<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.260> starter<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:08.660> think<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:09.780> all

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
and again the starter I think we all

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.810 
and again the starter I think we all
know<00:02:10.140> how<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.680> feels<00:02:11.040> when<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.370> starter<00:02:11.670> goes

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
know how it feels when the starter goes

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.720 
know how it feels when the starter goes
out<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.690> get<00:02:12.810> into<00:02:13.080> your<00:02:13.170> car<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.710> leave<00:02:14.550> for

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
out you get into your car you leave for

looking<00:02:35.850> up<00:02:38.540> there's<00:02:39.540> usually<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.900> cover<00:02:40.230> here

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
looking up there's usually a cover here

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.440 
looking up there's usually a cover here
I<00:02:41.600> already<00:02:42.600> removed<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:43.020> but<00:02:43.970> usually<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.180> cover

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
I already removed it but usually a cover

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.860 
I already removed it but usually a cover
here<00:02:46.040> let<00:02:47.040> me<00:02:47.070> see<00:02:48.890> okay<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.430> see<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:51.510> is

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
here let me see okay you see this is

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.770 
here let me see okay you see this is
usually<00:02:52.350> here<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.820> guess<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.120> protects<00:02:54.630> the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
usually here and I guess it protects the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.699 
usually here and I guess it protects the
wiring<00:02:55.170> inside<00:02:55.490> to<00:02:56.900> ten<00:02:57.900> millimeters<00:02:58.170> one

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
wiring inside to ten millimeters one

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.520 
wiring inside to ten millimeters one
here<00:02:59.010> one<00:02:59.880> here<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:01.019> one<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.230> believe<00:03:01.350> is

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
here one here and this one I believe is

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.680 
here one here and this one I believe is
a<00:03:01.590> 13<00:03:02.010> before<00:03:02.220> we<00:03:02.430> call<00:03:02.580> correctly<00:03:03.060> it's<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.300> 13

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
a 13 before we call correctly it's a 13

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.590 
a 13 before we call correctly it's a 13
so<00:03:03.870> once<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.200> take<00:03:04.860> those<00:03:05.100> off<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:06.239> slide

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
so once you take those off and slide

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.350 
so once you take those off and slide
this<00:03:06.780> cover<00:03:07.080> off<00:03:07.700> so<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.850> looks

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
this cover off so it looks

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.570 
this cover off so it looks
and<00:03:11.110> then<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.350> have<00:03:11.500> access<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.190> cables

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580

and then you have access to the cables
here<00:03:12.810> what<00:03:13.810> we<00:03:13.900> need<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.170> do<00:03:14.290> is<00:03:14.440> we<00:03:14.560> need<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.710> go
