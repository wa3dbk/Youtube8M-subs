woah that's not really the safest way to
go<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.710> figured<00:02:02.159> out<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.240> still<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.509> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
go I figured out and you can still get a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.490 
go I figured out and you can still get a
really<00:02:03.930> good<00:02:04.049> effect

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
really good effect

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.899 
really good effect
by<00:02:04.979> using<00:02:05.159> gas<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.390> what<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.930> did

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
by using gas so what I did

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.930 
by using gas so what I did
now<00:02:08.479> as<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:08.989> built<00:02:09.349> a<00:02:09.440> new<00:02:09.470> tank<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:10.190> bigger<00:02:10.700> tank

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
now as I built a new tank a bigger tank

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.670 
now as I built a new tank a bigger tank
and<00:02:11.360> I'm<00:02:11.569> running<00:02:11.840> it<00:02:11.959> off<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.260> these<00:02:12.440> own

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
and I'm running it off of these own

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.600 
and I'm running it off of these own
burns<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.880> Matic<00:02:14.120> propane<00:02:14.599> canisters<00:02:15.519> so<00:02:16.519> how

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
burns and Matic propane canisters so how

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.220 
burns and Matic propane canisters so how
this<00:02:16.760> works<00:02:16.819> basically<00:02:18.400> azar<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:20.110> screw<00:02:21.110> this

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
this works basically azar I screw this

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.910 
this works basically azar I screw this
in<00:02:21.380> here<00:02:22.090> turn<00:02:23.090> on<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.360> valve<00:02:23.540> right<00:02:23.930> here<00:02:23.989> gas

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
in here turn on the valve right here gas

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.309 
in here turn on the valve right here gas
flows<00:02:25.220> into<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.550> chamber<00:02:25.959> pressure<00:02:26.959> at<00:02:27.170> is

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
flows into this chamber pressure at is

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.850 
flows into this chamber pressure at is
it<00:02:27.500> got<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.489> pressure<00:02:28.760> gauge<00:02:29.030> right<00:02:29.300> here<00:02:29.860> tells

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
it got a pressure gauge right here tells

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.100 
it got a pressure gauge right here tells
me<00:02:31.010> how<00:02:31.099> much<00:02:31.220> pressure<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.580> have<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.840> far<00:02:33.019> I've

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
me how much pressure I have so far I've

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.770 
me how much pressure I have so far I've
only<00:02:33.230> tested<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.709> with<00:02:33.860> like<00:02:34.040> 10<00:02:35.000> 20<00:02:35.239> psi<00:02:35.599> of

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
only tested it with like 10 20 psi of

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.759 
only tested it with like 10 20 psi of
propane<00:02:36.590> in<00:02:36.709> here<00:02:37.599> then<00:02:38.599> I've<00:02:38.750> got<00:02:38.989> this

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
propane in here then I've got this

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.850 
propane in here then I've got this
solenoid<00:02:40.580> er<00:02:40.760> here<00:02:41.260> Electric<00:02:42.260> on/off<00:02:42.590> switch

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
solenoid er here Electric on/off switch

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.900 
solenoid er here Electric on/off switch
which<00:02:43.660> fires<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.870> gas<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:46.400> comes<00:02:46.610> out<00:02:46.790> as

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
which fires the gas and it comes out as

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.780 
which fires the gas and it comes out as
nuts<00:02:47.150> over<00:02:47.299> here<00:02:47.599> and<00:02:47.870> I've<00:02:47.989> got<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.340> our<00:02:49.340> pilot

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
nuts over here and I've got a our pilot

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.759 
nuts over here and I've got a our pilot
Lakes<00:02:50.030> as<00:02:50.870> well<00:02:51.080> that<00:02:51.260> I<00:02:51.290> showed<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.620> guys<00:02:51.650> in

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
Lakes as well that I showed you guys in

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.420 
Lakes as well that I showed you guys in
last<00:02:52.010> video<00:02:52.209> basically<00:02:53.209> just<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.510> micro<00:02:53.840> torch

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
last video basically just a micro torch

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.729 
last video basically just a micro torch
so<00:02:55.430> yeah<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.930> reason<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.260> couldn't<00:02:57.470> just<00:02:57.680> use

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
so yeah the reason I couldn't just use

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.240 
so yeah the reason I couldn't just use
this<00:02:58.040> gas<00:02:58.340> canister<00:02:59.019> and<00:03:00.019> just<00:03:00.739> not<00:03:00.920> use<00:03:01.069> that

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
this gas canister and just not use that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.640 
this gas canister and just not use that
canister<00:03:01.579> completely<00:03:02.180> it's<00:03:03.049> because<00:03:03.380> this

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
canister completely it's because this

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.759 
canister completely it's because this
will<00:03:04.040> not<00:03:04.280> let<00:03:04.760> out<00:03:04.910> enough<00:03:05.269> fuel<00:03:05.540> at<00:03:06.319> one<00:03:06.530> time

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
will not let out enough fuel at one time

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.009 
will not let out enough fuel at one time
to<00:03:06.980> make<00:03:07.130> my<00:03:07.310> key<00:03:07.430> good<00:03:07.610> in<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.790> flame<00:03:08.030> as<00:03:08.810> if

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
to make my key good in the flame as if

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.229 
to make my key good in the flame as if
see<00:03:09.200> in<00:03:09.319> a<00:03:09.349> minute

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
see in a minute

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.130 
see in a minute
yeah<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:11.390> that's<00:03:11.540> why<00:03:11.660> I<00:03:11.720> need<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:11.930> big

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
yeah so that's why I need the big

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.979 
yeah so that's why I need the big

what the flames gonna look like but
hopefully<00:03:27.079> we<00:03:27.170> get<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.440> final<00:03:27.620> one<00:03:27.859> a<00:03:27.889> little

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
hopefully we get the final one a little

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.890 
hopefully we get the final one a little
bit<00:03:28.190> bigger<00:03:28.370> but<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:29.120> one's<00:03:29.359> still<00:03:29.600> really

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
bit bigger but this one's still really

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:51.130 
bit bigger but this one's still really
cool<00:03:30.109> so<00:03:30.350> here<00:03:31.250> we<00:03:31.310> go<00:03:31.400> let's<00:03:31.579> check<00:03:31.850> it<00:03:31.970> out

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.420
