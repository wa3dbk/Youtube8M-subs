without further ado let's go ahead and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.290 
without further ado let's go ahead and
get<00:01:56.930> started<00:01:57.290> so<00:01:58.250> nothing<00:01:58.550> crazy<00:01:58.850> going<00:01:59.119> on

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
myself so now they've returned their

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.900 
myself so now they've returned their
flag<00:02:11.330> right<00:02:11.900> here<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:13.010> I'm<00:02:13.130> like<00:02:13.310> oh<00:02:13.490> shit<00:02:13.550> I

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
flag right here and I'm like oh shit I

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.110 
flag right here and I'm like oh shit I
gotta<00:02:14.150> go<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.690> bam<00:02:15.080> clutch<00:02:15.800> kill<00:02:16.160> clutch<00:02:16.820> kill

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.199 
gotta go and bam clutch kill clutch kill
and<00:02:17.570> notice<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:17.959> timer<00:02:18.410> on<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.800> flag<00:02:19.790> return

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
and notice that timer on the flag return

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.390 
and notice that timer on the flag return
pretty<00:02:20.870> cool<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.080> liked<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.620> couple<00:02:22.010> second

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
pretty cool I liked a couple second

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.610 
pretty cool I liked a couple second
delay<00:02:22.730> there<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.269> flag<00:02:23.480> return<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:24.080> think

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
delay there on the flag return I think

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.080 
delay there on the flag return I think
it's<00:02:24.769> good<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.190> can't<00:02:25.400> just<00:02:25.610> run<00:02:25.790> over<00:02:25.820> the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
it's good you can't just run over the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.660 
it's good you can't just run over the
flag<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.510> do<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.900> here<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.590> see<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:27.980> UAV<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:28.640> I

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
flag and do it here I see the UAV so I

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.500 
flag and do it here I see the UAV so I
turn<00:02:28.940> around<00:02:29.269> get<00:02:29.989> a<00:02:30.050> little<00:02:30.320> two-piece<00:02:30.739> and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
turn around get a little two-piece and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.540 
turn around get a little two-piece and
move<00:02:32.510> forward<00:02:32.900> on<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.930> this<00:02:36.350> one<00:02:36.590> here<00:02:37.040> they

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
move forward on on this one here they

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.400 
move forward on on this one here they
try<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.850> steal<00:02:38.180> our<00:02:38.209> flag<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.600> turn<00:02:38.959> around<00:02:39.200> get

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
try to steal our flag I turn around get

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.949 
try to steal our flag I turn around get
him<00:02:39.680> turn<00:02:40.310> around<00:02:40.580> my<00:02:41.120> teammate<00:02:41.510> wasn't<00:02:41.810> so

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
him turn around my teammate wasn't so

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.949 
him turn around my teammate wasn't so
lucky<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.709> was<00:02:43.250> able<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.580> return<00:02:43.820> I<00:02:44.030> really<00:02:44.930> am

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
lucky and was able to return I really am

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.410 
lucky and was able to return I really am
in<00:02:45.260> love<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.130> flag<00:02:46.430> return<00:02:46.850> time<00:02:47.180> I

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
in love with the flag return time I

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.720 
in love with the flag return time I
think<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:47.930> much<00:02:48.350> better<00:02:48.680> with<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.370> little<00:02:49.489> bit

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
think it's much better with a little bit

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.640 
think it's much better with a little bit
of<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.940> delay<00:02:50.269> there's<00:02:50.660> some<00:02:50.810> strategy<00:02:51.470> there

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
of a delay there's some strategy there

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.289 
of a delay there's some strategy there
you<00:02:51.799> don't<00:02:51.890> have<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.250> just<00:02:52.459> immediately<00:02:52.760> run

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
you don't have to just immediately run

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.949 
you don't have to just immediately run
there<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:54.370> again<00:02:55.370> with<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.090> nade<00:02:56.330> fail<00:02:56.600> on

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
there and again with the nade fail on

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.170 
there and again with the nade fail on
the<00:02:57.170> wall<00:02:57.380> this<00:02:57.920> time<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.280> wasn't<00:02:58.459> as<00:02:58.730> close<00:02:58.940> to

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
the wall this time it wasn't as close to

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.280 
the wall this time it wasn't as close to
me<00:02:59.330> but<00:03:00.430> with<00:03:01.430> with<00:03:02.000> capture<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.540> flag<00:03:02.750> and

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
me but with with capture the flag and

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.119 
me but with with capture the flag and
a three<00:03:05.030> flat<00:03:06.030> cat<00:03:06.269> similar<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.930> black<00:03:07.110> ops<00:03:07.379> I

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
a three flat cat similar to black ops I

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.490 
a three flat cat similar to black ops I
think<00:03:08.909> it's<00:03:09.090> much<00:03:09.390> better<00:03:09.659> to<00:03:09.840> be<00:03:10.140> run<00:03:10.319> this

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
think it's much better to be run this

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.160 
think it's much better to be run this
way<00:03:10.680> because<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.370> can't<00:03:11.579> just<00:03:11.879> have<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.450> think

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
way because you can't just have I think

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.599 
way because you can't just have I think
this<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.469> right<00:03:13.709> way<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.950> do<00:03:14.159> capture<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
this is the right way to do capture the

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.899 
this is the right way to do capture the
flag<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:15.000> public<00:03:15.390> matches<00:03:15.569> at<00:03:15.959> least<00:03:16.909> coming

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
flag in public matches at least coming

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.630 
flag in public matches at least coming
to<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.209> end<00:03:18.329> of<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.599> video<00:03:18.780> here<00:03:19.439> dome<00:03:20.370> is<00:03:20.609> a
