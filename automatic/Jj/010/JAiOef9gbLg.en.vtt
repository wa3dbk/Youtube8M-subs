00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 very low from youtube here do again 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.740
 in a pretty pretty short video 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.559
 new information video and good 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.460
 comment this video about the crack of 15 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.490
 For example, it is issuing in 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.199
 very many either by facebook or 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.510
 twitter as per the comments of 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.949
 youtube but you ask all the time where 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.850
 is the channel where the crack is not 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.850
 let install it 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.070
 and I'm still pretty bad 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.320
 if he lets us install the game if we do not 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.350
 leave if it does not work is because there is not the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.030
 crack is worth and crack is not yet 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.070
 available is looking for information 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.470
 because many of you ask me but it is that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.150
 it is not yet yes it is true that you can 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.150
 get some kind of crack whether 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.900
 made by some people with whom 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.360
 of such and such but are still not 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.680
 reliable these cracks do companies 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.100
 because it's not that simple to make a crack 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.620
 OK 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.090
 so do not trust if you see someone who 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.670
 put in the comments either from my 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.330
 video or other YouTube channels 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.790
 it's here the crack we hope 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.580
 We wait because you do not download it because 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.360
 it may not be reliable even though they 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.540
 say it is reliable may not be reliable 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.760
 the quiet one, do not be in a hurry and 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.950
 Well, what there is at the moment is not 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.220
 crack was looking like I say either 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.350
 please as for videos and others 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.570
 and yet there is nothing the truth is a 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.300
 pity they are taking so long but 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.400
 well we do not know when it will come out 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.880
 we are sure that it will be good 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.920
 follow the wait and good is something 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.750
 that bothers us a lot already I know 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.970
 you because you want to play obviously 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.600
 like me because I would also like 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.510
 play and upload a video whether 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.310
 be a friendly whatever you already know 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.350
 I know that I always like or go up 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.170
 some video not to make a series but 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.330
 yes I expected to see it a little more than 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.670
 nothing 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.730
 and good another thing that I come to say in 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.460
 this channel I will not have any video of 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.580
 tutorials news about video games 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.100
 and things about these because basically not 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.310
 I want you to put me more ads YouTube and 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.890
 I ran out of channel I do not want it and so 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.870
 I created I should not pass it but 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.680
 is that youtube goes like this and well you have to 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.780
 respect it are the rules that there are 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.170
 well as I say it creates another channel that 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.400
 it's right here in 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.590
 in my psuv box on my channel I also 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.220
 you will have the description of the video and 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.200
 by 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.200
 and that's it if you will have it also for me 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.210
 twitter you want it when twitter is 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.120
 here it's worth 45 45 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:50.450
 and good you have to carry an embolism 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.430
 and well here you have the channel is quite 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.530
 simple as you see in the photo does not come out 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.680
 I do not know why it has not really changed 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.450
 my photo is another is not this and good the 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.099
 I did the trip the other day it was because 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.530
 put something simply and plainly worth if 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.390
 someone wants to make me another one because 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.829
 it improved and it will surely be better than 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.829
 I did this project in 10 minutes 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.380
 and good here you will have the channel you can 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.150
 subscribe and that's where I'll upload everything 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.300
 type of tutorials to download this 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.520
 game guides 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.770
 news about video games and these things 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.390
 I'm sure I'll upload them there 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.400
 this channel will remain unique and 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.430
 exclusively for gameplays that is 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.310
 for what is done and for fun 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.220
 since good nothing more to add has 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.620
 changed the background you see looks weird 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.290
 I know it looks weird is for youtube uncle 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.710
 because it is that the resolution that has 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.240
 to put them is a little weird or not 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.250
 I know it's a resolution that does not have 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.750
 meaning to make it right so that 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.380
 lace well 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.380
 that is 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.290
 I'm going to do the demonstration here 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.500
 that is to fit a background 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.330
 it has to be such that if you continue in a 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.240
 background like this 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.820
 site 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.730
 you know and if you have done it for example 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.000
 here the background is worth you have 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.060
 your old age you have done it this way 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.320
 then you pass it to convert it here 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.680
 when you happen to convert I wanted it 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.810
 stretched the image and looks super bad 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.230
 but good better than nothing better than 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.880
 what I had already had a year and a half 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.590
 it is not 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.540
 so good nothing more to add 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.580
 I hope you liked it and you know 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.100
 favorites and subscribe to both this channel 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.020
 if you are not like the one you have the 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.230
 description a greeting and see you next time 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.230
 goodbye
