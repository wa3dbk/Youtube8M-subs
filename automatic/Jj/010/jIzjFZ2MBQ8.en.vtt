good drift with an indicator it's not

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.420 
good drift with an indicator it's not
too<00:01:21.119> unpleasant<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.810> cast<00:01:22.049> overhand<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:22.979> it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
too unpleasant to cast overhand so it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.370 
too unpleasant to cast overhand so it
seems<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> perfect<00:01:24.479> blend<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.200> good
