00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 Today I'm going to show you how to do it. 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.970
 a trick that is practically impossible to 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.780
 be discovered the juice of 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.780
 mustard 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.730
 to make cissokho baptized 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.790
 you will need two 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.439
 Identical juice cans have to be 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.420
 juice because you can not use anything that 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.130
 have gas if you use something have 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.750
 hiv refrigerant type 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.340
 soon the person will realize to stay 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.660
 imperceptible has to be juice tea 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.189
 Something like that 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.559
 you just need something to 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.360
 baptize a juice I'll use mustard 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.059
 because I'm using orange juice 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.699
 It's the same thing as hard to understand 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.309
 also use a little adhesive tape. 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.940
 super glue and a drill with a 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.970
 drill bit already properly washed 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.019
 The first step is you empty one of the 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.110
 South cans remembering that what 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.519
 You will not lose. You can drink and drink. 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.769
 This is what you took out of the can. 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.559
 important is you can take advantage of the 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.470
 bottom of the can and that's what I'm going 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.640
 take it out with scissors and it's obvious 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.220
 At this time you have to take a lot of 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.990
 be careful not to cut your hand because the 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.270
 aluminum is treacherous 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.300
 what use will in the end only 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.570
 this round line with kawasaki that 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.310
 Tin funding with no spare only 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.920
 This part here 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.760
 the next step is to make a hole 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.790
 Maroto in the other tin of South Ruben 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.860
 middle of the wheel line equivalent to that 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.960
 You just take another side, I'll 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:41.659
 do this with the drill hole made 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.940
 you have to separate some juice in 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.610
 another glass because it is this glass that 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.770
 people will use it to baptize some of the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.560
 South will see that it is a bit annoying to do 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.540
 leave because you do not have where the air enters 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.120
 it will appear that you are organizing a 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.280
 Do it, but no problem 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.100
 in the end the game will leave and 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.970
 come the time of the slut let's put 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.050
 a little bit of this spicy mustard 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.539
 here in orange juice 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.220
 today it is not good to put too much because 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.810
 It's cool and lets the person take a little 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.480
 to realize that you are baptized if you 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:19.340
 putting too much will not realize at the time 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:23.510
 demon or to realize this is the juice 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.159
 clean with dirty is the one here I go 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.720
 put back 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.250
 it will not be easy to put this 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.370
 business back on put well 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.910
 slowly and it is bad because it has no 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.489
 where to go for help dc juice 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.140
 You can give a few thumbs down. 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.680
 of it this way I'm doing here 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.360
 because then the air is coming out and bone goes 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.640
 going down inside 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.170
 and it 's clear that for the catchy to work out 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.480
 now we have to leave everything very 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.540
 and finally cap and is dried to 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.269
 but here I am going to use my mech 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.640
 my transparent tape but I 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.590
 I do not want the adhesive tape to have 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.599
 direct contact with juice so I go 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.030
 use a small piece of aluminum foil 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.500
 from a place in the hole to protect 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.150
 a little hole if you have not 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.920
 Aluminum foil can use a plastic 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:23.660
 I'll film something as soon as I can. 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:25.910
 and the last thing to be 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.430
 done and now you'll realize why 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.319
 this almost perfect catch is you 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.739
 take that little piece of aluminum that 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:41.269
 cut at the beginning that make a wheel 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:44.030
 which of super glue and put a disgusting 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.840
 but take a look you're from the other 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.630
 side 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.400
 Look at this can, tell me if you can. 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.799
 You get this deal in your hand. 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.870
 if you can identify why it is 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.870
 spoken was sabotaged 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.020
 I was just ready, let's see if I can 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.600
 convince someone to take a sip of this 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.600

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.570

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.570

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.499
 second chance for her 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.539
