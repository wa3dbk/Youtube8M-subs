free<00:00:23.580> agency<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.150> see<00:00:24.359> him<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:25.170> type<00:00:25.439> of

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
free agency you see him as that type of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.560

a<00:00:25.680> ROI<00:00:25.830> kind<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.369> think<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> use<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> different

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
a ROI kind of think so I use a different

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.179 
a ROI kind of think so I use a different
kind<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.779> player<00:00:27.990> they're<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> same<00:00:28.980> guy

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189

kind of player they're not the same guy
just<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.760> think<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.599> really<00:00:30.810> telling<00:00:31.289> that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
just I think it's really telling that

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.850 
just I think it's really telling that

when their pic came up at 26 and there

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.200 
when their pic came up at 26 and there
was<00:00:34.980> another<00:00:35.190> defense<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.670> pretty<00:00:36.030> highly

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
was another defense I pretty highly

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.880 
was another defense I pretty highly

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
taller leaner more athletic guy I think

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.240 
taller leaner more athletic guy I think
it's<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.090> direct<00:00:51.329> response<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.250> Colin

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
it's a direct response to Colin

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.569 
it's a direct response to Colin
Kaepernick<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.210> rg3<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:56.039> quarterbacks

Kaepernick and rg3 and the quarterbacks

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.330 
Kaepernick and rg3 and the quarterbacks
who<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.940> who<00:00:57.270> are<00:00:57.360> really<00:00:57.600> good<00:00:57.750> scramblers

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
who can who are really good scramblers

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.139 
who can who are really good scramblers
not<00:00:59.340> maybe<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.760> even<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.000> much<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
not maybe not even so much the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.029 
not maybe not even so much the
read-option<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> scrambling<00:01:01.920> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
read-option as just the scrambling and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.560 
read-option as just the scrambling and
that's<00:01:02.190> where<00:01:02.370> Kaepernick<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.329> hurt<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
that's where Kaepernick really hurt the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.729 
that's where Kaepernick really hurt the
Packers<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> first<00:01:04.320> half<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
Packers in the first half of that

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.190 
Packers in the first half of that
playoff<00:01:05.400> game<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:06.450> yeah<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> think<00:01:06.750> they're

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
playoff game but yeah I think they're

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.450 
playoff game but yeah I think they're
hoping<00:01:07.439> he's<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.799> there<00:01:07.950> they'll<00:01:08.189> become<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
hoping he's just there they'll become a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.120 
hoping he's just there they'll become a
more<00:01:09.060> athletic<00:01:09.210> team<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.960> he's<00:01:10.080> he's<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> good

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
more athletic team and he's he's a good

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.920 
more athletic team and he's he's a good
fit<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.369> 34<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.330> length<00:01:12.570> they<00:01:12.750> like

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
fit for 34 with that length they like

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.719

the<00:01:13.049> taller<00:01:13.260> defensive<00:01:14.100> linemen<00:01:14.430> they<00:01:14.520> really

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the taller defensive linemen they really

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.670 
the taller defensive linemen they really
hadn't<00:01:14.970> had<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> guy<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:16.020> his<00:01:16.170> bill<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.530> that
