00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
really really good about my defense so I

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.449 
really really good about my defense so I
just<00:03:27.090> left<00:03:27.360> in<00:03:27.570> my<00:03:27.780> bench<00:03:28.080> at<00:03:28.440> this<00:03:28.920> point<00:03:29.220> and

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
just left in my bench at this point and

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.580 
just left in my bench at this point and
again<00:03:29.790> here's<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.300> Joe<00:03:30.570> Johnson<00:03:31.110> thing<00:03:31.290> long

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.199 
again here's the Joe Johnson thing long
jumper<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.070> get<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> hand<00:03:32.550> in<00:03:32.670> his<00:03:32.730> face<00:03:32.790> he

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
jumper I get a hand in his face he

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.970 
jumper I get a hand in his face he
bricks<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:34.020> and<00:03:34.200> then<00:03:34.709> he<00:03:35.580> quits<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.780> mean<00:03:37.770> 10

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
bricks it and then he quits I mean 10

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.800 
bricks it and then he quits I mean 10
points<00:03:38.340> wasn't<00:03:38.670> insurmountable<00:03:39.060> but<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.540> guess

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
points wasn't insurmountable but I guess

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.540 
points wasn't insurmountable but I guess
he<00:03:39.840> had<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.260> take<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.500> longer<00:03:40.890> bathroom<00:03:41.310> break

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
he had to take a longer bathroom break

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.580 
he had to take a longer bathroom break
then<00:03:41.760> was<00:03:41.910> allowed<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.600> don't<00:03:43.320> know<00:03:43.380> what<00:03:43.500> the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.020 
then was allowed I don't know what the
deal<00:03:43.800> is<00:03:43.830> guys<00:03:44.190> but<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:44.490> was<00:03:44.520> a<00:03:44.610> nice<00:03:44.760> short

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030
