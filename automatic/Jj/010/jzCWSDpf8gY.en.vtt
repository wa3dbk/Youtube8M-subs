00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.760
 hello girls to present a couple of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.580
 fast hairstyles and easy to do already 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.800
 You will see how you will like it in this case 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.470
 we started with the first job that goes to 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.830
 being on a straight mane will work with 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.170
 busi and naturally it is worth yes with 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.990
 six no type of volume 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.529
 in this case we will start working 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.870
 on the hair with a little bit of hair 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.420
 designed rather a little lopsided 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.510
 to understand us differently and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.860
 we would do what are two partitions one 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.100
 idea 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.140
 from the upper part to the lower part 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.820
 behind the ear 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.820
 and we would make a central separation 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.280
 on the left side 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.370
 on the right side we continued with the 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.390
 same line just behind the 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.650
 ear with the partition like that of the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.659
 other side 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.220
 we would also be against pizza 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:17.570
 and then we will work 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.190
 the shaped and embossed braid 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.690
 look at the birth 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.270
 we would make a simple arrangement 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.100
 a little bit with inclination and 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.640
 we would start to weave with a braid of 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.640
 three fields 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.689
 they always wear their hair forward 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.020
 the first line and guide going through the 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.370
 part below and the other equally 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:56.120
 we continue weaving on the part of 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:58.370
 down we would continue picking up I do the dea 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.940
 down 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:05.600
 we would knit down again 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.050
 we would take part of hair down 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.750
 and we went around 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.750
 we would continue to knit the same 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.390
 down left 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.060
 we would go under 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.250
 we would pass the next one down and at the same time 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.250
 we take the other time from below 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.890
 equally 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.890
 with we had taking the same 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.560
 will host previously in the same 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.560
 upside down 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.769
 above all very important the part of the 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.220
 hair that we are taking has to 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.110
 be flat flat beach because if not 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.110
 here would not be a way to firefighter 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.190
 we would be past the capes 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.870
 almost at the bottom we will make a small 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.180
 turn 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:12.659
 back a moment to get 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.490
 the hospital did not bother him 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.980
 what is the profile of the face 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.990
 and we would give a little knitting 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.390
 the same system always below 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.870
 so that in relief if we day more 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.870
 marked 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.200
 you do not have to get to the end 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.200
 simply this average height 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.010
 from the ear more or less for making us a 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.010
 little the idea and there we would put a 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.630
 and there we would have a planet 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.590
 we would continue with the left part 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.320
 in this case we are going to make it into account 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:29.710
 of the relief out we're going to make it 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.710
 in relief what is a normal braid 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.290
 we would take part a little bit with 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.290
 inclination 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.939
 three car braid 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.280
 and the same 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.490
 will show you weaving 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.790
 but a normal date by 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.790
 above 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.210
 and the same always always outlined to the 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.740
 hair birth 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.460
 we would continue taking 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.460
 plan 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.020
 and this terminal 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.510
 and practically carrying the iss 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.330
 we rotate a bit too 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.190
 the wind 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.050
 to the left side but back 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.730
 so that it fits us a little bit we do not 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.730
 bother in his profile 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:50.179
 a little bit just going halfway 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.179
 then 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.550
 since we would do the same we fit the 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.550
 rubber 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.889
 what 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.680
 the partitions we have with the 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.040
 tweezers 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.500
 and the hair so 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:31.969
 and just over the braids 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.399
 this would be an option 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:36.969
 fast and like beautiful hair without 

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:36.969
 bother us 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.009
 OK
