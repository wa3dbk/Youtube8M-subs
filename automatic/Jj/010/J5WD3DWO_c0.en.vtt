 alerting the report also shows that 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.400
 initially the car was rented 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:24.030
 then 2010 auctioned out of traffic 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.820

 how it was bought at auction first 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.120
 the buyer did some repairs 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.840
 Now honda looks almost like 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.030

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.370

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.800
 most damaged ground and does not 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.920
 car really reliable here 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.560
 what damage you won't see to 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.800
 front wheels stand in place 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.569

 so let's see what points to 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.660
 these damages on these photos 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.290
 see the difference in the gaps work with different 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:29.000
 sides on the first photo in narrow beautiful 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.860
 the lines in the second photo show gaps on 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.870
 the first photo with the left side is all in 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.910
 alright when like the right side 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.450
 skewed it indicates 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.840
 poor quality car repair 8 years and no 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.910

 repainted cans tray front racks 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.540
 you can see that the side fish gi ceiling 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.180
 fired were then cut out and somehow 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.730
 lining put in place in the description 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.069
 auto said mechanical damage and 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.010
 damage under the body of the document 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.750
 certificate of bavaria in western virginia 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.970
 Why should an insurance company be assigned? 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.590
 a document of serious damage to such 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.080
 nice looking car 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.100
 if you see Sanych certificate 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.140
 intact 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.720
 cars you should be careful 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.090
 for sure this car was restored 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.760
 to be sure about the previous ones 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.760
 repairs use report and autocheck 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.730
 or carfax autocheck found problems 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.770
 with documents from this car 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.690
 implying an emergency history also 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.230
 records that the car surrendered to 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.130
 rent 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.380
 and then auctioned in 2011 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.380
 when certificate damage was 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.450
 assigned server certificate might not 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.520
 assign if the car is on time and 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.680
 quality repaired passing those 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.860
 inspection is a great example 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.110
 missing parts on the car 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.210
 protivotumanok no why can it be 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.670
 a great indicator of unfinished 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.220
 repairs require additional inspection 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.630
 to be sure on one side 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.240
 no vices 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.870
 again an excellent indicator of not complete 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.370
 repair well and the last observation 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.090
 engine compartment is not enough 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.490
 plastic 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.420
 this is another reason to look at 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.730
 car with caution remember and 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.460
