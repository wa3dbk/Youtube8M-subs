if we plan to go for fourth downs

if we plan to go for fourth downs
because<00:00:36.000> we're<00:00:36.270> behind<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:36.960> use<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.320> run

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
because we're behind we can use the run

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.170 
because we're behind we can use the run
on<00:00:37.620> third<00:00:37.800> downs<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.309> keep<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> distance<00:00:39.000> for

a first down manageable now let's take a

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.700 
a first down manageable now let's take a
look<00:00:42.660> at<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.809> first<00:00:42.960> example<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.649> we

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
look at the first example here and we

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.350 
look at the first example here and we
briefly<00:00:44.010> showed<00:00:44.250> an<00:00:44.340> example<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.059> how

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
briefly showed an example this and how

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.959 
briefly showed an example this and how
to<00:00:45.420> beat<00:00:45.809> self-defense<00:00:46.590> tutorial<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.789> same

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
to beat self-defense tutorial the same

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.340 
to beat self-defense tutorial the same
thing<00:00:48.149> applies<00:00:48.390> here<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.750> I'll<00:00:48.870> only<00:00:49.020> give<00:00:49.320> a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.619 
thing applies here so I'll only give a
couple<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.739> seconds<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.250> example<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.940> you

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
couple of seconds on this example if you

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.060 
couple of seconds on this example if you
notice<00:00:51.899> your<00:00:52.020> opponent's<00:00:52.440> coming<00:00:52.739> out<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.039> a

to want to call a run play I know this

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.350 
to want to call a run play I know this
may<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.649> telegraphing<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> little<00:01:59.700> bit<00:01:59.939> but

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
may be telegraphing it a little bit but

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.389 
may be telegraphing it a little bit but
a<00:02:00.420> telegraph<00:02:00.960> run<00:02:01.170> play<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.890> lot<00:02:02.219> better

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
a telegraph run play is a lot better

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.520 
a telegraph run play is a lot better
than<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> delay<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> game<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.990> clocks<00:02:04.229> are<00:02:04.380> much

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
than a delay a game the clocks are much

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.200 
than a delay a game the clocks are much
faster<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.070> first<00:02:05.310> play<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.579> every<00:02:05.939> Drive

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
faster on the first play of every Drive

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.910 
faster on the first play of every Drive
and<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.600> may<00:02:06.780> struggle<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.350> get<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> ball<00:02:07.890> off

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and you may struggle to get the ball off

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.830 
and you may struggle to get the ball off
if<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.429> attempt<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.910> set<00:02:09.090> up<00:02:09.239> some<00:02:09.390> crafty

if you attempt to set up some crafty
passing<00:02:10.289> play<00:02:10.640> result<00:02:11.640> may<00:02:11.819> very<00:02:12.030> well<00:02:12.180> end<00:02:12.239> up

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
passing play result may very well end up

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.580 
passing play result may very well end up
in<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.660> botched<00:02:12.840> pass<00:02:13.170> play
