00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.610
 i believe the abstract emotional leader 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.520
 therefore to because I might not be a 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.220
 Bind big speaks but he did 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.850
 lets follow and that on the place louis 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.990
 mo tga you capped unit for people 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.990
 was berlin rumble 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.109
 thank god is a team sport 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.399
 and west team colleagues I once 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.309
 can get carried away from difficult 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.640
 situations and that's what I try 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.250
 to pass 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.440
 That's what inspired me 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.440
 others were able to get carried away in the square 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:51.270
 Now the pants suits go 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.980
 veit - before the space amt in drinking 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.360
 quite like coffee from the game 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.280
 it might be as a ritual 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.649
 otherwise i try too 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.899
 who already play to think in advance whether 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.879
 Of course, one day from the game or am 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.320
 Spielag our zeugwart which jerseys 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.850
 Today we play in what tricks 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.920
 the opponent plays which referee 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.850
 whistles around so things already 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.860
 to introduce the vista 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 which happen to be around are left hanging 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.570
 of course you thus learn a 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.729
 a little better to deal with one analyzes 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.170
 even more accurate and that is most important 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.729
 but you get from such 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.729
 The biggest motivation was defeats 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.429
 the players hear that exactly 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.770
 know how the mood is a very 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.450
 good feeling for the situation 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.490
 the place to hear the people at the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.799
 and even if they still us one 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.849
 a little bit of encouragement and thrust 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.849
 you can still have a performance
