00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.929
 Hi I am doing something like this 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.910
 If you look at the chat window now that you have the right to withdraw your reward, 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.279
 You're picking up the volume. 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.460
 There have been a lot of updates to this, but before that, 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.820
 Let 's try synthesis first. 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.990
 Out dog body 4 is present expectations 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.800
 Since my width is now ready to be modified, 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.800
 I'll go inside. 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.570
 Oh, yes, it 's ready to go. Now, one by one. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 I'll see. 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.989
 4 First-party and gangster 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.900
 I'll try to synthesize the ship moved again 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.190
 It's the first time I've ever seen it . 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:01:00.460
 I'll try to just above the Gangsters and Isabel battered chairs 1 hits synthesis 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.460
 start 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.600
 4 came out to be about right now is to try jaebeop because healer 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.600
 I'll do it. 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.480
 4 Start pulling again 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:27.350
 4 Julie's out. It's a little unfortunate because she's not a saint. 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.649
 Eopeulgeot like one written by Julie than you think to make a first selection 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.649
 I'll do it 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.009
 I chose Julie once. 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:42.320
 If you like Julie 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:44.659
 Epheshib is summoning lightning, but now that it is better than I thought, 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.630
 I chose the character. 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.610
 I'll go right into this hit. 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.730
 4 with Mine 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:59.490
 Let's synthesize Fran . 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:02.600
 But Minea and Fran are going to go into the synthesis right now with Ian Taro. 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.600
 4 Start synthesis 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:15.610
 4 1 2 1 came out, but now I feel a little uncomfortable. 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.610
 I have nothing to do right now . 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:26.240
 4 The second part came out, and finally the first time, 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.640
 I'll have a cable. 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:36.580
 4 It's a little patient concept, but I got the quilt. 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:43.090
 If you look at the information, there are 4 infections . 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:47.440
 There are variations of the skill and the skill to fix the sides are straight yoreotge 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.150
 Once you pull one sinkae gatguyo I'll just go with three battered property 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.390
 I'll do it 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.060
 4 In this issue, 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.530
 I'll try to synthesize the queen bee once. 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:04.590
 Yobeon three straight batters synthetic inde Kaiji ditch the queen to try just Synthesis 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.590
 Now let three batters synthesis Yap 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:16.900
 4 That Lee came out now, so I'll give overlapping right back into the draw 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.900
 4 I started pulling that again 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:29.500
 4 Unfortunately, both have duplicates 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.840
 Thats That still select the yiraseo That inevitably duplicate the better would jachul 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.550
 I made a choice. 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:42.670
 Now, the mood is a little bad, but I still use a bitch. 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:47.620
 Now let's just JULIE comfortably into the story and the overthrow 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:52.990
 4 I'll try to synthesize and Julia Ronin fourth one-party synthesis 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:56.100
 Inde Julie Ronin in Java, let's go to the fourth-party Java 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.100
 Start synthesis 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:08.970
 No, no, no. 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.970
 I'll also try to draw a straight back chair yobeon start blaming the plug 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.880
 Another party came out of the abandoned 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:21.260
 I do not feel like a little bit of a bit before this 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.260
 I'll have a tartan. 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:30.469
 Now I can not choose between jjipjjip and is one haetguyo the Tatar selection 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:35.629
 I 'm glad he's out now. 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:38.870
 It's the final synthesis, but I keep thinking that the correction is a bit of a waste . 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:41.870
 I'll try synthesis right now. 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.080
 Now utilizing yirang whiteness yoreotge 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:50.080
 The final fifth synthesis of Neoant synthesis 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.080
 Here's start'll party synthesis begins 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.830
 4 And Rocks Harbin Faust came out the cash now, not now, Part 2 geonjin 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.880
 I do not think so. 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.880
 Let's pull it out again. 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.370
 Four or five Anna's are duplicates. 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:18.530
 Eventually, the correction was evaporated at once. 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:21.590
 I will choose Faust, which I do not have now. 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:27.050
 I chose Faust. 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:28.970
 Dr. party and the results are not good little rattling so so Singh cable 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:34.160
 I pulled out 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:39.590
 The result of the requisite is the second part. Julie Faust 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:44.830
 I chose one intervention character and Simke 1 and three new characters. 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.830
 I will level up and upload additional images.
