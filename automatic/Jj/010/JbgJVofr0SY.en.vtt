00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.440
 ah 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.269
 Miguel Calero 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.150
 a man your captain who looks like you 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.300
 friend I do not know what else was of you Miguel 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.789
 calero 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.169
 Miguel was an example for me 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.169
 it really is something that 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.820
 that to this day one misses him 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.070
 much 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.440
 that was a leader 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.950
 that was a whole person all the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.950
 aspects 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.390
 sometimes I look at pictures of him and I do not 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.910
 I can believe everything that happened as 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.760
 our leader our dad our 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.770
 our symbol beyond what it is 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.550
 as a footballer going on because I was 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.640
 Mexican also but something happens to me 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.860
 with miguel that is an image is a 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.110
 statue 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.540
 always going to do it because I when 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.540
 I saw him he was like seeing 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.720
 respect there were many figures in that 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:17.470
 pachuca team or there were men who 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.510
 open the symbol were they two but 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.520
 more miguel because gabriel was gone 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.800
 but then we give all the Flintstones 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.800
 we were all there not and if we did not and 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.670
 martín cabrera leobardo activate it paúl 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:34.360
 aguilar gerardo rodríguez jaime chitiva 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.610
 damián me landing chub but if there is something 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.630
 I'm going to tell you that sometimes it does not happen 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.360
 in all clubs 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.810
 and that I think that was something that helped 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.340
 much 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.500
 and it had a lot to do with the club 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.860
 as well 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.490
 that there was a birthday of some 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.420
 some player's boy 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.390
 and there was not missing one and we go all 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.390
 you understand me and that there was no fine if 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.689
 it was missing or not but she was amazing 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.340
 but that was not because it was obligation not 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.409
 it's because we had a good time in the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.160
 birthday and we were every day 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.070
 together and hear over time 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.410
 no no it's not like that and I have here on the cross 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.510
 blue took four years and we have not 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.659
 joined once 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.230
 birthday and obviously in the clubs 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.000
 They are different 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.180
 be in pachuca to be in the capital 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.760
 and it's another thing about a man of much 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.819
 laugh a lot 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.980
 and really 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.060
 when we realized we won five 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.770
 Titles 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.780
 and at that time maybe not what 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.920
 We enjoyed it so much if we were happy 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.650
 that this or that but today 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.200
 really being in blue cross carries 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.910
 15 years without achieving the title and for 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.110
 us at that normal moment win a 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.410
 title and today here and even blue I swear 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.540
 by god we do the impossible you 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.050
 I swear because there is not a single day that 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.069
 No player 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.930
 do everything to become champion 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.120
 and really coming out champion is very 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.400
 complicated is very difficult there are very few 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.109
 very few players who are lucky 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.859
 to come out champion and us in that 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.859
 moment is like that 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:27.239
 but they are teams are teams of eras and 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.579
 I think Pachuca was a team of 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.650
 as the toluca the teacher of 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.590
 the last 20 years in toluca the teacher 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.910
 meza and equipment 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.980
 of pachuca for me are the best this 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.760
 I did not really want to ask the 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.300
 I do because first of all if we are countrymen 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.790
 from countryman friends when asked that 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.120
 I always answer when the muñoz nodded 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.739
 what you said was not very well understood 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.030
 in the party and king did not finish the 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.129
 final chaco however you already know 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.500
 what happened I will answer you as 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.860
 friend 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.800
 you have to be inside the court 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.450
 because for inside the court you have to 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.900
 live the situation and because outside 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.860
 we can say many things really 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.109
 emotionally 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:23.980
 a blow a blow for us 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:26.100
 incredible from minute 42 to minute 47 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.210
 I do not know what happened 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.589
 and the last move I think that 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.680
 a half-blurred memory for you and 

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:39.110
 chaco no no really things happen 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:43.370
 for something I learned to think that way 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:47.200
 and I did not have to be champion in that 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.330
 American League really 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.210
 we did everything possible I think it was a 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.069
 series very even the two 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.490
 what makes you think is to say good 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:59.560
 it's because it always goes blue cross 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.160
 that what motivated you to think about 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.380
 what is and always a blue cross for 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.690
 understand why there really is a 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.690
 simple ball where the capi 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.730
 The PSOE has taken out everything but 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.090
 that was the easiest for all 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.090
 inside 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:24.939
 then we go to penalties and the capi 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.939
 Slips criminal series 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.630
 we do not explain to you that they are things that 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.390
 what do you say we did not know why then and 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.610
 well out there you stopped running you left 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.190
 to do this or leave to the other 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.620
 the first goal was concentration 9 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.660
 our the second one you do not explain yourself 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.030
 never those are moses muñoz that is going 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.940
 outside that the sun has it controlled and 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.430
 suddenly it appears it's like you're going 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.440
 watching the ball and you know that the 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.060
 grab 8 and go outside or that the 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.139
 lane take off with the inner part 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.060
 Clear 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:03.110
 justice for alejandro castro that had 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.729
 a great league and apart from that is a 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.810
 idea how was he after party 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:10.990
 I wanted to leave football 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:14.620
 to let 0 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.830
 then you pronounce bongo we would understand 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.870
 it's a play that happened to him 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.630
 It can happen to anyone at any 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.900
 side month where weird but good apart 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.330
 he just got that penalty kick 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.210
 but he gave him no 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.490
 because it does not make you think how much 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.259
 help to get to that moment 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.419
 it can be pending with you a one 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.069
 talk later if I no longer have 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:40.560
 problems there are also I like to talk if 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.659
 good is already pending is this 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.009
 talk but well you think we talk 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:47.039
 with you already after you've played 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:49.530
 match with the Mexican team that 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:52.220
 then you know it talk back 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:07:01.390
 when you write champion sauce 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:07:01.390
 I know it hurts very soon 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:08.890
 thank you very much thank you 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.890
 we say goodbye thank you very much
