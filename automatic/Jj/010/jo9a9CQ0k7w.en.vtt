to<00:00:25.609> teach<00:00:25.759> the<00:00:25.909> beauty<00:00:26.300> of<00:00:26.509> mathematics<00:00:27.289> that

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:27.319 
to teach the beauty of mathematics that

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.349 
to teach the beauty of mathematics that
I<00:00:27.439> see<00:00:27.710> wanting<00:00:28.310> it<00:00:28.400> both<00:00:28.489> ways<00:00:28.759> this<00:00:29.060> may<00:00:29.300> be

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
I see wanting it both ways this may be

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.999 
I see wanting it both ways this may be
difficult<00:00:29.599> but<00:00:30.109> that<00:00:30.319> efforts<00:00:30.739> are<00:00:30.829> water

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
difficult but that efforts are water

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.560 
difficult but that efforts are water
when<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.339> students<00:00:31.819> begin<00:00:32.119> to<00:00:32.149> connect

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570

things<00:00:32.780> because<00:00:33.080> all<00:00:33.200> I<00:00:33.230> want<00:00:33.410> to<00:00:33.560> do<00:00:33.680> is<00:00:33.860> help

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
things because all I want to do is help

teaching<00:00:36.200> lets<00:00:36.680> me<00:00:36.800> share<00:00:36.950> all<00:00:37.100> that<00:00:37.130> I<00:00:37.280> see

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930

teaching lets me share all that I see
gonna<00:00:38.930> challenge<00:00:39.320> what<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:39.560> think<00:00:39.890> forget

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
gonna challenge what you think forget

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.440 
gonna challenge what you think forget
what<00:00:40.520> you<00:00:40.640> thought<00:00:40.790> that<00:00:40.940> you<00:00:41.060> knew<00:00:41.240> it's

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
what you thought that you knew it's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.240 
what you thought that you knew it's
absolute<00:00:41.900> and<00:00:42.260> with<00:00:42.410> that<00:00:42.560> understanding<00:00:42.680> and

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
absolute and with that understanding and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.230 
absolute and with that understanding and
math<00:00:43.430> it's<00:00:43.670> it<00:00:43.790> complete

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
math it's it complete

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.820 
math it's it complete
it's<00:00:44.420> logic<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:44.900> I<00:00:44.930> finished<00:00:45.170> my<00:00:45.350> proof<00:00:45.650> with

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
it's logic so I finished my proof with

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.980 
it's logic so I finished my proof with
QED<00:00:46.250> that's<00:00:46.610> quite<00:00:46.820> a<00:00:47.030> right<00:00:47.270> demonstrate<00:00:47.870> on

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
QED that's quite a right demonstrate on

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.600 
QED that's quite a right demonstrate on
don't<00:00:48.170> you<00:00:48.320> see<00:00:48.620> dropping<00:00:49.130> some<00:00:49.280> laughs<00:00:49.460> and

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
don't you see dropping some laughs and

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.950 
don't you see dropping some laughs and
I'm<00:00:49.670> hoping<00:00:49.910> this<00:00:50.060> one<00:00:50.180> goes<00:00:50.330> platinum<00:00:50.780> but

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
I'm hoping this one goes platinum but

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.599 
I'm hoping this one goes platinum but
I'm<00:00:51.080> just<00:00:51.230> a<00:00:51.290> math<00:00:51.440> teacher<00:00:51.560> and<00:00:51.890> I'm

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609

you<00:01:00.650> try<00:01:01.010> it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.990 

cuz<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.309> thinking

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.260 
I'll be tweaking for the kids who tend
to<00:02:11.680> fight<00:02:11.890> back<00:02:12.160> saying<00:02:12.430> they<00:02:12.610> learn<00:02:12.760> way<00:02:13.000> back

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
to fight back saying they learn way back

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.940 
to fight back saying they learn way back
all<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.780> math<00:02:13.990> they<00:02:14.230> ever<00:02:14.380> needed<00:02:14.740> they<00:02:14.830> were

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
all the math they ever needed they were

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.320 
all the math they ever needed they were
done<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.190> division<00:02:15.670> while<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:15.910> world<00:02:16.180> without

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
done a division while a world without

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.990 
done a division while a world without
mats<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.900> metaphorical<00:02:17.530> prison<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:18.160> gotta<00:02:18.790> say

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
mats a metaphorical prison I gotta say

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.490 
mats a metaphorical prison I gotta say
it<00:02:19.120> kind<00:02:19.240> of<00:02:19.390> limits<00:02:19.690> your<00:02:19.810> vision<00:02:20.080> but<00:02:20.350> for

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
it kind of limits your vision but for

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.410 
it kind of limits your vision but for
each<00:02:20.620> kid<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:21.070> my<00:02:21.370> class<00:02:21.640> who<00:02:21.970> was<00:02:22.060> struggled

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
each kid in my class who was struggled

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.940 
each kid in my class who was struggled
in<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.630> past<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.080> starts<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.440> understand

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
in the past and starts to understand

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.920 
in the past and starts to understand
that's<00:02:24.190> free<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.790> pays<00:02:25.030> back<00:02:25.240> all<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.720> work

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
that's free it pays back all the work

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.380 
that's free it pays back all the work
you<00:02:26.140> put<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.620> math<00:02:27.160> class<00:02:27.370> turn<00:02:27.940> effort

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
you put in that math class turn effort

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.000 
you put in that math class turn effort
into<00:02:28.600> skills<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.200> could<00:02:29.440> take<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.830> into

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
into skills and you could take that into

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.310 
into skills and you could take that into
the<00:02:30.400> world<00:02:30.700> make<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> difference<00:02:31.660> chase<00:02:32.080> your

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
the world make a difference chase your

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.500 
the world make a difference chase your
vision<00:02:32.709> make<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.890> big<00:02:33.160> splash<00:02:33.370> maybe<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.209> need<00:02:34.480> a

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
vision make a big splash maybe I need a

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.630 
vision make a big splash maybe I need a
math<00:02:34.780> conference<00:02:35.080> face<00:02:35.500> facts<00:02:35.800> i<00:02:36.040> am<00:02:36.070> nuts<00:02:36.220> for

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
math conference face facts i am nuts for

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.830 
math conference face facts i am nuts for
math<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.120> i'm<00:02:37.240> okay<00:02:37.480> with<00:02:37.510> that

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
math and i'm okay with that

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
math and i'm okay with that
it's<00:02:38.200> everywhere<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:38.770> on

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.900 

when<00:02:43.220> we<00:02:43.340> solve<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.880> what<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.660> it

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
when we solve it what is it

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:54.910 
when we solve it what is it
you<00:02:47.570> try<00:02:47.960> and<00:02:48.230> study

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:50.730 

amazing

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.800 

you
