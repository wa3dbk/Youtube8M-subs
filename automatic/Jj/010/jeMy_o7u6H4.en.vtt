00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
to put on top of the light stand well

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.410 
to put on top of the light stand well
we're<00:00:37.860> gonna<00:00:37.950> put<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> light<00:00:38.489> unit<00:00:38.850> itself

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
we're gonna put the light unit itself

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.110 
we're gonna put the light unit itself
and<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.170> main<00:00:40.530> workhorse<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and this is the main workhorse of the

flora lighting the actual flora light
system<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.170> very

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
system and this is it and it's very

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.029 
system and this is it and it's very
pretty

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039

you don't get to say that often about

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.500 
you don't get to say that often about
lighting<00:00:49.110> units<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.010> quite<00:00:50.399> pretty<00:00:50.730> it's

goes on the top there like that now I'll
talk<00:01:04.650> about<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.070> back<00:01:05.309> part<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> lighting

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
talk about the back part of the lighting

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.359 
talk about the back part of the lighting
unit<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.200> just<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> moment<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.070> there's

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
unit in just a moment because there's

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.130 
unit in just a moment because there's
plenty<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.790> talk<00:01:08.970> about<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.420> that's<00:01:09.540> keep

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
looking at the front for the time being

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.620 
looking at the front for the time being
okay<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.070> light<00:01:14.580> unit<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.150> place

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
okay so there we go light unit in place

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
okay so there we go light unit in place
now<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.500> course<00:01:16.650> you're<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> need<00:01:17.189> some

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
thing to put in here the floor light

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.760 
thing to put in here the floor light
will<00:01:20.430> actually<00:01:20.580> hold<00:01:20.970> six<00:01:21.570> continuous<00:01:22.500> lights

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
will actually hold six continuous lights

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.580 
will actually hold six continuous lights
and<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.400> ships<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.060> bulbs<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.439> it

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
and it ships with the bulbs this is it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.130 
and it ships with the bulbs this is it
this<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.280> bulb<00:01:27.240> list<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.630> at<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> box<00:01:27.930> of

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
this is a bulb list it's at the box of

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.740 
this is a bulb list it's at the box of
one<00:01:28.290> let's<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:28.920> grab<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.460> out<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:30.509> come

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
one let's just grab one out as they come

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.569 
one let's just grab one out as they come
very<00:01:31.020> well<00:01:31.170> packed<00:01:31.590> very<00:01:32.130> well<00:01:32.310> sealed<00:01:32.640> up

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
very well packed very well sealed up

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.679 
very well packed very well sealed up
because<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.030> don't<00:01:36.060> want<00:01:36.329> these<00:01:36.390> things<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
because you don't want these things to

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.130 
because you don't want these things to
break<00:01:38.119> because<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.659> quite<00:01:39.869> fragile

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
break because it can be quite fragile

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.770 
break because it can be quite fragile
but<00:01:40.590> there<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.100> that's<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.509> six

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
but there it is that's one of the six

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.260 
but there it is that's one of the six
bulbs<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.259> will<00:01:43.380> get<00:01:43.560> now<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.490> an<00:01:44.610> 85

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
bulbs you will get now this is an 85

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.719 
bulbs you will get now this is an 85
watt<00:01:45.540> continuous<00:01:46.380> light<00:01:46.619> where<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.430> basically

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
watt continuous light where it basically

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.730 
watt continuous light where it basically
means<00:01:48.240> when<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.509> six<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> them<00:01:49.259> that's

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
means when you have six of them that's

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.460 
means when you have six of them that's
about<00:01:49.950> 2,000<00:01:50.939> watts<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.390> light<00:01:51.659> which<00:01:52.200> is

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
about 2,000 watts of light which is

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.580 
about 2,000 watts of light which is
pretty<00:01:53.130> seriously<00:01:53.729> bright<00:01:54.149> for<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> continuous

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
pretty seriously bright for a continuous

six bulbs something like that just to

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.240 
six bulbs something like that just to

give me a touch more control but there

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.730 
give me a touch more control but there
it<00:05:13.400> is<00:05:13.430> that's<00:05:13.700> what<00:05:13.970> you<00:05:14.000> get<00:05:14.410> if<00:05:15.410> there's<00:05:15.680> a

what I don't like is this spongy bit

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.850 
what I don't like is this spongy bit
that's<00:05:45.200> attached<00:05:45.530> because<00:05:46.150> it<00:05:47.150> comes<00:05:47.420> off

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
that's attached because it comes off

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.500 
that's attached because it comes off
