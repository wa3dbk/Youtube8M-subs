will talk about the shoulder muscles

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.730 
will talk about the shoulder muscles
first<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.300> will<00:00:09.480> start<00:00:09.660> with<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.200> deltoid

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
first I will start with the deltoid

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.709 
first I will start with the deltoid
muscle<00:00:11.250> here<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.509> right<00:00:12.840> deltoid<00:00:13.410> muscle
