Saudi 90 X a replacement for the d9 it

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.039 
Saudi 90 X a replacement for the d9 it
great<00:00:10.620> new<00:00:10.980> trimix<00:00:11.730> features<00:00:12.209> so<00:00:12.570> let's<00:00:12.600> take

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
great new trimix features so let's take

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.099 
great new trimix features so let's take
closer<00:00:13.320> look<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:14.520> d9<00:00:14.789> TX<00:00:15.240> replaces<00:00:15.869> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
closer look the d9 TX replaces the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.660 
closer look the d9 TX replaces the
flagship<00:00:16.830> d9<00:00:17.310> series<00:00:18.440> the<00:00:19.440> major<00:00:19.770> upgrades<00:00:20.340> on

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
flagship d9 series the major upgrades on

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.370 
flagship d9 series the major upgrades on
this<00:00:20.850> unit<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.390> obviously<00:00:21.690> trimix

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
this unit is obviously trimix

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.900 
this unit is obviously trimix
so<00:00:22.680> you've<00:00:22.920> obviously<00:00:23.010> got<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.460> extra<00:00:23.670> gas

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
so you've obviously got the extra gas

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.680 
so you've obviously got the extra gas
using<00:00:24.539> helium<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:26.460> whole<00:00:26.820> unit<00:00:27.300> has<00:00:27.480> been

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
using helium the whole unit has been

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.560 
using helium the whole unit has been
upgraded<00:00:28.380> you've<00:00:29.310> got<00:00:29.520> new<00:00:29.760> internals<00:00:30.390> we've

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
upgraded you've got new internals we've

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.200 
upgraded you've got new internals we've
had<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> much<00:00:31.500> bigger<00:00:31.710> memory<00:00:32.039> so<00:00:33.000> they<00:00:33.059> can

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
had a much bigger memory so they can

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.520 
had a much bigger memory so they can
stall<00:00:33.390> your<00:00:33.510> profiles<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.230> lot<00:00:34.379> longer

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
stall your profiles for a lot longer

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.500 
stall your profiles for a lot longer
it's<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.399> lot<00:00:35.550> more<00:00:35.640> accurate<00:00:35.850> as<00:00:36.269> well

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it's a lot more accurate as well

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.040 
it's a lot more accurate as well
especially<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.829> compass<00:00:38.929> the<00:00:39.929> whole

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
especially with the compass the whole

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.189 
especially with the compass the whole
unit<00:00:40.379> has<00:00:40.469> been<00:00:40.530> redesigned<00:00:41.339> to<00:00:41.989> put<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.019> nice

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
unit has been redesigned to put a nice

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.340 
unit has been redesigned to put a nice
new<00:00:43.229> finish<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.129> gun<00:00:44.399> metal<00:00:44.550> titanium<00:00:45.350> nicely

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
new finish a gun metal titanium nicely

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.410 
new finish a gun metal titanium nicely
finished<00:00:46.530> off<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.010> outer<00:00:47.309> housing<00:00:47.879> as<00:00:48.239> well

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
finished off it outer housing as well

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.509 
finished off it outer housing as well
and<00:00:48.659> new<00:00:49.409> strap<00:00:51.859> glass<00:00:52.859> as<00:00:53.069> well<00:00:53.249> has<00:00:53.489> been

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
and new strap glass as well has been

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.430 
and new strap glass as well has been
upgraded<00:00:54.120> since<00:00:54.239> sapphire<00:00:54.690> glass<00:00:54.839> so<00:00:55.289> it's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
upgraded since sapphire glass so it's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.079 
upgraded since sapphire glass so it's
much<00:00:55.589> stronger<00:00:57.829> with<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.069> d9<00:00:59.579> TX

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
much stronger with the d9 TX

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.329 
much stronger with the d9 TX
we<00:01:00.269> also<00:01:00.359> get<00:01:00.749> the<00:01:01.260> transfer<00:01:01.649> cable<00:01:02.039> USB

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
we also get the transfer cable USB

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.800 
we also get the transfer cable USB
transfer<00:01:02.729> cable<00:01:04.880> and<00:01:05.880> also<00:01:06.000> next<00:01:06.510> interesting

it with a thicker wetsuit or dry suit
you<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:11.850> need<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.240> extra<00:01:12.299> length<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.990> get

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
you just need that extra length to get

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.850 
you just need that extra length to get
it<00:01:13.259> over<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.590> over<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.920> soup<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.710> I'm<00:01:16.799> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
it over that over the soup so I'm a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.310 
it over that over the soup so I'm a
closer<00:01:17.130> look<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.579> the<00:01:17.880> unit<00:01:18.210> itself<00:01:20.359> to<00:01:21.359> get

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
closer look at the unit itself to get

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.700 
closer look at the unit itself to get
out<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.649> time<00:01:22.829> mode<00:01:24.259> we<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.439> got<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
out of the time mode we just got the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.249 
out of the time mode we just got the
mode<00:01:26.070> button<00:01:26.280> at<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.579> top<00:01:27.079> you<00:01:28.079> can<00:01:28.229> just

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
mode button at the top you can just

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.069 
mode button at the top you can just
cycle<00:01:28.560> through<00:01:28.880> any<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.240> these<00:01:30.450> modes<00:01:30.780> and

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
cycle through any of these modes and

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.609 
cycle through any of these modes and
just<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.070> select<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.539> just<00:01:33.719> leave<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.500> on

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
just to select it you just leave it on

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.429 
just to select it you just leave it on
the<00:01:34.829> particular<00:01:35.070> mode<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.640> want<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.259> it<00:01:37.259> will

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the particular mode you want and it will

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.679 
the particular mode you want and it will
go<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.159> mode<00:01:38.429> so<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.359> a<00:01:39.390> look<00:01:39.539> at<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
go to that mode so we have a look at the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.919 
go to that mode so we have a look at the
time<00:01:39.899> mode<00:01:40.140> first<00:01:41.179> from<00:01:42.179> this<00:01:42.329> mode<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.600> can

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
time mode first from this mode you can

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:44.450 
time mode first from this mode you can
get<00:01:43.079> access<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.469> the<00:01:43.649> compass<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.340> be

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
get access to the compass just be

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.800 
get access to the compass just be
holding<00:01:44.880> down<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.749> select<00:01:46.079> button<00:01:46.109> and<00:01:47.810> in

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
holding down on the select button and in

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.480 
holding down on the select button and in
there<00:01:49.020> you've<00:01:49.409> also<00:01:49.560> got<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> rotating

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
there you've also got the rotating

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.410 
there you've also got the rotating
compass<00:01:51.140> which<00:01:52.140> all<00:01:52.320> messy<00:01:52.649> adjusts<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
compass which all messy adjusts to the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.069 
compass which all messy adjusts to the
bearing<00:01:55.999> now<00:01:56.999> the<00:01:57.060> compass<00:01:57.539> as<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.689> said<00:01:57.899> has

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
bearing now the compass as I said has

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.719 
bearing now the compass as I said has
been<00:01:58.259> upgraded<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:58.829> well<00:01:59.039> so<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.369> now<00:01:59.490> got

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
been upgraded as well so it's now got

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.149 
been upgraded as well so it's now got
tilt<00:02:00.329> facilities<00:02:00.899> as<00:02:01.049> well<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.799> no<00:02:02.039> matter

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
tilt facilities as well so no matter

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.039 
tilt facilities as well so no matter
what<00:02:02.399> angle<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.270> at<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.780> still

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
what angle you have it at it is still

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.340 
what angle you have it at it is still
accurate<00:02:06.469> to<00:02:07.759> come<00:02:08.759> out<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:09.600> compass<00:02:09.960> you

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
accurate to come out of the compass you

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.470 
accurate to come out of the compass you
need<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.560> press<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.800> mode<00:02:11.130> button<00:02:11.360> take<00:02:12.360> you

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
need to press the mode button take you

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.780 
need to press the mode button take you
back<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.870> time<00:02:13.400> which<00:02:14.400> mode<00:02:14.640> obviously
