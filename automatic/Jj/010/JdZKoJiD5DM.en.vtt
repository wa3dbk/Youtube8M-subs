 franck passi and the interim coach 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.840
 hope to have his troops succeed a 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.089
 good result and the Reims are the 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.949
 first to get into action with 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:37.239
 this unconvincing head and a balloon

 in league 1 at the 14th minute 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.439
 that's enough to make people doubt 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.059
 little more Marseille and 

00:00:56.439 --> 00:01:00.549
 the marseille team of private parade has 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.559

 injured the last rookie 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.420
 the international Georgian cancava is 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.240
 not qualified it does not prevent it by one is 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.460
 to make a good match marseille try 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.060
 to go out to equalize alessandrini 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.920
 take a chance 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.810
 it is framed but kossi agassa has 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.420
 largely time to see this coming 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.939
 balloon and boxer in prince corner 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.619

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.990
 free kick is framed and mandanda 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.990
 that intervenes to prevent the 2 to 0 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.560

 three wins and two draws on this 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.560
 period of the Reims who hold on 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.610
 despite some assaults Marseille 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.530
 especially on this corner 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.910
 kossi agassa is present but rancid 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.730
 at most good opportunities 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.520

 guégan again a counter attack she 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.330

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.120
 he will serve golog in the back of karim

 match 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.760
 the Marseillais still have a small 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.900
 luck but fail to find 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.209
 attacking solutions 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.010
 the Reims continues to recover
