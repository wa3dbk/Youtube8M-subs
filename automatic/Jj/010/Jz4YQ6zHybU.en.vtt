00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.990
 hello kids here panda commenting and 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:07.960
 I bring you a 24 color video is null 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.150
 by teams where he finished 25 1 but yes 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.089
 that makes me a streak of 20 I think 21 something 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.369
 well so that's let's say give a mini 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.289
 nuclear because I almost lost but not the 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.660
 everything although there is no nuclear or mobile 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.130
 in this game obviously and good and before 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.039
 I did not want to thank Ruben 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.359
 or superlight are and that is a colleague of mine 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.769
 that has left me this game and been me 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.839
 he left yesterday and is with tonight and 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.460
 this morning I get the truth that 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.349
 pretty good departure 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.780
 this is one of them and well I wanted 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.850
 share a little video of conti 4 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.410
 that had not been going up for a long time and that is a 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.060
 game that people are not climbing very 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.950
 right now and I hope you like the 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.630
 video and if you want to see more I think that 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.180
 four decide not because I obviously 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.570
 I am very bored of the typical we can 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.190
 Always make three or all of that so 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.810
 if you want to see things from this game or from 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.690
 some particular game say less I 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.730
 I try not to bring video because of that and 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.070
 well the subject of the video is going to be a bit 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.360
 the questions and answers as you have 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.920
 made video of those 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.900
 I have a link but the questions 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.300
 down in the description between the videos 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.170
 and then there writers or whoever I am 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.200
 Question 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.570
 things related many times to 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.400
 Openwork of that but there's also 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.840
 questions let's say more personal I 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.490
 I try to respond to personal problems 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.189
 so you can know me better than it is a 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.619
 little of the goal of this type of videos 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.740
 and not so much how to use the alarm or 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.030
 how he makes love like I do not know what or what 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.680
 I can add to the play or if I can 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.899
 mount my clan but more personal things 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.630
 of me not so that you know me a little 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.340
 more as a person and good good of 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.320
 gameplay itself is a 25 as I said 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.880
 with a streak of 20 I'm in this area 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.130
 of the map very content because the 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.800
 enemies are coming out and spam 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.200
 and not that I put them this here 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.149
 a little with more teacher having always 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.069
 like zombies it's a bit complicated to go out 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.200
 because most of the video will be in 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.819
 this in this area and then right at the end 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.530
 they kill me and I start again working 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.810
 good but there's just how the game is 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.060
 a bit bitch is hard for teams but 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.380
 like the 4 and the brother but everything has 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.850
 and perhaps as many angels because 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.830
 carries this to the domain that has 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.209
 many more parks then well I hope 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.009
 like the game and now we are going to 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.989
 pass the questions there are many questions 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.329
 that are repeated a lot that are very very 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.970
 very very repeated very frequent so 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.090
 I will answer those first 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.580
 you want to know the most popular we have 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.500
 first there are many doubts of my family 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.360
 where am I from where are they from 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.160
 I speak English and all that has been what 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.870
 see a little better let's say 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.480
 explained earlier but so a little bit 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.320
 over without labeling again I was born in 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.590
 Spain 17 18 years ago and at 2 years old I 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.660
 I moved to Brazil that I was there for two years 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.030
 childhood let's say and then with four years 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.100
 I moved to Miami and I was there for ten years 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.130
 that's why I know Portuguese English Spanish 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.180
 my father is spanish i am spanish my 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.640
 road is Spanish 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.250
 - my mother who is Swedish, hence you are 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.720
 you have seen in the fairs in the photos 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.090
 from twitter I'm blond and blue eyes 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.070
 and that's why it's safe for my mother 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.020
 for the genes of my madrid but I am 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.640
 Spanish and just lived outside and by 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.440
 those other languages ​​but I'm not saying and 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.260
 nothing of the sort even if it seems not 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.030
 It seems a lot but I am not one another 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.090
 question is what the xbox that if I do not go 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.000
 to buy the xbox that if someday I'm going to 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.470
 play in xbox all that roll right now 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.940
 for now I do not think I buy good 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.620
 because simply because I like the 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.050
 play more even though I really do 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.270
 very old place is very slow sometimes yes 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.840
 but what to pay for urging to play 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.960
 the play all that not here we go I do not 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.880
 it seduces a lot and also because as 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.620
 you have to pay and the exclusives of the 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.510
 xbox are not as good those of the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.100
 play for example the god of war and the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.660
 heavy rain and all these in a charter 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.550
 they are not in the xbox and it does not look like the 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.980
 play has better games so for 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.840
 now I stay in the play but I can not 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.940
 promise that it will never happen to me 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.740
 the xbox must have two consoles because 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.060
 Maybe so I'm not going to say anything 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.380
 I'm not going to promise anything yet 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.560
 that for now I have a homage 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.090
 this self the theme is the partner theme there is 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.950
 a lot of questions about if I'm going to do 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.300
 the partner because I do not have it there and 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.520
 all that 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.610
 before going to Brazil as you know how to do 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.590
 for against because they were new and therefore 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.360
 supposed people told me that they were going to 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.300
 do faster over there where they have 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.440
 to do it over there but when I did 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.700
 to do it fast to be able to upload 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.370
 videos and programming the media were 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.260
 brazil just because they fucked me and no no what 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.060
 they activated none of that so I left 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.930
 speak without without a pass and then I went back to 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.850
 August and I 'm not leaving either 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.130
 ignore or more or less by skype and by 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.480
 email and everything so you can digest 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.280
 terminate the contract wanted to leave 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.190
 ultra even if it was never actually 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.600
 because but good and in the end it does 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.860
 three days like that they talked and mails that 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.600
 they had already finished contract and I already 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.150
 it was free let's say so very 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.280
 happy and I hope to leave with more minimum 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.100
 now this is very good week a 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.390
 email and see if they see it or not work 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.090
 in the future I think I will be like 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.020
 cinema that are more reliable we arrived 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.790
 people what can work 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.060
 yes they are professionals like that 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.070
 we hope you will go very briefly 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.770
 in the next months for more advance 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.280
 enough things we will see to see what is 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.970
 what exactly are we going 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.310
 and another question very much I repeat are 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.130
 those of the sensitivity that is 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.990
 sensitivity I've always carried four 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.300
 more or less always though the game of 4 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.040
 to 7 depends on how you are I do not know before 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.710
 they played 7 now played in 4 on the engine 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.470
 fer 3 and in all the games but let's go 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.389
 that more or less is more depends on each 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.440
 person and how comfortable you are is not 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.300
 that there is a sensitivity that is better 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.919
 that the other is that if you play in dieter 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.830
 it's good I wanted to play in one you're bad 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.600
 good yes but good that does not have much 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.180
 what to see is more then the size of 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.790
 hands and how the tombs say no 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.840
 It has nothing to do with it as if I or 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.340
 four is not because it is not because they are 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.160
 ends the modes so I play well what 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.290
 I have games good function must see 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.540
 well more or less the video just ends 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.310
 yes I'm not going to say much more 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.419
 questions or respond to anything else because 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.860
 I will not give time but I would do 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.140
 another video because I have so many 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.610
 questions in plan 200 so I want 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.919
 answer so we 'll see you in the 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.290
 next video will not be of questions but 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.780
 I 'm going to do I'll help do every month 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.070
 or every two three weeks so a video of 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.940
 questions that I think you do like 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.940
 I hope you like it 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.610
 and then goodbye
