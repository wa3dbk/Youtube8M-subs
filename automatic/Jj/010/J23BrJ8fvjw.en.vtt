00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.900
 to make 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.310
 you need 1 pack of apple pie 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.529
 butter and their eggs at room temperature 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.619
 diced apples in a 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.409
 orange the juice and grated painter 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.380
 of prunes that are also violent 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:37.080
 are cut into pieces 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.680
 sugar cinnamon cardamom and light 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.680
 roasted almond shavings 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.120
 start preheating the oven 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.970
 and heat the baking pan in my oven 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.680
 me at 165 degrees 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.380
 then I take the apple with the juice 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:01:00.870
 the peel the cinnamon the cardamom and the 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:01:04.170
 sugar then I gently stir in the butter 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.049
 mixing bowl and add the baking mix 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.640
 and two thirds of the egg this knead 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.429
 I then with a mixer with dough hooks 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.719
 a dough and in the end I knead it 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:14.719
 even by hand 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.170
 if I have a nice dough then go 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.119
 I bail for one 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.090
 and I made a roll and custody over 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.479
 one third for the edges and the rest 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:33.060
 there then makes a backdrop for the soil 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.009
 along with that dog I just got out of it 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.479
 baking tin is then coated and then we have 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.789
 a good tip because I scatter one 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.539
 breadcrumbs or rusks over the bottom 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.939
 this is how I prevent wet soil 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.319
 apple pieces enter number and pay attention 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.340
 that no bag comes from one 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.359
 orange and go almond shavings 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.549
 about the cake 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:57.119
 I am a little worthy of wages 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:03.090
 when the cake is baked and I spread the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:05.249
 edges with the rest of the end and 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.149
 when the cake is in the oven for 60 minutes 

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:07.979
 has been 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.110
 then divide i was talking about the 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.450
 cake you do not before because otherwise 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.159
 the plums become too hard 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.519
 then bake the cake 10 more with the brown wine 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.519
 minutes off 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.350
 and once out of the oven it goes one more 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.569
 little almond shavings over it and leave 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.810
 I cool it for an hour in the form and 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.810
 joy
