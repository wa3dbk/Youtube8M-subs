get the measles vaccine twice you get
two<00:02:26.550> shots<00:02:26.790> here's<00:02:27.510> why<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.720> get<00:02:27.930> two<00:02:28.080> shots

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320

because after one shot you are then

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.120 
because after one shot you are then
ninety-three<00:02:30.780> percent<00:02:30.990> protected<00:02:31.680> against

ninety-three percent protected against
measles<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.240> might<00:02:33.360> think<00:02:33.390> oh<00:02:33.630> well

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
raises it to ninety seven percent

raises it to ninety seven percent
protected<00:02:38.040> against<00:02:38.850> measles<00:02:39.000> which<00:02:39.300> means

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
about Jim Carrey that bothers me and all

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.280 
about Jim Carrey that bothers me and all
people<00:03:26.730> who<00:03:26.880> are<00:03:27.030> anti<00:03:27.450> vaccine<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:27.990> this<00:03:28.110> way

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
people who are anti vaccine in this way

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.350 
people who are anti vaccine in this way
is<00:03:28.560> it's<00:03:29.040> not<00:03:29.220> like<00:03:29.430> with<00:03:29.610> other<00:03:29.790> forms<00:03:30.270> of

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
is it's not like with other forms of

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.760 
is it's not like with other forms of
medicine<00:03:30.780> we're<00:03:30.959> Christian<00:03:31.260> Scientists<00:03:31.650> and

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
medicine we're Christian Scientists and

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.080 
medicine we're Christian Scientists and
stuff<00:03:31.980> like<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.280> are<00:03:32.400> saying<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.790> Jesus

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
stuff like that are saying that Jesus

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.210 
stuff like that are saying that Jesus
told<00:03:33.300> me<00:03:33.390> not<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.600> put<00:03:33.780> stuff<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.050> my<00:03:34.200> body<00:03:34.410> with

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
told me not to put stuff in my body with

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.470 
told me not to put stuff in my body with
the<00:03:35.340> way<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:35.610> they're<00:03:35.760> approaching<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.390> is

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
the way that they're approaching it is

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.360 
the way that they're approaching it is
by<00:03:36.630> talking<00:03:37.110> about<00:03:37.230> chemicals<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.100> talking

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
by talking about chemicals and talking

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.620 
by talking about chemicals and talking
about<00:03:38.490> additives<00:03:39.000> they're<00:03:39.180> using<00:03:39.540> the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
about additives they're using the

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.390 
about additives they're using the
language<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.260> science<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.860> they<00:03:40.950> seem<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.190> be

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
language of science and they seem to be

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.000 
language of science and they seem to be
genuinely<00:03:41.850> interested<00:03:41.940> in<00:03:42.540> trying<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.620> prove

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
genuinely interested in trying to prove

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.830 
genuinely interested in trying to prove
what<00:03:44.400> they<00:03:44.550> believe<00:03:44.820> not<00:03:45.030> simply<00:03:45.450> asserting

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
what they believe not simply asserting

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.480 
what they believe not simply asserting
it<00:03:45.930> based<00:03:46.080> on<00:03:46.230> faith<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.500> that's<00:03:46.770> why<00:03:46.950> they

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
it based on faith and that's why they

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.760 
it based on faith and that's why they
point<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:48.090> these<00:03:48.270> studies<00:03:48.570> but<00:03:49.170> studies<00:03:49.620> that

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
point to these studies but studies that

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.890 
point to these studies but studies that
they<00:03:49.890> point<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.400> have<00:03:50.580> been<00:03:50.790> debunked<00:03:51.209> bunk<00:03:51.780> is

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
they point to have been debunked bunk is

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.300 
they point to have been debunked bunk is
not<00:03:52.020> a<00:03:52.050> bad<00:03:52.260> thing<00:03:52.470> when<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.709> debunk<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.220> it

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
not a bad thing when you debunk it it

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.530 
not a bad thing when you debunk it it
doesn't<00:03:53.459> make<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.760> good<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:54.060> means<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.450> it

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
doesn't make it good it means that it

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.120 
doesn't make it good it means that it
was<00:03:54.660> false<00:03:54.990> it<00:03:55.200> was<00:03:55.290> made-up<00:03:55.770> it<00:03:55.920> didn't

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
was false it was made-up it didn't

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.040 
was false it was made-up it didn't
actually<00:03:56.280> exist<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:57.030> so<00:03:57.570> their<00:03:57.870> natural

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
actually exist and so their natural

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.020 
actually exist and so their natural
scientific<00:03:58.950> curiosity<00:03:59.220> has<00:03:59.610> been<00:03:59.790> perverted

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
scientific curiosity has been perverted

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.880 
scientific curiosity has been perverted
and<00:04:00.570> it<00:04:00.870> leads<00:04:01.080> them<00:04:01.230> down<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:01.560> path<00:04:01.860> to

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
and it leads them down this path to

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.970 
and it leads them down this path to
believing<00:04:02.400> not<00:04:03.060> just<00:04:03.480> silly<00:04:04.290> stuff<00:04:04.709> but

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
believing not just silly stuff but

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.949 
believing not just silly stuff but
dangerous<00:04:05.670> stuff<00:04:05.940> about<00:04:06.209> vaccines<00:04:06.720> stuff

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
dangerous stuff about vaccines stuff

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.449 
dangerous stuff about vaccines stuff
that<00:04:07.110> puts<00:04:07.260> their<00:04:07.470> kids<00:04:07.650> at<00:04:07.800> danger<00:04:08.130> in<00:04:08.310> danger

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
that puts their kids at danger in danger

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.400 
that puts their kids at danger in danger
and<00:04:08.820> puts<00:04:09.240> other<00:04:09.450> kids<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:09.870> danger<00:04:09.989> as<00:04:10.230> well

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
and puts other kids in danger as well

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.270 
and puts other kids in danger as well
yes<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:11.010> anti<00:04:11.580> vaccine<00:04:12.180> debate<00:04:13.140> has<00:04:13.920> very

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
yes the anti vaccine debate has very

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.220 
yes the anti vaccine debate has very
little<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:14.700> do<00:04:14.850> with<00:04:14.880> political<00:04:15.209> ideology<00:04:16.020> I

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
little to do with political ideology I

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.320 
little to do with political ideology I

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
mean you see people across the political

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.260 
mean you see people across the political
spectrum<00:04:18.709> that<00:04:19.709> have<00:04:19.980> varying<00:04:20.489> opinions<00:04:20.730> on

distrust you may have in the
medical<00:04:27.449> field<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:28.590> proof<00:04:28.860> is<00:04:29.009> in<00:04:29.039> the

medical field the proof is in the

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.980 
medical field the proof is in the

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
because of the vaccine yeah yeah and I'm

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.379 
because of the vaccine yeah yeah and I'm
glad<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.430> brought<00:04:47.520> up<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.729> ideology

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
glad that you brought up the ideology

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.090 
glad that you brought up the ideology
because<00:04:48.600> in<00:04:48.840> this<00:04:48.990> particular<00:04:49.289> case<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:49.860> does

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
because in this particular case it does

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.279 
because in this particular case it does
seem<00:04:50.490> at<00:04:50.759> least<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:51.180> be<00:04:51.210> more<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:51.930> liberal

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
seem at least to be more of a liberal

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:53.960 
seem at least to be more of a liberal
thing<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:52.770> it's<00:04:53.190> not<00:04:53.310> about<00:04:53.520> lack<00:04:53.940> of

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
thing and it's not about lack of

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.150 
thing and it's not about lack of
education<00:04:54.720> necessarily<00:04:55.410> like<00:04:55.590> many<00:04:55.919> of<00:04:56.039> the

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
education necessarily like many of the

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.529 
education necessarily like many of the
people<00:04:56.190> who<00:04:56.520> don't<00:04:56.729> vaccinate<00:04:56.940> their<00:04:57.300> kids<00:04:57.330> in

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
people who don't vaccinate their kids in

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.839
