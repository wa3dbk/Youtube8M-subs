hello this is James from X robots don
khon<00:00:10.770> UK<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.610> quick<00:00:11.790> update<00:00:11.910> on

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.180 
khon UK this is a quick update on

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.520 
khon UK this is a quick update on
android<00:00:12.780> 12

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530

I<00:00:13.559> finished<00:00:14.430> the<00:00:14.550> 3d<00:00:15.059> printing<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.540> past

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
I finished the 3d printing of the past

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.750 
I finished the 3d printing of the past
sometime<00:00:16.230> ago<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> few<00:00:17.010> people<00:00:17.310> asked<00:00:17.520> me<00:00:17.640> how

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
sometime ago a few people asked me how

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.710 
sometime ago a few people asked me how
it's<00:00:18.090> been<00:00:18.240> going

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
it's been going

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.380 
it's been going
so<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.170> thought<00:00:19.350> about<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.650> video<00:00:20.390> basically

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
so I thought about this video basically

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
so I thought about this video basically
I've<00:00:21.480> been<00:00:21.510> tinkering<00:00:21.960> around<00:00:22.080> with<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
I've been tinkering around with the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.050 
I've been tinkering around with the
electronics<00:00:23.040> and<00:00:23.369> trying<00:00:23.790> to<00:00:23.910> make<00:00:24.029> it

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
electronics and trying to make it

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.089 
electronics and trying to make it
dynamically<00:00:24.720> stable<00:00:24.779> which<00:00:25.470> I've<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.919> about

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
dynamically stable which I've just about

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:43.210 
dynamically stable which I've just about
achieved<00:00:26.610> so<00:00:27.180> let's<00:00:27.540> see<00:00:27.689> what<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.930> can<00:00:28.020> do

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.950 

so<00:00:44.220> for<00:00:44.460> now<00:00:44.580> I've<00:00:44.940> mostly<00:00:45.270> been<00:00:45.360> trying<00:00:45.810> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
so for now I've mostly been trying to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.230 
so for now I've mostly been trying to
set<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.200> up<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.680> shift<00:00:47.400> its<00:00:47.580> hips<00:00:47.790> from<00:00:47.910> side<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
set it up to shift its hips from side to

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.170 
set it up to shift its hips from side to
side<00:00:48.710> sort<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> oscillate<00:00:50.280> by<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.030> it's

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
side sort of oscillate by that so it's

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.940 
side sort of oscillate by that so it's
you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.480> see<00:00:51.720> it's<00:00:51.870> just<00:00:52.140> about<00:00:52.350> taking<00:00:52.830> its

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
you can see it's just about taking its

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.560 
you can see it's just about taking its
feet<00:00:53.160> off<00:00:53.310> the<00:00:53.340> ground<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:54.030> not<00:00:54.150> very<00:00:54.270> much

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
feet off the ground but not very much

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.110 
feet off the ground but not very much
I'm<00:00:55.290> not<00:00:55.470> using<00:00:55.650> its<00:00:55.920> knees<00:00:56.160> always<00:00:56.550> ankles<00:00:57.030> or

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
I'm not using its knees always ankles or

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.140 
I'm not using its knees always ankles or
its<00:00:57.239> thighs<00:00:57.450> or<00:00:57.660> any<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.900> the<00:00:57.960> other<00:00:58.080> joints

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
its thighs or any of the other joints

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.880 
its thighs or any of the other joints
and<00:01:00.150> basically<00:01:00.630> you're<00:01:00.720> using<00:01:00.750> gyros<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and basically you're using gyros the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.680 
and basically you're using gyros the
idea<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.400> can<00:01:02.520> oscillate<00:01:02.610> and<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.510> should

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
idea is it can oscillate and it should

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.980 
idea is it can oscillate and it should
stay<00:01:03.900> stable<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.390> basically<00:01:06.390> carry<00:01:06.690> on<00:01:06.810> like

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
stay stable and basically carry on like

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.950 
stay stable and basically carry on like
that<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:07.470> time<00:01:08.300> so<00:01:09.300> if<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.660> give<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
that for some time so if I give it a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:21.609 
that for some time so if I give it a
knock<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:16.790> sight<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.240> stay<00:01:19.200> upright<00:01:19.380> again

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
knock in sight and stay upright again

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.020 
knock in sight and stay upright again
using<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.680> number<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.040> gyroscopes<00:01:23.700> for

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
using the number of gyroscopes for

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.590 
using the number of gyroscopes for
that's<00:01:24.210> mainly<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.410> each<00:01:25.530> thigh<00:01:26.600> which

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that's mainly one on each thigh which

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.630 
that's mainly one on each thigh which
you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.990> see<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.680> each<00:01:28.830> side<00:01:29.160> here<00:01:29.460> these

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you can see just on each side here these

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.600 
you can see just on each side here these
blue<00:01:29.700> things<00:01:30.650> and<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.800> also<00:01:31.950> using<00:01:32.400> one

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
blue things and it's also using one

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.180 
blue things and it's also using one
master<00:01:33.060> gyro<00:01:33.479> at<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.720> top<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.290> alters<00:01:35.040> our

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
master gyro at the top which alters our

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:47.240 
master gyro at the top which alters our
timing<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.680> see<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.010> is<00:01:47.100> actually

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
timing so you can see it is actually

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.160 
timing so you can see it is actually
just<00:01:47.640> about<00:01:47.940> sightings<00:01:48.390> feet<00:01:48.659> off<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:48.900> ground

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
just about sightings feet off the ground

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.160 
just about sightings feet off the ground
on<00:01:49.409> each<00:01:49.500> step<00:01:50.030> it's<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.210> any<00:01:51.420> tangles<00:01:51.780> or<00:01:52.020> its

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
on each step it's not any tangles or its

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.050 
on each step it's not any tangles or its
knees<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.740> say<00:01:53.010> stay<00:01:53.490> from<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.820> side

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
knees as I say stay from a side

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.880 
knees as I say stay from a side
perspective<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> legs<00:01:55.049> are<00:01:55.229> both<00:01:55.380> straight

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
perspective the legs are both straight

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.890 
perspective the legs are both straight
and<00:01:56.720> it's<00:01:57.720> literally<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:59.420> just<00:02:00.420> moving<00:02:00.780> his

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
and it's literally just just moving his

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.780 
and it's literally just just moving his
hips<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:03.620> it's<00:02:04.620> shuffling<00:02:05.310> backwards

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
hips there it's shuffling backwards

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.080 
hips there it's shuffling backwards
slightly<00:02:07.010> probably<00:02:08.010> just<00:02:08.220> uses<00:02:08.700> some<00:02:08.850> slack

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
slightly probably just uses some slack

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.110 
slightly probably just uses some slack
in<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.360> joints<00:02:10.280> there<00:02:11.280> are<00:02:11.459> other<00:02:11.700> joints

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
in the joints there are other joints

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.400 
in the joints there are other joints
which<00:02:12.239> are<00:02:12.360> moving<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.870> can<00:02:12.989> just<00:02:13.170> about<00:02:13.290> see

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
which are moving you can just about see

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.530 
which are moving you can just about see
the<00:02:13.650> knee<00:02:13.950> Springs<00:02:14.400> compensating<00:02:15.360> there

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the knee Springs compensating there

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.190 
the knee Springs compensating there
those<00:02:15.750> are<00:02:15.900> also<00:02:16.049> using<00:02:16.380> gyros<00:02:17.360> as<00:02:18.360> possibly

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
those are also using gyros as possibly

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.110 
those are also using gyros as possibly
there's<00:02:19.470> an<00:02:19.560> easy<00:02:19.769> slightly<00:02:20.580> slack<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:20.880> each

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
there's an easy slightly slack on each

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.610 
there's an easy slightly slack on each
step<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:21.989> taking<00:02:22.320> little<00:02:22.440> steps

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
step and it's just taking little steps

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.770 
step and it's just taking little steps
backwards<00:02:24.650> obviously<00:02:25.650> if<00:02:25.739> I<00:02:25.830> was<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.600> have<00:02:27.600> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
backwards obviously if I was to have the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.080 
backwards obviously if I was to have the
thighs<00:02:28.019> move<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.010> knees<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.489> soul<00:02:29.760> move

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
thighs move and the knees and soul move

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.850 
thighs move and the knees and soul move
on<00:02:30.360> each<00:02:30.480> step<00:02:30.810> then<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.260> probably<00:02:31.560> would<00:02:31.709> walk

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
on each step then it probably would walk

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.410 
on each step then it probably would walk
forwards<00:02:34.400> okay<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:35.459> what<00:02:35.700> I've<00:02:35.790> got<00:02:36.000> here<00:02:36.209> is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
forwards okay so what I've got here is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.420 
forwards okay so what I've got here is
some<00:02:36.450> these<00:02:37.080> gyroscopes<00:02:37.860> which<00:02:38.220> are

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
some these gyroscopes which are

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.009 
some these gyroscopes which are
basically<00:02:38.820> from<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.630> company<00:02:39.989> called

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
basically from a company called

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.880 
basically from a company called
hobbyking<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.610> HK<00:02:42.120> 401<00:02:42.810> gyroscope<00:02:43.590> they

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
hobbyking the HK 401 gyroscope they

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.060 
hobbyking the HK 401 gyroscope they
basically<00:02:44.070> radio-controlled<00:02:45.030> gyroscopes

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
basically radio-controlled gyroscopes

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.710 
basically radio-controlled gyroscopes
and<00:02:47.070> those<00:02:47.250> are<00:02:47.489> basically<00:02:47.910> wide<00:02:48.209> in<00:02:48.510> line

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
and those are basically wide in line

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.140 
and those are basically wide in line
with<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.049> servo<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.040> they've<00:02:50.190> literally<00:02:50.489> got<00:02:50.760> an

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
with a servo so they've literally got an

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.059 
with a servo so they've literally got an
a<00:02:51.470> servo<00:02:52.470> connector<00:02:52.769> on<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:55.739> where<00:02:55.950> the

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
a servo connector on and so where the

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.619 
a servo connector on and so where the
survey<00:02:56.459> would<00:02:56.640> plug<00:02:56.849> into<00:02:57.030> your<00:02:57.209> servo

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
survey would plug into your servo

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.000 
survey would plug into your servo
controller<00:02:58.049> there's<00:02:58.409> one<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.620> those<00:02:58.739> on<00:02:58.890> each

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
controller there's one of those on each

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.940 
controller there's one of those on each
side<00:02:59.450> basically<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.689> plug<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:01.049> gyro<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.680> and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
side basically you plug this gyro in and

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.610 
side basically you plug this gyro in and
then<00:03:02.069> you<00:03:02.189> plug<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.989> servo<00:03:03.989> into<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> outlet

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
then you plug the servo into the outlet

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.940 
then you plug the servo into the outlet
of<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.829> gyro<00:03:05.299> so<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.510> gyro<00:03:07.470> uses<00:03:07.769> two

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
of the gyro so the gyro uses two

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.220 
of the gyro so the gyro uses two
channels<00:03:08.370> wonderful<00:03:08.849> position<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.019> can

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
channels wonderful position and you can

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.890 
channels wonderful position and you can
probably<00:03:10.439> see<00:03:10.680> there's<00:03:10.890> another<00:03:11.069> yellow<00:03:11.519> wire

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
probably see there's another yellow wire

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.360 
probably see there's another yellow wire
which<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:12.930> for<00:03:13.200> sensitivity<00:03:13.859> which<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.189> set

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
which is for sensitivity which you set

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.179 
which is for sensitivity which you set
on<00:03:14.400> another<00:03:14.609> another<00:03:15.269> survey<00:03:15.689> channel<00:03:16.189> so

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
on another another survey channel so

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.429 
on another another survey channel so
basically<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:18.030> motion<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.689> serve<00:03:19.019> of

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
basically the motion of the serve of

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.440 
basically the motion of the serve of
these<00:03:19.620> gyros<00:03:20.129> will<00:03:20.370> affect<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.970> position<00:03:21.120> of

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
these gyros will affect the position of

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.199 
these gyros will affect the position of
the<00:03:21.569> servo<00:03:21.750> based<00:03:22.349> on<00:03:22.650> in<00:03:23.609> this<00:03:23.790> case<00:03:24.000> the

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
the servo based on in this case the

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.149 
the servo based on in this case the
motion<00:03:24.389> of<00:03:24.629> the<00:03:24.750> overall<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.500> overall

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
motion of the overall the overall

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.660 
motion of the overall the overall
Android<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.659> I've<00:03:28.440> got<00:03:28.680> two<00:03:29.370> on<00:03:29.489> each<00:03:29.639> side

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
Android so I've got two on each side

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.550 
Android so I've got two on each side
here<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.299> you'll<00:03:30.450> notice<00:03:30.750> they're<00:03:30.959> oriented

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
here and you'll notice they're oriented

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.160 
here and you'll notice they're oriented
in<00:03:31.680> different<00:03:31.980> axes<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:33.389> the<00:03:33.510> ones<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.989> face

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
in different axes so the ones that face

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.039 
in different axes so the ones that face
this<00:03:34.409> way<00:03:34.680> for<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:35.250> side-to-side<00:03:35.609> motion<00:03:36.150> the

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
this way for the side-to-side motion the

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.690 
this way for the side-to-side motion the
ones<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.349> face<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:37.799> way<00:03:38.040> if<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.400> back<00:03:38.579> to

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
ones that face this way if a back to

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.970 
ones that face this way if a back to
front<00:03:38.939> motion<00:03:39.450> which<00:03:40.019> are<00:03:40.200> actually<00:03:40.500> wide<00:03:40.739> in

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
front motion which are actually wide in

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.940 
front motion which are actually wide in
line<00:03:41.129> with<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.760> thigh<00:03:42.659> servos<00:03:43.319> on<00:03:43.560> each<00:03:43.680> side

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
line with the thigh servos on each side

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.009 
line with the thigh servos on each side
and<00:03:44.579> around<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.269> other<00:03:45.389> side<00:03:45.659> there's

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
and around the other side there's

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.190 
and around the other side there's
another<00:03:46.079> two<00:03:47.389> so<00:03:48.389> those<00:03:48.870> basically

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
another two so those basically

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.589 
another two so those basically
compensate<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.099> position<00:03:50.549> of<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.849> servos<00:03:51.299> as

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
compensate the position of the servos as

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.750 
compensate the position of the servos as
the<00:03:51.810> Android<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.319> moving<00:03:52.739> side<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.069> side<00:03:53.220> now

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
the Android is moving side to side now

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.659 
the Android is moving side to side now
I've<00:03:54.750> got<00:03:54.959> another<00:03:55.260> one<00:03:55.410> here<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:56.310> that<00:03:56.370> does

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
I've got another one here and that does

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.270 
I've got another one here and that does
something<00:03:57.000> quite<00:03:57.120> different<00:03:57.980> basically<00:03:58.980> if

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
something quite different basically if

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.189 
something quite different basically if
we<00:03:59.310> look<00:03:59.609> down<00:03:59.639> in<00:04:00.030> here<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.449> can<00:04:00.599> see<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:00.840> green

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
we look down in here you can see a green

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:06.830 
we look down in here you can see a green
LED<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:03.019> as<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.169> turn<00:04:04.410> this<00:04:05.329> you'll<00:04:06.329> notice<00:04:06.480> the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
LED and as I turn this you'll notice the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.949 
LED and as I turn this you'll notice the
LED<00:04:07.049> toggling<00:04:07.799> on<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.159> off<00:04:08.419> and<00:04:09.419> again<00:04:09.659> we<00:04:09.780> can

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
LED toggling on and off and again we can

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.839 
LED toggling on and off and again we can
set<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.230> sensitivity<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.159> the<00:04:11.250> thresholds

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
set the sensitivity in the thresholds

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.909 
set the sensitivity in the thresholds
for<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:13.049> that<00:04:13.230> one<00:04:13.409> is<00:04:13.440> actually

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
for that so that one is actually

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.890 
for that so that one is actually
measuring<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.519> side-to-side<00:04:14.940> movement<00:04:15.449> of

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
measuring the side-to-side movement of

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.229 
measuring the side-to-side movement of
the<00:04:15.989> Android<00:04:16.409> and<00:04:16.859> that's<00:04:17.370> compensating<00:04:18.120> the

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
the Android and that's compensating the

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.700 
the Android and that's compensating the
timers<00:04:19.310> which<00:04:20.310> are<00:04:20.489> controlling<00:04:20.909> the

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
timers which are controlling the

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.770 
timers which are controlling the
position<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.919> servos<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:24.060> basically<00:04:24.479> this

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
position of the servos so basically this

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.050 
position of the servos so basically this
gyro<00:04:25.199> is<00:04:25.409> controlling<00:04:25.979> its<00:04:26.130> time<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:26.970> it

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
gyro is controlling its time that it

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.550 
gyro is controlling its time that it
moves<00:04:27.240> that<00:04:27.419> as<00:04:27.510> an<00:04:27.630> falls<00:04:27.870> which<00:04:28.169> is<00:04:28.320> around

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
moves that as an falls which is around

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.129 
moves that as an falls which is around
300<00:04:29.070> milliseconds<00:04:29.330> plus<00:04:30.330> or<00:04:30.479> minus<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:30.990> bit

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
300 milliseconds plus or minus a bit

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.589 
300 milliseconds plus or minus a bit
depending<00:04:31.560> on<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:32.639> stages<00:04:33.060> of<00:04:33.090> this<00:04:33.330> green

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
depending on the stages of this green

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.680 
depending on the stages of this green
light<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:35.400> gyros<00:04:35.820> on<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.000> side<00:04:36.300> will

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.860 
light and the gyros on the side will
compensate<00:04:37.260> for<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.530> movement<00:04:38.630> now<00:04:39.630> I've<00:04:39.720> got

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
compensate for the movement now I've got

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.629 
compensate for the movement now I've got
gyros<00:04:40.349> further<00:04:40.680> down<00:04:40.949> as<00:04:41.130> well

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
gyros further down as well

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.240 
gyros further down as well
so<00:04:42.150> I've<00:04:42.270> got<00:04:42.449> one<00:04:42.630> on<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.840> knee<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.380> I've

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
so I've got one on the knee and I've

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.990 
so I've got one on the knee and I've
also<00:04:44.400> got<00:04:44.729> one<00:04:44.880> on<00:04:45.000> each<00:04:45.120> ankle<00:04:46.729> and<00:04:47.729> if<00:04:47.880> we

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
also got one on each ankle and if we

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.990 
also got one on each ankle and if we
give<00:04:48.150> this<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.330> shove

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
give this a shove

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.629 
give this a shove
it<00:04:51.000> should<00:04:51.240> be<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.510> see<00:04:51.690> those<00:04:52.639> effectively

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
it should be to see those effectively

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.589 
it should be to see those effectively
what<00:04:53.849> are<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.090> Achilles<00:04:54.479> tendons

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
what are the Achilles tendons

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.029 
what are the Achilles tendons
compensating<00:04:57.599> for<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.810> motion<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.530> also<00:04:58.889> the

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
compensating for the motion and also the

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.390 
compensating for the motion and also the
knees

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.640 

so<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:03.030> should<00:05:03.210> keep<00:05:03.360> it<00:05:03.510> stable<00:05:03.990> back<00:05:04.500> to

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
so that should keep it stable back to

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.110 
so that should keep it stable back to
France<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.280> as<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.180> say<00:05:06.390> these<00:05:07.110> ones<00:05:08.120> operating

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
France and as I say these ones operating

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.580 
France and as I say these ones operating
the<00:05:09.180> thighs<00:05:09.420> so<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:09.870> will<00:05:10.080> keep<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.350> thighs

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
the thighs so that will keep the thighs

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.560 
the thighs so that will keep the thighs
that<00:05:10.950> he<00:05:11.010> will<00:05:11.130> back<00:05:11.250> to<00:05:11.280> front<00:05:11.640> so<00:05:12.330> when<00:05:12.450> it's

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
that he will back to front so when it's

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.540 
that he will back to front so when it's
actually<00:05:12.720> walking<00:05:13.350> all<00:05:13.830> of<00:05:14.070> those<00:05:14.220> three

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
actually walking all of those three

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.110 
actually walking all of those three
gyros<00:05:15.030> wide<00:05:15.330> in<00:05:15.510> line<00:05:15.660> with<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:15.990> servos

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
gyros wide in line with the servos

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.000 
gyros wide in line with the servos
basically<00:05:18.120> should<00:05:18.420> maintain<00:05:19.080> his<00:05:19.440> back<00:05:19.860> to

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
basically should maintain his back to

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.930 
basically should maintain his back to
front<00:05:20.190> stability<00:05:21.980> in<00:05:22.980> terms<00:05:23.220> of<00:05:23.370> electronics

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
front stability in terms of electronics

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.300 
front stability in terms of electronics
I've<00:05:24.660> got<00:05:24.930> two<00:05:25.170> batteries<00:05:25.650> which<00:05:25.920> are<00:05:26.070> nickel

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
I've got two batteries which are nickel

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.860 
I've got two batteries which are nickel
metal<00:05:26.460> hydride<00:05:26.610> packs<00:05:27.300> they're<00:05:27.600> actually

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
metal hydride packs they're actually

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.650 
metal hydride packs they're actually
racing<00:05:28.290> packs<00:05:28.500> for<00:05:28.650> radio-controlled<00:05:29.370> cars

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
racing packs for radio-controlled cars

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.160 
racing packs for radio-controlled cars
those<00:05:30.660> are<00:05:30.810> wired<00:05:30.990> in<00:05:31.140> series<00:05:32.810> so<00:05:33.810> at<00:05:33.870> seven

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
those are wired in series so at seven

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.420 
those are wired in series so at seven
point<00:05:34.290> two<00:05:34.410> volts<00:05:34.530> so<00:05:35.010> I<00:05:35.070> should<00:05:35.280> have

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
point two volts so I should have

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.070 
point two volts so I should have
fourteen<00:05:35.790> point<00:05:36.060> four<00:05:36.270> volts<00:05:36.690> of<00:05:36.840> actually

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
fourteen point four volts of actually

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.020 
fourteen point four volts of actually
got<00:05:37.200> 15<00:05:37.620> point<00:05:37.920> 2<00:05:37.980> or<00:05:38.340> higher<00:05:38.490> because<00:05:38.850> they've

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
got 15 point 2 or higher because they've

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.090 
got 15 point 2 or higher because they've
just<00:05:39.180> been<00:05:39.360> charged<00:05:39.810> so<00:05:40.620> this<00:05:40.740> level<00:05:40.920> displays

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
just been charged so this level displays

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.240 
just been charged so this level displays
metering<00:05:41.940> the<00:05:42.170> voltage<00:05:43.170> of<00:05:43.380> 15<00:05:43.500> point<00:05:43.920> two<00:05:44.040> and

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
metering the voltage of 15 point two and

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.620 
metering the voltage of 15 point two and
the<00:05:44.340> current<00:05:44.670> draw<00:05:44.880> one<00:05:45.030> hundred<00:05:45.240> and<00:05:45.330> sixty

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
the current draw one hundred and sixty

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.840 
the current draw one hundred and sixty
milliamps<00:05:46.200> it<00:05:46.830> goes<00:05:47.040> up<00:05:47.220> to<00:05:47.250> just<00:05:47.550> under<00:05:47.790> an

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
milliamps it goes up to just under an

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.570 
milliamps it goes up to just under an
amp<00:05:48.030> when<00:05:48.270> it's<00:05:48.390> in<00:05:48.510> motion<00:05:49.190> I've<00:05:50.190> got<00:05:50.490> an

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
amp when it's in motion I've got an

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.750 
amp when it's in motion I've got an
infrared<00:05:50.850> receiver<00:05:51.090> here<00:05:52.430> so<00:05:53.430> I<00:05:53.460> can

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
infrared receiver here so I can

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.580 
infrared receiver here so I can
basically<00:05:54.240> activate<00:05:54.900> different<00:05:55.080> routines

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
basically activate different routines

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.860 
basically activate different routines
with<00:05:55.890> an<00:05:56.010> infrared<00:05:56.280> remote<00:05:56.550> and<00:05:57.060> then<00:05:57.690> there's

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
with an infrared remote and then there's

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.950 
with an infrared remote and then there's
two<00:05:58.050> microcontrollers<00:05:59.010> they're<00:05:59.310> both<00:05:59.430> picaxe

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
two microcontrollers they're both picaxe

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.780 
two microcontrollers they're both picaxe
microcontrollers<00:06:00.960> an<00:06:01.080> 18x<00:06:01.830> microcontroller

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
microcontrollers an 18x microcontroller

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.020 
microcontrollers an 18x microcontroller
on<00:06:03.120> an<00:06:04.050> 18<00:06:04.410> X<00:06:04.650> project<00:06:05.040> board<00:06:05.430> and<00:06:05.730> also<00:06:05.850> a

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
on an 18 X project board and also a

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.440 
on an 18 X project board and also a
no-no<00:06:06.840> 8<00:06:07.110> M<00:06:07.410> -<00:06:07.860> I<00:06:07.890> think<00:06:08.040> it<00:06:08.310> is<00:06:08.340> I<00:06:08.640> happen<00:06:09.330> to

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
no-no 8 M - I think it is I happen to

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.870 
no-no 8 M - I think it is I happen to
have<00:06:09.660> and<00:06:10.200> so<00:06:10.890> this<00:06:11.070> one<00:06:11.250> it's<00:06:11.430> got<00:06:11.550> the<00:06:11.670> green

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
have and so this one it's got the green

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.510 
have and so this one it's got the green
light<00:06:11.910> on<00:06:13.040> that<00:06:15.800> it's<00:06:16.800> been<00:06:17.010> controlled<00:06:17.430> by

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
light on that it's been controlled by

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.720 
light on that it's been controlled by
this<00:06:17.640> gyro<00:06:18.320> so<00:06:19.320> that's<00:06:19.500> reading<00:06:19.890> the<00:06:20.010> PWM<00:06:20.580> from

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
this gyro so that's reading the PWM from

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.400 
this gyro so that's reading the PWM from
the<00:06:20.820> gyro<00:06:21.270> and<00:06:21.300> turning<00:06:21.810> the<00:06:21.900> light<00:06:22.080> on<00:06:22.110> and

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
the gyro and turning the light on and

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.860 
the gyro and turning the light on and
off<00:06:22.440> accordingly<00:06:23.120> and<00:06:24.120> then<00:06:24.300> the<00:06:24.510> signal

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
off accordingly and then the signal

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.600 
off accordingly and then the signal
comes<00:06:25.080> on<00:06:25.260> this<00:06:25.380> green<00:06:25.680> wire<00:06:25.920> to<00:06:26.100> an<00:06:26.190> input<00:06:26.580> of

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
comes on this green wire to an input of

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.370 
comes on this green wire to an input of
the<00:06:26.910> main<00:06:27.090> microcontroller<00:06:27.900> that's

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
the main microcontroller that's

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.410 
the main microcontroller that's
basically<00:06:28.830> controlling<00:06:29.280> all<00:06:29.580> of<00:06:29.730> the<00:06:29.880> servo

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
basically controlling all of the servo

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.290 
basically controlling all of the servo
controllers<00:06:31.020> so<00:06:31.950> two<00:06:32.190> servo<00:06:32.520> controllers<00:06:33.120> one

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
controllers so two servo controllers one

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.910 
controllers so two servo controllers one
on<00:06:33.420> each<00:06:33.540> side<00:06:33.810> these<00:06:34.050> are<00:06:34.110> polluting<00:06:34.680> mini

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920 
on each side these are polluting mini

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.380 
on each side these are polluting mini
maestro's<00:06:35.490> and<00:06:35.760> I<00:06:35.790> think<00:06:36.000> they're<00:06:36.120> twelve

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
maestro's and I think they're twelve

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.040 
maestro's and I think they're twelve
channels<00:06:36.630> each<00:06:37.400> and<00:06:38.690> there's<00:06:39.690> one<00:06:39.840> for<00:06:40.020> each

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
channels each and there's one for each

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.190 
channels each and there's one for each
leg<00:06:40.380> basically<00:06:41.360> so<00:06:42.360> there's<00:06:42.690> quite<00:06:42.960> a<00:06:42.990> lot<00:06:43.170> of

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
leg basically so there's quite a lot of

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.470 
leg basically so there's quite a lot of
adjustments<00:06:43.800> to<00:06:43.830> make<00:06:44.010> to<00:06:44.220> this<00:06:44.310> now<00:06:44.550> I'm

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480 
adjustments to make to this now I'm

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.990 
adjustments to make to this now I'm
hoping<00:06:45.660> to<00:06:45.930> have<00:06:46.020> a<00:06:46.080> slightly<00:06:46.860> slower<00:06:47.310> moving

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
hoping to have a slightly slower moving

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.640 
hoping to have a slightly slower moving
backwards<00:06:48.690> and<00:06:48.840> side<00:06:49.740> to<00:06:49.920> side<00:06:49.950> moving<00:06:50.610> gait

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
backwards and side to side moving gait

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.190 
backwards and side to side moving gait
to<00:06:52.650> try<00:06:52.830> and<00:06:52.950> actually<00:06:53.040> get<00:06:53.280> some<00:06:53.430> steps<00:06:53.760> in

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
to try and actually get some steps in

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.080 
to try and actually get some steps in
because<00:06:55.200> moving<00:06:55.500> as<00:06:55.950> it<00:06:56.070> is<00:06:56.220> there's<00:06:56.820> not<00:06:57.030> very

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
because moving as it is there's not very

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.000 
because moving as it is there's not very
much<00:06:57.420> time<00:06:57.630> to<00:06:57.810> actually<00:06:57.960> take<00:06:58.110> big<00:06:58.470> steps<00:06:58.740> in

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
much time to actually take big steps in

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.580 
much time to actually take big steps in
between<00:06:59.130> and<00:06:59.760> basically<00:07:00.600> that<00:07:00.750> timing<00:07:01.170> is<00:07:01.410> set

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
between and basically that timing is set

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.910 
between and basically that timing is set
up<00:07:01.710> just<00:07:01.890> for<00:07:02.010> natural<00:07:02.400> oscillation<00:07:03.470> but<00:07:04.470> I

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:04.920 
up just for natural oscillation but I

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.660 
up just for natural oscillation but I
need<00:07:05.340> to<00:07:05.490> place<00:07:05.640> a<00:07:05.670> V<00:07:05.880> experiment<00:07:06.570> with<00:07:06.750> the

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:07.670 
need to place a V experiment with the

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.190 
need to place a V experiment with the
acceleration<00:07:08.670> speed<00:07:09.150> settings<00:07:09.600> of<00:07:09.750> the<00:07:09.840> servo

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
acceleration speed settings of the servo

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.750 
acceleration speed settings of the servo
controllers<00:07:10.860> so<00:07:11.040> I<00:07:11.070> can<00:07:11.280> slow<00:07:11.490> the<00:07:11.640> whole

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:11.760 
controllers so I can slow the whole

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.480 
controllers so I can slow the whole
thing<00:07:12.000> down<00:07:12.180> and<00:07:12.240> still<00:07:12.720> get<00:07:12.930> quite<00:07:13.140> a

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.490 
thing down and still get quite a

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.939 
thing down and still get quite a
a<00:07:13.520> sort<00:07:13.880> of<00:07:13.910> smooth<00:07:14.240> motion<00:07:14.750> it's<00:07:15.590> all<00:07:15.680> I<00:07:15.830> need

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:15.949 
a sort of smooth motion it's all I need

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:18.279 
a sort of smooth motion it's all I need
to<00:07:16.069> do<00:07:16.190> to<00:07:16.520> set<00:07:17.060> this<00:07:17.180> off<00:07:17.360> is<00:07:17.599> to<00:07:17.870> just<00:07:18.050> press<00:07:18.259> a

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:18.289 
to do to set this off is to just press a

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:23.710 
to do to set this off is to just press a
button<00:07:18.380> on<00:07:18.710> here<00:07:21.580> and<00:07:22.580> that<00:07:22.729> just<00:07:22.759> triggers<00:07:23.630> an

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720 
button on here and that just triggers an

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.230 
button on here and that just triggers an
endless<00:07:24.050> loop<00:07:24.819> oscillating<00:07:25.819> backwards<00:07:26.150> and

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 
endless loop oscillating backwards and

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.529 
endless loop oscillating backwards and
forwards<00:07:27.310> so<00:07:28.310> all<00:07:28.639> that's<00:07:28.759> doing<00:07:29.000> is<00:07:29.300> reading

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:29.539 
forwards so all that's doing is reading

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:31.629 
forwards so all that's doing is reading
the<00:07:29.949> side<00:07:30.949> to<00:07:31.160> side

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:31.639 
the side to side

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:35.650 
the side to side
tipping<00:07:31.970> gyro<00:07:33.699> having<00:07:34.699> a<00:07:34.789> bit<00:07:34.940> of<00:07:35.030> time<00:07:35.240> to<00:07:35.539> it

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:35.660 
tipping gyro having a bit of time to it

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.140 
tipping gyro having a bit of time to it
and<00:07:35.960> then<00:07:36.590> sending<00:07:37.009> the<00:07:37.130> Android<00:07:37.550> back<00:07:37.940> the

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.150 
and then sending the Android back the

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.719 
and then sending the Android back the
other<00:07:38.270> way<00:07:38.360> with<00:07:38.810> the<00:07:38.840> two<00:07:39.080> hip<00:07:39.410> servos<00:07:40.370> and

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:40.729 
other way with the two hip servos and

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:43.390 
other way with the two hip servos and
the<00:07:41.660> positions<00:07:42.110> for<00:07:42.349> those<00:07:42.470> hip<00:07:42.740> servos<00:07:43.190> are

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400 
the positions for those hip servos are

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.939 
the positions for those hip servos are
compensated<00:07:44.210> by<00:07:44.419> the<00:07:44.479> gyros<00:07:45.199> which<00:07:45.590> they<00:07:45.830> are

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:45.949 
compensated by the gyros which they are

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:49.300 
compensated by the gyros which they are
wide<00:07:46.159> in<00:07:46.370> iron<00:07:46.580> with<00:07:47.259> so<00:07:48.259> far<00:07:48.530> that's<00:07:49.039> how<00:07:49.250> it

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:49.310 
wide in iron with so far that's how it

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.550 
wide in iron with so far that's how it
works
