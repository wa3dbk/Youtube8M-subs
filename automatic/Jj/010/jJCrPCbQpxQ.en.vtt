00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.950
 Hello everyone today we have to review not 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.570
 top device 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.610
 I specifically did not want to take any 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.160
 flagship because flagship and shoots everything 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.320
 And these all surveyors are not interested 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.940
 budget structure and srednyachki and after 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.980
 they are bought by a lot of people who 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.870
 flagships are not needed in principle because 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.520
 they need this device to call well 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.040
 and somehow more or less normal 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.990
 worked but they are not removed and I decided 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.750
 correct this unfortunate omission to help 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.070
 htc desire 500 26 g 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.070
 let's look at it 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:07.530
 and we begin by tradition with design and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.280
 front assembly then old familiar poems 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.119
 baths 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.890
 and still force one x clearly remember came out already 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.610
 2012 therefore the front panel 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.039
 looks 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.220
 a little bit archaic though she is quite 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:22.770
 recognizable behind the situation is another 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.720
 because here we see a panel which 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.090
 overall fits into a scape 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.509
 but in principle it does not copy any 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.920
 the smartphone is plastic back glossy and it is 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.240
 not so glossy plastic which 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.310
 usually used to see in the rest 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.740
 smartphones it is really nice on 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.600
 touch and moreover he does not collect 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.060
 prints at least on white 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.340
 models and the final cherry in design 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.409
 is coloring in aqua 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.020
 all but this sidebar is not 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.659
 painted back lettering camera bezel 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.789
 the light is really cool and more 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.470
 if you look at it under the sauce you can see 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.860
 how different shimmer on it 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.780
 sparkles this mega cool mega stylish very 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.519
 beautiful and generally respect the designer 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.440
 who came up with the location 

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:06.119
 elements here are very classic on top 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.580
 this is a three and a half millimeter connector 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.110
 below this is a microphone charging socket 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.940
 and on the right is the control keys 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.250
 volume on increase 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.099
 smartphone and now to the assembly as if 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.300
 well did not go keys in the whole body 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.000
 squeaks 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.290
 and crunches even if you're just here 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.840
 so squeeze in your hand 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.920
 there was an unpleasant crunch I do not understand 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.050
 why it was impossible to take this 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.980
 soundproofing with buttons and wind it up 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.590
 whole body 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.390
 everything would be fine yes I understand that here 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.300
 removable battery cover 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.040
 but still 2015 is the year of the court all this 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.409
 you can do so that everything is perfect for 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.409
 brought each other no creak 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.420
 performance operation of the device 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:52.109
 inside installed processor mtk 6582 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.480
 video accelerator mali-400 mpeg-1 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.849
 gigabytes of ram in principle 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.260
 this is a very weak bundle agree for 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.750
 the fact that the screen here has a small 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.120
 permission everything goes with a bang even nova 3 y 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.950
 here we run without prizes without lags 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.959
 and in general the device can work 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.560
 compare with those device 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.840
 build two two and a half times more expensive 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.310
 but again this is all behind the screen which you 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.439
 you can not watch it more than ten 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.189
 minutes and the taxi app all games go 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:22.769
 great questions no of course there you are not 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:25.349
 run him dragon 5 you don't run and 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.439
 one more thing is the fact that 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:31.709
 the shell here is stripped down seemingly htc 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:33.180
 corporate sense right now is an option here 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.090
 all stripped down branded applications 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.819
 only two this camera and gallery 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.400
 google calendar dialer from google a 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.109
 calculator from google message from google 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.419
 and total all google except these two 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.579
 applications and moreover sense here 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:50.159
 cut down so that there is no firm 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.739
 customization no those yes nothing at all 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:55.199
 even the folders are not properly set up therefore 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.319
 here it works and just keep in mind that 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.519
 the moment this smartphone sounds 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.199
 headphones it sounds more or less 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.970
 ok because settings can 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.340
 find a tick that will improve the quality 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.799
 sound and will throw at once the factory pleasant 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.019
 calocier external nike first he 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.229
 located racially true that is ahead 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.479
 no left no side no bottom no under 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.310
 the cover that is, its already really complicated 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:20.280
 so block and the speaker goes right to you 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.349
 ears but do not get fooled by the fact that there is very 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.750
 many holes and you might think supposedly 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:27.599
 here speakers 2 he is one and he is below 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.729
 above only conversational well and about him 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.620
 qualities can say the following he 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.150
 has nothing to do with 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.550
 speakers that are installed 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.320
 flagship models one is just 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.289
 speakers which has a large margin 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.389
 loudness and try not to wheeze at 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.039
 the biggest ones Iâ€™ll emphasize exactly what 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.400
 try because a little bit they 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.000
 still pahari will be but for such ideas 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.340
 and this is basically normal going further 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.199
 the camera is here 8 but not out of 10 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.930
 but just megapixels and pictures 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:05:00.289
 it turns out so-so who is not a document 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.539
 take a picture only and come down well and 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.210
 battery she's here just two thousand 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.280
 milliampere hours but low resolution 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.880
 screen 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.340
 energy efficient processor and 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.800
 thoughtful work of two radio modules 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.759
 give us the date that the phone is much more 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.100
 one day and 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.440
 more or less active, that is, you are constantly 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.229
 you can name two simok you can 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.090
 delve into the internet mail tank thread in 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.370
 Father only for a long time do not look or even 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.690
 your eyes will flow and as a result you have a smartphone 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:32.360
 all did in a day and a half somewhere like that a 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.780
 if you do not use much then after 2 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.449
 that is, you charged in the morning went in the morning 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.820
 returned to work later that evening 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.580
 once went to work back and here 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.169
 Only then he will sit down well, that is, and 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.289
 just do not need to consume the battery 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.449
 so he works so long I summarize 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.940
 for all the time testing this desire 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.710
 I thought that this 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.289
 smartphone is made for any 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.900
 1 category of people for specific tasks 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.250
 now let's model the situation you 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.560
 office employee 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.570
 you went to the office to work and you have 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.330
 this smartphone you most likely 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.310
 You gave the authorities on the consignment note and all 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.440
 what you need to do with it is to take 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.260
 calls or reject them from unwanted 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.280
 customers and maybe sometimes 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.830
 photograph documents that you 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.570
 You can send to colleagues as a bonus here. 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.340
 there is a nice look that again 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.440
 you when you go to the canteen with colleagues 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.599
 you could somehow stand out because 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.310
 all the other one hundred percent not simpletons 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:30.320
 in a cheap android smartphone which are 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.169
 is it a dull black square 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.300
 they cannot be distinguished from each other that is for 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.460
 specific tasks this smartphone is perfect 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.380
 fits that is here for office 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.389
 employees but with all the rest 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.050
 tasks that it can 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:44.870
 fold 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.930
 The screen does not cope at all 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.770
 the camera is not very sound multimedia mi he is not 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.479
 multimedia 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.539
 ian and he's loud just to 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:55.550
 again did not miss the call here and here 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:58.400
 all that is, this smartphone will do 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.500
 excellent at all office staff but 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.840
 or those who have no money there at all 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.539
 You really need two radio modules of active 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.150
 everything is not necessary to build illusions it is not 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:11.030
 flagship who can do anything anytime, anywhere 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.729
 at any moment there is no specific task 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.740
 specific device 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:18.680
 That's how it was a review of htc desire 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.690

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:27.979
 in general, whatever you want me to do 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:29.720
 I will only be glad to see our next video. 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:31.789
 take just some kind of flagship and 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.520
 try to find in it those moments that 

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:36.740
 will cost him who will be in it 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.020
 worse for everyone in this budget device 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.030
 and that the flagship will clearly remember my 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:47.319
 about 5-6 times more expensive than this 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:47.319
 see the device yet . 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.650
 important
