00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:02.899
 the methanisation of plastics occupy an important place 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.009
 in many industries like perfumery cosmetics sanitary 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.249
 or the automobile 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.119
 as does not report developed and developed within its laboratories 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.939
 processes that allow a plastic part of the 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.939
 Greece to become a producer 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.269
 during this visit 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.519
 you will discover the different stages chemistry break the policies 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.859
 necessary for the metallization of plastics at the industrial level 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.580
 carefully fixed on mounting bars raw parts are ready 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.760
 to be treated in the different points 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.880
 the first step is to go beyond them and eliminate the 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.330
 packing dust 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.010
 as you can see their surface has an average roughness 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.010
 of the order of 25 meters 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.920
 they are then immersed for 5 to 15 minutes in a bar of this maj to 68 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.950
 degrees celsius based on sulfuric acid and this chronic 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.160
 by oxidation the surface of the plastic 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
 we note a roughness of the order of 240 meters 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.510
 it's that you have to revisit can be highlighted by microscope at 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.840
 electronic scanning as can be seen in our station 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.130
 it is to avoid mounting on an anchorage the different qualities layers of 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.650
 nickel copper the chrome that will be deposited later 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.420
 the pieces will now be re-rolled several times before being 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.370
 immersed in a bath of ten hours of negotiations 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.790
 this one will reduce the hexavalent chromium road lying time surface of 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.850
 pieces found in hand 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.070
 hexavalent chromium years is indeed a poison for all chemical steps 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.070
 who will follow 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.730
 the catalysis port of the next step allows to deposit in the microphones 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.730
 roughness of the plastic surface of nanoscale particles 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.220
 the city of quebec 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.640
 Following the parts exits sea Aegean in a bandit of acceleration 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.100
 vision is a little bit his train crash 4 and palladium lesions are reduced in 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.290
 palladium weather 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.530
 the surface of the parts and thereby activated to allow the filing of 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.920
 nickel chili 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.650
 palladium makes it possible to initiate the oxidation-reduction reaction 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.110
 production of units as short as possible technically possible 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.920
 they are then covered with a single maintenance deposit of 0 2 to 0 4 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:17.629
 micron thick 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.450
 the pieces are now conductive maybe destabilized by way 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.450
 electronic 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.269
 to strengthen the chemical nickel layer 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.519
 the coins are then he puts it into play in a copper bar 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.990
 it is also possible to substitute a nickel bar 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.990
 copper electrolytic straete 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.540
 copper steel copper deposits of a thickness of about 20 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.529
 microgram 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:58.349
 this one allows to double the surface in order to obtain a very final deposit 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.339
 bright 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.979
 this fundamental ductile layer to be able to withstand the tensions without 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:04.879
 sink into a thermal shock 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.879
 avoid the formation of cracks 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.319
 the brilliant nickel deposit of a thickness of 5 to 7 minutes chrono 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.949
 brings just brilliant aspect 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.529
 in the automotive field for example in order to increase the resistance to 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:21.549
 corrosion 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.079
 three layers of nickel are successively used with properties 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.149
 different for each of its costs 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:31.429
 the final deposit of chromium then a thickness of 0 1 to 0 2 microns on 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:34.809
 gives the piece a shiny decorative appearance good resistance to 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:38.689
 shocks and as the corrosion and terrorism at the end of all his 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:39.489
 states 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.370
 so we deposited on the plastic case initially good conductor 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.200
 copper nickel nickel copper educpros 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:53.310
 the parts are now replaced it's at m 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.880
 and carefully checked before being shipped for assembly 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.500
 technicians ensure that it does not present any technical defect nature 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.779
 whether it is 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:05.539
 for the deposit album 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:09.019
 the parts thus treated chemically the electronics 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.019
 can be used in various fields such as perfumery 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:14.139
 these military
