00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 it left very quickly with aïda me 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.960
 it seems the number 10 kazakh brown 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.579
 Kazakh starlight is gone too 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.140
 world number 13 abounded robot their 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.220

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.960
 numbers 12 hollywood hollywood kepa 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.240
 misplaced with also always me 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.770
 does it seem like star light star has the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.450
 number 13 which is maybe otherwise 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.280
 more then was a brown coat which 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.350
 is it also seems to me 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.930
 number 10 saida that is still there that 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.119
 is also played with maybe the number 8 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.700
 cut canvas we will approach the passage 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.369
 of the post with probably number 13 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.329
 e starlight I think he wins on the 8th 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.979
 earlier on the 8th 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.040
 Ouch stars that win it's that 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.970
 it's the 8 ayé toile that are essential 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.290
 in any case we saw that there was 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.329
 movement in the paschal final phase 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.460
 absolutely as usual 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.350
 actually with his pony races 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.810
 and garlic stars this number 8 are holding back 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.280
 vignolles second aida the number ten 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.299
 eight and ten years look the arrival we are going 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.270
 give details in stride well 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.549
 sure pascal 8 so haye star in front of the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.219
 say eide was immediately well placed 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.219
 then third place for the nine 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.979
 sony on the 19th it seems to me 19 by which 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.159
 one is the fourth is the ass 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.119
 mandarin 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.759
 8 10 19 as and 5th the number two the 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.050
 number two and then the 6th then we go 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.640
 present them by his call both 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.440
 present and so I said the 5 sultan 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.239
 is ridden by ryan nersessian then the 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.980
 winner number 8 you said it ouch 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.569
 star and mounted by despicable hortense 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.890
 it's absolutely out of time 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.230
 vineyard for the pony-club of 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.980
 brimborions second place so for 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.610
 aida associated with louis will double for the 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.709
 jardy stud 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.260
 here is the stud de jardy which second of 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.330
 the 3rd race we still have the stud 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.250
 jardy with one ena the big ones 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.870

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.690
 the second and third jardy stud 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.980

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.629
 tangerine mounted by aissa azzouzi 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.980
 so who finishes fourth the fifth 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.230
 place you said it is taken by 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.970

 el amel on the 12 hollywood there was my 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.870
 no old teeth on the very star ac 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.090
 with ludivine darbon holds 14 yasmin 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.959
 had shouted darbon on lustucru the 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.180
 15th and marie adélie dekalb aulas on the 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.120
 16 rebels were there in queiroz on 17 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.769
 words there was charlotte firecrackers 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.920
 on the 18 aulas there was one is that of the 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.659
 case what is safe 19 moon it was said 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.920
 with the Negroes esi watch passage of the 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.840
 post going to Hollywood 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.700
 Ouch stars by don hay gold stars when 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.200
 this puppet who wins with two lengths 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.060
 advanced anyway that's call it's 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.379
 true who went then we do not know if 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.970
 she went up behind the 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.280
 leader in any case she went through the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.810
 track for himself 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.130
 in my opinion she is a little bit taken away 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.260
 by his pony because obviously the 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.880
 ponies discover this beautiful line 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.990
 right of the racecourse of longchamp 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.450
 so they give it to their heart's content 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.400
 a smile anyway hortense who 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.569
 imposed and which effect is essential for 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.930
 Rambouillet clubs where you can see the view 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.600
 front 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.090
 that's with the leader who was led by 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.090
 marianne raymond who took all 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.050
 this little troop to success and 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.000
 and then she left then 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.770
 obviously in the very last alley 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.190
 phase of the straight line and the 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.910
 competitors therefore take the lead for 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.680
 prevail 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.109

 hortense to win at the end of 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.080

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.940

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.370
