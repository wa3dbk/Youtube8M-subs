00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.140
 say a little discriminated in this 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.359
 work we do because we do not 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.460

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.789
 Communication 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.710

 common use for all professionals 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.270
 liberals that are normally discriminated against 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.910
 so with holistic therapy this 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.370
 tool is also what marketing is 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.610
 marketing is a tool coming 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.760
 administration that serves to help us 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.820
 the issue of attracting the issue of 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.189

 approach you for who you are and why 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.659
 vibration you transmit and when we 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.640
 we are in this area of ​​therapy 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.490
 this occurs even as the highest frequency 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.649
 people like to identify and 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.840
 approach marketing has a 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.509
 extremely important tool in the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.970
 prospecting new customers to attract 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.850
 these new friends that we will do 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.430
 in this therapy work that are price 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.740
 square product promotion 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.810
 each of these weights help us 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.729
 different ways for example the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.950
 square issue 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.500
 usually we saw our colleagues 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.890
 therapists set up their offices and 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.620
 no no no looking for a more suitable location 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.110
 let's say so to ride 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.959
 these points your point of sale your 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.970
 point of service with that forget in 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.120
 important basic details that 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.519
 are every time a point is set 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.970
 there have to be two main factors 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.769
 a good easy access to him and he 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.930
 It has to be how we work in the area. 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.840
 Silent holistic therapy 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.849
 It seems counter contradicting but 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.560
 It does not have to be peaceful and 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.200
 same time it has to be 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.319
 an easily accessible location that people 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.870
 able to reach by bus subways 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.030
 and everything else and at the same time put a 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.190
 quiet place where there is not much 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.200
 because it is because we know that the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.810
 excessive noise disrupts during 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.390
 consultations on the price issue we 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.670
 we observe that people define the price 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.379
 based on what the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.720
 market also offers a great deal of 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.030
 mistake because the appreciation of a 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.340
 product should be considered several 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.489
 aspects first what are the costs 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.299
 What do I have to do this service? 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.739
 of these costs 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.870
 I have to put after that 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.700
 able to account for them unfold them 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.040
 to account for them I have to put 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.139
 a profit margin because the cost will be 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.690
 simply to pay for the expenses 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.480
 I have over that place of which 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.049
 I am putting this unfolding of 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.849
 value 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.160
 it simply serves to pay the 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.290
 costs you will have to make 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.419
 that service and you need 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.790
 define a net amount that will be the 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:44.849
 your income from attendance 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.099
 never forget the value you draw for 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.230
 expenditure shall cover expenditure on 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.419
 value that you take as your own 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.859
 Your profit is good for your 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.970
 personal expenses are two things 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.099
 different 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.980
 then the pressure must always be 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.410
 based on expenses and what you 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.120
 I want to recipe for later yes 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.730
 set the final price 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.139
 the other item is also the issue of 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.079
 promotion 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.090
 the promotion she is confused directly 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.459
 with the question of settlement and discount 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.829
 only the promotion is not he who gives samba 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.169
 discount for you is a coming word 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.590
 of the word promote what it means 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.789
 disseminate and disseminate what 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.970
 you do 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:29.220
 there is another very serious error 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.350
 the following people do not do the 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.410
 work to publicize their spaces 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.290
 his work as a therapist thinking that 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.510
 after he does a certain training 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.000
 professional will going to have a huge queue 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.760
 of people wanting to meet with her 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.100
 It's an illusion because people need 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.020
 interested in that product which 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.940
 you're bidding for it if 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.670
 interested in this product that you are 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.640
 it is important that you do 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.640
 business cards folders participate in 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.310
 radio interviews if possible on tv 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.010
 be a columnist for a newspaper or 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.290
 a newspaper in your neighborhood is from a magazine 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.210
 and so on there are many 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.700
 tools that help us in this 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.220
 issue of publicizing our work 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.820
 the other main point and the 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.750
 determinant is the product you are 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.810
 offering 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.270
 do not forget to talk about selling a product is 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.030
 one thing to sell a service that is what 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.480
 What you do is another story. 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.330
 The product you can feel will be to give 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.580
 for someone to touch the service, not 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.890
 people decide to do therapy with you 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.780
 as a matter of fact it implies you 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.150
 even talk all the work you do 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.820
 for these people but what defines them 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.880
 she will do with you is not to say the 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.650
 your intimate is the final decision of your 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.810
 heart heart who is viewing and 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.669
 then look sometimes people 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.710
 Think it's good now to keep my 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.300
 I gave my practice office my job 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.430
 out there will have a huge queue for 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.100
 answer as I said earlier is not 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.440
 so usually you have to leave 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.440
 that ostracism that you normally 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.080
 develops for a certain 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.660
 little prospecting of the job you 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.300
 It is for people to know then 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.550
 get out of that point get out of that moment that 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.310
 You're in there in a shell. 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.560
 show yourself to people for 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.820
 community shows the service that you 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.010
 can 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.470
 the benefits you can bring these 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.400
 people you sure will not miss 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.770
 customers 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.630
 well see the success of his work he is 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.419
 directly proportional to your connection 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.169
 and the quality service that 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.169
 you will provide
