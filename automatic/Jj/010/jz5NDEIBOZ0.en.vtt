00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.700
The cold has a voice

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.400
It talks to me

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.000
"Stillborn, by choice"

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:49.100
And it airs no need to hold

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.200
Old man feels the cold...

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.400
Oh baby don't - 'Cause I've been told,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.500
Stay on these roads

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.400
We shall meet, I know

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.500
Stay on... My love

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.500
We'll meet, I know, I know...

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.900
Where joy should reign

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.600
These skies restrain

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.500
"Shadow your love..."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.100
The voice trails off again

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.500
And the voice trails off again...

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.600
Old man feels the cold

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.600
Oh baby don't - 'Cause I've been told,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.700
Stay on these roads

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.600
We shall meet, I know

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.900
Stay on... My love

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.100
You feel so weak, be strong

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.500
Stay on, stay on

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:47.400
We'll meet, I know, I know...

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.500
I know, my love, I know...

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.600
Feel the cold...

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:22.800
Winter's calling on my home

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.900
Stay on these roads

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.100
We shall meet, I know

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.400
Stay on... My love

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.400
We will meet, I know, So

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.000
