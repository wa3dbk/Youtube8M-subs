00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.880
 youtube and good as in the title 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.830
 I bring you this one seed one seed 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.389
 and it has been a long time since he brought them any 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.980
 well in this case this is going to 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.779
 show what is being given to 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.090
 know this seed in the console 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.300
 gush 360 but then also the same 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.800
 in playstation 3 is not good then 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.200
 if you have not seen any other video now 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.239
 where do I make this kind of seeds or suv 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.130
 seeds first I will know the 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.829
 seed and then you can already some small 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.089
 cut and I do what is coming then 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.289
 making known the seed itself not 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:43.010
 well, this seed is less 19 64 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.120
 92 29 3 if they were not learned as 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.699
 want to be the leave in the description 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.929
 of the video I'm good people in this 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.339
 seed let's find what's coming 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.920
 being two temples of the desert 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.620
 diamonds some secrets and some others 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.329
 things not good people this they see the 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.329
 Generated seed right now I see them 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.160
 and good friends, this is already 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.080
 return in what has been in the 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.610
 Generated seed and good friends we are going to 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.180
 appear in what is being in this 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.940
 jungle area is the so let's say that the 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.910
 respado principal and good because this 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.310
 We are going to what is happening then to give 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.680
 the route through the map but before 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.090
 that I wanted to tell you an important point 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.729
 for those who want to play in this 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.460
 meaning some survival with 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.560
 Some friend or just not to take 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.970
 a faster survival this one I'm going 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.520
 to give a coordinate where 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.160
 find this diamond diamonds and 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.350
 this or iron and all that resources 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:43.479
 main to survive the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:46.149
 coordinate is x 39 z of 253 as you see there 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.899
 is a hole is more or less in this 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.729
 part of here the coordinate will leave it 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.600
 in the description of the video such as 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.820
 seed not the first temple is down 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.550
 from the map to the right we're going to go this 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.649
 traveling the flying so that they go 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.930
 visualizing what is being this 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.560
 seed is seed is very diverse 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.369
 as 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.489
 has enough enough this languages 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.709
 and well this has all kinds not a 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.659
 little good here is what is being 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.390
 the temple already arrived we will enter by 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:21.849
 up in this case I was trying to 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.040
 see what things I had before and the truth is 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.420
 they made me very interesting in this 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.540
 chest we have what comes three 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.940
 emeralds six gold ingots of 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.319
 iron we have iron and more forum not in 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.110
 this other chest we have what comes 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.760
 being an enchanted book with affinity 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.160
 to the water and to the uer diamond meat of 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.129
 zombie I do not know what the ingot is for 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.260
 they read in this case we have here the 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.150
 ingot of gold iron ingot and in 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.930
 this case we have three other emeralds 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.250
 more iron and diamond zombie meat ok 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.900
 well let's continue with what's coming 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.340
 being the other temple the other temple yes 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.609
 is a little bit far from once they 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.430
 notice is the two temples are at 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.890
 half of the map 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.480
 let me give you the coordinate for 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.989
 if in case they want to return 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:16.330
 the coordinate is x 282 176 zeta 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.860
 346 well let's go now yes to continue with 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.049
 what is the next temple 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.840
 This good friends and not long ago 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.239
 this type of seeds was extracted this 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.370
 I hope you like this seed because 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.319
 Well, it seemed to me quite enough 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.319
 important because he's doing something 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.239
 Regarding the can 14 not some no 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.579
 are asking when will the 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.640
 to 15 when he's going out and who knows what 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.140
 Of course, the 15th thing is going to 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.930
 put or not we were sure the date 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.400
 I was not sure either, he reported 14 but 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.349
 well, always always always 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.930
 they end up saying on twitter of 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.010
 four good studies we already arrived at what 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.000
 What is this temple being? 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.980
 coordinate of this temple is minus 358 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.799
 174 let's see the chests the chests 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.060
 they bring iron bone zombie flesh and 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.280
 good nothing more 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.709
 the other chest brings three emeralds already 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.569
 there are six with those these are three or 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.329
 nine we have nine emeralds 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.010
 we have infinity that this was coming 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.360
 pretty good with a bow or meat 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.130
 rotten bones 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.150
 in this case we have two more 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.130
 emeralds we would have 11 emeralds 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.620
 this and in this case we have gold and 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.030
 bones good people this if they want 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.910
 go and exchange with the villagers of 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.590
 once I tell you that on the map next 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.110
 of this temple there is a village there is a 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.460
 villa that can go to exchange with 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:41.260
 the villagers ok this in this villa this 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.150
 is the coordinate -154 z - 10 good 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.190
 friends this good I think this would be 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.990
 I hope you liked this one 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.840
 I hope you tell me if and if the song 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.550
 background was to your liking and well then 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.169
 you know that if you liked give me a 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.000
 like suction it stops for more videos and we 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.000
 we see for the next video see you
