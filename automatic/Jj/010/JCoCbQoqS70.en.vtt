00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.130
 people who like to accompany their eggs 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.120
 with vegetables or mushrooms or any 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.440

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.640
 let's put it here to the egg 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.770
 well we can also prepare a piece 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.920
 of cheese we are going to use the play doh 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.820

 of our egg also 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.449
 good and I think we need something 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.360
 here in our eggs do not you believe 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:15.539
 that they think is needed here I think 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.870
 that we need a piece of bacon 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:21.750
 truth you accompany your eggs with 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.880
 bacon to do this if we're not going to 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.139
 put here play doh coffee and play doh 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:31.139
 white and let's see what we have left 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:33.630
 let's put it here and now we're going to 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:36.410
 press and let's see what it is that 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.410
 come out here

 our egg with a good good bacon 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.039
 I believe that this egg is already more than 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.540
 ready truth because we already have bacon 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:03.750
 mushrooms cheese 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.970

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.760
 our egg, very good, what do you think? 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.010
 if we make a toast 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.230
 let's do it with the play doh coffee 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.110
 to make it an integral bread and not 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.820

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.780

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.690

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.920

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:31.460

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:34.280

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:48.420
