second time I just switched my rally
brain<00:00:56.380> on<00:00:56.560> cousins<00:00:56.860> ever<00:00:57.040> in<00:00:57.190> this

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.980 

we<00:01:36.790> had<00:01:36.910> a<00:01:36.940> pretty<00:01:37.180> reasonable<00:01:37.390> run<00:01:37.810> then

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
we had a pretty reasonable run then

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.380 
we had a pretty reasonable run then
we're<00:01:38.080> just<00:01:38.170> trying<00:01:38.410> to<00:01:38.470> look<00:01:38.530> after<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.890> ties

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
we're just trying to look after the ties

custom<00:01:40.390> soft<00:01:40.600> on<00:01:40.750> pounds<00:01:41.050> on<00:01:41.170> there<00:01:41.380> at<00:01:41.470> the

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
custom soft on pounds on there at the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.080 
custom soft on pounds on there at the
moment<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:41.950> we're<00:01:42.100> going<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.280> make<00:01:42.370> a<00:01:42.430> mask<00:01:42.700> for

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
moment so we're going to make a mask for

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.570 
moment so we're going to make a mask for
day<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:44.470> so<00:01:44.590> far<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:44.830> good<00:01:45.070> no<00:01:45.220> problems<00:01:45.490> with

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
day but so far so good no problems with

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:56.220 
day but so far so good no problems with
the<00:01:45.640> car<00:01:45.760> so<00:01:45.940> we're<00:01:46.060> pretty<00:01:46.210> happy<00:01:55.050> it's<00:01:56.050> tight

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
the car so we're pretty happy it's tight

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.780 
the car so we're pretty happy it's tight
and<00:01:56.350> fifty<00:01:56.680> through<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:57.040> stuff<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:57.490> probably

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
and fifty through this stuff so probably

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:10.700 
and fifty through this stuff so probably
suits<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.120> evo<00:01:58.450> but<00:01:58.690> now<00:01:58.840> we're<00:01:58.990> going<00:01:59.140> good
