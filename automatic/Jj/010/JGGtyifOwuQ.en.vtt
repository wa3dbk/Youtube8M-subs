00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
chef and I decided to start urinating

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.610 
chef and I decided to start urinating
over<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.860> toilet<00:02:54.069> of<00:02:54.250> course<00:02:54.959> as<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:56.319> started

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
over the toilet of course as I started

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.979 
over the toilet of course as I started
urinating<00:02:56.799> I<00:02:57.340> started<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.030> form<00:02:58.299> what<00:02:58.540> was<00:02:58.750> a

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
urinating I started to form what was a

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.800 
urinating I started to form what was a
water<00:02:59.290> balloon<00:02:59.530> except<00:03:00.280> not<00:03:00.610> water<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.540> was<00:03:01.780> a

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
water balloon except not water it was a

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.190 
water balloon except not water it was a
urine<00:03:02.230> balloon<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:03.489> UN<00:03:03.730> balloon<00:03:03.970> started<00:03:04.510> to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
urine balloon the UN balloon started to

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.559 
urine balloon the UN balloon started to
get<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:05.890> much<00:03:06.130> tighter<00:03:06.459> on<00:03:06.760> my<00:03:07.030> ding-a-ling

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
get that much tighter on my ding-a-ling

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.250 
get that much tighter on my ding-a-ling
and<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.500> realized<00:03:09.010> quite<00:03:09.250> quickly<00:03:09.450> I'm<00:03:10.450> not

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
and I realized quite quickly I'm not

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.870 
and I realized quite quickly I'm not
gonna<00:03:11.440> be<00:03:11.590> able<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.799> get<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:12.100> off<00:03:12.400> without

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
gonna be able to get this off without

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.300 
gonna be able to get this off without
making<00:03:13.420> probably<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.930> mess<00:03:14.319> there's<00:03:15.160> some

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
making probably a mess there's some

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.920 
making probably a mess there's some
pressure<00:03:15.519> behind<00:03:15.850> this<00:03:16.090> water<00:03:16.359> balloon<00:03:16.569> I<00:03:16.810> can

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
pressure behind this water balloon I can

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.830 
pressure behind this water balloon I can
feel<00:03:17.140> it<00:03:17.260> on<00:03:17.350> my<00:03:17.410> ding-a-ling<00:03:18.329> so<00:03:19.329> I<00:03:19.359> had<00:03:19.690> to

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
feel it on my ding-a-ling so I had to

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.830 
feel it on my ding-a-ling so I had to
figure<00:03:20.079> out<00:03:20.290> how<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.590> get<00:03:20.889> this<00:03:21.130> thing<00:03:21.190> off

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
figure out how to get this thing off

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.680 
figure out how to get this thing off
without<00:03:22.840> making<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.500> mess<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.120> decided<00:03:25.540> to

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
without making a mess so I decided to

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.370 
without making a mess so I decided to
hop<00:03:25.870> into<00:03:26.139> the<00:03:26.230> shower<00:03:27.209> where<00:03:28.209> I<00:03:28.380> quickly

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
hop into the shower where I quickly

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.129 
hop into the shower where I quickly
turned<00:03:29.709> on<00:03:29.889> the<00:03:30.010> water<00:03:30.220> just<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.720> get<00:03:31.900> rid<00:03:32.109> of

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
turned on the water just to get rid of

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.809 
turned on the water just to get rid of
the<00:03:32.380> urine<00:03:32.680> flow<00:03:32.859> because<00:03:33.100> we've<00:03:33.250> all<00:03:33.430> peed<00:03:33.700> in

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
the urine flow because we've all peed in

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.360 
the urine flow because we've all peed in
them<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:34.660> shower<00:03:34.989> men<00:03:35.470> women<00:03:35.739> I'm<00:03:36.100> not

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
sure if women do it but it quite easy

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.599

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
for us men we just aim for the you know

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.509 
for us men we just aim for the you know
the<00:03:42.609> drain<00:03:42.880> but<00:03:43.840> yes<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.530> turned<00:03:45.010> on<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.489> shower

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
the drain but yes I turned on the shower

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.140 
the drain but yes I turned on the shower
flowing<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.480> was<00:03:46.569> quite<00:03:46.780> cold<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:48.370> cut<00:03:49.120> off

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
flowing it was quite cold and I cut off

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.849 
flowing it was quite cold and I cut off
my<00:03:49.709> flow<00:03:51.930> it's<00:03:52.930> quite<00:03:53.109> difficult<00:03:53.290> for<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.680> man

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
my flow it's quite difficult for a man

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.360 
my flow it's quite difficult for a man
to<00:03:54.250> cut<00:03:54.400> off<00:03:54.519> their<00:03:54.670> flow<00:03:55.109> but<00:03:56.109> I<00:03:56.139> did<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.560> but

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
to cut off their flow but I did it but

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.860 
to cut off their flow but I did it but
then<00:03:57.489> I<00:03:57.579> realized<00:03:57.940> quite<00:03:58.180> quickly<00:03:58.239> that<00:03:58.720> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
then I realized quite quickly that the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.940 
then I realized quite quickly that the
flow<00:03:59.170> was<00:04:00.040> quite<00:04:01.709> reversing<00:04:03.120> yeah<00:04:04.530> my<00:04:05.530> urine

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
flow was quite reversing yeah my urine

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.270 
flow was quite reversing yeah my urine
started<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.489> flow<00:04:06.670> backwards<00:04:08.760> how<00:04:11.010> was<00:04:12.010> felt

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
started to flow backwards how was felt

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.710 
started to flow backwards how was felt
by<00:04:12.370> quickly<00:04:12.729> how<00:04:13.660> was<00:04:13.959> a<00:04:13.989> word<00:04:14.259> that<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:15.160> said

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
by quickly how was a word that I said

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.800 
by quickly how was a word that I said
and<00:04:16.720> there's<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.320> few

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
and there's a few

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.000 
and there's a few
which<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.139> was<00:04:18.260> said<00:04:18.410> look<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.709> said<00:04:18.859> it<00:04:18.920> was

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
which that was said look I said it was

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:26.100 
which that was said look I said it was
quite<00:04:19.480> I<00:04:20.480> I<00:04:22.780> believe<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:24.139> day<00:04:24.440> I<00:04:24.800> probably

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
quite I I believe that day I probably

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.350 
quite I I believe that day I probably
experienced<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.860> urinary<00:04:28.850> tract<00:04:29.240> infection

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
experienced a urinary tract infection

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.350 
experienced a urinary tract infection
because<00:04:30.260> whatever<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:30.919> felt<00:04:31.580> was<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.030> worst

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
because whatever I felt was the worst

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.150 
because whatever I felt was the worst
