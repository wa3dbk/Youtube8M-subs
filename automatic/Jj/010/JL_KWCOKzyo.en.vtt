00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
first find a spot where you can cut the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.879 
first find a spot where you can cut the
seed<00:00:10.309> and<00:00:11.870> gently<00:00:12.870> get<00:00:13.170> into<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.650> without

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
seed and gently get into it without

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.010 
seed and gently get into it without
harming<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.549> actual<00:00:14.940> seed<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.480> cut<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
harming the actual seed so you cut the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.670 
harming the actual seed so you cut the
pit<00:00:16.580> and<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:18.210> want<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.660> pry<00:00:19.289> open<00:00:21.350> up<00:00:22.350> it

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
pit and you want to pry open up it

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:33.010 
pit and you want to pry open up it
gently<00:00:28.789> and<00:00:29.789> then<00:00:30.269> you'll<00:00:30.480> find<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.109> seed

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
gently and then you'll find the seed

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:53.600 
gently and then you'll find the seed
block<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:49.489> here's<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.640> mango<00:00:51.120> seed<00:00:52.460> kind<00:00:53.460> of

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
block do it here's a mango seed kind of

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.750 
block do it here's a mango seed kind of
look<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.969> giant<00:00:54.270> bean<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.640> with

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
look like a giant bean so you do with

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.459 
look like a giant bean so you do with
this<00:00:58.129> so<00:00:59.129> you'll<00:00:59.250> want<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> take<00:00:59.699> it<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:01.140> find

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
this so you'll want to take it and find

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.859 
this so you'll want to take it and find
yourself<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.780> large<00:01:03.780> bag<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:06.290> peat<00:01:07.290> moss<00:01:07.340> and

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
yourself a large bag of peat moss and

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.450 
yourself a large bag of peat moss and
you<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.049> want<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.350> place<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.770> seeds<00:01:11.070> inside

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
you just want to place the seeds inside

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.200 
you just want to place the seeds inside
the<00:01:12.030> center<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.340> keep<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.520> nice<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the center of that and keep it nice and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.520 
the center of that and keep it nice and
warm<00:01:15.450> at<00:01:16.439> all<00:01:16.500> times<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.630> wait<00:01:18.630> patiently<00:01:19.020> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
warm at all times and wait patiently and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.300 
warm at all times and wait patiently and
eventually<00:01:20.159> using<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.350> method<00:01:22.350> your<00:01:22.950> seed

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
eventually using this method your seed

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.810 
eventually using this method your seed
will<00:01:23.520> start<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.939> grow<00:01:24.180> very<00:01:24.930> strong<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.950> thick

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
will start to grow very strong and thick

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.100 
will start to grow very strong and thick
roots<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:29.210> when<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.390> happens<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.079> can

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
roots and when that happens you can

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.539 
roots and when that happens you can
plant<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.220> pot<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:34.400> probably<00:01:35.400> bigger

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
plant it in a pot and probably bigger

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.819 
plant it in a pot and probably bigger
than<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.780> plant<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.799> pot

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
than this one but you plant it in a pot

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.090 
than this one but you plant it in a pot
and<00:01:41.060> once<00:01:42.060> you've<00:01:42.240> done<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.740> want<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
and once you've done that you want to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.819 
and once you've done that you want to
keep<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.490> bag<00:01:44.759> over<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:46.229> keep<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> humidity

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
keep a bag over it to keep the humidity

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.740 
keep a bag over it to keep the humidity
while<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.490> seedling<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.090> still<00:01:48.329> getting<00:01:48.600> used

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
while the seedling is still getting used

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.490 
while the seedling is still getting used
to<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:50.759> outsides<00:01:52.610> drier<00:01:53.659> humid<00:01:54.659> or<00:01:54.899> drier

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
to the outsides drier humid or drier

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.679 
to the outsides drier humid or drier
environment<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:57.060> eventually<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.540> can

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
environment and then eventually you can

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.569 
environment and then eventually you can
take<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.079> bag<00:01:58.259> off<00:01:58.530> more<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.219> more<00:01:59.399> often

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
take the bag off more and more often

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.190 
take the bag off more and more often
till<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.149> don't<00:02:00.329> need<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.540> keep<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:00.960> but

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
till you don't need to keep it on but

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.260 
till you don't need to keep it on but
that's<00:02:01.350> when<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> seedling<00:02:02.130> actually<00:02:03.060> grows

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
that's when the seedling actually grows

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.539 
that's when the seedling actually grows
of<00:02:03.450> course<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.259> if<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.469> do<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.829> right<00:02:05.130> I'll
