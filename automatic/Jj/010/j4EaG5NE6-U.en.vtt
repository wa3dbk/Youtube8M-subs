show you the mix that I use in the
self-watering<00:00:38.450> containers<00:00:39.080> how<00:00:39.890> to<00:00:39.950> mix<00:00:40.250> it

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
self-watering containers how to mix it

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.890 
self-watering containers how to mix it
and<00:00:40.580> the<00:00:41.830> proportions<00:00:42.830> that<00:00:42.950> I<00:00:43.070> use<00:00:43.900> alright

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
and the proportions that I use alright

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.240 
and the proportions that I use alright
the<00:00:45.050> soil<00:00:45.350> mixture<00:00:45.620> that<00:00:45.860> I'm<00:00:45.980> going<00:00:46.130> to<00:00:46.190> be

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
the soil mixture that I'm going to be

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.250 
the soil mixture that I'm going to be
using<00:00:46.520> is<00:00:46.850> two<00:00:47.840> parts<00:00:48.670> potting<00:00:49.670> soil<00:00:50.260> two

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
using is two parts potting soil two

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.090 
using is two parts potting soil two
parts<00:00:51.680> vegam<00:00:52.640> peat<00:00:52.850> moss<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.710> one<00:00:54.710> part<00:00:55.010> per

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
parts vegam peat moss and one part per

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.720 
parts vegam peat moss and one part per
light<00:00:56.739> after<00:00:57.739> doing<00:00:57.830> a<00:00:57.950> little<00:00:58.129> research<00:00:58.370> I

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
light after doing a little research I

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.030 
light after doing a little research I
found<00:00:58.760> this<00:00:59.060> to<00:00:59.210> be<00:00:59.240> a<00:00:59.360> pretty<00:00:59.570> popular<00:00:59.870> mix<00:01:00.410> it

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
found this to be a pretty popular mix it

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.800 
found this to be a pretty popular mix it
seems<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.430> have<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:01.760> right<00:01:01.940> combination<00:01:02.690> of

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
seems to have the right combination of

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.490 
seems to have the right combination of
aeration<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:03.910> moisture<00:01:04.910> patrol<00:01:05.449> so<00:01:06.350> this

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
aeration and moisture patrol so this

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.350 
aeration and moisture patrol so this
mixture<00:01:06.830> seems<00:01:07.190> to<00:01:07.310> work<00:01:07.490> pretty<00:01:07.700> well<00:01:07.880> with

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
mixture seems to work pretty well with

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.650 
mixture seems to work pretty well with
container<00:01:09.080> gardening<00:01:10.060> so<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.240> containers

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
container gardening so the containers

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.990 
container gardening so the containers
that<00:01:11.690> I<00:01:11.840> use<00:01:12.110> they<00:01:12.350> actually<00:01:12.770> use<00:01:12.979> quite<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.729> bit

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
that I use they actually use quite a bit

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.889 
that I use they actually use quite a bit
of<00:01:14.119> soil<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:15.229> container<00:01:15.590> itself<00:01:15.979> is<00:01:16.899> 4.25

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
of soil the container itself is 4.25

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.060 
of soil the container itself is 4.25
cubic<00:01:18.560> feet<00:01:18.830> or<00:01:19.100> 32<00:01:19.490> gallons<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:20.950> after<00:01:21.950> the

reservoir is taken into consideration
the<00:01:24.410> actual<00:01:24.710> amount<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:25.250> soil<00:01:25.460> we're<00:01:25.729> going<00:01:25.850> to

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
the actual amount of soil we're going to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.870 
the actual amount of soil we're going to
be<00:01:26.000> using<00:01:26.030> is<00:01:26.360> about<00:01:26.869> 3.6<00:01:27.590> cubic<00:01:28.070> feet<00:01:28.310> that's

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
be using is about 3.6 cubic feet that's
