00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
can see I started off a little bit damp

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.750 
can see I started off a little bit damp
here<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.200> I've<00:00:37.890> got<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.340> little<00:00:38.370> bit<00:00:38.579> of

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
product in here talk about another time

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.750 
product in here talk about another time
just<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> comb<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.510> all<00:00:42.600> straight<00:00:43.440> back

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.940 

the<00:00:47.760> sides<00:00:48.210> down<00:00:48.660> there<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.260> know<00:00:49.289> how<00:00:49.649> much

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the sides down there you know how much

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.850 
the sides down there you know how much
does<00:00:50.219> really<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.850> little<00:00:51.210> nips<00:00:51.539> sometimes<00:00:52.020> so

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
does really get little nips sometimes so

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.299 
does really get little nips sometimes so
I<00:00:52.920> got<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.309> back<00:00:54.620> I'll<00:00:55.620> turn<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.190> you

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
I got it all back I'll turn it for you

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.119 
I got it all back I'll turn it for you
here<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:58.219> get<00:00:59.219> everything<00:00:59.640> back<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:01.129> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
here and get everything back here and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.260 
here and get everything back here and
you<00:01:02.670> want<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.090> three<00:01:03.660> sections<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you want to get three sections so it's a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.080 
you want to get three sections so it's a
piece<00:01:06.630> I'd<00:01:07.760> go<00:01:08.760> right<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> middle<00:01:09.830> and

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
piece I'd go right up the middle and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.030 
piece I'd go right up the middle and
it's<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.420> important<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.290> try<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.799> get

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
it's really important to try get get

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.440 
it's really important to try get get
separation

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.560 

easier<00:01:19.960> said<00:01:19.990> than<00:01:20.380> done<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:22.000> go<00:01:22.270> right<00:01:22.540> there

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
easier said than done we go right there

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.590 
easier said than done we go right there
we've<00:01:23.080> got<00:01:23.439> that<00:01:23.710> separated<00:01:24.520> pull<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.420> one

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
we've got that separated pull that one

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.690 
we've got that separated pull that one
out<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:29.049> then<00:01:29.290> I've<00:01:29.439> got<00:01:29.710> my<00:01:29.920> right<00:01:30.340> section

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
out and then I've got my right section

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.300 
out and then I've got my right section
there<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:32.320> once<00:01:32.680> you've<00:01:32.830> got<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.070> wall

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
there and once you've got a wall

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.139 
there and once you've got a wall
sectioned<00:01:34.000> off<00:01:35.340> now<00:01:36.340> it's<00:01:36.520> easy<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:36.909> wouldn't

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
sectioned off now it's easy you wouldn't

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.279 
sectioned off now it's easy you wouldn't
have<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.270> braid<00:01:38.159> elementary<00:01:39.159> school<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.750> just

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
have a braid elementary school and just

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.090 
have a braid elementary school and just
top<00:01:41.590> over<00:01:42.009> and<00:01:42.789> alternating<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.740> I<00:01:44.799> got<00:01:44.979> my

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
top over and alternating so I got my

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.389 
top over and alternating so I got my
three<00:01:45.399> sections<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.920> I'm<00:01:48.100> just<00:01:48.159> going

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
three sections and then I'm just going

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.919 
three sections and then I'm just going
to<00:01:48.460> keep<00:01:48.729> pulling<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:51.189> outside<00:01:51.759> section<00:01:52.270> over

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
to keep pulling the outside section over

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.389 
to keep pulling the outside section over
the<00:01:53.050> top<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:56.259> basically<00:01:56.710> just<00:01:56.800> keeping<00:01:57.280> your

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
the top it's basically just keeping your

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.050 
the top it's basically just keeping your
three<00:01:59.190> energy<00:02:00.190> dance

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.580 

looking<00:02:04.060> tight<00:02:04.390> as<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.750> go<00:02:06.150> left<00:02:07.150> over<00:02:10.590> right

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
looking tight as I go left over right

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.490 
looking tight as I go left over right
over

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.920 

left<00:02:17.100> over

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.960 

right<00:02:20.500> over<00:02:20.769> I'm<00:02:21.370> going<00:02:21.489> to<00:02:21.549> keep<00:02:21.730> alternating

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
right over I'm going to keep alternating

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.580 
right over I'm going to keep alternating
there<00:02:22.769> keep<00:02:23.769> it<00:02:23.920> nice<00:02:24.099> and<00:02:24.129> tight<00:02:24.519> as<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:25.000> go

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:39.240 

left<00:02:29.590> over<00:02:31.590> right

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.610 

I'm<00:02:40.240> going<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.510> take<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.750> down<00:02:40.780> as<00:02:41.080> far<00:02:41.320> as<00:02:41.500> I

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
I'm going to take it down as far as I

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.340 
I'm going to take it down as far as I
can<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.130> is<00:02:42.190> where<00:02:42.780> it's<00:02:43.780> important<00:02:44.320> that

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
can this is where it's important that

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.530 
can this is where it's important that
you<00:02:44.530> get<00:02:44.680> three<00:02:45.070> equal<00:02:45.580> sections<00:02:45.850> which<00:02:46.360> in

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
you get three equal sections which in

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.530 
you get three equal sections which in

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
right there XY pinching it so you get

you gotta keep trying and the thing is

you gotta keep trying and the thing is
you<00:03:47.810> could<00:03:47.930> probably<00:03:48.110> only<00:03:48.319> get<00:03:48.470> about<00:03:48.620> two<00:03:48.860> or

three practices at once because your
