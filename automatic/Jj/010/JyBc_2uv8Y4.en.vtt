system<00:02:57.420> let<00:02:58.079> me<00:02:58.170> tell<00:02:58.349> you<00:02:58.440> how<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.680> works

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
system let me tell you how it works

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.130 
system let me tell you how it works
let's<00:02:59.519> say<00:02:59.700> for<00:02:59.940> example<00:02:59.970> you're<00:03:00.599> in<00:03:00.690> second

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
let's say for example you're in second

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.050 
let's say for example you're in second
gear<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.739> other<00:03:01.890> clutch<00:03:02.280> actually<00:03:02.730> priest

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
gear the other clutch actually priest

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.120 
gear the other clutch actually priest
likes<00:03:03.299> third<00:03:03.690> gear<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.620> shift<00:03:04.889> between

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
likes third gear so the shift between

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.160 
likes third gear so the shift between
gears<00:03:05.549> it's<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.239> quick<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.900> instant

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
gears it's that quick it's that instant

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.379 
gears it's that quick it's that instant
there's<00:03:07.950> absolutely<00:03:08.310> no<00:03:08.579> friction<00:03:09.209> loss

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
there's absolutely no friction loss

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.420 
there's absolutely no friction loss
between<00:03:09.660> gear<00:03:10.079> shifts<00:03:10.470> but<00:03:10.920> not<00:03:11.069> only<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:11.280> we

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
between gear shifts but not only that we

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
does it actually sharpens up the gear

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.670 
does it actually sharpens up the gear
shift<00:03:15.329> that<00:03:15.900> much<00:03:16.200> more

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
shift that much more
