00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.640
 Today we want to talk with the reason 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.950
 to deal with the building materials of the food 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.170
 Surely you have already asked yourself what in 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.059
 your food is included and which one 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.889
 meaning the individual components 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.059
 to have 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.590
 why are different fabrics 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.630
 actually so important for the 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.180
 human body and in which 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.580
 foods are included 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.880
 our food is first and foremost 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.029
 from proteins fats and carbohydrates 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.550
 For example, if you are bread your body gets 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.800
 a wealth of carbohydrate molecules 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.010
 this is also the case if you 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.170
 Candy is when eating meat 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.700
 and fish you get many important ones 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.520
 proteins and also fat 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.370
 how these are structured molecules want 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.260
 Let's take a closer look now 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.390
 Now we will deal with the most important 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.560
 to deal with ingredients of the food 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.500
 Let's start with the carbohydrates 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.350
 Carbohydrates are eg grape sugar 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.720
 household sugar starch and cellulose the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.220
 carbohydrates have a common 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.470
 humming formula 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.000
 the characteristics of the individual 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.530
 Carbohydrates are especially used by the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.530
 molecule size determined 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.010
 most well - known carbohydrate molecule is the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.050
 glucose the so-called grape sugar the 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:28.440
 complete movie and many more 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:31.450
