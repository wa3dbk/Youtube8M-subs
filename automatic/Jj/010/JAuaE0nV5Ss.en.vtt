okay<00:00:03.120> so<00:00:03.179> here's<00:00:03.629> my<00:00:03.920> DIY<00:00:06.230> stir<00:00:07.230> plate<00:00:08.450> it's

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
okay so here's my DIY stir plate it's

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.490 
okay so here's my DIY stir plate it's
made<00:00:09.719> with<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.309> cd-rom<00:00:11.509> external<00:00:12.509> case<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:15.500> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
made with a cd-rom external case and the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.920 
made with a cd-rom external case and the
usual<00:00:17.130> obligatory<00:00:21.680> PC<00:00:22.680> fed<00:00:23.240> you<00:00:24.240> can<00:00:24.390> just<00:00:24.660> see

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
usual obligatory PC fed you can just see

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.920 
usual obligatory PC fed you can just see
in<00:00:24.990> there<00:00:28.099> and<00:00:29.449> the<00:00:30.449> magnet<00:00:30.840> from<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.590> computer

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
in there and the magnet from a computer

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.650 
in there and the magnet from a computer
table<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:37.380> stood<00:00:38.390> still<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.480> quite

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
table and it stood still it's quite

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.660 
table and it stood still it's quite
nicely<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:41.460> trouble<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:41.940> these<00:00:42.500> DIY

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
nicely the trouble with these DIY

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.160 
nicely the trouble with these DIY
solutions<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:45.000> don't<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.450> any<00:00:45.660> heating

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
solutions is they don't have any heating

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.610 
solutions is they don't have any heating
and<00:00:48.410> so<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.440> thought<00:00:49.739> well<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
and so I thought well what can I do to

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.380 
and so I thought well what can I do to
put<00:00:52.620> heating<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
put heating on it

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.069 
put heating on it
so<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:55.370> picked<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.730> these<00:00:56.910> ripped<00:00:57.840> team

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
so I picked up one of these ripped team

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.549 
so I picked up one of these ripped team
mats

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
mats

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.770 
mats
it's<00:00:59.100> a<00:01:00.710> mat<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:02.960> warming<00:01:03.960> terrariums<00:01:05.570> if<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
it's a mat for warming terrariums if you

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.399 
it's a mat for warming terrariums if you
keep<00:01:06.960> reptiles<00:01:07.439> or<00:01:07.939> arachnids<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:12.260> just<00:01:13.260> with

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
keep reptiles or arachnids and just with

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.840 
keep reptiles or arachnids and just with
tap<00:01:13.590> water<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.130> running<00:01:14.490> at<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> moment

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
tap water and this running at the moment

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.460 
tap water and this running at the moment
this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.810> now<00:01:16.170> at<00:01:16.380> around<00:01:16.770> about<00:01:17.040> 20<00:01:17.700> degrees

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
this is now at around about 20 degrees

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.310 
this is now at around about 20 degrees
which<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.590> nicely<00:01:19.799> used<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:21.170> this<00:01:22.170> is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
which is nicely used and this is

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.440 
which is nicely used and this is
specifically<00:01:23.159> what<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> want<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> use<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.150> for

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
specifically what I want to use this for

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.560 
specifically what I want to use this for
is<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.830> to<00:01:25.830> use<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.180> bit<00:01:27.540> more

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
is to to use it to have a bit more

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.600 
is to to use it to have a bit more
temperature<00:01:28.080> control<00:01:28.470> over<00:01:28.860> my<00:01:29.369> yeast

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
temperature control over my yeast

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.890 
temperature control over my yeast
starters<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:32.040> has<00:01:32.189> no<00:01:32.340> wires<00:01:32.579> inside<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.210> it's

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
starters it has no wires inside it it's

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.670 
starters it has no wires inside it it's
infrared<00:01:34.710> mat<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> doesn't<00:01:37.530> interfere

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
infrared mat and so it doesn't interfere

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.880 
infrared mat and so it doesn't interfere
in<00:01:38.070> any<00:01:38.220> way<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> make<00:01:39.890> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
in any way with the with the make the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.980 
in any way with the with the make the
magnet<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> its<00:01:41.729> effect<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.299> stirrup<00:01:44.990> it

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
magnet and its effect on the stirrup it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.069 
magnet and its effect on the stirrup it
does<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.470> warm<00:01:46.590> over<00:01:46.950> time<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.369> has<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.549> 50<00:01:48.079> mm

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
does get warm over time it has a 50 mm

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.620 
does get warm over time it has a 50 mm
50<00:01:49.409> degrees<00:01:49.710> C<00:01:49.950> shutoff<00:01:50.820> switch<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.390> as<00:01:51.450> it

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
50 degrees C shutoff switch so as it

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.350 
50 degrees C shutoff switch so as it
doesn't<00:01:51.899> go<00:01:51.960> over<00:01:52.229> 50<00:01:52.530> degrees<00:01:52.829> soo<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.360> figured

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
doesn't go over 50 degrees soo I figured

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.569 
doesn't go over 50 degrees soo I figured
while<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.810> probably<00:01:55.470> need<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> way<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> control

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
while I probably need a way to control

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.760 
while I probably need a way to control
that<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.299> I'm<00:01:57.450> running<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.780> new<00:01:58.229> starter<00:01:58.619> for

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
that so if I'm running a new starter for

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.440 
that so if I'm running a new starter for
two<00:01:58.950> days<00:01:59.130> or<00:01:59.340> what<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.579> was<00:01:59.640> beforehand<00:02:00.240> I

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
two days or what it was beforehand I

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.359 
two days or what it was beforehand I
need<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.290> control<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> temperature<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.189> I

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
need to control the temperature and I

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.550 
need to control the temperature and I
thought<00:02:02.880> well<00:02:03.180> first<00:02:03.750> way<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.229> might<00:02:04.380> be

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
thought well first way that I might be

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.740 
thought well first way that I might be
able<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.770> do<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.100> would<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.540> use<00:02:06.719> a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
able to do that would be just to use a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.510 
able to do that would be just to use a
standard<00:02:07.439> on/off<00:02:08.340> switch

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
standard on/off switch

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.900 
standard on/off switch
which<00:02:10.390> switches<00:02:11.290> itself<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.250> off<00:02:12.430> every

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
which switches itself on and off every

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.020 
which switches itself on and off every
half<00:02:13.300> hour<00:02:13.510> around<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.530> clock<00:02:15.780> or<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:18.030> could

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
half hour around the clock or I could

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:29.250 
half hour around the clock or I could
use<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:20.820> universal<00:02:23.310> thermostat<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.860> which<00:02:28.260> then

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
use a universal thermostat in which then

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:38.400 
use a universal thermostat in which then
I<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:31.750> control<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:35.910> temperature<00:02:37.080> but<00:02:38.080> I'm

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
I can control the temperature but I'm

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.280 
I can control the temperature but I'm
not<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:38.830> sure<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.580> can<00:02:40.480> actually<00:02:40.900> that

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
not so sure that this can actually that

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.900 
not so sure that this can actually that
the<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.530> probe<00:02:42.250> on<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:44.710> see<00:02:44.890> here<00:02:45.220> is

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
the the probe on this to see here is

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.720 
the the probe on this to see here is
actually<00:02:46.120> waterproof<00:02:47.160> like<00:02:48.160> me<00:02:48.310> I've<00:02:48.400> up<00:02:48.550> two

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
actually waterproof like me I've up two

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.100 
actually waterproof like me I've up two
of<00:02:48.850> these<00:02:48.940> so<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.180> can<00:02:49.210> give<00:02:49.480> mine<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> shot<00:02:49.960> and

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
of these so I can give mine a shot and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.050 
of these so I can give mine a shot and
see<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.410> works<00:02:50.740> if<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.340> doesn't<00:02:51.370> work<00:02:51.700> then<00:02:51.910> I

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
see it works if it doesn't work then I

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.880 
see it works if it doesn't work then I
can<00:02:52.240> now<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.660> know<00:02:53.530> know<00:02:54.130> not<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.490> use<00:02:54.520> it<00:02:54.970> for

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
can now I know know not to use it for

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.000 
can now I know know not to use it for
this<00:02:56.890> kind<00:02:57.130> of<00:02:57.250> application<00:02:58.770> there<00:02:59.770> you<00:02:59.860> go

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
this kind of application there you go
