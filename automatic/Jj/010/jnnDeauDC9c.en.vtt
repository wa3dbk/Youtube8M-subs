 Yes let's do Yes Hello is vandalism Clovis 9 degrees 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:15.289
 The last time yet aligned First one side it the way I think I aligned here I am-th stage to the next to useless 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:20.130
 Yes, but this time we know the end of one stage 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:24.150
 You one this 4 First of all I would like to make a cross on one side of the cat 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.539
 Please disregard the charcoal of yellow What is this yellow now? 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.640
 The state is 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.029
 There are 4 patterns, but I'm already lucky if I can make a cross here from the beginning 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.260
 Ne 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:38.230
 Lucky it is big as it is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.710
 Which button is ok 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.219
 3 patterns other than 10 o'clock are here 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:50.820
 Please ignore the four root corners first of all 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:55.250
 Are aligned following the first column 1 column only not only have all the middle 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.730
 It is aligned in another three like this 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.080
 I think that probably applies to any 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.309
 I think this is 10 o'clock I have 4 patterns that are aligned in play 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.950
 In no way 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:14.210
 I have a way of turning it do its turn how sound as would remember the so-so love child and this 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:20.270
 It is this one that was one When I turn it 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:24.300
 From here, it will be this next time if you turn it the same way more 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.720
 The sound of the last completed form 10:00 when it runs once more 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:34.050
 I think that I would like to do how to turn it 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.320
 How to hold this will continue to enter the other as it is anywhere is good when this Nehito single point 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.320

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.890
 First of all 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.530
 Next time 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:49.190
 Then it's a bit confusing, but this one 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.390
 Slide the front of or pc before the over here 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.040

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.300
 If you come 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.909

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.159

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.369

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.820
 Yes 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.940
 It is difficult to know how 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:49.890
 Well that's all right now it's 5 and turns around 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.370
 This high-eared person will be here again once the same procedure 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.370

 This time is up to here this time and again once again 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.069
 Let's do it 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:40.050
 How to memorize it is the one I can learn as it is 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:43.860
 Well, it's a little bit too long 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:47.340
 I think I won't get confused 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:52.160

 Please remember until about 3 but please remember to here 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:04.630
 Then I will look at it like this I know I already know what the white is 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.830
 I wonder if 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.170
 Although it has become like this 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.540
 Yes, here is it here 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:19.079
 Blue mud over white 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:22.720
 Where is the castle here, so here I will bring it as it is 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.100
 How do I live up after Is this a white bring 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.730

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.570
 First of all, not this one 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:34.280
 Shift and make three people a plus and the road surface 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.920
 I think it will be completed 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.919
 And also it's above has been automatically this 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.129
 I know I each person is how to remember 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.129
 Follow 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.039
 White is aligned is where tomorrow it Nde say 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.039
 Then lower this 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:05:02.000
 It is a hot spring feeling 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.000
 Then I want to finish turning it to the last minute without shifting the girl of the cube . 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:26.040
 First of all, please try making a cross 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.389
 Next time I will align this sound all over Yes 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.389
