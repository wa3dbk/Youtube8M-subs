 who speaks to you in this video I want a 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.789
 just explain these endless 8s that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.560
 there are in the killer map also that 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.269
 I found a couple of clues guys that 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.939
 could be very interesting me 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.309
 I find in Sen now National Park for whom 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.460
 did not know where I show it here 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.170
 in the fair map just in the desert 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.170
 let's start right away with the first clue 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.329
 you guys already see the infinite 28 here in 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.430
 practice that is the symbol must indeed 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.450
 infinite here is the nursery rhyme 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.800
 by freddy krueger 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.989
 for those who haven't seen this yet 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.989
 here really is a very much clue 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.789
 important guys because I found a 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.760
 it looks like three or four clues in the whole 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.379
 map and I hope they can help us 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.180
 to find the killer or at least to 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.070
 find the victims 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.030
 so guys with this first clue 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.369
 that's all and we'll see each other well 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.500

 forgot this boys wall 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.280
 look at 8 infinity symbols there 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.280
 they are a crazy thing 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.119

 bonomo of the genus boys here another eight 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.140
 really interesting guys this is 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.570
 the second clue that helps us 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.420
 really a lot and now I leave you 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.400
 still because I will go with trevor 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.630
 at the third clue guys so there 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.730
 we'll see very soon guys here I am 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.290
 back as you see I had to put the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.770
 makeup of invincibility are here 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.990
 was killed thousands of times is this 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.660
 here guys and the third clue that in 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.620
 practice says where the water meets the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:59.790
 earth and fire once erupted there 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.230
 it will be lotto ie the infinite 8 must 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.230
 stay must stay 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.480
 until i return this here guys is 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.910
 very important look at how many others 8 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.370
 what I am telling you here is this 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.430
 inside the prison that in practice the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.000
 prison kids this is in here 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.270
 arm 9b basically guys in the middle 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.690
 here at the garden and it really is 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:31.350
 important guys this this clue 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.820
 because it will make us understand where the are 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.270
 child victims 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.030
 so now I can also conclude 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.890
 this part this third 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.320
 very important part and I will bring you 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.060
 girls to see where these are 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.630
 victims these bodies will be alive 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.640
 they will be dead you will find out only boys 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.640
 looking at continuing to watch the video 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.720
 well guys here we are back there you 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.820
 I immediately see on the map where it is 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.400
 the first corpse boys because they are 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.530
 all at the bottom of the sea just for 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.600
 luckily the seabed is very low 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.230
 so they are very simple to find 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.060
 maybe someone is hidden behind 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.480
 some aquatic plants but you can find it 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.850
 right away it seemed like this here 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.799
 very much the television series dexter where 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.800
 there was precisely the protagonist where 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.710
 he was making gangster touches, throwing them down 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.889
 in the ocean I tell you guys right away 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.069
 I found 5 human and I imagined 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.940
 boys 8 precisely for the infinite number 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:39.810
 8 pro kid found precisely 5 this 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.849
 I don't know what it means if for 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.849
 case three more are elsewhere 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.949
 this guys really don't know 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.509
 why 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.990
 see the third one is enough here too 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.990
 close 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.949
 nothing I invite you too if you want 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.860
 to go exploring the seabed here too 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.050
 marine if you find the other three bodies 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.599
 warn me so maybe I can make a 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.940
 another video to finish it off 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:08.940
 completely because they emanate from it 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.610
 both with the number 888 and at the end of 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.300
 corpses dinners 5 so I really don't know 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.340
 what does it mean vi 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.570
 thank you so much for everyone I like it 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.550
 girls this one you just got 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.289
 seen was the fourth 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.509
 I remind you as always of leaving 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.849
 I like a lot of comments 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.979
 subscribe to the girls channel if you have 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.030
 any indication of theme there 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.370
 comments 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.630
 I hope to see you all at games week 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.039
 because maybe I'm succeeding in going 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.720
 so guys I would say that the video is 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:43.380
 can conclude here this is the 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:47.930
 fifth and nothing here from mister is everything and 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.930
 we guys will see you at the next video
