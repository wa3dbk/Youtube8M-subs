cap<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:14.099> here<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.320> 12<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.530> quarter

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
cap on here this is the 12 and a quarter

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.420 
cap on here this is the 12 and a quarter
inch<00:00:17.070> eye<00:00:17.280> peas<00:00:17.610> by<00:00:18.090> 96<00:00:18.930> inches<00:00:19.230> long<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:20.370> you

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
inch eye peas by 96 inches long so you

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.400 
inch eye peas by 96 inches long so you
can<00:00:20.520> kind<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.760> see<00:00:20.970> how<00:00:21.210> far<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.960> comes<00:00:22.200> into

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
can kind of see how far it comes into

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.340 
can kind of see how far it comes into
the<00:00:22.560> table<00:00:22.920> here<00:00:23.720> how<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> kind<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.050> lined<00:00:25.230> that

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the table here how I kind of lined that

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.490 
the table here how I kind of lined that
up<00:00:25.410> as<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.890> drew<00:00:26.630> before<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.810> did<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> carved<00:00:28.290> run

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
up as I drew before I did the carved run

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.610 
up as I drew before I did the carved run
to<00:00:28.590> do<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.890> middle<00:00:29.190> centerline<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.850> the<00:00:30.000> 96

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:30.620 
to do that middle centerline of the 96

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.229 
to do that middle centerline of the 96
and<00:00:31.620> it<00:00:31.710> also<00:00:32.009> measured<00:00:32.339> on<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.489> table<00:00:33.000> so

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
and it also measured on the table so

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.729 
and it also measured on the table so
then<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.539> kind<00:00:33.929> of<00:00:33.989> lined<00:00:34.199> him<00:00:34.379> up<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
then I just kind of lined him up and

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.299 
then I just kind of lined him up and
that's<00:00:34.859> how<00:00:35.129> I<00:00:35.239> got<00:00:36.239> everything<00:00:36.510> centered<00:00:37.019> at

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
that's how I got everything centered at

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.290 
that's how I got everything centered at
the<00:00:38.309> car<00:00:38.760> show<00:00:38.789> it<00:00:39.030> works<00:00:39.269> really<00:00:39.660> well<00:00:41.300> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the car show it works really well the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.040 
the car show it works really well the
total<00:00:42.480> length<00:00:42.839> of<00:00:43.019> the<00:00:43.379> joint<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.890> 20<00:00:44.370> inches<00:00:44.730> I

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
total length of the joint is 20 inches I

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.419 
total length of the joint is 20 inches I
think<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.289> 41<00:00:46.800> cuts

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:47.429 
think it's like 41 cuts

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:49.669 
think it's like 41 cuts
I<00:00:47.670> don't<00:00:48.300> know<00:00:48.420> how<00:00:48.600> wide<00:00:48.809> my<00:00:48.870> blade<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.409> which

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679 
I don't know how wide my blade is which

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.439 
I don't know how wide my blade is which
is<00:00:49.769> just<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.129> standard<00:00:50.309> blade<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.120> I've<00:00:51.239> got

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
is just the standard blade and I've got

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.259 
is just the standard blade and I've got
about<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.659> sixteenth<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.350> an<00:00:52.499> inch<00:00:52.940> right<00:00:53.940> here

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
about a sixteenth of an inch right here

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.959 
about a sixteenth of an inch right here
and<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.620> was<00:00:55.620> plenty<00:00:56.069> to<00:00:56.100> allow<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.489> flex<00:00:56.789> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
and that was plenty to allow it flex it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.599 
and that was plenty to allow it flex it
could<00:00:57.089> actually<00:00:57.269> do<00:00:58.229> a<00:00:58.260> much<00:00:58.559> tighter<00:00:59.190> quarter

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
could actually do a much tighter quarter

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.809 
could actually do a much tighter quarter
than<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.350> it's<00:01:01.350> all<00:01:01.559> good<00:01:01.769> so<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.550> got<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:02.819 
than that but it's all good so I got it

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:04.880 
than that but it's all good so I got it
clamped<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> bottom<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.559> got<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> four

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
clamped on the bottom and I got a four

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.880 
clamped on the bottom and I got a four
by<00:01:05.010> four<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.370> here<00:01:05.580> that's<00:01:05.850> 48<00:01:06.210> inches<00:01:06.890> pretty

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
by four up here that's 48 inches pretty

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.430 
by four up here that's 48 inches pretty
close<00:01:08.240> cut<00:01:09.240> off<00:01:09.420> then<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.660> got<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.900> clamped<00:01:10.080> kind

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
close cut off then I got it clamped kind

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.860 
close cut off then I got it clamped kind
of<00:01:10.530> keep<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.830> top<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:11.970> angle<00:01:14.810> having<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
of keep the top you know angle having a

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.030 
of keep the top you know angle having a
little<00:01:16.020> problem<00:01:16.170> kind<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.530> keeping<00:01:16.800> the<00:01:16.860> blue

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
little problem kind of keeping the blue

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.710 
little problem kind of keeping the blue
and<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.370> kind<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.750> built<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.960> deal<00:01:19.200> up<00:01:20.720> trying

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and I kind of built that deal up trying

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.590 
and I kind of built that deal up trying
to<00:01:21.810> keep<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> glue<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:23.240> trying<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.300> get<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.510> in

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
to keep the glue on trying to get it in

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.140 
to keep the glue on trying to get it in
between<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.960> carve<00:01:25.290> deal<00:01:25.560> there<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.370> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
between the carve deal there and the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.630 
between the carve deal there and the
table<00:01:27.480> trying<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.810> give<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.340> make<00:01:29.340> sure<00:01:29.490> it's

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
table trying to give it make sure it's

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.040 
table trying to give it make sure it's
strong<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.270> used<00:01:30.660> my<00:01:30.840> brad<00:01:31.080> gun<00:01:32.510> if<00:01:33.510> you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.870> see

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
strong I used my brad gun if you can see

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.480 
strong I used my brad gun if you can see
a<00:01:34.080> drill<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.800> got<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.980> bunch<00:01:35.190> of<00:01:35.280> Brad's

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
a drill on there I got a bunch of Brad's

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.770 
a drill on there I got a bunch of Brad's
in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> side<00:01:36.000> there<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.300> kind<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.480> helped<00:01:36.690> me

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
in the side there it kind of helped me

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.440 
in the side there it kind of helped me
hold<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.580> actually<00:01:38.580> was<00:01:38.670> able<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.940> put<00:01:39.120> this<00:01:39.270> on

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
hold it actually was able to put this on

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.540 
hold it actually was able to put this on
by<00:01:39.660> myself<00:01:40.580> surprisingly<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.350> that's<00:01:44.040> half<00:01:44.370> of

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
by myself surprisingly so that's half of

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.460 
by myself surprisingly so that's half of
it

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
it

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.930 
it
tomorrow's<00:01:46.470> Monday<00:01:46.710> I'll<00:01:47.370> probably<00:01:47.580> start
