right away good idea but these ones have
a<00:01:43.630> considerable<00:01:44.320> amount<00:01:44.649> of<00:01:44.770> here<00:01:45.670> organic

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390

sugar<00:01:46.660> water<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:50.350> rubber-banded<00:01:51.039> it<00:01:51.190> up

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
sugar water just rubber-banded it up

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:59.580 
sugar water just rubber-banded it up
here<00:01:56.069> take<00:01:57.069> those<00:01:57.250> two<00:01:58.050> right<00:01:59.050> ring<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.380> big

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
here take those two right ring a big

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:13.770 
here take those two right ring a big
present<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.670> one<00:02:12.880> frame<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.300> brood<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.660> had

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
present the one frame of brood I had

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.890 
present the one frame of brood I had
brood<00:02:14.050> coma<00:02:14.500> had<00:02:14.739> in<00:02:14.890> there<00:02:15.040> yeah<00:02:15.900> my

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
brood coma had in there yeah my

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.449 
brood coma had in there yeah my
prediction<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.680> they<00:02:17.800> just<00:02:18.010> showed<00:02:18.250> up

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
prediction is that they just showed up

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.020 
prediction is that they just showed up
yesterday<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.800> she<00:02:20.860> might<00:02:21.190> not<00:02:21.220> had<00:02:21.550> time<00:02:21.790> to

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
yesterday so she might not had time to

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.460 
yesterday so she might not had time to
get<00:02:22.180> straight<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.690> work<00:02:22.720> but<00:02:23.349> who<00:02:23.530> knows

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.050 

so<00:02:30.470> it's<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.739> little<00:02:30.920> tricky<00:02:31.190> because<00:02:31.430> I'd<00:02:31.849> love

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060
