to three hours to kill enough mobs to
trigger<00:00:37.140> one<00:00:37.350> now<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.280> heard<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.579> kills

while in a raid group do not count

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.030 
while in a raid group do not count

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
however my iron horde invasion triggered

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.729 
however my iron horde invasion triggered
off<00:00:44.280> grinding<00:00:44.969> apex<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.480> crystals<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.410> raid

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
off grinding apex is crystals in a raid

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.130 
off grinding apex is crystals in a raid
group<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.489> pit<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.539> while<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.750> can't

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
group in the pit so while I can't

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.619 
group in the pit so while I can't
necessarily<00:00:49.969> recommend<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.480> this

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
necessarily recommend that you do this

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.630 
necessarily recommend that you do this
in<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.840> great<00:00:52.079> group<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.440> something<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.949> seems

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
in a great group or something it seems

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.520 
in a great group or something it seems
like<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:53.850> did<00:00:54.210> work<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.600> me<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.199> could<00:00:55.500> just

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
like that did work for me it could just

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.799 
like that did work for me it could just
be<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.800> bug<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.850> hard<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.239> say<00:00:57.300> either<00:00:57.539> way

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
be a bug so it's hard to say either way

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.889 
be a bug so it's hard to say either way
but<00:00:58.320> basically<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.250> kill<00:00:59.520> mobs<00:00:59.730> outside<00:01:00.629> in

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
but basically you kill mobs outside in

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.619 
but basically you kill mobs outside in
the<00:01:01.140> world<00:01:01.350> generally<00:01:02.250> doing<00:01:02.789> three<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:03.300> four

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the world generally doing three or four

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.660 
the world generally doing three or four
of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.930> apexes<00:01:04.500> dailies<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.220> single

of the apexes dailies for a single
faction<00:01:06.180> or<00:01:06.299> against<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> single<00:01:07.140> faction

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
faction or against the single faction

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.370 
faction or against the single faction
will<00:01:08.189> generate<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.270> invasion<00:01:09.900> for<00:01:10.170> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
will generate a invasion for that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.350 
will generate a invasion for that
faction<00:01:10.860> once<00:01:11.340> you've<00:01:11.520> killed<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.000> required

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
number of mobs for a faction you will

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280 
number of mobs for a faction you will
start<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> notice<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.689> your<00:01:15.960> mini-map

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
start to notice that your mini-map

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.560 
start to notice that your mini-map
button<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.740> flashing<00:01:17.040> rather<00:01:17.729> annoyingly<00:01:18.180> and

button is flashing rather annoyingly and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.120 
button is flashing rather annoyingly and
then<00:01:18.780> when<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.080> go<00:01:19.229> back<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:19.710> garrison

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
then when you go back to your garrison

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.160 
then when you go back to your garrison
there<00:01:20.700> will<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.060> quest<00:01:21.420> which<00:01:21.659> appears<00:01:21.990> from

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170

health<00:03:16.890> has<00:03:17.010> never<00:03:17.190> been<00:03:17.340> much<00:03:17.520> of<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.790> problem

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
health has never been much of a problem

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.930 
health has never been much of a problem
so<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.690> only<00:03:18.960> really<00:03:19.500> recommend<00:03:20.040> getting<00:03:20.610> the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
so I only really recommend getting the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.880 
so I only really recommend getting the
speed<00:03:21.210> one<00:03:21.450> especially<00:03:21.930> if<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.500> are<00:03:22.560> Melly

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
speed one especially if you are Melly

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.400 
speed one especially if you are Melly
also<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:23.940> anticipate<00:03:24.150> struggling<00:03:25.050> maybe

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
also if you anticipate struggling maybe

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.020 
also if you anticipate struggling maybe
you<00:03:25.560> know<00:03:25.650> you've<00:03:25.800> not<00:03:26.040> got<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.370> particularly

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
you know you've not got a particularly

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.210 
you know you've not got a particularly

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
high gear level then food and a flask

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.430 
high gear level then food and a flask
could<00:03:29.760> help<00:03:30.000> especially<00:03:30.870> during<00:03:31.020> that<00:03:31.230> eight

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
could help especially during that eight

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.650 
could help especially during that eight

pretty self-explanatory in case you
missed<00:04:20.160> any<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.640> just<00:04:20.880> kill<00:04:21.420> the<00:04:21.570> mobs<00:04:21.780> you

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
actually be really easy to get a golf
