let's assume that we want to go say

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.110 
let's assume that we want to go say
back<00:05:37.009> three<00:05:37.190> holes<00:05:37.520> and

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
back three holes and

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.190 
back three holes and
the<00:05:39.419> whole<00:05:39.570> back<00:05:39.780> here<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:40.410> I'm<00:05:40.590> going<00:05:40.830> back

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
the whole back here and I'm going back

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:55.780 
the whole back here and I'm going back
then<00:05:42.320> when<00:05:42.530> I<00:05:42.560> slide<00:05:42.800> the<00:05:42.980> truck<00:05:43.220> I<00:05:43.460> think

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:02.230 

this<00:05:56.790> guy<00:05:56.970> again

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.879 

get<00:06:02.810> back<00:06:02.990> to<00:06:03.139> the<00:06:03.259> truck<00:06:03.440> here<00:06:03.650> I<00:06:03.710> got

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
get back to the truck here I got

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.499 
get back to the truck here I got
thinking<00:06:04.130> that<00:06:04.460> one<00:06:04.880> of<00:06:04.910> the<00:06:05.030> most<00:06:05.120> common

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:05.509 
thinking that one of the most common

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.379 
thinking that one of the most common
things<00:06:05.750> you'll<00:06:05.960> do<00:06:06.970> when<00:06:07.970> you<00:06:08.030> get<00:06:08.150> to<00:06:08.330> a

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
things you'll do when you get to a
