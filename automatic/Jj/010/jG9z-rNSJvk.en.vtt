00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.770
 thanks for the invitation yes yesterday with 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.779
 a rather difficult stage despite 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.340
 it was a short climb it was very very 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.050
 demanding 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.180
 thanks to them we could be in the 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.310
 first positions the team helps me 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.090
 start your life in a way 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.820
 amazing 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.770
 he thought of the tenth wheel and that's a 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.560
 great advantage things went well and 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.290
 well here we are one more day that we have 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.150
 saved now reads the peeling that is 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.000
 worth the revelation of the return to Spain 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.880
 Daddy , how am I going to get to this or 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.070
 do not 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.570
 I did not see it very well super super I think 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.800
 that should be his return this year I think 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.180
 that is very well very quiet a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.430
 team that plays him and I think he's going to 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.990
 be there very well what advice should be 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.240
 give a runner as young as 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.800
 esteban I believe that neither the stephen 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.720
 He knows how to take care and Nil has a lot 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.440
 experience and just listening to you 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.440
 in the wii is already 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.489
 ah 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.590
 well I have not seen all these days very 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.590
 good year showing all this year 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.990
 and their great condition that they have and good 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.540
 yesterday the truth that was pretty good 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.970
 with other Colombians despite 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.549
 all this is what he has done and the weather 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.900
 It has been very difficult for us but 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.330
 it is already 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.120
 but all this and we hope that here in 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.120
 go ahead and make less heat 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.930
 Good Morning
