little bit boring for you and I totally
get<00:04:45.330> that<00:04:45.389> but<00:04:45.720> I<00:04:45.900> think<00:04:45.990> this<00:04:46.320> is<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.530> very<00:04:46.949> I

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
get that but I think this is a very I

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.620 
get that but I think this is a very I
don't<00:04:47.550> want<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:47.970> say<00:04:48.120> it's<00:04:48.300> not<00:04:48.360> like

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
don't want to say it's not like

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.300 
don't want to say it's not like
sophisticated<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.590> would<00:04:49.770> say<00:04:49.919> it's<00:04:49.979> a<00:04:50.099> very

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
sophisticated I would say it's a very

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.700 
sophisticated I would say it's a very
refined<00:04:50.630> sense<00:04:51.630> of<00:04:51.780> humor<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.320> think<00:04:52.530> it's

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
refined sense of humor and I think it's

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.260 
refined sense of humor and I think it's
I<00:04:52.860> think<00:04:52.919> it's<00:04:53.070> really<00:04:53.400> enjoyable<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:53.970> think<00:04:54.150> if

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
I think it's really enjoyable I think if

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.480 
I think it's really enjoyable I think if
you<00:04:54.360> just<00:04:54.389> let<00:04:54.810> yourself<00:04:55.289> go<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:55.860> just<00:04:56.370> sort

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
you just let yourself go and just sort

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.310 
you just let yourself go and just sort
of<00:04:56.610> really<00:04:56.940> just<00:04:57.150> lose<00:04:57.810> yourself<00:04:57.960> with<00:04:58.260> the

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
of really just lose yourself with the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.230 
of really just lose yourself with the
characters<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:58.740> all<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.520> absurdity

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
characters and all of the absurdity

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.790 
characters and all of the absurdity
that's<00:05:00.449> taking<00:05:00.750> place<00:05:00.780> in<00:05:01.080> front<00:05:01.289> of<00:05:01.349> you<00:05:01.500> you
