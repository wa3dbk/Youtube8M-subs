air<00:00:53.330> compressor<00:00:53.870> in<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.410> long<00:00:54.620> run<00:00:54.650> it<00:00:54.980> ends

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
air compressor in the long run it ends

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.850 
air compressor in the long run it ends
up<00:00:55.370> being<00:00:55.580> much<00:00:55.820> cheaper<00:00:56.559> all<00:00:57.559> you<00:00:57.710> do<00:00:57.830> is

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
up being much cheaper all you do is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.479 
up being much cheaper all you do is
