00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
into the database again but for most

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.490 
into the database again but for most
websites<00:01:20.970> who<00:01:21.570> don't<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.900> brand<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
may take it out the redirect but then

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.800 
may take it out the redirect but then
they<00:01:27.990> may<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.579> re<00:01:29.579> included<00:01:30.000> again<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.420> the

they may not be re included again in the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.140 
they may not be re included again in the
database<00:01:31.290> because<00:01:31.670> there<00:01:32.670> are<00:01:32.729> many<00:01:32.880> are

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
database because there are many are

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.149 
database because there are many are
companies<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:33.930> been<00:01:34.020> using<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.770> technique

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
companies have been using this technique

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.310 
companies have been using this technique
and<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:36.090> can't<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:36.509> back<00:01:36.659> into<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.110> data

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
and they can't get back into the data

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.980 
and they can't get back into the data
database<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.100> Google<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.390> therefore<00:01:39.540> all

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
database in Google and so therefore all

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.289 
database in Google and so therefore all
your<00:01:40.229> google<00:01:40.619> rankings<00:01:41.009> are<00:01:41.159> lost<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.759> it's

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
your google rankings are lost so it's

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.810
