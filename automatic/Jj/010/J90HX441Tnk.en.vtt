00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.924
Hi, my name is Veronika and I am bringing you another item of

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:06.920
news from the 10th European Youth Olympic Festival.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.480
We find ourselves on Jested, where downhill skiers have just started their training sessions.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.983
Ales Kryzl is the Alpine Skiing Manager. 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.140
Good morning and welcome. What does it take to be a sport manager?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.387
Good morning. It requires the complete organization of the discipline. 

00:00:35.487 --> 00:00:41.287
We take care of the downhill skiers so 
 we have to prepare the course and

00:00:42.287 --> 00:00:49.389
prepare the facilities in coordination with all the other departments of the European Festivals.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:53.977
I cannot help asking about our biggest hope for medals, Ester Ledecka.

00:00:54.058 --> 00:00:57.983
Ester Ledecka, we believe she is a medal favourite.

00:00:58.863 --> 00:01:04.660
However, what makes her a unique athlete is the fact 
 that she takes part in two disciplines: 

00:01:04.994 --> 00:01:09.776
giant slalom on Monday, snowboarding on Tuesday. I’m 
 not sure quite sure which snowboarding discipline,

00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:17.065
then slalom on Wednesday and snowboarding on Thursday. 
 So we will see how she performs.

00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:21.781
 I think she is the only participant in the 
 European Youth Olympics who takes part in two competitions.

00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:25.028
How difficult is it for you and what does it involve?

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.060
It is going to be difficult but I hope I’ll manage, I 
 have trained hard so I hope to pull it off.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.154
Have you got any ritual for luck before the race?

00:01:36.154 --> 00:01:39.080
No, I don’t want to reveal that.

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.100
As a former athlete, could you describe the feelings and 
 emotions of an athlete standing at the starting line?

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:54.750
Standing at the starting gate one tries to visualize 
 the track, whatever he has time for,

00:01:54.753 --> 00:02:00.440
and during the race itself, there is no time to 
 think about anything else but how to keep

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:07.900
the ideal track and how to get to 
 the finishing line as quickly as possible.
