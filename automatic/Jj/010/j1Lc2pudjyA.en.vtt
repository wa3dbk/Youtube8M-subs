to concepts to ally the foils the colors

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.880

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
to highlight it very much it's a

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.640

compelling<00:01:25.280> sort<00:01:25.880> of<00:01:26.120> thing<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.720> maybe<00:01:27.410> see

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
compelling sort of thing and maybe see

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.220 
compelling sort of thing and maybe see
we<00:01:27.920> have<00:01:28.160> to<00:01:28.400> emphasize<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:29.300> now<00:01:29.540> it<00:01:29.750> is<00:01:29.930> not

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
we have to emphasize that now it is not

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.660 
we have to emphasize that now it is not
only<00:01:30.500> about<00:01:30.770> one<00:01:32.320> painting<00:01:33.670> specific

paintings but it is about about the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
interesting and I'm very fascinating how

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.860 
interesting and I'm very fascinating how
he<00:02:33.810> can<00:02:34.380> transform<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.790> penis

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
he can transform this and penis

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.759 
he can transform this and penis
he<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.530> still<00:02:37.830> find<00:02:38.250> away<00:02:39.170> from<00:02:40.170> them<00:02:40.440> to

he can still find away from them to
something<00:02:41.040> of

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
something of

00:02:41.960 --> 00:03:06.250 
something of

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.809 

I<00:03:06.319> think<00:03:07.099> the<00:03:07.220> reason<00:03:07.400> why<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:09.519> discovered<00:03:10.519> for

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
I think the reason why I discovered for

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.319 
I think the reason why I discovered for
myself<00:03:10.849> my<00:03:11.780> Anna's<00:03:12.140> work<00:03:12.500> that<00:03:13.069> was<00:03:13.310> in<00:03:14.180> the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
myself my Anna's work that was in the

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.039 
myself my Anna's work that was in the
time<00:03:14.510> when<00:03:15.110> I<00:03:15.140> studied<00:03:15.530> in<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:15.980> 90s<00:03:16.720> was<00:03:17.720> that

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
time when I studied in the 90s was that

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.170 
time when I studied in the 90s was that
there<00:03:18.260> was<00:03:18.439> something<00:03:19.129> it's<00:03:19.879> always

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
there was something it's always

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.210 
there was something it's always
difficult<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:20.689> think<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.959> talk<00:03:21.409> about<00:03:21.530> abstract

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
difficult I think to talk about abstract

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.319 
difficult I think to talk about abstract
painting<00:03:22.700> or<00:03:22.819> abstract<00:03:23.120> art<00:03:23.980> because<00:03:25.329> it's

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
painting or abstract art because it's

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.569 
painting or abstract art because it's
some<00:03:26.709> difficult<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.860> find<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:28.159> right<00:03:28.310> word

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
some difficult to find the right word

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.259 
some difficult to find the right word
for<00:03:28.610> it<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.150> there<00:03:29.390> was<00:03:29.540> something<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:32.090> way

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
for it but there was something the way

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
was a very strong feeling I got from it

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.330 
was a very strong feeling I got from it
and<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:54.400> discovered<00:03:55.400> that<00:03:55.579> she<00:03:56.060> kind<00:03:56.659> of<00:03:56.840> use

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
and I discovered that she kind of use

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.110 
and I discovered that she kind of use
material<00:03:58.340> as<00:03:58.579> a<00:03:58.639> language<00:03:59.120> and<00:04:00.940> that<00:04:01.940> it's

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
material as a language and that it's

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.020 
material as a language and that it's
really<00:04:02.389> a<00:04:02.510> language<00:04:03.170> not<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:04.010> not<00:04:04.639> their<00:04:04.819> own

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
really a language not the not their own

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.509 
really a language not the not their own
only<00:04:05.690> issue<00:04:05.870> but<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.440> language<00:04:06.829> for<00:04:07.099> it<00:04:07.280> and

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
only issue but the language for it and

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.449 
only issue but the language for it and
that<00:04:07.819> was<00:04:08.180> a<00:04:08.239> very<00:04:08.569> pure<00:04:09.019> way<00:04:09.290> that<00:04:09.709> I<00:04:09.739> like

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
that was a very pure way that I like

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:18.680 
that was a very pure way that I like
very<00:04:10.489> much

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.800 

I<00:04:18.750> think<00:04:19.620> by<00:04:19.739> accident<00:04:20.310> she<00:04:20.730> came<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.330> my

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
I think by accident she came to my

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.560 
I think by accident she came to my
studio<00:04:22.110> with<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.530> finished<00:04:23.010> group<00:04:23.280> or<00:04:24.120> let's

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
studio with a finished group or let's

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.300 
studio with a finished group or let's
say<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:24.750> didn't<00:04:25.230> know<00:04:25.320> that<00:04:25.350> that<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:25.920> is<00:04:26.070> her

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
say I didn't know that that it is her

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.230 
say I didn't know that that it is her
and<00:04:27.290> then<00:04:28.290> I<00:04:28.470> found<00:04:29.310> out<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.610> it's<00:04:29.970> Molly

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
and then I found out that it's Molly

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.360 
and then I found out that it's Molly
Anna<00:04:30.450> routine<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.170> that<00:04:31.290> was<00:04:31.470> 10<00:04:32.190> years

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
Anna routine and and that was 10 years

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.320 
Anna routine and and that was 10 years
or<00:04:32.610> 15<00:04:32.730> years<00:04:32.970> later<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:34.650> I<00:04:35.330> exactly

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
or 15 years later and I exactly

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.110 
or 15 years later and I exactly
remembered<00:04:36.870> her<00:04:37.020> works<00:04:37.290> so<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:40.250> then<00:04:41.250> we<00:04:41.580> we

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
remembered her works so and then we we

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.780 
remembered her works so and then we we
met<00:04:42.360> some<00:04:42.990> time<00:04:43.020> in<00:04:43.530> Berlin<00:04:43.830> because<00:04:44.340> she

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
met some time in Berlin because she

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.270 
met some time in Berlin because she
lived<00:04:45.000> in<00:04:45.180> Berlin<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:45.750> we<00:04:46.590> always<00:04:46.770> wanted<00:04:47.160> to

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
lived in Berlin and we always wanted to

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.390 
lived in Berlin and we always wanted to
do<00:04:47.430> something<00:04:47.820> together<00:04:49.070> but<00:04:50.070> for<00:04:50.280> this

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
do something together but for this

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.120 
do something together but for this
project<00:04:50.700> is<00:04:51.180> it<00:04:51.420> was<00:04:51.630> not<00:04:51.870> our<00:04:52.050> work<00:04:52.710> to<00:04:52.980> do

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
project is it was not our work to do

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.000 
project is it was not our work to do
that<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.790> was<00:04:53.970> not<00:04:54.150> our<00:04:54.180> idea<00:04:54.450> it<00:04:54.900> was<00:04:55.080> the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
that it was not our idea it was the

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.770 
that it was not our idea it was the
people<00:04:56.370> from<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.520> long<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:57.090> timo<00:04:57.360> they<00:04:57.540> came

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
people from the long and timo they came

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.470 
people from the long and timo they came
to<00:04:58.440> us<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.860> they<00:04:59.010> had<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.340> idea<00:04:59.490> they<00:05:00.270> found

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
to us and they had the idea they found

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.540 
to us and they had the idea they found
out<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:00.900> our<00:05:00.960> works<00:05:01.560> could<00:05:02.160> be<00:05:02.370> good

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
out that our works could be good

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.100 
out that our works could be good
together<00:05:02.730> that<00:05:03.270> it<00:05:03.390> makes<00:05:03.540> sense<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.900> show

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
together that it makes sense to show

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.600 
together that it makes sense to show
together<00:05:04.580> so<00:05:05.580> that<00:05:05.610> was<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.240> good<00:05:07.610> cook

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
together so that was a good cook

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.419 
together so that was a good cook
coincidence

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:14.429 

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:18.509 

to<00:05:15.429> the<00:05:15.549> concept<00:05:15.999> for<00:05:16.179> the<00:05:16.329> show<00:05:17.189> when<00:05:18.189> I<00:05:18.219> saw

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:18.519 
to the concept for the show when I saw

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:21.209 
to the concept for the show when I saw
this<00:05:18.699> space<00:05:19.029> here<00:05:19.389> because<00:05:20.379> it<00:05:20.559> is<00:05:20.709> called<00:05:20.979> so

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
this space here because it is called so

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:24.149 
this space here because it is called so
long<00:05:21.399> and<00:05:21.729> I<00:05:21.879> had<00:05:21.999> the<00:05:22.179> idea<00:05:22.299> when<00:05:22.959> we<00:05:23.139> do<00:05:23.319> the

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
long and I had the idea when we do the

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.339 
long and I had the idea when we do the
waltz<00:05:24.609> in<00:05:24.879> a<00:05:24.969> dark<00:05:25.269> color<00:05:25.569> it<00:05:25.899> is<00:05:26.109> much<00:05:26.319> more

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
waltz in a dark color it is much more

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.749 
waltz in a dark color it is much more
less<00:05:26.769> alone<00:05:27.099> and<00:05:28.349> so<00:05:29.349> it<00:05:29.469> fits<00:05:29.739> to<00:05:29.949> this<00:05:30.129> idea

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
less alone and so it fits to this idea

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:35.159 
less alone and so it fits to this idea
of<00:05:30.939> us<00:05:31.059> along<00:05:31.359> quite<00:05:32.079> a<00:05:32.109> lot<00:05:32.439> and<00:05:32.729> then<00:05:33.929> we<00:05:34.929> want

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
of us along quite a lot and then we want

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.739 
of us along quite a lot and then we want
to<00:05:35.259> make<00:05:35.409> it<00:05:35.439> a<00:05:35.739> bit<00:05:36.099> more<00:05:36.129> harder<00:05:37.029> we<00:05:37.539> had<00:05:37.629> the

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:37.749 
to make it a bit more harder we had the

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:40.589 
to make it a bit more harder we had the
idea<00:05:37.869> for<00:05:38.169> black<00:05:38.609> but<00:05:39.609> it<00:05:39.639> is<00:05:40.089> I<00:05:40.269> think<00:05:40.389> very

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
idea for black but it is I think very

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.319 
idea for black but it is I think very
much<00:05:41.019> to<00:05:41.499> work<00:05:41.709> with<00:05:42.039> this<00:05:42.399> a<00:05:42.459> long<00:05:42.729> idea<00:05:43.149> and

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:43.329 
much to work with this a long idea and

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:46.079 
much to work with this a long idea and
with<00:05:43.509> the<00:05:43.539> space<00:05:43.989> and<00:05:44.409> not<00:05:44.769> against<00:05:45.339> it<00:05:45.549> might

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.089 
with the space and not against it might

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:47.909 
with the space and not against it might
be<00:05:46.269> a<00:05:46.299> bit<00:05:46.599> shocking<00:05:47.110> when<00:05:47.439> you<00:05:47.559> come<00:05:47.769> inside

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
be a bit shocking when you come inside

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.489 
be a bit shocking when you come inside
but<00:05:48.279> I<00:05:48.339> think<00:05:48.669> it<00:05:48.879> is<00:05:49.029> very<00:05:49.119> much<00:05:49.539> that<00:05:50.169> we<00:05:50.319> were

00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:50.499 
but I think it is very much that we were

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:55.480 
but I think it is very much that we were
with<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:51.279> space

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.980 

I<00:05:55.750> didn't<00:05:56.750> know<00:05:56.780> that<00:05:57.169> it's<00:05:57.349> so<00:05:57.620> much

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
I didn't know that it's so much

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.170 
I didn't know that it's so much
parallels<00:06:00.550> when<00:06:01.550> we<00:06:01.669> build<00:06:01.910> up<00:06:02.030> the

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
parallels when we build up the

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.320 
parallels when we build up the
exhibition<00:06:02.750> I<00:06:02.990> was<00:06:03.500> really<00:06:04.389> i<00:06:05.710> found<00:06:06.710> out<00:06:06.860> that

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
exhibition I was really i found out that

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.749 
exhibition I was really i found out that
what<00:06:08.330> i<00:06:08.360> would<00:06:09.080> go<00:06:09.259> here<00:06:09.410> first<00:06:09.590> time<00:06:09.919> it<00:06:10.520> would

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
what i would go here first time it would

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:13.270 
what i would go here first time it would
be<00:06:10.880> really<00:06:11.270> difficult<00:06:11.569> to<00:06:12.380> say<00:06:12.590> this<00:06:12.830> work<00:06:13.069> is

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
be really difficult to say this work is

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.580 
be really difficult to say this work is
unzip<00:06:14.090> lightly<00:06:14.389> this<00:06:14.539> is<00:06:14.690> mariana<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:15.259> even

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
unzip lightly this is mariana and even

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.710 
unzip lightly this is mariana and even
