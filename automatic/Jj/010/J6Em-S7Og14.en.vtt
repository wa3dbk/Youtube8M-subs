this<00:01:52.759> year<00:01:52.969> I<00:01:52.999> think<00:01:53.329> it's<00:01:53.509> Gump<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:54.139> would<00:01:54.439> some

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
this year I think it's Gump I would some

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.889 
this year I think it's Gump I would some
kind<00:01:55.459> of<00:01:55.490> hard<00:01:55.670> with<00:01:55.819> plywood<00:01:56.299> it's<00:01:56.719> not

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
kind of hard with plywood it's not

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.099 
kind of hard with plywood it's not
really<00:01:57.170> important<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:58.600> framing<00:01:59.600> power<00:01:59.810> doors

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
really important the framing power doors

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.399 
really important the framing power doors
are<00:02:00.319> just<00:02:00.499> white<00:02:00.709> pine<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:02.020> they<00:02:03.020> seem<00:02:03.319> to

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
are just white pine and they seem to

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:04.560 
are just white pine and they seem to
work<00:02:03.590> real<00:02:03.799> good<00:02:03.829> for<00:02:04.130> this<00:02:04.219> app

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
work real good for this app

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.770 
work real good for this app
and<00:02:04.660> I<00:02:04.960> didn't<00:02:05.200> use<00:02:05.350> these<00:02:05.530> knobs<00:02:05.740> up<00:02:06.070> anyway

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
and I didn't use these knobs up anyway

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.070 
and I didn't use these knobs up anyway
and<00:02:07.780> but<00:02:08.470> anyway<00:02:08.560> it's<00:02:09.310> very<00:02:09.600> intense<00:02:10.600> as<00:02:10.840> I

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
and but anyway it's very intense as I

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.540 
and but anyway it's very intense as I
showed<00:02:11.320> you<00:02:11.350> in<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.560> other<00:02:11.620> video

showed you in the other video

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.640 
showed you in the other video
it<00:02:13.540> goes<00:02:13.720> on<00:02:14.790> either<00:02:15.790> side<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.180> them<00:02:16.420> -<00:02:16.650> it

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
it goes on either side of them - it

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.890 
it goes on either side of them - it
