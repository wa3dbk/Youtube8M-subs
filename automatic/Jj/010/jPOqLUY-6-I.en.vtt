00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
getting to be winter here in Illinois so

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.770 
getting to be winter here in Illinois so
I'm<00:00:13.230> back<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.469> making<00:00:13.920> little<00:00:14.130> engines<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.910> by

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
I'm back to making little engines and by

I'm back to making little engines and by
the<00:00:15.839> way<00:00:16.020> if<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.800> don't<00:00:16.950> live<00:00:17.099> in<00:00:17.130> Illinois

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the way if you don't live in Illinois

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.210 
the way if you don't live in Illinois
they<00:00:17.640> don't<00:00:17.790> recommend<00:00:18.240> moving<00:00:18.720> here<00:00:19.100> we<00:00:20.100> only

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
they don't recommend moving here we only

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.000 
they don't recommend moving here we only
have<00:00:20.369> about<00:00:20.640> six<00:00:21.090> months<00:00:21.390> good<00:00:21.630> weather<00:00:22.109> most

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
have about six months good weather most

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.490 
have about six months good weather most
of<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> year<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.730> quite<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.600> corrupt

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
of the year and it's quite a corrupt

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.830 
of the year and it's quite a corrupt
government<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:26.310> Illinois<00:00:26.970> as<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.660> hear

even<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> national<00:00:28.800> news<00:00:28.949> there's<00:00:29.609> a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
even on the national news there's a

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.710 
even on the national news there's a
little<00:00:29.939> engine<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.689> I'd<00:00:30.810> aggress<00:00:31.740> by<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.369> way

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
little engine and I'd aggress by the way

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.000 
little engine and I'd aggress by the way
here's<00:00:33.720> a<00:00:33.809> little<00:00:34.019> engine<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:34.620> made<00:00:34.800> that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
here's a little engine I just made that

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.880 
here's a little engine I just made that
run<00:00:35.879> by<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.089> solenoid<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.960> has<00:00:37.170> similar<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.739> one

I<00:00:37.920> made<00:00:38.250> last<00:00:38.640> year<00:00:38.850> right<00:00:39.299> I<00:00:39.540> made<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.140> note

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:40.409 
I made last year right I made this note

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.590 
I made last year right I made this note
here<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.460> solenoid<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.210> here<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.570> a

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
here that the solenoid on here is a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.259

sporran solenoids l MK c - one which i
just<00:00:48.479> happened<00:00:48.869> to<00:00:48.900> run<00:00:49.049> across<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.710> cut<00:00:49.979> off

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
just happened to run across I cut off

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.070 
just happened to run across I cut off
the<00:00:50.369> valve<00:00:50.640> portion<00:00:51.330> of<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.540> but<00:00:51.720> it's<00:00:51.869> a<00:00:51.960> very

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
the valve portion of it but it's a very

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.609 
the valve portion of it but it's a very
nice<00:00:52.409> little<00:00:52.799> solenoids<00:00:53.479> ol<00:00:54.479> in<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.500> it's

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:55.619 
nice little solenoids ol in it but it's

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.229 
nice little solenoids ol in it but it's
a<00:00:55.710> hundred<00:00:55.830> and<00:00:56.129> ten<00:00:56.309> bolt<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.909> you<00:00:56.970> gotta

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
a hundred and ten bolt so you gotta

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.570 
a hundred and ten bolt so you gotta
watch<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:57.659> you<00:00:57.809> touch<00:00:57.989> around<00:00:58.409> here<00:00:58.769> but

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
watch what you touch around here but

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.030 
watch what you touch around here but
it's<00:01:00.449> similar<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.080> one<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.500> made<00:01:01.710> last

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
it's similar to one that I made last

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.130 
it's similar to one that I made last
year<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:03.269> a<00:01:03.420> 12<00:01:03.750> volt<00:01:04.110> er<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:05.869> that's<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
year it's a 12 volt er but that's the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.050 
year it's a 12 volt er but that's the
inspiration<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.950> guess<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.310> could<00:01:08.520> say<00:01:08.550> but

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
inspiration I guess you could say but

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.400 
inspiration I guess you could say but
runs<00:01:12.060> real<00:01:12.270> good<00:01:12.480> I<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.780> plugs<00:01:13.050> in<00:01:13.200> 210<00:01:13.800> volt

this apportion the do-nothing machine
do-nothing<00:01:48.579> engine<00:01:49.000> so<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.799> needn't<00:01:51.220> bother

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
do-nothing engine so you needn't bother

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.050 
do-nothing engine so you needn't bother
to<00:01:51.790> tell<00:01:52.000> me<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.890> it's<00:01:54.070> worthless<00:01:54.340> or<00:01:54.850> the

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
to tell me that it's worthless or the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
had no power or esmolol use that I know

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.580 
had no power or esmolol use that I know
it<00:01:58.210> doesn't<00:01:58.539> fit<00:01:58.720> for<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:58.990> fun<00:01:59.200> of<00:01:59.229> it<00:01:59.409> just

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
it doesn't fit for the fun of it just

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.039 
it doesn't fit for the fun of it just
quickly<00:02:00.100> for<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.490> fun<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:00.909> and<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:01.899> can

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
quickly for the fun of it and you can

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.020 
quickly for the fun of it and you can
stop<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.530> as<00:02:02.679> long<00:02:02.890> as<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.250> solenoid<00:02:04.409> isn't<00:02:05.409> on

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
stop it as long as the solenoid isn't on

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.359 
stop it as long as the solenoid isn't on
so<00:02:07.030> we<00:02:07.179> got<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.739> micro<00:02:08.739> such<00:02:08.950> kind<00:02:09.190> of<00:02:09.250> in<00:02:09.310> the

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
so we got the micro such kind of in the

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.670 
so we got the micro such kind of in the
neutral<00:02:09.759> position<00:02:09.880> there<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.539> made<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.380> cam

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
neutral position there I made that cam

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.759 
neutral position there I made that cam
so<00:02:12.130> that<00:02:12.400> probably<00:02:13.090> about<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.690> hundred<00:02:14.590> degrees

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
so that probably about a hundred degrees

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.920 
so that probably about a hundred degrees
of<00:02:15.370> rotation<00:02:15.970> there<00:02:16.150> maybe<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.540> little<00:02:16.630> more

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
of rotation there maybe a little more

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.199 
of rotation there maybe a little more
120<00:02:17.799> where<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:19.890> current<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.010> running<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.090> the

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
120 where the current is running to the

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.199 
120 where the current is running to the
solenoid<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.989> tried<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.680> much<00:02:24.190> less<00:02:24.519> than<00:02:25.000> that

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
solenoid I tried it much less than that
