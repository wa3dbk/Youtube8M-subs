00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.469
 so servus with each other 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.940
 Now I would like to make you new again 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.889
 I would present a workshop today 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.870
 explain to you how to fix the flying mistakes 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.000
 technique for the baskets applies that 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.590
 Last time I have you the gravity 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.180
 sheet already explained so how 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.980
 always comment 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.580
 Tell me what maybe better 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.029
 could do and then we catch ourselves 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.180
 do 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:38.790
 I got sticks from tana today 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.530
 brought these are the fool of 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.110
 a Japanese rich this extremely 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.910
 hard just as good for metal and 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.160
 hardcore and is quite something and as always 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.500
 Actually playing with every drums 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.170
 The things also touch very loosely 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.699
 should be neat in the hand 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.420
 should not someone slip or 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.160
 something it is in pretty good now 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.409
 It is also very important that you like 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.229
 always not cramped that we do 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.799
 You can play properly 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.479
 then take the steel strings snaredrum off then 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.700
 Can you hear exactly if you clean 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.020
 plays or just plays dirty or 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.759
 the blows whether the sow or get 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.229
 Not 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.420
 important is that you have the two fingers 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.390
 thumb and forefinger together 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.030
 swing freely and with the three 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.810
 the rest fingers one up and down 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.119
 So movement creates one 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.380
 wave motion quasi that the stick on 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:44.020
 end of the leyen so oscillates 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.119
 that you are not sitting there cramped and 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.600
 tried as crazy on the cases the 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:53.110
 basins but that the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.579
 Stick movement comes on automatically 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.579
 best start slowly 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:17.570
 I now have the chance once again 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.700
 created on the field and I would like 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.870
 explain that it is very important that you 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.210
 the amplitude is the height 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.000
 beating sticks as low as possible 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.350
 is the shorter the way is the shorter 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.090
 faster could be on again 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.130
 It is best to open this field 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.110
 but for the life 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.230
 the swing movement with the fingers in 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.280
 to train an amplitude and then 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.280
 to get faster 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.730
 We are at the end of our lives again 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.100
 workshop last I want you still 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.430
 put it on the way that it is best 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.770
 in the leaf beats from slow to 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.990
 quickly back up slowly again 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.190
 to train fast 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.350
 especially if you are in one 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.030
 speed since suits you well 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.080
 then again in one speed 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.220
 since it is extremely difficult for you 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.400
 and then again at a speed 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.710
 from above, it will make you feel better again 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.840
 so could the speed 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.400
 train and especially the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.780
 higher speeds do not you 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.640
 because of that you can become safer there 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.100
 I hope it has brought you further 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.230
 I wish you still had much success 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.230
 and as I said comment
