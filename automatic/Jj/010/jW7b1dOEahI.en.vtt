00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.269
 hey people welcome to the first one 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.759
 as in 2015 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.160
 The first video this year is about to go 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.340
 a memory upgrade of an imac is 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.180
 there in the background then with such 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.250
 to regulate memory 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.619
 I have recently ordered this 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.720
 they still have to be installed 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.010
 the question is just for many mac users 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.800
 I can simply upgrade my mac 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.720
 is that difficult if so how expensive is it? 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.870
 how that works is that 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.340
 covered with the guarantee is lost 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.100
 so it is not guaranteed 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.600
 he lost shows himself that shows 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.460
 I'll show you how 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.960
 you can now upgrade the memory that 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.129
 is now only the preparation 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.230
 shall be called the video you see now 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.690
 identified what kind of a way had with 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.070
 what this can be upgraded is 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.480
 yes important you can not do anything 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.280
 but must be very accurate 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.930
 take care that these memories 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.550
 custom fit here and also the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 Right ones are around the second part 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.159
 subtle the practical thing namely 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.080
 how to install the memory and run 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.549
 restarted the computer around the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.920
 to see if they have accepted too 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.900
 was or maybe not yes 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.210
 So have fun in the first video im 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.460
 year 2015 this is the preparation for 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.250
 Memory upgrade of a series of people 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.049
 Now we landed on my imac 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.900
 and now it's about how it works 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.759
 to identify mac up here you have 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.470
 your raffel if you also have this apple 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.659
 then there's the one below 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.659
 Possibility of this agreement 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.369
 We'll just do that 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:41.000
 and then I should get exactly now 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:44.159
 first of all what is installed here is going on 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.759
 angeles katy it's her version 10.10 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.729
 each one away from mid-2011 to 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.409
 processor 2 7 ghz intel core i5 and 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.180
 Now we come to the actual 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.369
 quoted problems namely 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.939
 the memory is much better 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.520
 Installed 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:05.100
 13 33 ddr3 ecc is so that now is the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.390
 big question I was got out I 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.879
 unfortunately it is rich with me 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.709
 not when I cut videos 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.950
 I'm doing on this computer here then 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.599
 is my store 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.520
 fully utilized that again and again 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.269
 outsourced to the hard disk 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.720
 Need to become 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.769
 that makes the whole infinitely slow 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.660
 That's why I want my memory now 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.879
 upgrade and usually the case 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.840
 at the other usern the their memory 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.269
 want to upgrade 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.370
 Here you go to memory once 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.230
 to see what's for 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.800
 is installed at all and I see 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.040
 here my imac has quasi 1234 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.209
 the ram benches of which two each with 2 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.730
 gibyte are occupied 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.099
 that means I have two empty benches 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.140
 that means I can upgrade these 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.750
 next comes the question with what 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.940
 I then knew that and there is 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.000
 Below is a guide to the store 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.810
 upgrade one clicks on it then comes 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.200
 First of all, you choose the model exactly 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.730
 that means you have to know what kind of 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.890
 model you have just who 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.519
 paid attention that saw that in 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.579
 The overview is something of an animal 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.530
 owns 21 5 inches middle 2011 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:20.139
 that means I go here to 21 5 inches 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.609
 middle of 2011 and actually click on it 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.410
 should all this down now 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.180
 scroll 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.290
 I do not know if this mistake on the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.430
 apple side only occurs when you get the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.170
 chrome browser uses or even the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.090
 other browser that is in the case 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.600
 you probably just have to go down 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.150
 scroll 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.489
 So you look at exactly what 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.510
 here it goes down further 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.609
 a little further down 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.920
 and then we are already at that 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:49.720
 We need apply to the following models 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.609
 imac 21,5 mid-2011 number of 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.049
 Memory slots fourth waiting 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:57.700
 memory 4 at maximum memory 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.730
 16 gigabytes 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.829
 that means you can also upgrade 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.780
 put his advice at imac 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.400
 you two for it is next to memory 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.359
 you have not seen the type of trent 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.090
 use 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:13.150
 with the models imac with scenes amec 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.549
 with 20 11 in two or four each 0 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.789
 the working memory of the type 13 30 mhz 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:22.539
 Use ddr3 sdram in each slot 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:25.480
 that means I need for my imacs 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:32.410
 middle 20 11 pc 300 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:34.270
 600 a parity 204 pohlig 13 33 mhz 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.510
 ddr sd ram 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.550
 I ordered that and so on 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.820
 exactly the same way 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.310
 you with this list up here 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.110
 verify and find out how you are 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.110
 your upgrade from memory upgrade 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.240
 if you can stop the problem so 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.280
 like me, that he does not belong to the one 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.900
 the actual entry in the page 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.090
 then you can do the whole course 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.230
 scroll down by hand and you 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.690
 then look here 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.670
 the most important was now first 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.650
 determine what kind of a need then 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.900
 I said now I need this 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.640
 you could if you older 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.440
 models has a different space use 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.660
 you have to then accordingly 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.430
 I have ordered it then 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.380
 about Amazon I link you and 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.820
 affirmation down in the video 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.100
 You can click on the description of it 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.520
 if the interest is in it and here 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.190
 below you can already see apple itself 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.410
 provides a guide how to 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.770
 the space is exchanged that is 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.090
 make power off then you have to do this 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.530
 raise the position a bit 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.440
 down here the memory cover with 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.680
 then a cross screwdriver stands 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.150
 open and then the further procedure 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.810
 but of course there are now 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.940
 next video so that's the one 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.230
 preparation with the things you can 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.210
 her now the space first made the 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.830
 you still need and in the next video 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.850
 is it then about this asked 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.770
 to use 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.430
 See you at the next video too 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.430
 motivation
