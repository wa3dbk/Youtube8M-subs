00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.830 
rest of the fight and outscored him by
three<00:01:41.130> rounds<00:01:41.729> according<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> judges

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
three rounds according to the judges

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.380 
three rounds according to the judges
over<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.619> remaining<00:01:44.009> 11<00:01:44.820> rounds<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.240> that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
over the remaining 11 rounds of that

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.319 
over the remaining 11 rounds of that
fight<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.740> think<00:01:47.009> Marquez<00:01:47.700> more<00:01:48.149> than

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
fight so we think Marquez more than

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.749 
fight so we think Marquez more than
handled<00:01:48.750> its<00:01:48.869> own<00:01:49.020> against<00:01:49.409> pacquiao<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.189> we

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
handled its own against pacquiao and we

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.389 
handled its own against pacquiao and we
believe<00:01:51.060> cracow<00:01:51.600> has<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.200> harder<00:01:52.770> punch<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
believe cracow has a harder punch and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.090 
believe cracow has a harder punch and
has<00:01:54.149> much<00:01:54.509> more<00:01:54.540> hands<00:01:55.020> feed<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.560> better<00:01:55.770> legs

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
has much more hands feed at better legs
