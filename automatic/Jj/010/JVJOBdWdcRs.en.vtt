changes okay you got experiment and if
you<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.579> some<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> pieces<00:01:54.360> are<00:01:55.049> close

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
you can get some of the pieces are close

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.200 
you can get some of the pieces are close
to<00:01:55.710> some<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> parameters<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:57.149> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
racket speed is like a joke it's so much

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.600 
racket speed is like a joke it's so much
faster<00:02:15.209> I<00:02:15.690> can<00:02:15.959> spin<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.530> ball<00:02:16.740> I'm<00:02:17.100> not<00:02:17.370> late

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
faster I can spin the ball I'm not late

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.230 
faster I can spin the ball I'm not late
anymore

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
anymore

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.120 
anymore
I<00:02:18.270> don't<00:02:18.570> feel<00:02:18.780> jammed<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.470> that's<00:02:19.980> a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
I don't feel jammed and that's a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.670 
I don't feel jammed and that's a
byproduct<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:21.180> thing<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.600> mechanics<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
byproduct of one thing the mechanics the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.170 
byproduct of one thing the mechanics the
only<00:02:22.890> thing<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.220> got<00:02:23.370> control<00:02:23.610> over<00:02:23.820> right

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
only thing you got control over right

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.630 
only thing you got control over right
now<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.900> how<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.140> hit<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.500> ball<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.010> get

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
now is how you hit the ball you get

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.940 
now is how you hit the ball you get
order<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.270> becomes<00:02:27.690> super<00:02:28.080> because<00:02:28.590> you've

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
order this becomes super because you've

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.130 
order this becomes super because you've
got<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.340> much<00:02:29.489> muscle<00:02:29.730> memory<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:30.690> hard<00:02:31.020> to

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
got so much muscle memory it's hard to

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.800 
got so much muscle memory it's hard to
make<00:02:31.319> adjustments<00:02:31.470> when<00:02:32.459> you're<00:02:32.580> like<00:02:32.810> 1617

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
make adjustments when you're like 1617

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.110 
make adjustments when you're like 1617
it's<00:02:34.020> hard<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:34.800> right<00:02:34.980> now<00:02:35.220> it's<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.850> clean

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
it's hard but right now it's a clean

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.690 
it's hard but right now it's a clean
slate<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.080> got<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.530> go<00:02:37.650> slow<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:38.430> got<00:02:38.580> to

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
slate so you got to go slow you got to

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.280 
slate so you got to go slow you got to
think<00:02:38.850> about<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.510> try<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.660> work<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.140> this

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
think about it and try to work on this

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.920 
think about it and try to work on this
all<00:02:40.739> right<00:02:40.860> did<00:02:41.160> anybody<00:02:41.310> like<00:02:41.730> fire<00:02:42.090> yeah

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.210 

okay<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:45.989> yes<00:02:47.209> No<00:02:48.239> okay<00:02:48.720> first<00:02:49.530> off<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:49.890> see<00:02:50.070> a

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
okay so yes No okay first off you see a

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.040 
okay so yes No okay first off you see a
lot<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.580> times<00:02:50.760> you're<00:02:50.940> gonna<00:02:51.030> ask<00:02:51.690> about<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
lot of times you're gonna ask about the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.920 
lot of times you're gonna ask about the
finish<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.830> follow-through<00:02:53.489> see<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.690> balls

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
finish the follow-through see the balls

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.690 
finish the follow-through see the balls
already<00:02:55.230> left<00:02:55.470> there<00:02:55.650> after<00:02:55.800> the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
already left there after the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.390 
already left there after the
follow-through<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.870> really<00:02:58.350> just<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.920> teaching

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
follow-through is really just a teaching

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.180 
follow-through is really just a teaching
element<00:03:00.060> okay<00:03:00.690> it's<00:03:00.900> really<00:03:01.080> insignificant

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
element okay it's really insignificant

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.770 
element okay it's really insignificant
unless<00:03:02.489> someone's<00:03:02.910> not<00:03:03.120> following<00:03:03.600> through

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
unless someone's not following through

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.569 
unless someone's not following through
see<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.560> thought<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.920> balls<00:03:05.130> already<00:03:05.370> left

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
see the thought the balls already left

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.949 
see the thought the balls already left
the<00:03:05.670> racket<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.360> that's<00:03:06.540> what<00:03:06.660> people<00:03:06.810> don't

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
the racket and that's what people don't

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.259 
the racket and that's what people don't
understand<00:03:07.590> where<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.459> follow-through<00:03:08.850> goes

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
understand where the follow-through goes

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.150 
understand where the follow-through goes
depends<00:03:10.049> on<00:03:10.170> where<00:03:10.500> you're<00:03:10.620> hitting<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:10.980> ball

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
depends on where you're hitting the ball

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.850 
depends on where you're hitting the ball
it's<00:03:11.700> all<00:03:11.880> like<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.269> situation<00:03:13.019> sometimes

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
it's all like a situation sometimes

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.800 
it's all like a situation sometimes
you're<00:03:14.010> gonna<00:03:14.100> see<00:03:14.310> people<00:03:14.640> go<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.150> see

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
you're gonna see people go like this see

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.780 
you're gonna see people go like this see
rapid<00:03:16.230> do<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> lot<00:03:16.829> we're<00:03:17.250> gonna<00:03:17.400> see<00:03:17.549> this

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
rapid do that a lot we're gonna see this

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.940 
rapid do that a lot we're gonna see this
you<00:03:18.299> can<00:03:18.329> see<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.690> racket<00:03:19.079> inverted<00:03:19.620> you'll

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
you can see the racket inverted you'll

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.039
