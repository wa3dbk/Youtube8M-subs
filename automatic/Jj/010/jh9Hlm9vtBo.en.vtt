00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
little bit of extra skin and you can

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.110 
little bit of extra skin and you can
really<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.290> from<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.820> doing<00:00:44.820> push-ups

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
really see like from like doing push-ups

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.270 
really see like from like doing push-ups
or<00:00:45.690> something<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:46.500> while<00:00:46.680> remaining<00:00:46.860> over

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280

or something like while remaining over
so<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.579> see<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.149> little<00:00:48.239> bit<00:00:48.390> after

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
so you see it's just a little bit after

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.900 
so you see it's just a little bit after
skin<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.530> mostly<00:00:49.770> really<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.280> tell<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.670> I'm

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
skin but mostly really can tell if I'm

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.350 
skin but mostly really can tell if I'm
standing<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.480> really<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:52.020> tell<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:54.210> that's

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
standing up really can tell so that's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.580 
standing up really can tell so that's
something<00:00:54.510> I'm<00:00:54.690> really<00:00:54.870> worried<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.199> I

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
something I'm really worried about I

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.080 
something I'm really worried about I
wouldn't<00:00:55.949> never<00:00:56.039> get<00:00:56.250> surgery<00:00:56.640> or<00:00:56.820> something

wouldn't never get surgery or something

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.610 
wouldn't never get surgery or something
like<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.300> maybe<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.620> some<00:00:58.770> more<00:00:58.890> setups

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620
