00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.139
 last week we started our 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.570
 workshop by Claudio Nodar and the 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.320
 responsible for the vision and knob that 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.320
 today we will meet 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.779
 30 years ago we're on the bike and 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 We are dedicating what we sell 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.270
 repair a service whatever it is 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.500
 on two wheels we mostly do everything 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.690
 what can we do our song 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.579
 I started a workshop in a 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.190
 sick mechanic shop turnery 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.489
 mechanics and we started with the bikes in 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.850
 81 when the importation of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.050
 motorcycles and the little time something happened to us 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.129
 as what is not happening records in 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.379
 followed we stayed in proposal of 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.960
 motorcycles because we had opened an engine and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.670
 we stayed six months waiting for a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.070
 singer we ended up doing the march 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.310
 and so began to happen a lot has followed 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.710
 much more answers and have a mass and 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.720
 months after the business we are going to take it out 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.759
 something easier and more dynamic and there 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.890
 we went with the vision in 83 out with 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.470
 the good bicycle we are with the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.729
 full bicycle pointed we are in a 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.259
 new trend that the urban bicycle 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.030
 everything that is coming makes the 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.700
 people go a little bit the wiesn gives 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.650
 move to work by bike and we have a 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.140
 great move in that sector 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.240
 luckily it is in full evolution 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.460
 many bicycle recycling that 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.410
 we are recycling a lot of people now the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.650
 they call vintage and all that trend of 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.270
 the grandfather's bike and good to the 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.600
 young guys who turned to the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.620
 return bicycle are practicing 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.690
 that experience in which you are giving 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.310
 had the result because every time there is 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.620
 more people who go out with a bicycle that is 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.300
 new customers where we came from 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.830
 since they started the topic the 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.110
 bicycle paths 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.000
 we noticed that the attachment tendency as 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.470
 right away to the people who had visited 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.690
 that many people had more than one bike in 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.250
 home and for fear of going out on the street 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.310
 it happens because I have the door presents 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.750
 from home and on Sundays the boys the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.480
 people the parents who are teaching him 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.790
 permanently to roll and leave and in 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.700
 drive on the street I see it very very 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.710
 important and in the parks from 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.390
 that closed that lattice and all that 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.730
 like that 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.440
 they forbade the boys even the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.490
 centennial park that we have here many 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.250
 tracks 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.740
 you go in and say and another with your officer the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.930
 yes how can it be to go and good 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.310
 bicycle path is the place for the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.930
 people now teach the guys in 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.060
 bicycle and move around in the city that 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.840
 is full at that point like -10 at 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.890
 guys the new guys that this already 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.990
 I say 30 years 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.310
 the boy comes for a bike under pressure 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.420
 parents now coming to us 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.190
 own decision 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.959
 we see this tendency that the baby 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.120
 come to choose the bicycle 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.920
 shakira a warning and it does not cost me that no 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.780
 comes because the parents want me to 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.300
 leave the computer that comes out of 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.730
 this to take the occasion or what 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.959
 has visiten and accompaÃ±ame costs me with 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.390
 my own sheen with exit from the street 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.260
 with same services is a step and already with 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:18.330
 bigger guys and the truth that the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.330
 problematic this last one surprised us 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.530
 from the banks that started us 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.940
 to turn your face in a lot of 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.740
 orders and suppliers 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.080
 unfortunately they were also found 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.120
 with a lot of missing and replacement 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.560
 that they could not do which makes 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.410
 unfortunately good some things 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.990
 complicate a price we almost avoid 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.550
 buy it honestly are with no 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.100
 stock that we should have but we are 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.080
 is also hoping either not 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.060
 where will we dedicate the national list 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.430
 It's not long before I finish it 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.770
 people or is almost finished and 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.510
 generate what we have is an 80 per 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.800
 National percent and 20 percent 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.710
 imported that is the mechanics of the 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.840
 transmission and we hope not in this 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.250
 this year's term and the one that is coming 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.250
 appear some national transmission
