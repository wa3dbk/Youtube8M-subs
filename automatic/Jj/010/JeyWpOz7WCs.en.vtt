00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.380
 beautiful and pretty 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.690
 You're here with me again there. 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.020
 to start another module on 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.939
 philosophy this module is particularly 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.810
 a module that I really like 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.920
 Look, we'll just start talking. 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.920
 about ethics 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.010
 man when guided by ethics is the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.969
 best of animals when without it is the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.969
 worst of all 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.680
 What is ethical about the subject? 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.050
 ethics because we think so much about 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.890
 this and do not know what it is 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.260
 look that ethics fears is the one that is 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.500
 addressed by philosophers since the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.720
 antiquity is still so current and 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.229
 controversial as well as necessary and vital 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.229
 ethic 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.780
 that is the question my dear student 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.160
 Have you ever stopped to think of some? 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.590
 if you're good there over there 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.509
 Time you're riding the bus and you? 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.420
 Nothing to do, the battery is gone. 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.160
 You can not listen to music on the phone. 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.990
 The moment you think about life you become 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:34.950
 recognize me badly, I made a crap 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.390
 Do you think about it or not? I'm good for 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.090
 a religious morality 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.990
 Are you thinking about yourself but what about you? 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.789
 society 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:49.020
 men are good or they are bad or bad 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:52.229
 a man can be good and bad and where 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.460
 comes the ethics to arbitrate these two 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.640
 sides of humanity 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:03.630
 what do you think ethics is a choice 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.840
 ethics is an opt-in option for a 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.509
 behavior in this way. 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.950
 we can understand that human life is 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.410
 difference in the size of values are the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.630
 human values that will tell how 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.530
 People are going to be guided as we go. 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.010
 living in society and thinking about ethics 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.670
 it's also philosophical thinking you do 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.769
 This every day without realizing that it's 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.160
 I'll give you a die to think about. 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.640
 already thought that the word etiquette comes 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.840
 ethics is the little ethics it is as if 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.579
 to behave 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.489
 Do you know how to behave in society? 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.310
 ethics guides human conduct 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.980
 no man is an island this famous 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.860
 phrase of the English philosopher thomas more us 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.870
 help 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.110
 understand us that human life is 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.730
 living for a living is 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.970
 to live together 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.010
 Have you stopped to think about us since the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.950
 doubling your choices 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.640
 already stopped to think how to act and this 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.490
 Act 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.090
 it obeys a code of conduct 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:20.050
 what we call the code of 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.910
 ethics but ethics it is not normative 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.740
 it does not pass through laws 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.200
 it passes for a 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.200
 behavior may explain better 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.730
 every time we talk about ethics to 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.220
 people confuse with morale 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.170
 Are you going to watch this class with me and will? 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.330
 watch the next one too because the 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.450
 next I'll tell you exactly 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.280
 what the definition of moral and ethical but 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.320
 go thinking you know 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.350
 they say the same thing as I said 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.880
 which is a code of ethics 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.310
 you usually think of a code of ethics 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.170
 When are you going to talk about law and 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.750
 When are you going to talk about medicine? 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.100
 doctor has a code of ethics for 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.190
 example to you 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.709
 when I was a young girl in 1920's garment 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.580
 people today had more 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.049
 people had a way of going to the 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.530
 gynecologist 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.660
 the first time your mother goes with you 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.040
 boys follows the reasoning because it is 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.770
 important for you to see with your 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.419
 girlfriends wife wives does not shy away from this 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.479
 subject is also of you 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.460
 and we are at the gynecologist and you? 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.590
 is full of questions to ask the 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.450
 doctor but you can not because your mother 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.169
 There you do not want her to know what 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.950
 it's rolling 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.450
 and then the doctor showed that you need 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.060
 talking to him asks for solon and if 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.610
 and you ask questions that do not 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.520
 necessarily are questions that will 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.300
 injure morals and good manners and look 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.030
 then custom and morals keep this when 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.010
 a walk back to the office 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.380
 you see her asking for a doctor 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.669
 that you told him and he said that 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.940
 by the code of ethics I can not speak 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:09.580
 just like if you were a psychiatrist 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.310
 soon he could not name things 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.410
 spoken there for your family 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.590
 another place also happens a lot 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.850
 This is where the confessional is. 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.820
 that's right 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:25.240
 even in religion we have a modus 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.870
 operantis a way of ethics or morals 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.030
 You'll see better than this. 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.220
 here in this case brought definition to 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.920
 you ethics can refer to a 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.440
 set of principles and standards that a 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.170
 group establishes for its exercise 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.840
 such as code 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.660
 ethics of doctors in the lawyers of the 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.390
 psychologists of politicians etc 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.320
 but there was a question about the limit of 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.040
 ethic 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.730
 ethics has punitive power ethics has 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.650
 jurisdictional power that you only see 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.080
 from the definition of the word itself 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:06.250
 what ethics means 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.840
 let's look ahead here we have 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.670
 a code of conduct 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.910
 you know the constitution of Brazil 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.790
 Does it contemplate the highest ethical 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:20.280
 law of a nation state is your 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:24.280
 our writing in 1988 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:27.210
 governs how we should proceed in society 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.610
 and it is that in this constitution 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:33.730
 supposedly recent the presence of ethics 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.280
 between Article 1 of Article 5 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.650
 there are a number of factors that 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.780
 dealing with ethics, especially in 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.880
 objective of the Federative Republic of 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.370
 Brazil that the goal is this 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.240
 is it you to make human life in the 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.560
 Brazil is full without prejudice without 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.470
 gender distinction 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.810
 Now, how do you explain to me? 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.880
 required for work to conduct 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.790
 mainly people dealing with 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.669
 of Brazil 's ethics as you explain the 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.970
 social inequality to misery 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:10.660
 the difference of genres is the 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:12.850
 conduct is the breaking of ethics but if it is the 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.450
 so we can live in 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:18.580
 society because it did not follow 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.419
 people will see together at our next 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.880
 class 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:24.260
 the next class is about 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.390
 of moral ethics and human values 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:30.300
 especially of the conflicts that these 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.460
 Values ​​bring us to come with me. 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.900
 Let's stay here. Do not see another little girl. 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.900
 of philosophy until then
