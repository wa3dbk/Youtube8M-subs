 Hi all 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.249
 I am day 15 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.249
 in this new video I bring you a tutorial for your pc 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.659
 I imagine that several of you have heard the term defragment a 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.659
 hard drive this to give maintenance to your computers 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.810
 will help them to make their PCs faster and not give them problems in the long run 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.040
 because in this video I will teach you how to do it 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.530
 but first I would like to invite you to a channel that I highly recommend 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.050
 it's from the user 11 wrc he makes videos about the ipo tous and his 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.620
 Applications 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.140
 I invite you to watch your videos and if you like subscribe be your channel to be 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.840
 aware of your next projects 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.840
 I leave the direct link in the description of the video 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.450
 without more than saying let's start the video 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.820
 this is a very simple process 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.820
 first we open the icon of my pc 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.230
 there are our hard drives 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.160
 they select the one they want to defragment by right clicking on it 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.700
 then we give the property option 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.350
 a new window will open 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.500
 there at the top of that window look for the tab 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 tools and they click 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.060
 there we will see this option that says defragment now 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.840
 they give you click 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.230
 another window will open 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.480
 I warn you that in order to defragment a disc you must have at least 15% 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.340
 from your empty hard drive 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.720
 now they give the button to defragment 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.020
 and we just have to wait for the process to finish 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.830
 This may take several minutes 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.340
 when it finishes automatically it will leave a warning that finished defragmenting 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.340
 I know and probably ask to be reset 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:14.869
 oo your computer is already defragmented this process can be 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:18.519
 do whenever they want I recommend it at least once a month 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.779
 thanks for watching I hope you liked it 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.709

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.409
 I am day 15 goodbye
