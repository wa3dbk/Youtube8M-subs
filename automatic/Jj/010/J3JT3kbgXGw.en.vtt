on<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:03.090> connector<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.799> it's<00:01:04.799> tied

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
on this little connector and it's tied

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.560 
on this little connector and it's tied
right<00:01:05.460> into<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> connector<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.299> all<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.479> have

right into the connector so all you have

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.660 
right into the connector so all you have
to<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.869> remove<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.290> connector<00:01:07.619> pop<00:01:08.460> this

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
to do is remove the connector pop this

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.480 
to do is remove the connector pop this
off<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.200> replace<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.439> there's<00:01:10.890> no<00:01:11.100> need<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
off and replace it there's no need to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.030 
off and replace it there's no need to

we<00:01:25.770> decided<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.939> into<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.360> ars<00:01:27.720> market<00:01:28.049> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
we decided to go into the ars market a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.380 
we decided to go into the ars market a
couple<00:01:28.860> years<00:01:28.979> ago<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.939> roughly<00:01:30.180> been

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
couple years ago so it's roughly been

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.870 
couple years ago so it's roughly been
two<00:01:30.570> years<00:01:30.810> once<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.189> basic<00:01:32.729> design

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
two years once we get the basic design

two years once we get the basic design
down<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.990> know<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.229> could<00:01:34.350> typically<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
down you know we could typically get the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.580 
down you know we could typically get the
functional<00:01:36.150> requirement<00:01:36.540> document<00:01:36.900> set<00:01:37.140> the
