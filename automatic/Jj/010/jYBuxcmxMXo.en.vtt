00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.690 
detail plant it would be nice put
together<00:01:42.530> as<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:42.829> ground<00:01:43.100> cover<00:01:43.280> like<00:01:43.460> we've

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
together as a ground cover like we've

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.279 
together as a ground cover like we've
got<00:01:43.880> here<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:44.270> grows<00:01:44.539> out<00:01:44.719> when<00:01:44.899> we've<00:01:45.020> got<00:01:45.170> it

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
got here it grows out when we've got it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.789 
got here it grows out when we've got it
under<00:01:45.469> this<00:01:46.750> yellow<00:01:47.750> cedar<00:01:48.079> here<00:01:48.350> that's<00:01:48.590> been

under this yellow cedar here that's been

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.069 
under this yellow cedar here that's been
cast<00:01:49.039> so<00:01:49.700> it's<00:01:49.819> gonna<00:01:49.909> make<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.149> nice<00:01:50.360> contrast

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
cast so it's gonna make a nice contrast
