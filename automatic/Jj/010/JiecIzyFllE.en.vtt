 fast would make an orange carpaccio and 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.660
 the cinnamon and the monte a little very 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.590
 Moroccan inspiration of the holidays that for 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.210
 the holidays after the turkey with chestnuts 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.990
 call to the photographer will see it's 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.100
 Just huge 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.450
 go we left we start with what 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.680
 we will start by doing the cair 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.650
 last orange car then the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.039
 orange carpaccio we will peel raw 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.350
 oranges 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.710
 absolutely we will cut the basic 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.210
 like that and from there we go and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.980
 flora and but we are going to blow up the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.390
 white he's quite really good 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.220
 to continue all the white skin is 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.470
 very simple it takes a little training 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.470
 but it's a habit and here 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.420
 pretty slice being singing 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.160
 in the cannes tale the heart too 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.950
 which is still nature more 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.059
 rustic rustic and montaigu mans 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.190
 quite that would be a lot more of 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.410
 months leagues and pleasant in the mouth one is 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.370
 okay but still because it's 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.070
 beautiful but on the handle and the log of 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.240
 Wood was called dengue must 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.640
 try a very light 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.760
 now we get an orange and we 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.470
 will squeeze the juice we will mix our 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.450
 orange juice with a little cinnamon and 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.820
 current grapes we will put a 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.800
 small pinch of cinnamon powder 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.649
 according to his taste this is according to his you 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.270
 agrees strongly imposing heavier 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.509
 you are a very greedy kenzo I see 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.090
 not and then we'll add a little bit of 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.280
 slightly dry currants 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.360
 here is wifi we will see how it was 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.860
 do a little bit too much time 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.440
 can this match as we can leave 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.470
 macerate exactly discarded and after one 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.420
 go chiseled h and a little fresh mint 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.729
 without super good Lacanian light it's 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.060
 good it's beautiful and fresh lola dastros is 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.770

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.080

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.039
 the shots example but that we can 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.509
 taste on everything we prepare to 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.670
 the advanced one can leave to the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.540
 fridge to rename that it's 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.860
 perfume web 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.350
 the ideal is still to prepare 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.030
 yeah quite but you prepare and you 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.350
 put in a dish well filmed in the liver and 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.760
 like that the next day you're gone 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.050

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.610

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.730
 the more we can prepare the before what is 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.250
 really very interesting for the holidays 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.450
 we leave in the fridge we go out on the table is 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.489
 however something very fresh and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.120
 very light it's just very very very
