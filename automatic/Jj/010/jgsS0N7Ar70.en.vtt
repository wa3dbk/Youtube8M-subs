00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
soil around the roots and it's always a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.969 
soil around the roots and it's always a
good<00:01:32.670> idea<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.999> plant<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:33.749> fresh<00:01:34.139> soil<00:01:34.499> to

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
not so much that water would not be able

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:09.320

little plans bunched together instead of

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.630 
little plans bunched together instead of
separating<00:04:08.170> them<00:04:08.319> and<00:04:08.650> you<00:04:09.280> don't<00:04:09.370> need<00:04:09.519> to

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
separating them and you don't need to

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.250 
separating them and you don't need to
spend<00:04:09.849> a<00:04:09.970> bunch<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:10.269> money<00:04:10.450> on<00:04:10.540> a<00:04:10.750> variety<00:04:11.079> of

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
spend a bunch of money on a variety of

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.800 
spend a bunch of money on a variety of
plants<00:04:11.859> this<00:04:12.519> little<00:04:12.819> pot<00:04:13.000> from<00:04:13.209> Daiso<00:04:13.540> fits

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
plants this little pot from Daiso fits

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.170 
plants this little pot from Daiso fits
just<00:04:13.900> one<00:04:14.260> plant<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:14.859> I<00:04:14.950> think<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.430> is<00:04:15.670> just<00:04:16.060> as

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
just one plant and I think it is just as

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:35.860 
just one plant and I think it is just as
interesting<00:04:16.509> as<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.590> other<00:04:17.829> larger<00:04:18.310> pots

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.310 

and<00:04:36.830> we're<00:04:37.250> all<00:04:37.370> done<00:04:37.580> I<00:04:37.880> did<00:04:38.540> that<00:04:38.720> little<00:04:39.020> one

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
and we're all done I did that little one

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.439 
and we're all done I did that little one
at<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.620> end<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:40.190> I<00:04:40.310> definitely<00:04:41.030> made<00:04:41.240> way

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
at the end and I definitely made way

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.980 
at the end and I definitely made way
more<00:04:41.480> of<00:04:41.750> a<00:04:41.900> mess<00:04:42.110> than<00:04:42.770> Joe<00:04:43.280> did<00:04:43.550> so<00:04:43.970> if<00:04:44.330> you

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
more of a mess than Joe did so if you

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.540 
more of a mess than Joe did so if you
don't<00:04:45.290> want<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.530> deal<00:04:45.650> with<00:04:45.710> dirt<00:04:45.949> at<00:04:46.100> all<00:04:46.250> you

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
don't want to deal with dirt at all you

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.820 
don't want to deal with dirt at all you
should<00:04:46.580> look<00:04:46.910> into<00:04:47.210> two<00:04:47.660> Lancias<00:04:48.199> or<00:04:48.500> air

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
should look into two Lancias or air

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.100 
should look into two Lancias or air
plants<00:04:49.310> you<00:04:50.000> can<00:04:50.120> find<00:04:50.389> these<00:04:50.570> plants<00:04:50.960> in
