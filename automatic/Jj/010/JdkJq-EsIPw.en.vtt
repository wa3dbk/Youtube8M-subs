you have two more tabs up to the top of
your<00:01:57.329> settings<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:58.829> regular<00:01:59.219> settings

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
your settings the regular settings

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.940 
your settings the regular settings
pretty<00:01:59.880> much<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.149> same<00:02:00.360> as<00:02:00.570> always<00:02:00.829> but<00:02:01.829> if

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
pretty much the same as always but if

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.859 
pretty much the same as always but if
you<00:02:02.040> head<00:02:02.189> over<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.549> system<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.570> change<00:02:03.780> a

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
you head over to system you can change a

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.050 
you head over to system you can change a
few<00:02:04.020> things<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.530> input<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.909> input

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
few things here like input the input

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.150 
few things here like input the input
buttons<00:02:06.689> I'm<00:02:07.290> not<00:02:07.439> going<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.680> get<00:02:07.799> into<00:02:07.920> that

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
buttons I'm not going to get into that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.479 
buttons I'm not going to get into that
because<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.110> go<00:02:10.259> into<00:02:10.410> performance<00:02:11.250> and

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
because you can go into performance and

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.550 
because you can go into performance and
this<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.730> how<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.910> overclock<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.959> can<00:02:13.200> change
