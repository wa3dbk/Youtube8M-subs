really hard about what are the

really hard about what are the
essentials<00:00:31.350> like<00:00:31.590> what<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.010> traveler<00:00:32.550> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and we knew we needed a great developer

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.060 
and we knew we needed a great developer

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
team of iPhone app development we wanted

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.350 
team of iPhone app development we wanted
to<00:00:49.650> just<00:00:49.710> remove<00:00:50.100> ourselves<00:00:50.250> from<00:00:50.580> the

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.950 
distractions of the day-to-day office
and<00:00:53.040> we<00:00:54.000> put<00:00:54.239> ourselves<00:00:54.330> in<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.780> called

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and we put ourselves in what we called

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.200 
and we put ourselves in what we called
the<00:00:55.019> iPhone<00:00:55.170> bunker<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.000> there's<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.089> this

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the iPhone bunker and there's in this

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.750 
the iPhone bunker and there's in this
room<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.870> work<00:00:58.589> on<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:58.860> app<00:00:59.040> for<00:00:59.430> about

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
room that we work on the app for about

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.610 
room that we work on the app for about
four<00:01:00.120> weeks<00:01:00.330> straight<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.019> everybody<00:01:01.470> had<00:01:01.589> to

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
four weeks straight and everybody had to

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.170 
four weeks straight and everybody had to
put<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.949> army<00:01:02.220> clothing<00:01:02.549> before<00:01:02.729> they<00:01:02.970> enter

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
put on army clothing before they enter

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.360 
put on army clothing before they enter
everything<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:04.019> had<00:01:04.140> essentially<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.129> huge

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
everything we had essentially this huge

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.250 
everything we had essentially this huge
wall<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.640> iPhone<00:01:06.180> screenshots<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.140> would

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
wall of iPhone screenshots we would

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.539 
wall of iPhone screenshots we would
print<00:01:07.409> off<00:01:07.530> every<00:01:07.770> screen<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> app<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.460> you

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
print off every screen in the app so you

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.920 
print off every screen in the app so you
can<00:01:08.610> see<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> progress<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.450> think<00:01:09.479> what<00:01:09.810> was

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
can see the progress I think what was

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.390 
can see the progress I think what was
really<00:01:09.960> great<00:01:10.320> about<00:01:10.440> our<00:01:10.680> process<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.250> that

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
really great about our process is that

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850 
really great about our process is that
Andrew<00:01:12.000> would<00:01:12.150> build<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.690> then<00:01:13.260> we'd<00:01:13.409> go<00:01:13.530> test

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
Andrew would build and then we'd go test

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.080 
Andrew would build and then we'd go test
and<00:01:14.190> because<00:01:14.970> Apple<00:01:15.420> makes<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.960> easy<00:01:15.990> to

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
and because Apple makes it so easy to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.180 
and because Apple makes it so easy to
iterate<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> iPhone<00:01:18.780> app<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.710> were<00:01:19.860> able

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
iterate on the iPhone app we were able

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.810 
iterate on the iPhone app we were able
to<00:01:20.370> make<00:01:20.460> iterations<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.120> the<00:01:21.210> fly<00:01:22.730> there<00:01:23.730> was

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
to make iterations on the fly there was

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.940 
to make iterations on the fly there was
this<00:01:23.910> back-and-forth<00:01:24.150> process<00:01:24.960> very<00:01:25.890> much

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
this back-and-forth process very much

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.830 
this back-and-forth process very much
like<00:01:26.250> industrial<00:01:26.610> design<00:01:27.090> when<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.600> design

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
like industrial design when you design

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.690 
like industrial design when you design
your<00:01:27.870> product<00:01:28.280> we<00:01:29.280> use<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.490> same

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
your product we use the same

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.400 
your product we use the same
methodologies<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.690> same<00:01:30.900> process

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
methodologies in the same process

methodologies in the same process
develop<00:01:32.370> an<00:01:32.460> iPhone<00:01:32.760> app

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869

right when the user first comes to the

right when the user first comes to the

there's any content that they've put on
it<00:01:43.190> was<00:01:43.640> it<00:01:43.790> you<00:01:43.909> look<00:01:44.090> like<00:01:44.119> we<00:01:44.869> wanted<00:01:45.140> to

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
it was it you look like we wanted to

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.230 
it was it you look like we wanted to
stick<00:01:45.500> with<00:01:45.710> kind<00:01:46.310> of<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.460> like<00:01:46.700> user<00:01:46.880> interface

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
stick with kind of a like user interface

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.850 
stick with kind of a like user interface
idioms<00:01:47.659> that<00:01:47.930> Apple<00:01:48.170> had<00:01:48.290> laid<00:01:48.470> out<00:01:48.500> but<00:01:48.770> we

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
idioms that Apple had laid out but we

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.749 
idioms that Apple had laid out but we
wanted<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.130> really<00:01:49.399> make<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.729> special

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
wanted to really make it a special

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.160 
wanted to really make it a special
experience<00:01:50.360> really<00:01:50.750> make<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:50.899> feel<00:01:51.140> like

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
experience really make it feel like
