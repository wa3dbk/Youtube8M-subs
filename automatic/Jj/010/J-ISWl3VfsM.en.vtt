 Christian 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.480
 son, I want to tell you about the time we defeated the bayern 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.559
 monk in centimeters you had to be really strong to beat the premier 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:46.550
 to the Pope 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.350
 the strongest in the world - 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.260
 who knows how many trophies and you will have won with that team 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.380
 both in Italy and in Europe 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.960
 real dad 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.690
 really only two Italian cups and an Italian super cup 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.240
 it was all the fault of the palate at that time there was a conspiracy against Rome 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.900
 they bothered 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.470
 never said it was a plot or when they did you do the spot 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.430
 vodafone with peppers 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.430
 ok, tell me about the game 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.710
 you can therefore the bayern came from a strip of 15 consecutive victories in 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.580
 championship but in centimos still had failed to qualify for occurred 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.170
 rome with the best training all its champions were in the field 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.720
 so small was he doing that he remembers that they played with the reserves 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.200

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.540

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.390
 I really was on the bench ok but you immediately entered no 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.890
 you were too important for the team 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.400
 the coach knew he couldn't leave you too long in Thailand 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.960
 I certainly entered the last 15 minutes 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.550
 more recovery 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.860
 however, the great Pope marked the goal of the final 32 of the triumph of Rome 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.629
 I knew who you were the strongest 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.440

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:27.759
 Pope 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.759
