automotive aftermarket division today
we're<00:00:26.160> here<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.369> talk<00:00:26.519> about<00:00:26.580> some<00:00:27.029> issues

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
we're here to talk about some issues

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.660 
we're here to talk about some issues
with<00:00:27.449> automotive<00:00:27.779> foams<00:00:28.199> as<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.250> know<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
with automotive foams as we know the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.460 
with automotive foams as we know the
cars<00:00:29.880> are<00:00:30.150> being<00:00:30.390> made<00:00:30.570> by<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> manufacturers

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
cars are being made by the manufacturers

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.250 
cars are being made by the manufacturers
lighter<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.040> thus<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.210> need<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.450> sound

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
lighter and thus the need for sound

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.170 
lighter and thus the need for sound
deadening<00:00:34.710> foams<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.550> vehicles<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
deadening foams in the vehicles is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.119 
deadening foams in the vehicles is
becoming<00:00:36.600> greater<00:00:36.870> we're<00:00:37.530> gonna<00:00:37.620> see<00:00:37.829> entire

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
becoming greater we're gonna see entire

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.459 
becoming greater we're gonna see entire
cavities<00:00:38.730> filled<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.540> foams<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.320> newer

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
cavities filled with foams on the newer

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.680 
cavities filled with foams on the newer
vehicles<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.730> there's<00:00:42.090> some<00:00:42.239> things<00:00:42.270> we<00:00:42.510> need

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
vehicles so there's some things we need

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.270 
vehicles so there's some things we need
to<00:00:42.780> understand<00:00:43.200> about<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.559> foams<00:00:43.800> there<00:00:44.219> are

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
to understand about the foams there are

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.400 
to understand about the foams there are
several<00:00:44.550> different<00:00:44.879> types<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.329> foams<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.289> we

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
several different types of foams so we

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.930 
several different types of foams so we
need<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.649> understand<00:00:47.160> what<00:00:47.370> they<00:00:47.520> are<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
need to understand what they are and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.240 
need to understand what they are and
basically<00:00:48.360> there<00:00:48.840> are<00:00:48.870> four<00:00:48.960> different<00:00:49.500> types

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
basically there are four different types

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.180 
basically there are four different types
of<00:00:50.460> foams<00:00:50.700> there's<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> structural<00:00:52.530> foam<00:00:52.710> which

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
of foams there's a structural foam which

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.880 
of foams there's a structural foam which
is<00:00:53.370> rarely<00:00:53.730> used<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.239> vehicles<00:00:54.750> today<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.260> don't

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
is rarely used on vehicles today I don't

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.500 
is rarely used on vehicles today I don't
have<00:00:56.070> any<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.460> structural<00:00:56.879> foam<00:00:57.059> pictured

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
have any of the structural foam pictured

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.830 
have any of the structural foam pictured
here<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.920> solid<00:00:59.640> epoxy<00:01:00.000> type<00:01:00.480> looking

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
here but it's a solid epoxy type looking

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.080 
here but it's a solid epoxy type looking
foam<00:01:01.079> with<00:01:01.289> no<00:01:01.469> visible<00:01:01.949> cell<00:01:02.219> structure<00:01:02.730> but

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
foam with no visible cell structure but

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.000 
foam with no visible cell structure but
again<00:01:03.359> you're<00:01:03.570> very<00:01:04.049> unlikely<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.680> encounter

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
again you're very unlikely to encounter

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.530 
again you're very unlikely to encounter
that<00:01:05.159> type<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.549> full<00:01:05.850> amount<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.210> vehicle

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
that type of full amount of vehicle

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.570 
that type of full amount of vehicle
today<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.380> foams<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.950> will<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.369> are<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
today the foams that you will see are a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.060 
today the foams that you will see are a
soft<00:01:08.970> foam<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.810> flexible<00:01:10.439> foam<00:01:10.650> such<00:01:10.920> as

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
soft foam or a flexible foam such as

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.160 
soft foam or a flexible foam such as
this<00:01:11.189> here<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.630> identified<00:01:12.990> by

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
this here and this can be identified by

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.840 
this here and this can be identified by
being<00:01:13.710> able<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.920> push<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.310> your<00:01:14.520> finger

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
being able to push it with your finger

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.660 
being able to push it with your finger
and<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.150> rebounds<00:01:15.630> back<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> pillar

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and it rebounds back this is a pillar

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.510 
and it rebounds back this is a pillar
foam<00:01:18.030> some<00:01:18.689> people<00:01:19.049> call<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.560> rigid<00:01:20.310> foam

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
foam some people call it a rigid foam

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.719 
foam some people call it a rigid foam
and<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.540> push<00:01:22.200> your<00:01:22.380> finger<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.830> will

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
and this if you push your finger in will

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.789 
and this if you push your finger in will
collapse<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.360> will<00:01:24.479> not<00:01:24.659> rebound<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.619> that's

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
collapse and will not rebound so that's

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.289 
collapse and will not rebound so that's
how<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.189> tell<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.549> type<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.790> foam<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.240> is

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
how we can tell what type of foam it is

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.330 
how we can tell what type of foam it is
it's<00:01:27.780> very<00:01:27.990> important<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.650> replace<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it's very important that we replace the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.969 
it's very important that we replace the
foam<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.820> remove<00:01:30.509> from<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.840> vehicle

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
foam that we remove from the vehicle

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.490 
foam that we remove from the vehicle
with<00:01:31.979> an<00:01:32.460> identical<00:01:32.970> type<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.509> foam<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:34.049> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
with an identical type of foam if you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.069 
with an identical type of foam if you
put<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.340> instance<00:01:35.369> rigid<00:01:36.360> foam<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.840> where<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
put for instance rigid foam in where a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.260 
put for instance rigid foam in where a
soft<00:01:37.500> foam<00:01:37.799> was<00:01:38.009> supposed<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.400> be<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:39.090> would

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
soft foam was supposed to be it would

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.289 
soft foam was supposed to be it would
actually<00:01:39.420> amplify<00:01:40.110> noise<00:01:40.380> rather<00:01:40.799> than<00:01:41.299> quiet

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
actually amplify noise rather than quiet

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.120 
actually amplify noise rather than quiet
the<00:01:42.479> vehicle<00:01:42.840> down<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.920> make<00:01:44.100> sure

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the vehicle down so we have to make sure

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.980 
the vehicle down so we have to make sure
we're<00:01:44.460> using<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.820> correct<00:01:45.060> foam<00:01:45.329> another

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
we're using the correct foam another

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.889 
we're using the correct foam another
very<00:01:46.320> underutilized<00:01:46.950> foam<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.790> an<00:01:48.149> NVH<00:01:48.570> foam

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
very underutilized foam is an NVH foam

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.870 
very underutilized foam is an NVH foam
and<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.920> little<00:01:50.310> bit<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> misnomer

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
and it's a little bit of a misnomer

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.730 
and it's a little bit of a misnomer
because<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.600> foam<00:01:51.780> really<00:01:52.049> doesn't<00:01:52.320> foam<00:01:52.530> up

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
because this foam really doesn't foam up

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.679 
because this foam really doesn't foam up
there's<00:01:52.979> no<00:01:53.130> visible<00:01:53.549> cell<00:01:53.790> structure<00:01:54.270> it

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
there's no visible cell structure it

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.719 
there's no visible cell structure it
looks<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> windshield<00:01:55.500> urethane<00:01:56.159> but

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
looks like a windshield urethane but

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.310 
looks like a windshield urethane but
it's<00:01:56.850> very<00:01:57.000> useful<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.659> fact<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.170> can

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
it's very useful in the fact that we can

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.740 
it's very useful in the fact that we can
use<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.770> reattach<00:01:59.040> existing<00:01:59.850> foam<00:02:00.060> so

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
use that to reattach existing foam so

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.630 
use that to reattach existing foam so
there<00:02:01.079> may<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.380> case<00:02:01.590> where<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.219> foam

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
there may be a case where you have foam

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.010 
there may be a case where you have foam
in<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.880> vehicle<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.420> apart<00:02:03.719> you're<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
in the vehicle and apart you're going to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.899 
in the vehicle and apart you're going to
reuse<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.979> don't<00:02:05.130> necessarily<00:02:05.280> need<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
reuse you don't necessarily need to

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.910 
reuse you don't necessarily need to
remove<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.450> all<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.079> actually<00:02:07.380> coat<00:02:07.740> it

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
remove it all you can actually coat it

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.050 
remove it all you can actually coat it
with<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.369> NVH<00:02:09.030> foam<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:10.550> replace<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.819> in<00:02:11.940> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
with this NVH foam and replace it in the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.160 
with this NVH foam and replace it in the
vehicle

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
vehicle

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.320 
vehicle
so<00:02:13.860> those<00:02:14.069> are<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.280> main<00:02:14.670> types<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.150> foams

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
so those are the main types of foams

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.640 
so those are the main types of foams
we're<00:02:15.510> going<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.690> encounter<00:02:15.930> now<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.470> other

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
we're going to encounter now the other

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.840 
we're going to encounter now the other
thing<00:02:16.860> that's<00:02:17.010> very<00:02:17.069> important<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.730> we

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
thing that's very important is that we

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.900 
thing that's very important is that we
understand<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.830> properties<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.400> each<00:02:20.670> type

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
understand the properties of each type

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.730 
understand the properties of each type
of<00:02:21.060> foam<00:02:21.240> now<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:22.020> really<00:02:22.260> important<00:02:22.709> that

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
of foam now it's really important that

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.170 
of foam now it's really important that
we<00:02:22.920> read<00:02:23.160> these<00:02:23.340> instructions<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:24.030> come

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
we read these instructions that come

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.280 
we read these instructions that come
with<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.450> phone<00:02:24.630> there's<00:02:24.840> gonna<00:02:24.959> be<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> lot<00:02:25.260> of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
with the phone there's gonna be a lot of

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.140 
with the phone there's gonna be a lot of
good<00:02:25.470> information<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:26.130> here<00:02:26.160> one<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
good information in here one of the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.640 
good information in here one of the
things<00:02:27.330> we<00:02:27.480> need<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.720> know<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:27.990> how<00:02:28.140> much<00:02:28.290> dwell

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
things we need to know is how much dwell

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.430 
things we need to know is how much dwell
time<00:02:28.950> we<00:02:29.160> have<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.610> dwell<00:02:30.270> time<00:02:30.570> is<00:02:30.870> how<00:02:31.200> long

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
time we have and dwell time is how long

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.260 
time we have and dwell time is how long
it<00:02:31.590> takes<00:02:31.800> for<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.190> foam<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.700> actually<00:02:33.060> start

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
it takes for the foam to actually start

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.750 
it takes for the foam to actually start
reacting<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.959> foam<00:02:34.170> out<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.740> nozzle<00:02:34.920> it's

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
reacting and foam out of the nozzle it's

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.250 
reacting and foam out of the nozzle it's
very<00:02:35.940> important<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.450> we<00:02:36.540> know<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.930> if<00:02:37.140> we

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
very important that we know that if we

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.560 
very important that we know that if we
if<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:37.920> don't<00:02:38.190> know<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.910> we<00:02:39.180> take<00:02:39.390> too

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
if we don't know that and we take too

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.910 
if we don't know that and we take too
long<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.900> may<00:02:39.989> actually<00:02:40.290> harden<00:02:40.500> before<00:02:40.830> we

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
long it may actually harden before we

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.590 
long it may actually harden before we
get<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.160> out<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.430> nozzle<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.060> dwell<00:02:42.360> time

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
get it out of the nozzle so dwell time

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.720 
get it out of the nozzle so dwell time
is<00:02:42.750> very<00:02:42.959> important<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:44.040> other<00:02:44.190> important

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
is very important the other important

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.090 
is very important the other important
factor<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.239> foam<00:02:45.600> time<00:02:45.930> for<00:02:46.650> instance<00:02:46.980> this

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
factor is foam time for instance this

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.340 
factor is foam time for instance this
product<00:02:47.520> here<00:02:47.700> has<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> five-minute<00:02:48.810> foam<00:02:49.050> time

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
product here has a five-minute foam time

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.100 
product here has a five-minute foam time
so<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.070> will<00:02:50.190> actually<00:02:50.610> not<00:02:51.209> react<00:02:51.660> for<00:02:51.930> five

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
so it will actually not react for five

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.660 
so it will actually not react for five
minutes<00:02:52.530> which<00:02:52.680> will<00:02:52.860> allow<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.340> get<00:02:53.550> us

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
minutes which will allow it to get us

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.180 
minutes which will allow it to get us
into<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:53.970> remote<00:02:54.360> cavity<00:02:54.930> possibly<00:02:55.470> down<00:02:55.980> in

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
into a remote cavity possibly down in

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.650 
into a remote cavity possibly down in
the<00:02:56.250> bottom<00:02:56.519> of<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.700> b-pillar<00:02:57.090> or<00:02:57.330> down<00:02:57.450> in<00:02:57.630> the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
the bottom of a b-pillar or down in the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.630 
the bottom of a b-pillar or down in the
bottom<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.110> rocker<00:02:58.320> pillar<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.130> we<00:02:59.250> need<00:02:59.459> to

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
bottom of a rocker pillar so we need to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.100 
bottom of a rocker pillar so we need to
choose<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.910> foam<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.300> has<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.900> correct

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
choose the foam that has the correct

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.170 
choose the foam that has the correct
properties<00:03:01.709> for<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.430> application<00:03:03.030> we're

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
properties for the application we're

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.060 
properties for the application we're
using<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:04.500> other<00:03:04.620> thing<00:03:04.830> that's<00:03:04.980> very

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
using the other thing that's very

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.400 
using the other thing that's very
important<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.820> preparing<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.959> cartridge

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
important is preparing the cartridge

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.560 
important is preparing the cartridge
once<00:03:07.920> we<00:03:08.100> have<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.310> form<00:03:08.610> selected<00:03:09.120> we<00:03:09.239> have<00:03:09.390> to

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
once we have a form selected we have to

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.540 
once we have a form selected we have to
know<00:03:09.660> how<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.870> prepare<00:03:10.110> that<00:03:10.440> cartridge<00:03:10.800> to

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
know how to prepare that cartridge to

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.400 
know how to prepare that cartridge to
properly<00:03:11.970> use<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.019> we<00:03:13.110> don't<00:03:13.200> have

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
properly use it so that we don't have

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.320 
properly use it so that we don't have
any<00:03:13.530> air<00:03:13.650> pockets<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:14.489> have<00:03:14.670> complete

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
any air pockets and we have complete

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.539 
any air pockets and we have complete
reaction<00:03:15.540> with<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.080> chemicals<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.250> one<00:03:17.519> of

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
reaction with the chemicals so one of

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.830 
reaction with the chemicals so one of
the<00:03:17.670> things<00:03:17.820> we<00:03:17.940> want<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.180> do<00:03:18.269> first<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.600> all<00:03:18.690> we

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
the things we want to do first of all we

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.210 
the things we want to do first of all we

we'd<00:03:27.540> want<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.840> wear<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.019> respirator<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:29.250> what

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
we'd want to wear a respirator so what

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.210 
we'd want to wear a respirator so what
we<00:03:29.519> want<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.790> do<00:03:30.110> is<00:03:31.110> equalize<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:31.829> cartridge

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
we want to do is equalize this cartridge

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.440 
we want to do is equalize this cartridge
we<00:03:32.400> want<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.610> make<00:03:32.730> sure<00:03:32.880> there's<00:03:33.120> no<00:03:33.269> air

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
we want to make sure there's no air

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.050 
we want to make sure there's no air
pockets<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:34.140> either<00:03:35.070> side<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.610> cartridge

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
pockets in either side of this cartridge

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.660 
pockets in either side of this cartridge
so<00:03:36.299> this<00:03:36.480> is<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.660> two<00:03:37.140> chemical<00:03:37.620> product<00:03:38.130> side<00:03:38.640> a

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
so this is a two chemical product side a

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.819 
so this is a two chemical product side a
and<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.090> side<00:03:39.329> B<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:40.170> have<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.470> make<00:03:40.650> sure

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
and a side B and we have to make sure

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.560 
and a side B and we have to make sure
that<00:03:41.010> we're<00:03:41.160> getting<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.430> proper<00:03:41.850> mixture<00:03:42.180> if

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
that we're getting the proper mixture if

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.539 
that we're getting the proper mixture if
there's<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.440> restriction<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.250> one<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.459> the

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
there's a restriction in one of the

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.120 
there's a restriction in one of the
ports<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:45.900> would<00:03:46.079> clog<00:03:46.320> one<00:03:46.560> side<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.070> it

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
ports it would clog one side and it

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.860 
ports it would clog one side and it
would<00:03:47.220> not<00:03:47.400> react<00:03:47.790> properly<00:03:48.329> so<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.660> would<00:03:48.750> go

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
would not react properly so it would go

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.180 
would not react properly so it would go
down<00:03:48.989> in<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.290> bottom<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.709> cavity<00:03:50.040> and

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
down in the bottom of a cavity and

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.039 
down in the bottom of a cavity and
remain<00:03:50.489> liquid<00:03:50.730> which<00:03:51.060> is<00:03:51.209> certainly<00:03:51.780> what<00:03:51.930> we

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
remain liquid which is certainly what we

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.370 
remain liquid which is certainly what we
don't<00:03:52.170> want<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:53.310> it's<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.549> good<00:03:53.700> idea<00:03:54.000> to

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
don't want so it's a good idea to

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.960 
don't want so it's a good idea to
install<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.650> cartridge<00:03:56.040> remove<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.549> nozzle

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
install the cartridge remove the nozzle

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.130 
install the cartridge remove the nozzle
and<00:03:57.739> then<00:03:58.739> equalize<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.459> cartridge<00:04:00.140> upwards

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
and then equalize the cartridge upwards

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.319 
and then equalize the cartridge upwards
this<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:01.920> just<00:04:02.190> like<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.519> doctor<00:04:02.940> would<00:04:03.060> do<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.269> a

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
this is just like a doctor would do in a

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.509 
this is just like a doctor would do in a
doctor's<00:04:03.690> office<00:04:04.049> with<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.230> syringe<00:04:04.590> where<00:04:05.430> it

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
doctor's office with a syringe where it

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.420 
doctor's office with a syringe where it
brings<00:04:05.760> any<00:04:05.970> air<00:04:06.180> pocket<00:04:06.720> up<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.190> surface

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
brings any air pocket up to the surface

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.349 
brings any air pocket up to the surface
and<00:04:08.850> out<00:04:09.390> of<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.660> product<00:04:10.730> so<00:04:11.730> now<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:11.880> know<00:04:12.060> how

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
I have product coming out of both sides

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.800 
I have product coming out of both sides
I<00:04:14.340> know<00:04:14.459> there's<00:04:14.760> no<00:04:14.880> air<00:04:15.090> in<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.269> product<00:04:15.660> now

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810
