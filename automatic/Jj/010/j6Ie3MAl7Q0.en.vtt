00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:08.549
 friends we are going to do a giant boxing 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:15.240
 This toy I bought it is 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:17.100
 an rs evo v 3 is a play city that nothing 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.660
 more is a whole car structure for 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:26.640
 Timon're steering wheel and shift and stuff 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.160
 All for the race game for whoever 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 Who knows the blog knows I've done it? 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.540
 The critter loves me and I'm working 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.930
 in this other project to set up a 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.730
 zinho simulator for me for a while longer 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.610
 I'm buying everything, everything's ready 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.370
 The city was lacking sunshine. 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.160
 so if I could ride this all over 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.620
 You'll probably see it works. 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.539
 the tic came right here to help me 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.949
 and I'm going to skip this here because I know 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.129
 It's going to be very annoying, I'll show you the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.570
 steps for you its beauty 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.699
 After 72 hours I got it. 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.259
 finally it 's all in the box and now I'm going 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.880
 take everything to corporation time in 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.659
 mount the structure here until the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.729
 corporation 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.869
 I already set up the structure of a hassle 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.689
 mount bolt tighten everything now 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.509
 Only the bank is missing and I'm going to pack it later. 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.030
 all this mess here one to the monitors 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.619
 to set up a computer and test it is a 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.869
 game after 11 years I finally 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.470
 I was able to set up the bank. 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.420
 funny hitch i hope 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.799
 It has all worked out that I'm a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.320
 screw and now I'm going to ride the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.869
 joking all over here and we'll see how it is 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.570
 that is 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.659
 after the extreme makeover on my desk 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.610

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.149

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.079
 bank you want is a subwoofer and 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:31.799
 silencer that helps make the chair 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:35.640
 shaking is not a mocha system but he 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:41.639
 and gives you a lot more fun 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:43.019

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:46.829

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.299

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.180
 and then the simulator will be 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.650
 exclusive with this will be a computer 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.680

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.420
 Just a little place and then I do not need to stay. 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.420

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.120
 I think these people then if I do not 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.269
