00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
very weak especially from distance I

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.360

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
didn't actually find however he did

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.250 
didn't actually find however he did
rattle<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> bar<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> few<00:00:57.360> times<00:00:57.629> never<00:00:57.930> really

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
rattle the bar a few times never really

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.660

texted<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> goalkeeper<00:00:59.160> though<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.460> shots

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
texted the goalkeeper though the shots

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760 
texted the goalkeeper though the shots
because<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.239> said<00:01:00.510> they<00:01:00.870> went<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.320> powerful

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
because I said they went very powerful

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.650 
because I said they went very powerful
so<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> keepers<00:01:02.309> did<00:01:02.489> find<00:01:02.730> them<00:01:02.910> easy<00:01:03.329> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
so the keepers did find them easy to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.630 
so the keepers did find them easy to
save<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> am<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> ball<00:01:05.129> he's<00:01:05.369> actually

was effective but as you can see guys
one<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.990> best<00:01:40.140> things<00:01:40.229> about<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.650> guy

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
one of the best things about this guy

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.020 
one of the best things about this guy
was<00:01:40.950> actually<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.310> crossing<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.820> didn't

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
was actually is crossing I didn't

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.520 
was actually is crossing I didn't
actually<00:01:42.090> find<00:01:42.329> his<00:01:42.509> shooting<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.290> much

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
actually find his shooting to be much

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.740 
actually find his shooting to be much
better<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.890> crossing<00:01:44.250> which<00:01:44.399> his<00:01:45.240> cats<00:01:45.509> that

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
better is crossing which his cats that

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.170 
better is crossing which his cats that
say<00:01:45.930> otherwise<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.530> right<00:01:47.040> footed<00:01:47.430> wise<00:01:47.610> he's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
say otherwise but right footed wise he's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.780 
say otherwise but right footed wise he's
crossing<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.840> actually<00:01:49.380> decent<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.950> sit<00:01:50.220> and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
crossing is actually decent to sit and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.219 
crossing is actually decent to sit and
he<00:01:51.030> hasn't<00:01:51.270> got<00:01:51.390> great<00:01:51.570> week<00:01:51.750> foot<00:01:52.049> would<00:01:52.200> be

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
he hasn't got great week foot would be

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
he hasn't got great week foot would be
alike<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:53.009> honest<00:01:53.280> shooting-wise<00:01:54.060> it's

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
alike to be honest shooting-wise it's

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.179 
alike to be honest shooting-wise it's
not<00:01:54.659> great<00:01:54.960> nine<00:01:55.229> times<00:01:55.439> out<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.619> ten<00:01:55.740> you're

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
not great nine times out of ten you're

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.350 
not great nine times out of ten you're
probably<00:01:56.430> going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> skip<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> shot<00:01:57.210> but

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
probably going to skip the shot but

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.120 
probably going to skip the shot but
crossing<00:01:57.630> lies<00:01:57.930> as<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.229> said<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.799> his<00:01:58.950> right

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
crossing lies as I said with his right

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.499 
crossing lies as I said with his right
foot<00:01:59.159> wasn't<00:02:00.000> too<00:02:00.119> bad<00:02:00.360> especially

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
foot wasn't too bad especially

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.420 
foot wasn't too bad especially
considering<00:02:01.229> he<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> right<00:02:01.770> side<00:02:01.979> so

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
considering he is on the right side so

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.649 
considering he is on the right side so
that<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.700> where<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:02.969> gonna<00:02:03.030> get<00:02:03.210> moved<00:02:03.450> more

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
that is where it's gonna get moved more

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.440 
that is where it's gonna get moved more
fair<00:02:04.200> enough<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.799> game<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.280> could<00:02:05.520> use<00:02:06.299> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
fair enough in game you could use the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.180 
fair enough in game you could use the
tactic<00:02:06.750> which<00:02:06.960> swaps<00:02:07.170> wings<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:07.890> I'm<00:02:08.009> just

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
tactic which swaps wings but I'm just

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.710 
tactic which swaps wings but I'm just
this<00:02:08.580> review<00:02:08.910> I'm<00:02:09.060> keeping<00:02:09.390> him<00:02:09.479> out<00:02:09.539> right

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
this review I'm keeping him out right

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.910 
this review I'm keeping him out right
wing<00:02:09.899> because<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.530> position

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
wing because that is this position

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.740 
wing because that is this position
obviously<00:02:11.520> some<00:02:11.700> people<00:02:11.849> are<00:02:12.239> not<00:02:12.480> going<00:02:12.599> to
