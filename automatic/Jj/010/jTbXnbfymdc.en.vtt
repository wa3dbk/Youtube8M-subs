00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
where I that digital pianos would really

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.140 
where I that digital pianos would really
be<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.240> true<00:02:19.680> artistic<00:02:20.680> instrument<00:02:21.610> well<00:02:22.000> that

and this program piano tech which is

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.110 
and this program piano tech which is
different<00:02:43.840> from<00:02:43.930> almost<00:02:44.170> any<00:02:44.530> other<00:02:45.120> digital

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
different from other sample libraries

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.130 
different from other sample libraries
which<00:02:52.600> seek<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.519> recreate<00:02:54.600> high-end<00:02:55.600> pianos

of<00:02:56.470> Steinway<00:02:56.860> servers<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:57.730> offers<00:02:58.530> this

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530

of Steinway servers and offers this
program<00:02:59.590> I<00:03:00.310> think<00:03:00.820> represents<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.510> future<00:03:01.840> of

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
program I think represents the future of

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.160 
program I think represents the future of
digital<00:03:03.340> instruments<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.630> think<00:03:04.989> really

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
digital instruments and I think really

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.830 
digital instruments and I think really
the<00:03:05.350> first<00:03:05.620> true<00:03:06.400> opportunity<00:03:06.730> for<00:03:07.330> classical

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
the first true opportunity for classical

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.920 
the first true opportunity for classical
musicians<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.709> take<00:03:08.980> these<00:03:09.190> instruments

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
musicians to take these instruments

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.720 
musicians to take these instruments
seriously<00:03:10.930> as<00:03:11.080> an<00:03:11.320> artistic<00:03:11.620> tool<00:03:12.130> for

note on a digital piano what it's doing

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.229 
note on a digital piano what it's doing
is<00:03:28.390> playing<00:03:29.350> back<00:03:29.799> or<00:03:30.459> triggering<00:03:31.060> a

recording of an actual acoustic piano
that<00:03:34.870> was<00:03:34.989> recorded<00:03:35.380> by<00:03:35.920> striking<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.610> key<00:03:36.880> at

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
that was recorded by striking the key at

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.720 
that was recorded by striking the key at
different<00:03:37.780> velocities<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:39.250> when<00:03:39.430> you<00:03:39.519> play

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
different velocities so when you play

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.569 
different velocities so when you play
the<00:03:39.880> keys<00:03:40.120> slowly<00:03:40.570> on<00:03:40.959> digital<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:42.400> will

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
the keys slowly on digital you will

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.539 
the keys slowly on digital you will
trigger<00:03:42.820> a<00:03:43.090> softer<00:03:43.840> recording<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.980> faster

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
trigger a softer recording the faster

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.789 
trigger a softer recording the faster
trigger<00:03:45.910> or<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.420> faster<00:03:46.900> keystroke<00:03:47.440> will

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
trigger or the faster keystroke will

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.820 
trigger or the faster keystroke will
trigger<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.430> louder<00:03:48.790> recording<00:03:49.480> okay<00:03:50.110> now

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
trigger a louder recording okay now

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.260 
trigger a louder recording okay now
typically<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.640> then<00:03:51.730> this<00:03:51.819> is<00:03:51.940> something<00:03:52.090> I

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
typically and then this is something I

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.670 
typically and then this is something I
didn't<00:03:52.510> realize<00:03:52.870> until<00:03:53.050> I<00:03:53.260> started

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
didn't realize until I started

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.890 
didn't realize until I started
researching<00:03:54.160> digital

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
researching digital

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.840

typically<00:03:56.900> a<00:03:57.290> digital<00:03:58.100> piano<00:03:58.280> will<00:03:58.670> have

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
typically a digital piano will have

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.930 
typically a digital piano will have
sampled<00:03:59.420> between<00:03:59.930> eight<00:04:00.770> maybe<00:04:01.550> ten

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
sampled between eight maybe ten

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.040 
sampled between eight maybe ten
different<00:04:02.900> velocities<00:04:03.620> of<00:04:03.950> key<00:04:04.520> strikes<00:04:05.050> for

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
different velocities of key strikes for

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.920 
different velocities of key strikes for
each<00:04:06.230> note<00:04:06.500> well<00:04:07.160> eight<00:04:07.820> to<00:04:08.060> ten<00:04:08.330> key<00:04:08.660> strikes

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
each note well eight to ten key strikes

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.630 
each note well eight to ten key strikes
doesn't<00:04:09.350> give<00:04:09.500> you<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.650> lot<00:04:09.830> of<00:04:09.890> colors<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.490> play

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
doesn't give you a lot of colors to play

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.180 
doesn't give you a lot of colors to play
and<00:04:11.150> in<00:04:11.270> fact<00:04:11.510> those<00:04:12.170> recordings<00:04:12.770> are<00:04:12.890> pretty

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
and in fact those recordings are pretty

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.180 
and in fact those recordings are pretty
much<00:04:13.370> static<00:04:14.150> it's<00:04:15.020> just<00:04:15.410> a<00:04:15.530> recording<00:04:15.980> of

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
much static it's just a recording of

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.890 
much static it's just a recording of
course<00:04:16.370> you<00:04:16.489> can<00:04:16.640> hold<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:17.000> key<00:04:17.239> in<00:04:17.300> and<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:17.750> can

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
course you can hold a key in and you can

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.930 
course you can hold a key in and you can
listen<00:04:18.110> to<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.410> recording<00:04:18.500> play<00:04:19.130> until<00:04:19.880> the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
listen to the recording play until the

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.200 
listen to the recording play until the
note<00:04:20.270> dies<00:04:20.630> or<00:04:21.050> has<00:04:21.230> that<00:04:21.500> decay<00:04:21.950> but<00:04:22.790> there<00:04:23.030> is

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
note dies or has that decay but there is

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.080 
note dies or has that decay but there is
no<00:04:23.450> real<00:04:23.870> interaction<00:04:24.440> from<00:04:25.040> one<00:04:25.310> note<00:04:25.640> to<00:04:25.670> the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
no real interaction from one note to the

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.080 
no real interaction from one note to the
next<00:04:26.290> okay<00:04:27.290> so<00:04:27.920> you're<00:04:28.130> basically<00:04:28.430> playing<00:04:28.730> a

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
next okay so you're basically playing a

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.430 
next okay so you're basically playing a
set<00:04:29.480> static<00:04:30.320> recordings<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.520> this<00:04:31.910> is<00:04:32.030> why

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
set static recordings and this is why

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.780 
set static recordings and this is why
most<00:04:33.440> classical<00:04:33.980> musicians<00:04:34.400> or<00:04:34.610> most

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
most classical musicians or most

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.340 
most classical musicians or most
classical<00:04:35.210> pianists<00:04:35.810> when<00:04:35.990> they're<00:04:36.110> given

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
classical pianists when they're given

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.900 
classical pianists when they're given
the<00:04:36.440> option<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:36.920> play<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.280> digital<00:04:37.610> piano

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
the option to play the digital piano

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.030 
the option to play the digital piano
they<00:04:38.600> really<00:04:38.900> turn<00:04:39.110> up<00:04:39.230> their<00:04:39.380> noses<00:04:39.410> on<00:04:39.890> these

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
they really turn up their noses on these

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.980 
they really turn up their noses on these
things<00:04:40.250> because<00:04:40.640> it's<00:04:40.790> like<00:04:40.970> asking<00:04:41.720> a

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
things because it's like asking a

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.710 
things because it's like asking a
painter<00:04:42.230> that<00:04:43.100> somebody<00:04:43.730> worked<00:04:43.940> with<00:04:44.150> ten

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
painter that somebody worked with ten

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.710 
painter that somebody worked with ten
crayons<00:04:45.350> rather<00:04:45.920> than<00:04:46.190> their<00:04:46.430> full<00:04:46.730> paints

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
crayons rather than their full paints

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.840 
crayons rather than their full paints
they<00:04:48.230> just<00:04:48.710> feel<00:04:48.920> like<00:04:49.070> our<00:04:49.220> week<00:04:49.460> we<00:04:49.580> feel<00:04:49.760> out

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
they just feel like our week we feel out

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.670 
they just feel like our week we feel out
our<00:04:49.970> hands<00:04:50.180> are<00:04:50.420> tied<00:04:50.450> we<00:04:51.230> feel<00:04:51.440> like<00:04:51.560> we

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
our hands are tied we feel like we

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.560 
our hands are tied we feel like we
really<00:04:51.860> can't<00:04:52.250> express<00:04:52.610> what<00:04:52.880> we<00:04:53.030> want<00:04:53.330> and

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
really can't express what we want and

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.670 
really can't express what we want and
they<00:04:54.530> just<00:04:54.710> feel<00:04:54.920> like<00:04:55.040> toys<00:04:55.340> Oh
