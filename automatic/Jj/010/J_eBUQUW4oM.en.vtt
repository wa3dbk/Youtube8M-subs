but it's got volume control buttons

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.950 
but it's got volume control buttons
right<00:05:45.480> here

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
right here

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.750 
right here

the headphone jack here and it comes
with<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.120> earbuds<00:05:48.540> so<00:05:48.750> that<00:05:48.990> you<00:05:49.110> can<00:05:49.260> do<00:05:49.380> that

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
with the earbuds so that you can do that

private<00:05:50.070> listening<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:51.270> wrist<00:05:51.480> strap<00:05:51.570> I

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
private listening the wrist strap I

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.390 
private listening the wrist strap I
think<00:05:52.140> is<00:05:52.260> also<00:05:52.410> related<00:05:52.710> to<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:52.950> fact<00:05:53.220> that

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
think is also related to the fact that

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.000 
think is also related to the fact that
this<00:05:54.210> can<00:05:54.660> be<00:05:54.900> used<00:05:55.110> as<00:05:55.350> a<00:05:55.410> game<00:05:55.710> controller

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
this can be used as a game controller

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.390 
this can be used as a game controller
it's<00:05:56.730> inside<00:05:57.330> it<00:05:57.630> has<00:05:58.100> accelerometers<00:05:59.100> so<00:05:59.280> it

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
it's inside it has accelerometers so it

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.560 
it's inside it has accelerometers so it
knows<00:05:59.550> which<00:05:59.760> way<00:05:59.910> you're<00:06:00.090> holding<00:06:00.180> it<00:06:00.510> and

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
knows which way you're holding it and

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.790 
knows which way you're holding it and
how<00:06:00.690> you're<00:06:00.870> moving<00:06:01.230> it<00:06:01.350> and<00:06:01.440> you<00:06:01.500> can<00:06:01.650> play

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
how you're moving it and you can play

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.010 
how you're moving it and you can play
some<00:06:02.070> games<00:06:02.280> on<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:02.640> Roku<00:06:02.790> 3<00:06:03.180> I<00:06:03.390> thought<00:06:03.870> we

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
some games on the Roku 3 I thought we

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.420 
some games on the Roku 3 I thought we
would<00:06:04.200> do<00:06:04.290> that<00:06:04.470> more<00:06:04.680> but<00:06:04.830> we<00:06:04.950> really<00:06:05.190> haven't

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
would do that more but we really haven't

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.820 
would do that more but we really haven't
with<00:06:06.120> Amazon<00:06:06.660> though<00:06:06.840> as<00:06:06.990> I<00:06:07.020> understand<00:06:07.620> it

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
with Amazon though as I understand it

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.350 
with Amazon though as I understand it
you<00:06:07.950> can<00:06:08.190> set<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:08.550> up<00:06:08.700> if<00:06:08.910> you<00:06:09.030> don't<00:06:09.120> want<00:06:09.210> to

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
you can set it up if you don't want to

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.570 
you can set it up if you don't want to
spend<00:06:09.480> the<00:06:09.630> $40<00:06:10.200> for<00:06:10.470> that<00:06:10.590> Xbox<00:06:11.310> type

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
spend the $40 for that Xbox type

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.190 
spend the $40 for that Xbox type
controller<00:06:11.970> that<00:06:12.180> works<00:06:12.360> with<00:06:12.570> the<00:06:12.690> Amazon

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
controller that works with the Amazon

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.370 
controller that works with the Amazon
fire<00:06:13.890> TV<00:06:14.280> I<00:06:14.760> believe<00:06:15.390> you<00:06:15.600> can<00:06:15.810> set<00:06:16.050> up<00:06:16.140> your

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
fire TV I believe you can set up your

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.160 
fire TV I believe you can set up your
tablet<00:06:16.980> or<00:06:17.100> your<00:06:17.730> smart<00:06:18.120> phone<00:06:18.390> to<00:06:18.720> work<00:06:18.900> as

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
tablet or your smart phone to work as

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.660 
tablet or your smart phone to work as
the<00:06:19.380> controller<00:06:19.770> because<00:06:20.100> it<00:06:20.250> already<00:06:20.430> has

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
the controller because it already has

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.520 
the controller because it already has
the<00:06:20.850> accelerometer<00:06:21.570> and<00:06:21.600> so<00:06:21.840> forth<00:06:22.080> in<00:06:22.230> it<00:06:22.380> and

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
the accelerometer and so forth in it and

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.160 
the accelerometer and so forth in it and
then<00:06:22.950> use<00:06:23.190> that<00:06:23.220> to<00:06:23.460> play<00:06:23.760> the<00:06:23.940> games<00:06:24.180> that<00:06:24.840> are

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.170 
then use that to play the games that are

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.930 
then use that to play the games that are
offered<00:06:25.620> through<00:06:25.650> the<00:06:25.890> Amazon<00:06:26.190> fire<00:06:26.400> TV<00:06:26.610> those

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
offered through the Amazon fire TV those

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.610 
offered through the Amazon fire TV those
games<00:06:27.210> really<00:06:27.510> do<00:06:27.720> look<00:06:27.840> kind<00:06:28.050> of<00:06:28.110> interesting

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
games really do look kind of interesting

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.780 
games really do look kind of interesting
so<00:06:28.740> I'm<00:06:28.800> going<00:06:28.920> to<00:06:28.980> look<00:06:29.100> into<00:06:29.250> that<00:06:29.340> some<00:06:29.670> more

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
and watch anything so I'm interested to

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.339 
and watch anything so I'm interested to
see<00:07:08.080> if<00:07:08.589> the<00:07:09.099> Amazon<00:07:09.909> fire<00:07:10.149> TV<00:07:10.449> has<00:07:10.959> a<00:07:10.990> way<00:07:11.289> to

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:11.349 
see if the Amazon fire TV has a way to

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:12.779 
see if the Amazon fire TV has a way to
limit<00:07:11.619> access<00:07:11.889> to<00:07:12.129> that<00:07:12.369> sort<00:07:12.639> of<00:07:12.729> thing

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:12.789 
limit access to that sort of thing

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:14.999 
limit access to that sort of thing
something<00:07:13.539> that<00:07:13.569> I<00:07:13.749> am<00:07:13.929> disappointed<00:07:14.289> in<00:07:14.769> with

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:15.009 
something that I am disappointed in with

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:17.009 
something that I am disappointed in with
all<00:07:15.159> the<00:07:15.459> set-top<00:07:15.819> streaming<00:07:16.479> boxes<00:07:16.869> but

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:17.019 
all the set-top streaming boxes but

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:18.329 
all the set-top streaming boxes but
maybe<00:07:17.139> in<00:07:17.349> particular<00:07:17.860> with<00:07:18.009> this<00:07:18.129> one

00:07:18.329 --> 00:07:18.339 
maybe in particular with this one

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:19.889 
maybe in particular with this one
because<00:07:18.610> it's<00:07:18.789> the<00:07:18.969> newest<00:07:19.300> that<00:07:19.479> had<00:07:19.599> more

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:19.899 
because it's the newest that had more

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:22.019 
because it's the newest that had more
time<00:07:20.199> to<00:07:20.439> do<00:07:20.559> this<00:07:20.769> is<00:07:20.979> they<00:07:21.459> don't<00:07:21.610> work<00:07:21.819> with

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:22.029 
time to do this is they don't work with

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:24.629 
time to do this is they don't work with
4k<00:07:22.300> you<00:07:23.050> if<00:07:23.349> you<00:07:23.439> have<00:07:23.559> a<00:07:23.589> 4k<00:07:24.009> television<00:07:24.189> you
