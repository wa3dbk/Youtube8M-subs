00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.250
 he came back home 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.730
 while other types of machines suffer wear over time the machine 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.730
 can improve with 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:26.949
 Exercises 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.679
 make muscles grow strength strength and size 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.760
 rainsford work hard as barbie to develop your body 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.190
 he works his torahcs and can lift a little of his weight 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.450
 in the average man the 656 different muscles 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.450
 almost half the body weight 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.290
 to about three muscles for each use 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.490
 not all appear fulfilled outside 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.620
 country of 5 we have the same number of muscle cells 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.040
 this number stays senate before we are born 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.680
 muscles are made basically team protein 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.840
 to improve our physique 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.390
 we need a highly protein diet in a training program 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.790
 but not everyone can achieve this muscle martial even with a training 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.790
 imitated 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.120
 a school that all kinds of muscles that can reach 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.710
 This picture 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.870
 for those who want to print agility 

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.270
 it's best to avoid light muscles with faster responses 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.980
 exercises also strengthen the conditions of these muscles 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.499
 and it is also a time there is a coordination between muscles and 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:23.399
 senses of vision 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.399
 and balance 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.639
 sometimes a muscle mass generated may be a disadvantage because the 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.719
 works 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.459
 the deputies 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.570
 a small piece of musicians the size of a soda purchase 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.569
 already capable of lifting a weight of 20 kilos 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.169
 if all the muscles of the human body can become extinct it would raise a weight of 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.439
 25 tons 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.829
 besides volunteers the body has two other types of muscles 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:03.579
 the first is the heart muscle similar some as a volunteer but 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.559
 can not be controlled 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:09.159
 the second type are smooth muscles 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.159
 found in the walls of the intestines and with blood vessels 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.069
 they are also out of our mind control 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.069
 all muscles receive instructions from the nervous system 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.780
 which emits electrical signals from the spinal couple 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.829
 the whereabouts of the servers 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.419
 these lead the thousands of muscle cells 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.189
 resulting in contraction of relaxation 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:41.679
 each cell has an average hair thickness of about five 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:43.179
 centimeters 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:46.509
 the nerve thrusts electrical shock to the surface of the cell 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:51.739
 The electric impulse causes the small fibers inside the cell to 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.739
 to contract 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:59.330
 when contracting 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.780
 muscle and may have a weight of its regional length 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.469
 it is fixed on tendons in turn attached to the partners 

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:09.809
 for light work 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:14.499
 the nervous system and feather stimulates a part of the cells in each musician 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.530
 if it needs more force it recruits more cells and shoots them with 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.529
 bigger frequency 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.490
 the muscular powers come from the chemical traction 'between different proteins 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.490
 within this microscopic end 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:47.509
 the blood muscle food with a constant flow of oxygen 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.030
 and also the refueling and takeoff 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.030
 stored as glycogen 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.860
 when the muscle is working 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.849
 the expertise warms up several degrees 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.490
 the warmth of the muscles helps maintain our normal temperature 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.070
 around the pct degrees 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.970
 the laboratory can prepare for the final 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.800
 your muscles are ready to reach 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.330
 he increased heart rate 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.479
 fills the air lungs 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.129
 still lacking fuel for his powerful musician 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.699
 for third he needs extra energy 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.399
 your muscles can produce energy without potts and james 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.089
 so fail 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:52.309
 or lactic acid 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:56.889
 Residual products penetrates your muscles causing historical sars 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.770
 That 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.819
 the willpower 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.819
 reach its limit and when it approaches the line 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.629
 despite the pain his time was excellent 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.740
 took another step towards his Olympic dream 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:52.259
 most of us do not take your body limits 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:53.979
 forcing such limits 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:58.090
 the athletes helped to unravel it with one of the mysteries of the human machine 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:04.569
 it is indeed the extraordinary vehicle 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.610
 are millions of parts that united and in a coordinated way 

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:13.559
 one can admire perfection in this way not only in sport 

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:15.309
 but also 

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:17.079
 in the simple flashing of the world
