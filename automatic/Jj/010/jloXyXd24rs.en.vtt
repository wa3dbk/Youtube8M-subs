00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.380
 I think it's pretty good and we're in 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.870
 a kind of tutorial as they saw in 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.450
 the title of how to explore what 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.100
 they are the strong cost or the dan jones 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.760
 underground where the portal is encouraged 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.949
 and how not to get lost in the attempt but 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.869
 which is a pretty simple way but 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.250
 well I bring them here in case they reach 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.380
 find it in survival or in 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.360
 creative so that it is easy for them 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.780
 find it and do not get lost in the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.670
 labyrinth and well this is great 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.699
 because there is a village and just in that 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.829
 village ignore that big thing over there and 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.340
 in the village below it is what 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.350
 is this the extracted the give and the same for 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.710
 there and I'll show you more or less 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.739
 as a technique that we can 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.070
 use to not miss I'll leave you the 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.230
 quote of what is this 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.810
 in this village with the trunk down and 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.280
 others so they can explore the three 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.920
 themselves both in survival in 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.520
 creative since you will decide and 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.860
 well let's get my throat wet here 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.630
 many people are already very well we are already 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.660
 here 's how it looks even here 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.350
 because little boxes although I do not know why 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.110
 this does not charge because it does not charge 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.460
 well let's leave it like that even youtube 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.799
 up there and good, what is the best way 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.780
 simple and more practical to be able 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.360
 explore what are the great cycles to 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.979
 the caves and not get lost then it's 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.860
 Pretty simple is normally needed 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.930
 torches and the joke say putting them 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.640
 on the floor because on the floor because in 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.190
 the case of these for example those 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.820
 torches here and here I do not 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.530
 I put them to say that they are already in the 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.630
 plane and I put them on my floor my mind 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.190
 even that's where they're also put 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.450
 on the floor it means that you 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.190
 they placed them and also something still 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.920
 much more practical is that they put 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.259
 right side 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.620
 and where wherever they go past the 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.730
 they are placing on the right side to avoid 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.340
 get lost to know which way is the one that 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.099
 they followed is and continue to place and 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.830
 placing and placing while going 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.180
 exploring and when they go through the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.300
 same place for example what can 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.430
 place on the other side 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.780
 so they know they were already on their way and 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.540
 come back and they found nothing 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.300
 interesting we're going through here and we're going 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.590
 placing also for example in these 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.600
 can also place that already 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.160
 they explored and there's nothing too for 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.440
 Do not waste time if this one goes back to 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.890
 pass by here look also here 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.310
 There are many 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.920
 roads in the event that there are several 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.600
 roads extra signs well what I give them 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.030
 I recommend that they always start 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.300
 on the right side so we go for 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.060
 here we are going to explore this part by 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.000
 example here is another entry we go for 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.070
 here and what I say they should do is 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.750
 go on the right side for example here 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.690
 that we can no longer go the other way 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.970
 right obviously it is again to give half 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.340
 return and continue the same on the side 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.630
 right over here there's nothing 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.200
 we continue on the right side 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.150
 straight 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.769
 this is supported but good does not matter 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.360
 and we had already explored all this and to 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.150
 that will not happen to me here here if 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.500
 they could place I do not know three torches or 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.870
 fill it with torches that already 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.959
 explored in this area and it has no case 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.580
 will come back anyway to have 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.830
 the torches on the floor they will already know 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.660
 that already happened here and in this way 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.050
 same but I do not know why it is 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.990
 Bustling this we will have to try to leave 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.240
 to see if you can is that it is a problem 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.490
 with will 2 I think the one would best him 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.780
 It was better in your case 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.910
 we return tickets 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.270
 because because it did not happen to me I hope so 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:00.920
 that they take out soon the next one and what 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:03.260
 makes me broke creation of Haceme 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.700
 let's see let's try to re-enter 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.700
 and if not then well 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:14.840
 I think that here would be this tutorial 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.930
 ok now in charge but that everything 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.560
 sent out because who knows if not 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.360
 it was not that crazy and good that's how 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.690
 we can all the foreigners the caves 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.090
 and in the same way and avoid getting lost and 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.590
 also afterwards I will make the other one 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.010
 tutorial that many will serve 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.940
 it has to do with this huge thing but 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.930
 well also what I gave them the cidh and 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.430
 I'm going to see where is the 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.470
 matter the lens directly also if 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.320
 they do not want to explore but well what 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.550
 interesting is to explore it in 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.990
 survival because there are also chests 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.650
 and they 're supposed to have little things 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.470
 inside is that I'm not going to kill myself 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.430
 where society or the other time towards 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.300
 here 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.290
 Here we run themselves want and 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.170
 perfect we are dead very well 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:12.370
 we answer here is and right here 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:15.320
 is where we respond and we are even 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.610
 seeing where the village is here 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.680
 where is this mountain that tends to 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.360
 right side to the left side where 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.600
 they end like this all straight 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.529
 and they find in the village put 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.769
 big for now the easiest 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:32.829
 We will go there fast and fast to 

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:34.539
 prohibit wrongdoing and justly or 

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:37.479
 we even document it you ask 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.309
 that the foreigner is talking about this 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.919
 lake but curiously I did not have this 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:43.659
 kind of lake I do not know why but 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.599
 good then then coming to the village 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:49.209
 as you can see here is one of the 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:52.659
 crops here there is a block above and 

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:54.819
 exactly where this is where it ends 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:59.679
 block because nothing else would tell what 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:06:02.409
 are 1 2 3 4 and in the fifth to have to 

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:04.839
 dig everything down and to the hedges and 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.979
 down they would be directly here but 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.479
 I will tell them if they are going to do it in 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.029
 survival would be much better 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:12.200
 because it explores a year and wind 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:15.020
 it took like 10 minutes 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.400
 and even exploring the others for 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.380
 come directly and without 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.000
 directly since you already know where to end 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:25.010
 it does not fit anymore for them and they will not fall 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.900
 in álava and here is a spam of the 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.240
 these little things that are very strange 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.150
 but I do not know is the 9th time in loco of 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.330
 very biological models and nothing I hope that 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.950
 have you liked this tutorial not 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.780
 forget to subscribe session have been given 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.940
 you have to comment make more tutorials of 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.190
 how to survive in the infinite worlds 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.260
 because I know it's not a thing 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.090
 simple and nothing I hope that I have 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.650
 liked and we'll see each other in this video 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.650
 see you later
