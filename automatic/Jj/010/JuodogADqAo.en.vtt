I'm<00:00:01.020> Annie<00:00:01.260> Duke<00:00:01.530> in<00:00:01.829> our<00:00:02.580> last<00:00:02.790> lesson<00:00:03.090> we

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
I'm Annie Duke in our last lesson we

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.550 
I'm Annie Duke in our last lesson we
explained<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.780> difference<00:00:04.049> between<00:00:04.170> big

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
explained the difference between big

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.590 
explained the difference between big
draws<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.190> small<00:00:05.549> draws<00:00:05.790> after<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.210> flop

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
draws and small draws after the flop

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.230 
draws and small draws after the flop
now<00:00:07.529> we're<00:00:07.770> gonna<00:00:07.859> take<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.160> closer<00:00:08.639> look<00:00:08.849> at

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
now we're gonna take a closer look at

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.240 
now we're gonna take a closer look at
what<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.599> that<00:00:09.750> makes<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.200> big<00:00:10.380> draw<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.889> big

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
what it is that makes a big draw a big

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.640 
what it is that makes a big draw a big
draw<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.880> give<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.870> some<00:00:13.049> advice<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.349> can

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
draw and give you some advice that can

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.110 
draw and give you some advice that can
help<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:14.009> make<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.280> most<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.610> these<00:00:14.790> kinds<00:00:15.089> of

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
help you make the most of these kinds of

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.439 
help you make the most of these kinds of
big<00:00:15.330> hands<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:16.440> our<00:00:17.039> last<00:00:17.279> lesson<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:18.060> defined

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
big hands in our last lesson we defined

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.510 
big hands in our last lesson we defined
a<00:00:18.570> big<00:00:18.810> draw<00:00:19.109> as<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.410> hand<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.189> while<00:00:20.369> you

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
a big draw as a hand that while you

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.189 
a big draw as a hand that while you
don't<00:00:20.760> actually<00:00:20.970> have<00:00:21.180> as<00:00:21.510> good<00:00:21.630> as<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> pair

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
don't actually have as good as a pair

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.740 
don't actually have as good as a pair
yet<00:00:22.470> has<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.519> many<00:00:23.699> outs<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.420> usually

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
yet has so many outs that you usually

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.929 
yet has so many outs that you usually
have<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.170> mathematical<00:00:26.010> advantage<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.699> your

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
have the mathematical advantage on your

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.630 
have the mathematical advantage on your
opponent<00:00:27.420> with<00:00:27.539> two<00:00:27.689> cards<00:00:27.900> left<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.320> come<00:00:28.640> but

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
opponent with two cards left to come but

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.089 
opponent with two cards left to come but
that's<00:00:29.789> not<00:00:30.090> really<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> whole<00:00:30.599> story<00:00:31.099> let's

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that's not really the whole story let's

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.889 
that's not really the whole story let's
go<00:00:32.250> back<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.640> our<00:00:32.730> example<00:00:32.820> hand<00:00:33.480> where<00:00:33.719> we

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
go back to our example hand where we

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.990 
go back to our example hand where we
held<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.410> suspense<00:00:35.010> King<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.399> Spades<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.940> a

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
held a suspense King of Spades on a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.299 
held a suspense King of Spades on a
board<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.690> 10<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.140> Spades<00:00:37.410> six<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.070> Spades

board of 10 of Spades six of Spades

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.970 
board of 10 of Spades six of Spades
deuce<00:00:38.640> apart<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.780> time<00:00:40.110> we'll<00:00:40.950> be

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
deuce apart and this time we'll be

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.190 
deuce apart and this time we'll be
against<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.730> one<00:00:41.820> opponent<00:00:42.239> who's<00:00:42.809> holding

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
against just one opponent who's holding

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.010 
against just one opponent who's holding
a<00:00:43.410> pair<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.860> Queens<00:00:44.510> now<00:00:45.510> there<00:00:45.660> are<00:00:45.750> three

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
a pair of Queens now there are three

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
a pair of Queens now there are three
factors<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:47.039> consider<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.910> really<00:00:48.270> make

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
factors to consider that really make

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240 
factors to consider that really make
this<00:00:48.719> hand<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.110> big<00:00:49.289> draw<00:00:49.530> as<00:00:49.770> opposed<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
this hand a big draw as opposed to a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.900 
this hand a big draw as opposed to a
small<00:00:50.520> one

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
small one

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.790 
small one
the<00:00:51.390> first<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.840> along<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> flush<00:00:52.770> draw

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
the first is along with the flush draw

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.939 
the first is along with the flush draw
we<00:00:53.160> also<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.699> over<00:00:54.270> cards<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:55.110> give<00:00:55.260> us<00:00:55.469> six

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
we also have over cards that give us six

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.580 
we also have over cards that give us six
extra<00:00:56.309> outs<00:00:56.750> we're<00:00:57.750> against<00:00:58.170> only<00:00:58.320> one

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
extra outs we're against only one

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.520 
extra outs we're against only one
opponent<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.539> we<00:01:00.539> still<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:01.020> two<00:01:01.260> cards

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
opponent and we still have two cards

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.740 
opponent and we still have two cards
left<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.920> come<00:01:02.129> now<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.149> two<00:01:03.480> really

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
left to come now the two really

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.960 
left to come now the two really
important<00:01:04.290> factors<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.920> notice<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.610> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
important factors to notice here is that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.690 
important factors to notice here is that
we<00:01:06.210> are<00:01:06.510> against<00:01:06.990> only<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.650> opponent<00:01:08.159> with

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
we are against only one opponent with

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.179 
we are against only one opponent with
two<00:01:09.390> cards<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.960> come<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:11.159> of

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
two cards to come and it's because of

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.340 
two cards to come and it's because of
this<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.880> our<00:01:12.030> hand<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.780> currently<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
this that our hand is really currently a

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.649 
this that our hand is really currently a
mathematical<00:01:14.130> favorite<00:01:14.549> over<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> hand<00:01:15.479> like

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
mathematical favorite over a hand like

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.289 
mathematical favorite over a hand like
Queens<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.770> actually<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.939> slightly

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
Queens and is actually just slightly

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.240 
Queens and is actually just slightly
worse<00:01:18.600> than<00:01:18.630> even<00:01:19.049> money<00:01:19.200> against<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.070> hand

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
worse than even money against a hand

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.370 
worse than even money against a hand
like<00:01:20.400> King<00:01:20.640> King<00:01:20.939> if<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:22.049> add<00:01:22.350> another

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
like King King if we add another

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.310 
like King King if we add another
opponent<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> mix<00:01:23.729> or<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:25.140> give

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
opponent to the mix or if we give

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.830 
opponent to the mix or if we give
ourselves<00:01:25.470> only<00:01:26.040> one<00:01:26.369> card<00:01:26.880> left<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.600> come

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
ourselves only one card left to come

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.899 
ourselves only one card left to come
then<00:01:28.320> our<00:01:28.500> odds<00:01:28.650> aren't<00:01:29.130> nearly<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.460> good<00:01:29.700> in

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
then our odds aren't nearly as good in

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.140 
then our odds aren't nearly as good in
fact<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.329> become<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> dog<00:01:30.920> if<00:01:31.920> our<00:01:32.460> hand<00:01:32.729> doesn't

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
fact we become a dog if our hand doesn't

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.420 
fact we become a dog if our hand doesn't
improve<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> turn<00:01:33.960> we'll<00:01:34.799> go<00:01:35.070> from<00:01:35.340> being

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
improve on the turn we'll go from being

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.149 
improve on the turn we'll go from being
a<00:01:35.880> favorite<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:37.049> being<00:01:37.290> about<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> two<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
a favorite to being about a two and a

a favorite to being about a two and a
half<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.460> an<00:01:38.579> underdog<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.240> win<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> river

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
half to an underdog to win on the river

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.350 
half to an underdog to win on the river
since<00:01:40.170> our<00:01:40.320> 15<00:01:40.740> outs<00:01:40.979> are<00:01:41.340> only<00:01:41.909> going<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> be

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
since our 15 outs are only going to be

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.130

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
likely to hit 30% of the time similarly

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.710 
likely to hit 30% of the time similarly
we<00:01:46.920> no<00:01:47.100> longer<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> big<00:01:48.060> draw<00:01:48.299> if<00:01:48.509> we're

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
we no longer have a big draw if we're

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.270 
we no longer have a big draw if we're
facing<00:01:49.170> more<00:01:49.290> than<00:01:49.439> one<00:01:49.619> opponent<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.159> this

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
facing more than one opponent in this

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.609 
facing more than one opponent in this
hand<00:01:50.579> because<00:01:51.420> our<00:01:51.540> chances<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.079> winning<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.969 
hand by hitting either an ace or a king
are<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:56.280> much<00:01:56.490> less<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:58.200> case<00:01:58.500> where

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
are just much less in this case where

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.740 
are just much less in this case where
we're<00:01:59.159> facing<00:01:59.460> more<00:01:59.820> than<00:02:00.000> one<00:02:00.180> opponent<00:02:00.659> we

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
we're facing more than one opponent we

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.260 
we're facing more than one opponent we
really<00:02:01.020> need<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.259> discount<00:02:01.979> those<00:02:02.520> six<00:02:02.909> extra

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
really need to discount those six extra

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.990 
really need to discount those six extra
outs<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.530> would<00:02:04.680> really<00:02:04.860> count<00:02:05.460> if<00:02:05.820> we

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
outs that we would really count if we

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.449 
outs that we would really count if we
were<00:02:06.180> heads<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.689> because<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.009> look<00:02:08.310> at

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
were heads up because we have to look at

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.400 
were heads up because we have to look at
the<00:02:08.580> hand<00:02:08.819> as<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.509> as<00:02:09.660> if<00:02:09.780> we're<00:02:09.959> really<00:02:10.110> only

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
the hand as just as if we're really only

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.510 
the hand as just as if we're really only
holding<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.830> nut<00:02:10.979> flush<00:02:11.220> draw

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
holding the nut flush draw

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.730 
holding the nut flush draw
it's<00:02:12.090> against<00:02:12.360> multiple<00:02:12.840> opponents<00:02:12.989> if

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
it's against multiple opponents if

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.660 
it's against multiple opponents if
hit<00:02:13.950> an<00:02:14.070> ace<00:02:14.190> or<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.430> king<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.940> may<00:02:15.510> not<00:02:15.690> be<00:02:15.870> good

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
hit an ace or a king it may not be good

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.940 
hit an ace or a king it may not be good
so<00:02:17.670> against<00:02:18.210> more<00:02:18.450> than<00:02:18.600> one<00:02:18.750> opponent<00:02:19.050> we<00:02:19.740> go

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
so against more than one opponent we go

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.830 
so against more than one opponent we go
from<00:02:20.250> being<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.550> mathematical<00:02:21.330> favorite<00:02:21.720> on

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840

from being a mathematical favorite on
the<00:02:21.990> flop<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.950> being<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.220> two-to-one<00:02:23.580> underdog

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
the flop to being a two-to-one underdog

the flop to being a two-to-one underdog
with<00:02:24.390> two<00:02:24.540> cards<00:02:24.810> left<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.110> come<00:02:25.290> because<00:02:25.500> all

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
with two cards left to come because all

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.590 
with two cards left to come because all
you<00:02:26.040> have<00:02:26.220> now<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.550> flush<00:02:26.850> draw<00:02:26.880> which<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.480> a

you have now is a flush draw which is a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.150 
you have now is a flush draw which is a
two-to-one<00:02:27.960> underdog<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.740> spot<00:02:29.010> and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
two-to-one underdog in that spot and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.280 
two-to-one underdog in that spot and
worse<00:02:29.850> yet<00:02:30.090> you're<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> four<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.750> one<00:02:30.780> underdog

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
worse yet you're a four to one underdog

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.400 
worse yet you're a four to one underdog
with<00:02:31.500> just<00:02:31.680> one<00:02:31.860> card<00:02:32.070> left<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.340> fall<00:02:33.170> now<00:02:34.170> that

with just one card left to fall now that

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.830 
with just one card left to fall now that
we<00:02:34.530> really<00:02:34.920> understand<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:36.600> so

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
we really understand that it's so

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.210 
we really understand that it's so
important<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.350> be<00:02:37.470> against<00:02:37.770> one<00:02:37.950> opponent

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220

with<00:02:38.700> two<00:02:39.000> cards<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.450> come<00:02:39.630> we<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.050> logically

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
with two cards to come we can logically

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.290 
with two cards to come we can logically
set<00:02:40.830> our<00:02:41.100> goals<00:02:41.550> with<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:41.910> hand<00:02:42.150> our

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
set our goals with this hand our

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.900 
set our goals with this hand our
strategies<00:02:42.920> since<00:02:43.920> our<00:02:44.130> hand<00:02:44.400> goes<00:02:44.670> from

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
strategies since our hand goes from

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.490 
strategies since our hand goes from
being<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.180> favorite<00:02:45.570> on<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.780> flop<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.200> being<00:02:46.410> a

our 15 outs our goal should really be to
play<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.600> hand<00:02:51.840> very<00:02:51.930> fast<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.010> flop

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
play the hand very fast on the flop

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.160 
play the hand very fast on the flop
because<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:54.060> will<00:02:54.270> ensure<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:54.990> either

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
because this will ensure that we either

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.650 
because this will ensure that we either
win<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.100> pot<00:02:56.280> right<00:02:56.430> there<00:02:56.700> which<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:56.970> totally

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
fine since all we have is ace high at

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.060 
fine since all we have is ace high at
that<00:02:59.880> moment<00:03:00.270> or<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.510> we'll<00:03:01.230> definitely<00:03:01.500> get

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
that moment or that we'll definitely get

to see two cards which is really what

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.300

place by betting big on the flop we may

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.970 
place by betting big on the flop we may

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
induce our opponent to fold which lets

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
what you want or if he's not calling

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.500 
what you want or if he's not calling
all-in<00:04:10.950> he'll<00:04:11.310> almost<00:04:11.520> definitely<00:04:12.090> check<00:04:12.330> the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
all-in he'll almost definitely check the

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.600

turn<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.990> you<00:04:13.140> which<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.709> also<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:14.130> good<00:04:14.370> thing

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
because then you could choose to take

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.680 
because then you could choose to take
that<00:04:16.020> free<00:04:16.230> card<00:04:16.560> if<00:04:17.000> you've<00:04:18.000> moved<00:04:18.209> all-in

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690

and he calls you're still gonna see two

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.719 
and he calls you're still gonna see two
cards<00:04:21.840> which<00:04:21.989> is<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.530> best<00:04:22.800> outcome<00:04:23.280> for<00:04:23.310> you

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
cards which is the best outcome for you

with<00:04:24.510> this<00:04:24.690> hand<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.140> if<00:04:25.290> he<00:04:25.410> re-raises<00:04:25.770> you

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
with this hand and if he re-raises you

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.650 
with this hand and if he re-raises you
all-in<00:04:26.250> you'll<00:04:26.910> almost<00:04:27.090> always

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
all-in you'll almost always

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.020 
all-in you'll almost always
getting<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.050> right<00:04:28.230> price<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.800> call<00:04:29.040> even<00:04:29.670> if

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030

your hand is downgraded to just a flush

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
because you'll get to see those two

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.250 
because you'll get to see those two
cards<00:04:33.980> if<00:04:34.980> you<00:04:35.700> were<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.120> preflop<00:04:36.540> raiser<00:04:36.870> and

your opponent checks the flop you should

care since your hand is so strong that
you'll<00:04:45.420> probably<00:04:45.630> want<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.020> re-raise<00:04:46.470> if<00:04:46.860> your

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790
