now<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> questions<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.269> get<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> lot<00:00:24.630> is

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
now one of the questions we get a lot is

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.560 
now one of the questions we get a lot is
is<00:00:25.460> well<00:00:26.460> how<00:00:26.670> are<00:00:26.789> these<00:00:26.910> different<00:00:27.119> than<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
is well how are these different than the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.929 
is well how are these different than the
old<00:00:27.660> gulp<00:00:28.050> tails<00:00:28.410> right<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.250> regular<00:00:29.670> gulp

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
old gulp tails right the regular gulp

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.479 
old gulp tails right the regular gulp
tails<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.289> solution<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.340> actually

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
tails it's the solution you can actually

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.490 
tails it's the solution you can actually
buy<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:32.850> solution<00:00:33.540> because<00:00:34.140> then<00:00:34.290> I'm<00:00:34.380> not

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
buy this solution because then I'm not

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.600 
buy this solution because then I'm not
sure<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.770> they<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.160> over<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:35.550> you

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
sure if they have it over here but you

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.819 
sure if they have it over here but you
can<00:00:35.820> buy<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.030> solution<00:00:36.600> spray<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.140> what<00:00:37.710> it

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
can buy the solution spray it on what it

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.860 
can buy the solution spray it on what it
does<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.340> saturates<00:00:38.940> into<00:00:39.390> these<00:00:39.540> baits

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
does is it saturates into these baits

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.830 
does is it saturates into these baits
and<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.920> make<00:00:41.100> some<00:00:41.180> softer<00:00:42.180> okay<00:00:42.600> more

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and just make some softer okay more

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.200 
and just make some softer okay more
realistic<00:00:43.469> that's<00:00:43.649> really<00:00:44.010> what<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.460> so

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
realistic that's really what it is so

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.540 
realistic that's really what it is so
it's<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.690> more<00:00:45.840> realistic<00:00:46.200> look<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it's just a more realistic look to the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.310 
it's just a more realistic look to the
bait<00:00:47.730> there's<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> few<00:00:48.840> things<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
bait there's a few things that have a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.250 
bait there's a few things that have a
softer<00:00:49.860> more<00:00:50.039> realistic<00:00:50.960> available<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.050> many

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
softer more realistic available in many

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.350 
softer more realistic available in many

what makes golf alive a little bit

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.830 
what makes golf alive a little bit
different<00:04:18.910> is<00:04:19.000> first<00:04:19.209> of<00:04:19.329> all<00:04:19.359> you'll<00:04:19.570> see<00:04:19.600> the

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
different is first of all you'll see the

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.569 
different is first of all you'll see the
container<00:04:20.139> is<00:04:20.350> completely<00:04:20.829> different<00:04:21.010> in

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
container is completely different in

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.430 
container is completely different in
this<00:04:21.820> container<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.870> reason<00:04:23.139> that<00:04:23.200> has<00:04:23.320> to

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
this container the reason that has to

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.290 
this container the reason that has to
come<00:04:23.590> in<00:04:23.770> that<00:04:23.919> is<00:04:24.430> because<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.940> bodies

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
come in that is because the bodies

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.210 
come in that is because the bodies
actually<00:04:25.540> come<00:04:25.870> in<00:04:25.990> this<00:04:26.139> golf<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.560> live<00:04:26.800> juice

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
actually come in this golf a live juice

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.250 
actually come in this golf a live juice
and<00:04:27.729> what<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:28.060> does<00:04:28.330> is<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.600> couple<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.080> things

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
and what that does is a couple of things

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.500 
and what that does is a couple of things
for<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.590> first<00:04:29.889> of<00:04:30.100> all<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.700> keeps<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.180> golf

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
for you first of all it keeps the golf

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
liquid so that as it sits in there it

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.409 
liquid so that as it sits in there it
