00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.000
So you've got a lot of problems

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.250
I think I could help you solve them

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.200
I found the solution while watching anime

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.949
before you blow me off please here me out

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.800
this is my plan. Lets say...

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you could form a contract with your supernatural buddy

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.480
fill all of your pokeballs with creatures cute and cuddly

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.199
if you are a girl than you can make the whole world stop

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.280
with a very simple action if you just take off your top

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.200
find a magic stone that makes you magical yourself

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.340
dress as a different gender make them think
you're someone else

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.000
grow your eyes to twice their size make those who wronged you 
feel ashamed

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.350
or you could play a Children's Card Game!

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.920
or wait I think I've got it.  It's the best solution yet!

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.920
no matter what your problems are, this could solve them all I bet!

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.000
you should build a Massive Mega Mecha Machine

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.800
with a Great Big Gigantic Machine Gun

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.000
to shoot away your problems with a

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.550
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.000
or to squish them one by one.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.300
cause with a robot all your problems they are small enough to toss.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.450
you can simply squish your teachers or shoot lasers at your boss.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.310
you can rescue helpless damsels as they plummet to the ground

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.220
cause those damsels will be falling once you
kick that building down!

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.640
I don't know how to build a ROBOT but I know one of you must

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.310
and once you build a ROBOT you'll remember
me I trust,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.750
and how it was my idea that made your problems run and hide

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.250
so once you build a robot wont you take me
for a ride?

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.000
yeah you should build a Massive Mega Mecha Machine

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
with a Great Big Gigantic Machine Gun

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
to shoot away your problems with a

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.700
or to squish them one by one

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.600
if people are crying 
if the governments lying

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.000
if they're starving and dying
Well use...

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
ROBOTS!

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.579
if you had a bad date and you gained too much weight

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.000
and now you wont get laid
solve it with...

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
ROBOTS!

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.689
no one was expecting a
Deus ex Mecha Na!

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:23.000
you should build a Massive Mega Mecha Machine

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.100
with a Great Big Gigantic Machine Gun

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.100
to shoot away your problems with a

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.000
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.700
or to squish them one by one.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.000
