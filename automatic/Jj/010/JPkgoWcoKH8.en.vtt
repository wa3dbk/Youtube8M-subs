00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:53.840 
sometimes it can be a little tricky to
open<00:01:52.649> these<00:01:52.799> because<00:01:53.219> you<00:01:53.369> don't<00:01:53.549> want<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
open these because you don't want the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.090 
open these because you don't want the
figurine<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.659> statue<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.200> fall<00:01:55.469> out<00:01:55.680> as

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
figurine or the statue to fall out as

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.859 
figurine or the statue to fall out as
you're<00:01:56.369> opening<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:57.659> base

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
you're opening it but this is the base

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.450 
you're opening it but this is the base
itself<00:01:58.350> as<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.619> see<00:01:58.890> they<00:01:58.979> actually<00:01:59.009> want

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
itself as you can see they actually want

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.910 
itself as you can see they actually want
with<00:01:59.609> the<00:01:59.789> Harley<00:02:00.179> Quinn<00:02:00.539> pattern<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.500> well

over the place and we ended up getting

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.470 
over the place and we ended up getting
what's<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.970> look<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:10.160> 525<00:02:11.160> out<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.970> yeah
