you know I think that's how it we have

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.280 
you know I think that's how it we have
to<00:01:11.880> keep<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> organic<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.170> know<00:01:13.260> I

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to keep it organic like that you know I

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.130 
to keep it organic like that you know I
mean

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
mean

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.030 
mean
nobody<00:01:15.140> I<00:01:15.170> mean<00:01:15.260> nobody<00:01:15.410> does<00:01:15.740> a<00:01:15.770> better<00:01:15.860> job

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
nobody I mean nobody does a better job

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.100 
nobody I mean nobody does a better job
for<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.430> writers<00:01:16.760> writing<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.540> jokes<00:01:17.780> but

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
for the writers writing the jokes but

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.410 
for the writers writing the jokes but
but<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:18.650> think<00:01:18.860> there<00:01:19.010> are<00:01:19.040> ways<00:01:19.190> things<00:01:20.180> that

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
but I think there are ways things that

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.420 
but I think there are ways things that
come<00:01:20.630> up<00:01:20.660> while<00:01:21.560> you're<00:01:21.740> acting<00:01:22.070> that<00:01:22.190> just
