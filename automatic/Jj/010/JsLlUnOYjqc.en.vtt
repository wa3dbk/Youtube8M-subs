yeah<00:03:07.680> i<00:03:08.190> think<00:03:08.520> it's<00:03:08.910> it's<00:03:09.150> pretty<00:03:09.450> important

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
yeah i think it's it's pretty important

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.250 
yeah i think it's it's pretty important
that<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:11.670> stay<00:03:11.880> composed<00:03:12.239> in<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.570> situations

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
that you stay composed in the situations

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.400 
that you stay composed in the situations
and<00:03:13.470> i'm<00:03:14.160> going<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.780> want<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.870> take<00:03:15.989> some<00:03:16.200> time

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
and i'm going to want to take some time

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.670 
and i'm going to want to take some time
it's<00:03:16.800> definitely<00:03:16.970> something<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.120> learn<00:03:18.390> as

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
it's definitely something you learn as

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.199 
it's definitely something you learn as
as<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:19.709> mature<00:03:20.010> as<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.459> as<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.610> goaltender<00:03:21.180> i

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
as you mature as it as a goaltender i

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.190 
as you mature as it as a goaltender i
think<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.950> don't<00:03:23.100> want<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:24.390> know<00:03:24.540> try<00:03:25.050> and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
think you don't want to you know try and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.990 
think you don't want to you know try and
force<00:03:25.440> something<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:26.070> good<00:03:26.670> wind<00:03:26.880> up

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
force something that good wind up

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.120 
force something that good wind up
costing<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.690> think<00:03:27.900> it's<00:03:28.130> sometimes

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
costing you and I think it's sometimes

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.269 
costing you and I think it's sometimes
