00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.510 

I've<00:00:02.600> designed<00:00:02.870> and<00:00:03.409> built<00:00:03.620> cantilever

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:04.520 
I've designed and built cantilever

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.890 
I've designed and built cantilever
sawhorse<00:00:05.060> out<00:00:05.480> of<00:00:05.810> recycled<00:00:06.470> scrap<00:00:06.980> metal<00:00:07.490> I

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:07.900 
sawhorse out of recycled scrap metal I

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.810 
sawhorse out of recycled scrap metal I
made<00:00:08.900> it<00:00:09.139> because<00:00:09.349> the<00:00:09.709> traditional<00:00:10.249> sawhorse

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
made it because the traditional sawhorse

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.970 
made it because the traditional sawhorse
makes<00:00:11.269> it<00:00:11.450> quite<00:00:11.660> difficult<00:00:11.869> to<00:00:12.259> cut<00:00:12.559> the<00:00:12.709> ends

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
makes it quite difficult to cut the ends

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.980 
makes it quite difficult to cut the ends
of<00:00:13.039> the<00:00:13.190> logs<00:00:13.339> once<00:00:14.089> you<00:00:14.240> get<00:00:14.450> down<00:00:14.629> to<00:00:14.690> the

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
of the logs once you get down to the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.890 
of the logs once you get down to the
last<00:00:15.169> three<00:00:15.440> feet<00:00:16.390> there's<00:00:17.390> also<00:00:17.540> a<00:00:17.690> lot<00:00:17.870> of

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
last three feet there's also a lot of

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.790 
last three feet there's also a lot of
pumping<00:00:18.320> and<00:00:18.440> dumping<00:00:18.470> involved<00:00:23.620> the<00:00:24.620> new

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
pumping and dumping involved the new

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.070 
pumping and dumping involved the new
design<00:00:25.220> allows<00:00:25.610> me<00:00:25.880> to<00:00:26.060> cut<00:00:26.270> the<00:00:26.450> entire<00:00:26.540> log

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
design allows me to cut the entire log

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
design allows me to cut the entire log
in<00:00:27.350> one<00:00:27.590> section<00:00:28.190> and<00:00:28.430> it's<00:00:29.150> much<00:00:29.390> less<00:00:29.690> effort

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.790 

the<00:00:47.100> basic<00:00:47.489> design<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.540> steel<00:00:48.870> rails<00:00:49.230> with

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the basic design is to steel rails with

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.310 
the basic design is to steel rails with
two<00:00:50.040> uprights<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.879> then<00:00:51.480> supports<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
two uprights and then supports for the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.939 
two uprights and then supports for the
cantilever<00:00:54.199> there's<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.320> 20<00:00:55.680> millimeter

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
cantilever there's a 20 millimeter

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.549 
cantilever there's a 20 millimeter
swinging<00:00:56.850> bar<00:00:57.089> which<00:00:57.480> holds<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.019> teeth<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
swinging bar which holds the teeth and

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.590 
swinging bar which holds the teeth and
then<00:00:59.250> there's<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.519> rail<00:00:59.790> that<00:01:00.089> puts<00:01:00.360> in

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
then there's a rail that puts in

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.640 
then there's a rail that puts in
removable<00:01:01.379> Heights<00:01:01.949> justice<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.379> slide

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
removable Heights justice you just slide

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.940 
removable Heights justice you just slide
in<00:01:04.860> or<00:01:05.009> slide<00:01:05.369> out<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.350> silver<00:01:07.350> metal<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
in or slide out the silver metal to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:18.430 
in or slide out the silver metal to
create<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.400> height<00:01:08.550> you<00:01:08.700> want

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.899 

the<00:01:19.440> teeth<00:01:19.680> both<00:01:19.979> swing<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.610> 20

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the teeth both swing on the 20

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.620 
the teeth both swing on the 20
millimeter<00:01:21.090> bar<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:26.030> it's<00:01:27.030> very<00:01:27.240> easy<00:01:27.330> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
millimeter bar and it's very easy to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:39.520 
millimeter bar and it's very easy to
load

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.440 

you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.710> hold<00:01:40.920> pretty<00:01:41.159> well<00:01:41.310> any<00:01:41.520> size<00:01:41.789> log<00:01:42.179> in

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
you can hold pretty well any size log in

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.060 
you can hold pretty well any size log in
fact<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> longer<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.289> log<00:01:43.469> is<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.829> tighter

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
fact the longer the log is the tighter

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:56.160 
fact the longer the log is the tighter
it<00:01:44.280> holds<00:01:44.609> it

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.270 

this<00:01:57.170> was<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.500> reason<00:01:57.799> I<00:01:57.920> made<00:01:58.130> the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
this was the reason I made the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.850 
this was the reason I made the
cantilever<00:01:58.820> it's<00:01:59.630> very<00:01:59.960> hard<00:02:00.260> to<00:02:00.470> cut<00:02:00.710> the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
cantilever it's very hard to cut the

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.859 
cantilever it's very hard to cut the
last<00:02:01.040> three<00:02:01.340> feet<00:02:01.580> of<00:02:01.760> log<00:02:04.390> now<00:02:05.390> with<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.720> new

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
last three feet of log now with the new

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.370 
last three feet of log now with the new
design<00:02:06.259> I<00:02:06.530> can<00:02:07.400> make<00:02:07.580> them<00:02:07.820> 25<00:02:08.420> in<00:02:08.690> centimeters

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
design I can make them 25 in centimeters

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.570 
design I can make them 25 in centimeters
or<00:02:09.590> 10<00:02:09.800> inches

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.300 

I<00:02:16.330> take<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.450> truck<00:02:17.690> out<00:02:17.840> into<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.320> bush<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.830> I

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
I take the truck out into the bush and I

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.160 
I take the truck out into the bush and I
find<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.790> trees<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.300> fallen<00:02:20.720> over<00:02:21.140> and

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
find the trees that fallen over and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.010 
find the trees that fallen over and
already<00:02:21.890> seasoned<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:25.480> then<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.600> throw<00:02:26.840> them

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
already seasoned and then I throw them

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.740 
already seasoned and then I throw them
onto<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.410> back<00:02:27.530> of<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.770> Ute<00:02:28.240> this<00:02:29.240> shows<00:02:29.510> how

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
onto the back of the Ute this shows how

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.960 
onto the back of the Ute this shows how
well<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.080> holds<00:02:30.290> real<00:02:30.710> wobbly<00:02:31.190> branches<00:02:31.760> that

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
well it holds real wobbly branches that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.430 
well it holds real wobbly branches that
are<00:02:32.090> 15<00:02:32.510> feet<00:02:32.540> long<00:02:33.010> it's<00:02:34.010> very<00:02:34.190> easy
