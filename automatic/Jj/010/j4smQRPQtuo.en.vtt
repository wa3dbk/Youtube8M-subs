guess<00:00:47.650> you<00:00:47.770> could<00:00:47.800> say<00:00:48.070> an<00:00:48.220> example<00:00:48.700> of<00:00:48.820> a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
guess you could say an example of a

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.780 
guess you could say an example of a
closed<00:00:49.420> tool<00:00:49.720> between<00:00:50.140> a<00:00:50.470> hundred<00:00:50.860> and<00:00:51.040> a<00:00:51.190> ret

scattershot<00:00:54.550> he's<00:00:54.850> got<00:00:55.090> he'd<00:00:55.870> like<00:00:56.170> marksmen

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
scattershot he's got he'd like marksmen

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.310

hunters<00:00:56.980> they<00:00:57.280> do<00:00:57.340> a<00:00:57.430> lot<00:00:57.670> of<00:00:57.700> damage<00:00:58.000> and<00:00:58.450> then

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
hunters they do a lot of damage and then

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.470 
hunters they do a lot of damage and then
you<00:01:00.010> can<00:01:00.190> notice<00:01:00.400> here<00:01:00.550> how<00:01:00.760> he's<00:01:01.210> just

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
you can notice here how he's just

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.660 
you can notice here how he's just
kidding<00:01:01.690> me<00:01:01.960> like<00:01:02.079> normal<00:01:02.470> Hunters<00:01:02.710> wood<00:01:02.920> and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
kidding me like normal Hunters wood and

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.460 
kidding me like normal Hunters wood and
the<00:01:03.820> reason<00:01:04.329> that<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:04.839> freedom<00:01:05.229> right<00:01:05.350> off

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470

the reason that you freedom right off
the<00:01:05.650> bat<00:01:05.799> is<00:01:06.040> so<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.520> they<00:01:07.149> can't<00:01:07.479> get<00:01:07.659> that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
the bat is so that they can't get that

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.289 
the bat is so that they can't get that
range<00:01:08.079> on<00:01:08.320> you<00:01:08.470> now<00:01:09.430> I<00:01:09.460> get<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.729> quick<00:01:10.030> word<00:01:10.210> of

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
glory right there and it saves me the

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.490 
glory right there and it saves me the
match<00:01:12.280> and<00:01:12.670> I<00:01:12.909> win<00:01:13.210> but<00:01:13.510> it's<00:01:13.720> very<00:01:14.170> close
