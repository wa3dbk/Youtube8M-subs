00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:19.590
 can we clone ourselves together with 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.630
 by the institute dyad you more thanks 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.020
 the popularity of such TV series as dark 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.939
 child 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.439
 and human cloning began to think everything 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.420
 and their sister and their sister and their other 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.649
 sister is another their sister their brother 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.270
 thanks to modern achievements in 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.160
 genetics and synthetic 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.190
 biology we could change the genome 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.350
 man in such a way that we do not have 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.600
 our descendants had no diseases and even 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.460
 change certain traits but can 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.960
 real human clone exist 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.210
 actually well hi sent me 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.219
 hand over yes they want me to be with you 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.199
 this episode or something like that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.059
 Well, okay , do what they say 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.460
 sponsors think you really 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.240
 you look well it doesn't matter so the clones could 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.580
 would exist 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.020
 they already exist we call them 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.000
 identical twins 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.710
 identical twins is the result 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.840
 single fertilization single 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.939
 sperm of one egg which 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.619
 then it splits into two embryos in such 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.450
 the way they originate from the same 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.250
 genetic material but even 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.290
 identical twins not fully 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.240
 identical early in development 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.130
 there are hundreds of them maybe thousands 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.259
 different mutations in every cell of the body 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.880
 which will not have their twin and not 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.250
 it is important that it shows movies in 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.810
 identical twin personalities are different and 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.210
 they don't even always look perfect 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.860
 the same even two genes 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.780
 completely identical can act 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.979
 different due to own signals 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.320
 dna it 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.180
 epigenetics is current genetically 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.640
 identical organisms can turn out 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.770
 very different it goes on 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.270
 throughout their lifetime genetic 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.719
 changes occur in different cells 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.030
 bodies we are not even genetically identical 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.350
 yourself 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.159
 saying clones I was in the local market 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.920
 natural products and i found there 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.440
 several clones like this avocado this 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.560
 an Apple 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.570
 orange even this banana is actually 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.410
 all the fruits and vegetables that we buy 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.790
 these are genetically identical clones scientists 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.910
 also working to create 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.830
 cloned animals take dna 1 not 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.240
 fertilized by the egg and replaces it 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.110
 dna adult animal 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.310
 all the core now there is talk to 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.920
 return some extinct animals 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.570
 for example big woolly mammoths 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.920
 researchers have already done this with 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.560
 some live animals 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.240
 including lamb dolly dogs even cute 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.270
 little kitten nicknamed sisi 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.340
 an exact copy and I would call it 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.240
 differently he looks like me but it 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.030
 just my opinion 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.310
 due to mutations epigenetics like twins 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.300
 these cloned animals are a bit 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.030
 different from their genetic 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.490
 parents or siblings or how 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.000
 there it is called i mean they 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.530
 may be clones but they are personality 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.630
 what should be the difference to be 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.580
 yourself a good question 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.710
 thank you know it goes beyond 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.750
 cloning such things could save 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.280
 life now when the human genome 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.780
 sequenced we got 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.640
 identified genetically 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.440
 varieties that increase the risk 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.360
 certain diseases such as cancer 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.430
 breasts and besides we focused 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.440
 focus on those genes that are responsible for 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.420
 external signs such as eye color 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.270
 changing the dna sequence in semen 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.410
 or eggs we could create 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.660
 designer children with individual 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.100
 genes they we could even pass on these 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.140
 changes to their descendants 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.820
 we already have the technology to do 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.540
 it using technologies like 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.220
 crispr 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.200
 short polin fractional repeats and 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.360
 regularly arranged in groups where 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.070
 a small segment of rna works as a pair 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.019
 scissors to cut off a certain 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.130
 dna sequence letting us 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.140
 change at will any 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.060
 consistency in the body is easy 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.620
 do and it has already been done a lot 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.510
 times with different animals 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.310
 we do n't even need to change dna in the core 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.280
 some rare diseases are caused 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.570
 mutations in mitochondrial dna 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.830
 fertilized egg mitochondria 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.230
 can be replaced by mitochondria 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.570
 a donor that does not contain such mutations 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.340
 and then they can be implanted by the mother 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.920
 This so -called eco from three parents 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.540
 was recently allowed to uk 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.519
 but is still banned during 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.549
 many countries of the world we are sorry to whom 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.250
 belong these genomes I ask for 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.930
 friend 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.610
 Well, at the moment grown 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.350
 in a natural way dna cannot be 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.180
 patented in the united states 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.670
 for example a type of breast cancer gene 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.770
 bers to her one he was already discovered in 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.660
 nature nobody can own it but 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.580
 synthetic dna genes that we 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.340
 we create according to your taste and we can also 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.170
 do belong to those who created them 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.760
 should be put on them bar codes or 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.180
 something like to know who 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.850
 belong to this dna probably they would 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.800
 could actually do it 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.830
 we can already do most of 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.180
 these things with people 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.669
 cloning design genetics 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.380
 at least in theory but for now we are ready 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.300
 test and technology on plants 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.460
 options rats dogs and while they 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.160
 limited to people we won't know how on 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.110
 in fact they work it kinda 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.669
 futuristic issue and purpose of the chicken 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.710
 to find out whether these 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.510
 technologies are safe for people anymore 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.980
 the benefits of them than the harm we need 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.190
 do some human research 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.169
 or at least on human cells but 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.000
 until we know how 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.800
 they are really safe most 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.900
 people claim to hold such 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.030
 research is too risky or even 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.979
 not ethical as you think such 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.900
 technologies like change cloning 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.570
 human genomes are bright 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.910
 new or dark terrible future about what 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.000
 we should worry or everything is good during 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.620
 name of progress write to me or us in 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.740
 comments or twitter 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:49.110
 and you guys have twitter Hello I 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.639
 here for shooting what i need to drink 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.900
 cappuccino 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.900
 stay curious 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.410
 the outside 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.960
 one
