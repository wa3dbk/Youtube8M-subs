00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.110 
sponge then I dumped it on the nail I
repeated<00:01:29.830> this<00:01:29.950> process<00:01:30.010> to<00:01:30.580> make<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.820> colors

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
repeated this process to make the colors

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.890 
repeated this process to make the colors
more<00:01:31.150> opaque

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.600 

while<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:38.079> polish<00:01:38.409> was<00:01:38.590> still<00:01:38.799> wet<00:01:39.040> I<00:01:39.220> peeled

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
while the polish was still wet I peeled

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.399 
while the polish was still wet I peeled
off<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.939> latex<00:01:40.270> barrier<00:01:40.689> and<00:01:40.930> remove<00:01:41.320> the

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
off the latex barrier and remove the

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:51.640 
off the latex barrier and remove the
strapping<00:01:41.799> tear<00:01:41.979> with<00:01:42.130> some<00:01:42.280> tweezers

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.460 

I<00:01:52.420> then<00:01:53.420> left<00:01:53.630> my<00:01:53.720> nails<00:01:53.930> dry<00:01:54.170> for<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.440> few
