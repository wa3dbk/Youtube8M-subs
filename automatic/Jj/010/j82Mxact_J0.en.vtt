particular<00:00:39.379> does<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.739> trailer<00:00:41.219> reveal<00:00:41.940> what

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
particular does this trailer reveal what

particular does this trailer reveal what
could<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.440> birth<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.250> new<00:00:44.670> Sith<00:00:45.480> Empire

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.040 
could be the birth of a new Sith Empire
I<00:00:46.739> believe<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.520> does<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.760> here's<00:00:48.300> why<00:00:48.539> for

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
I believe it does and here's why for

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.240 
I believe it does and here's why for
this<00:00:49.140> shot<00:00:49.350> here<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.680> lot<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.920> people<00:00:50.160> are

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
this shot here a lot of people are

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.529 
this shot here a lot of people are
talking<00:00:50.579> about<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.910> symbol<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
talking about the symbol in the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.760 
talking about the symbol in the
background<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.289> bears<00:00:52.469> many

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
background that it bears many

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.400 
background that it bears many
similarities<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.789> old<00:00:53.840> Empire<00:00:54.840> symbol

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
similarities to the old Empire symbol

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.439 
similarities to the old Empire symbol
but<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.160> different<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> new

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
but it is different it's like a new

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.590 
but it is different it's like a new
proto<00:00:58.410> neo<00:00:58.920> kind<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.670> Empire<00:01:00.059> symbol

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
proto neo kind of Empire symbol

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.510 
proto neo kind of Empire symbol
distinctive<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.500> course<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> very<00:01:02.219> red

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
distinctive of course is the very red

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.670 
distinctive of course is the very red
background<00:01:03.120> which<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.480> course<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:04.170> very<00:01:04.530> much

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
background which of course is very much

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.950 
background which of course is very much
a<00:01:04.860> Sith<00:01:05.309> color<00:01:05.640> as<00:01:06.060> they<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> red

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
a Sith color as they all have the red

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.410 
a Sith color as they all have the red
lightsabers<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:08.070> red<00:01:08.340> aspect<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.939> also<00:01:09.210> seen

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
lightsabers that red aspect is also seen

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.480 
lightsabers that red aspect is also seen
in<00:01:09.450> some<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.960> TIE<00:01:10.170> fighters<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:11.070> well<00:01:11.310> as

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
in some of the TIE fighters as well as

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.120 
in some of the TIE fighters as well as
this<00:01:11.970> chrome<00:01:12.479> trooper<00:01:13.320> there<00:01:13.710> could<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:13.920> like

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
this chrome trooper there could be like

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.280 
this chrome trooper there could be like
a<00:01:14.159> new<00:01:14.460> bobba<00:01:14.850> fett<00:01:15.150> type<00:01:15.420> thing<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.080> this

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
a new bobba fett type thing so this

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.310 
a new bobba fett type thing so this
perhaps<00:01:16.560> could<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.460> some<00:01:18.200> faction<00:01:19.200> of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
perhaps could be like some faction of

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.410 
perhaps could be like some faction of
the<00:01:19.409> Old<00:01:19.920> Republic<00:01:20.070> which<00:01:20.880> has<00:01:21.060> now<00:01:21.210> been

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the Old Republic which has now been

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.620 
the Old Republic which has now been
reborn<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> form<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.549> very<00:01:24.060> sick

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
reborn in the form of a very sick

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.800 
reborn in the form of a very sick
focused<00:01:25.619> faction<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.909> think<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.360> because

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
focused faction and I think this because

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.859 
focused faction and I think this because
they're<00:01:28.200> clearly<00:01:28.530> led<00:01:29.159> by<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> sit<00:01:30.329> here<00:01:30.750> in

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
they're clearly led by a sit here in

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.240 
they're clearly led by a sit here in
this<00:01:30.990> scene<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.409> see<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.590> stormtroopers

this scene we see the stormtroopers

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.010 
this scene we see the stormtroopers
rounding<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.729> some<00:01:32.939> civilians<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.600> they're

rounding up some civilians and they're

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.580 
rounding up some civilians and they're
being<00:01:34.170> led<00:01:34.500> by<00:01:34.860> Andy<00:01:35.610> circuses<00:01:36.299> sis<00:01:37.049> villain

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
not only that we can actually see him in

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.690 
not only that we can actually see him in
the<00:01:40.170> background<00:01:40.400> standing<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> platform

above all of the troopers and I'm pretty
sure<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.549> him<00:01:44.850> because<00:01:45.240> when<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.479> crank

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
sure that is him because when you crank

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.600 
sure that is him because when you crank
up<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> brightness<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.680> see<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.340> shine

England that are filming it then it's
all<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.330> confirmed<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.289> these<00:02:10.590> two<00:02:10.950> are

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
the children of Han and Leia so they're

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.509 
the children of Han and Leia so they're
both<00:02:15.819> Skywalker's<00:02:16.689> and<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.290> dude<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:18.099> this

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
both Skywalker's and the dude is this

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.190 
both Skywalker's and the dude is this
guy<00:02:18.849> that<00:02:19.090> we<00:02:19.209> saw<00:02:19.359> in<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.569> last<00:02:19.689> trailer<00:02:20.049> with

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
guy that we saw in the last trailer with

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.050 
guy that we saw in the last trailer with
the<00:02:20.290> cross<00:02:20.530> guard<00:02:20.859> lightsaber<00:02:21.489> so<00:02:21.909> I<00:02:21.969> think

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
the cross guard lightsaber so I think

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.270 
the cross guard lightsaber so I think
what's<00:02:22.299> going<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:22.719> is<00:02:22.930> Andy<00:02:23.680> Serkis<00:02:23.980> as

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
what's going on is Andy Serkis as

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.069 
what's going on is Andy Serkis as

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
villain is trying to build a new Sith

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.500 
villain is trying to build a new Sith
Empire<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.829> he<00:02:27.040> wants<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.430> Skywalker<00:02:28.030> as<00:02:28.329> his

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
Empire and he wants a Skywalker as his

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.809 
Empire and he wants a Skywalker as his
apprentice<00:02:28.719> which<00:02:29.439> ends<00:02:29.769> up<00:02:29.859> being<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.579> dude

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
but also what's interesting is john

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.399 
but also what's interesting is john
boyega's<00:02:33.790> character<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.299> finn<00:02:34.629> in<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.170> shot

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409

have<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:38.049> lightsaber<00:02:38.409> on<00:02:38.829> him<00:02:39.099> you<00:02:39.489> can<00:02:39.670> see<00:02:39.879> it

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
have a lightsaber on him you can see it

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.640 
have a lightsaber on him you can see it
now<00:02:40.329> it<00:02:40.510> could<00:02:40.659> just<00:02:40.780> be<00:02:40.930> carrying<00:02:41.500> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
now it could just be carrying the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.319 
now it could just be carrying the
lightsaber<00:02:42.099> for<00:02:42.340> someone<00:02:42.670> else<00:02:42.849> but<00:02:43.060> if<00:02:43.180> he's

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
lightsaber for someone else but if he's

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.869 
lightsaber for someone else but if he's
not<00:02:43.599> that<00:02:44.019> means<00:02:44.230> he's<00:02:44.409> force<00:02:44.739> sensitive<00:02:45.430> it's

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
not that means he's force sensitive it's

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.399 
not that means he's force sensitive it's
interesting<00:02:46.269> that<00:02:46.629> he<00:02:46.689> was<00:02:46.900> then<00:02:47.049> recruited

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
interesting that he was then recruited

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.559 
interesting that he was then recruited
into<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:47.919> stormtroopers<00:02:48.760> then<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.329> could

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
into the stormtroopers then that could

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.170 
into the stormtroopers then that could
mean<00:02:49.870> that<00:02:50.169> Andy<00:02:50.680> Serkis<00:02:51.010> is<00:02:51.430> gathering

mentioned in previous videos that his

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.789 
mentioned in previous videos that his
villain<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.209> going<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.659> be<00:03:01.780> like<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.349> Darth

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
villain is going to be like a Darth

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.309 
villain is going to be like a Darth
Revan<00:03:03.129> type<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.269> character<00:03:04.780> in<00:03:05.019> case<00:03:05.200> you

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
Revan type of character in case you

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.959 
Revan type of character in case you
don't<00:03:05.500> know<00:03:05.590> Darth<00:03:05.859> Revan<00:03:05.980> was<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.489> character

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:06.969 
don't know Darth Revan was a character

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.059 
don't know Darth Revan was a character
who<00:03:07.269> could<00:03:07.510> use<00:03:07.750> both<00:03:08.109> the<00:03:08.349> light<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:08.799> the

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
who could use both the light and the

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.860 
who could use both the light and the
dark<00:03:09.280> side<00:03:09.549> of<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.790> force<00:03:09.819> and<00:03:10.269> mix<00:03:10.689> them

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
dark side of the force and mix them

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.750 
dark side of the force and mix them
together<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.739> think<00:03:11.799> Andy<00:03:12.219> Serkis<00:03:12.489> is

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
together and I think Andy Serkis is

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.309 
together and I think Andy Serkis is
doing<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.060> similar<00:03:13.209> thing<00:03:13.450> because<00:03:13.900> his<00:03:14.049> mask

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
doing a similar thing because his mask

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.589 
doing a similar thing because his mask
looks<00:03:14.829> exactly<00:03:15.159> like<00:03:15.400> Darth<00:03:15.790> Revan<00:03:15.909> here<00:03:16.389> and

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
looks exactly like Darth Revan here and

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.689 
looks exactly like Darth Revan here and
