00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
and his vision was that we bring that

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.140 
and his vision was that we bring that
together<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.520> would<00:02:10.640> be<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.819> focal

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
together and that would be the focal

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.690 
together and that would be the focal
point<00:02:11.390> in<00:02:11.510> our<00:02:11.660> kitchen<00:02:12.050> cool<00:02:12.590> right<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:13.310> was

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
point in our kitchen cool right so I was

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.000 
point in our kitchen cool right so I was
all<00:02:13.910> over<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.240> idea<00:02:14.360> immediately<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.470> did

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
all over the idea immediately I did

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.270 
all over the idea immediately I did
catch<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.490> vision<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.959> did<00:02:18.230> involve<00:02:18.770> some

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
catch the vision and it did involve some

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.070 
catch the vision and it did involve some
creative<00:02:19.730> thinking<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.420> we<00:02:20.540> actually<00:02:20.660> put<00:02:20.959> our

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
creative thinking so we actually put our

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.750 
creative thinking so we actually put our
heads<00:02:21.290> together<00:02:21.470> with<00:02:21.860> our<00:02:21.890> good<00:02:22.160> friend<00:02:22.430> Joan

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
our house and that's how we came up with

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.820 
our house and that's how we came up with
this<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:31.160> they<00:02:31.310> understand<00:02:31.760> what<00:02:32.239> this

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
this just they understand what this

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.830 
this just they understand what this
originally<00:02:33.830> was<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.370> was<00:02:34.610> all<00:02:34.819> that<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.810> UH

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
originally was it was all that the UH

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.890 
originally was it was all that the UH
the<00:02:36.350> niche<00:02:36.980> had<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.610> shape<00:02:37.970> but<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.630> was<00:02:38.750> all

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
the niche had this shape but it was all

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.400 
the niche had this shape but it was all
drywall<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:39.890> what<00:02:40.040> we<00:02:40.160> did<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:41.080> John<00:02:42.080> out<00:02:42.380> of

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
drywall so what we did is John out of

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.160 
drywall so what we did is John out of
this<00:02:42.650> wood<00:02:43.070> inside<00:02:43.820> here<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.420> then<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.900> the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
this wood inside here and then the the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.830 
this wood inside here and then the the
molding<00:02:45.680> around<00:02:45.800> it<00:02:46.130> which<00:02:46.250> was<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.840> bendable

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
molding around it which was a bendable

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.229 
molding around it which was a bendable
molding<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.590> then<00:02:49.160> this<00:02:49.550> is<00:02:49.610> kind<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.090> the

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
molding and then this is kind of the

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.830 
molding and then this is kind of the
unit<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:51.230> we<00:02:51.739> came<00:02:51.950> up<00:02:52.010> with<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.840> involving

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
unit that we came up with of involving

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.130 
unit that we came up with of involving
two<00:02:54.140> TVs<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:54.980> keep<00:02:55.910> in<00:02:56.060> mind<00:02:56.239> this<00:02:56.450> vision<00:02:56.930> and

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
two TVs and keep in mind this vision and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.750 
two TVs and keep in mind this vision and
David<00:02:57.560> sharing<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.890> idea<00:02:58.100> about<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.400> TVs

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
David sharing the idea about the TVs

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.750 
David sharing the idea about the TVs
they've<00:02:59.690> never<00:02:59.959> been<00:03:00.080> used<00:03:00.470> as<00:03:00.680> TVs<00:03:01.489> you

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
they've never been used as TVs you

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.420 
they've never been used as TVs you
certainly<00:03:02.090> could<00:03:02.480> but<00:03:03.350> we<00:03:03.680> purposely<00:03:04.160> wanted

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
certainly could but we purposely wanted

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.070 
certainly could but we purposely wanted
it<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.850> be<00:03:04.970> specifically<00:03:05.480> for<00:03:05.720> pictures<00:03:06.050> and

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
it to be specifically for pictures and

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.990 
it to be specifically for pictures and
that's<00:03:06.319> what<00:03:06.470> we've<00:03:06.620> used<00:03:06.830> it<00:03:07.040> for<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.519> rest

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
that's what we've used it for the rest

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000 
that's what we've used it for the rest
of<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.360> space<00:03:08.660> we<00:03:09.019> use<00:03:09.170> for<00:03:09.470> just<00:03:09.680> decorative

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
of the space we use for just decorative

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.330 
of the space we use for just decorative
stuff<00:03:10.340> it's<00:03:10.610> almost<00:03:10.940> always<00:03:11.209> seasonal<00:03:11.930> and

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
stuff it's almost always seasonal and

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.380 
stuff it's almost always seasonal and
the<00:03:13.340> one<00:03:13.489> thing<00:03:13.610> that<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.820> wanted<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.239> be<00:03:14.299> sure

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
the one thing that I wanted to be sure

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.970 
the one thing that I wanted to be sure
that<00:03:14.570> we<00:03:14.720> did<00:03:14.959> was<00:03:15.110> make<00:03:15.350> sure<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.620> the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
that we did was make sure that the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.789 
that we did was make sure that the
bottom<00:03:16.850> edge<00:03:17.060> is<00:03:17.390> this<00:03:17.810> darker<00:03:18.320> but<00:03:18.500> not

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
bottom edge is this darker but not

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.500 
bottom edge is this darker but not
necessarily<00:03:19.280> white<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:19.790> that<00:03:19.940> makes<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.360> a

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
necessarily white and that makes it a

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.990 
necessarily white and that makes it a
little<00:03:20.660> bit<00:03:20.810> more<00:03:20.959> interesting<00:03:21.820> so<00:03:22.820> let's

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
little bit more interesting so let's

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.360 
little bit more interesting so let's
talk<00:03:23.120> about<00:03:23.269> this<00:03:23.660> is<00:03:23.810> how<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.049> works<00:03:24.370> this

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
talk about this is how it works this

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.630 
talk about this is how it works this
actually<00:03:25.610> opens<00:03:26.180> up<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:26.630> this<00:03:27.560> is<00:03:27.739> one<00:03:28.280> door

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
actually opens up and this is one door

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.810 
actually opens up and this is one door
and<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:30.410> is<00:03:30.650> just<00:03:30.890> kind<00:03:31.040> of<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.310> mess<00:03:31.549> back

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
and this is just kind of the mess back

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.750 
and this is just kind of the mess back
here<00:03:31.880> with<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.239> couple<00:03:32.450> of<00:03:32.690> wires<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:34.610> can

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
here with a couple of wires and you can

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.949 
here with a couple of wires and you can
see<00:03:34.970> where<00:03:35.209> we<00:03:35.450> didn't<00:03:35.660> even<00:03:35.720> bother

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
see where we didn't even bother

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.960 
see where we didn't even bother
finishing<00:03:36.560> painting<00:03:37.310> that<00:03:37.579> although<00:03:37.880> in

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
finishing painting that although in

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.610 
finishing painting that although in
retrospect<00:03:38.209> I<00:03:38.510> wish<00:03:38.630> we<00:03:38.780> kind<00:03:38.959> of<00:03:38.989> did<00:03:39.170> but

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
retrospect I wish we kind of did but

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.830 
retrospect I wish we kind of did but
no<00:03:39.769> big<00:03:39.950> deal<00:03:40.069> so<00:03:40.730> you<00:03:40.790> can<00:03:41.030> see<00:03:41.239> how<00:03:41.480> John

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
no big deal so you can see how John

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.970 
no big deal so you can see how John
built<00:03:42.349> this<00:03:42.530> out<00:03:42.739> so<00:03:43.099> there's<00:03:43.310> def<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:44.980> and

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
built this out so there's def and and

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.979 
built this out so there's def and and
there's<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:46.430> know<00:03:46.489> top<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.330> base<00:03:47.569> and

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
there's you know top and the base and

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.199 
there's you know top and the base and
then<00:03:48.739> this<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.280> know<00:03:49.400> kind<00:03:49.670> of<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:50.060> goes

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
then this you know kind of the goes

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.699 
then this you know kind of the goes
through<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.540> middle<00:03:50.810> but<00:03:51.080> if<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:51.349> look<00:03:51.500> right

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
through the middle but if you look right

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.160 
through the middle but if you look right
here<00:03:51.769> on<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.459> actual<00:03:52.790> door<00:03:53.150> these<00:03:53.870> wood
