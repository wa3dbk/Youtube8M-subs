00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello all right come on 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.240
 Now we're going to make a video about a 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.920
 from eyes to locations to settings 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.179
 cleaning and experimentation 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.590
 first you go there in the bar 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.560
 search and write the word 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.480
 cleaning and applications will not appear 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.890
 nothing but settings appeared 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.439
 four items 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.800
 the item that we first will use 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.149
 going to be there to free up disk space 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.489
 chosen unnecessary challenge 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:43.590
 then it makes analysis challenges can be 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:47.070
 eliminated and will give us the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.520
 a good observation is that you mark and 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:56.719
 all options and also click on 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:01.309
 The system park will re-analyze 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.309
 check the files to be deleted 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:21.569
 well it turned out that here from my space 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.960
 obtained is being small because I already 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:29.369
 I made this command for the video to be short 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.259
 then but possibly these commands 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.179
 should be delayed 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.990
 in case the user has never done 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:42.689
 minutes until now and this cleaning is 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.869
 when it is finished it closes the file 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.509
 Let's go back to the tab searched in 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.610
 windows and now they will write again 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.610
 the word cleaning 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.890
 we will set again and only 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:04.439
 we'll tell you what to do later 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:09.149
 to command defragment and optimize 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.310
 your units and a screen will appear that 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.610
 was formerly called defragmenting 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.840
 the disc in now in optimizing the humidity to 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.440
 same function 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.079
 one thing is the information that says it 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.400
 is done automatically week 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:32.280
 but in case the whole house well its system 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:37.139
 very unorganized is at risk 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:43.049
 because excess data when winning clean 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:48.720
 there was too much of open programs 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:50.880
 at the same time and will not make it to aa 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.090
 own optimization 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.319
 so I advise the end user that 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.250
 do it at least 15 days 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:08.669
 take 11 hours to use the computer 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:13.010
 to do what the results will be well 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:17.459
 comes into account the performance may 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:22.799
 back to the first days the kiss 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:24.530
 of use of your brand and have people who 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.300
 they say that 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.080
 overstay are bad people 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.990
 informed that what damages hd 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.560
 the correct hard disk sun 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.350
 if it is it would be the fragmentation of the data 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.170
 inside it because it was 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:48.620
 dropped data at various points 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:52.040
 this would make the needle hd and have the 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.950
 appearance of a pun 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.989
 only that instead of being a country it's a record 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.000
 who is older should know 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.070
 it looks like a cd 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.390
 it has a magnetic needle that 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.070
 gravity 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:11.560
 within the unit then when the person 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:15.769
 do not optimizes the term currently used 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:20.660
 hd it tends to record data from a 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:23.900
 program at various points of its own is the 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.150
 Magnesium surface and wrong data 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.790
 in the act of recording in 1 points 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.740
 different and not reading act 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.729
 this will greatly increase the movement 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.960
 of the needles and that this reduces to life 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.210
 Helpful from the hillside 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:44.090
 so use it there has to be a use 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.669
 consciousness and at times correct type 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.580
 15 fifteen days a week depending on 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.669
 very continuous use of the computer 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.880
 other thing that the person the user should 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:58.610
 observe is to check the type 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.570
 in the bar and near the clock also 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:06.530
 here's a drawing loudspeakers thing 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:09.860
 do you check how many programs are 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.150
 running and knowing if this program can 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.190
 be closed 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.410
 in case here as I have 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.390
 tendency to always keep the machine 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.810
 thing does not have a destination the program 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.820
 running in conjunction with the windows more 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.550
 some computers 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.830
 it comes with several programs running right 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:32.900
 It is interesting that in the act of your 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:38.500
 pedro and says they ooo fragmentation 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:40.490
 user authenticate the programs so that in 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.030
 your body 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:48.310
 as you may have seen there when I 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:51.200
 bar the computer a stop right 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.720
 so you increase the shelf life 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:59.570
 performance of your machine. 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:02.110
 computer and prevents data loss 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.540
 these situations 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.060
 then a case here one and it has already been 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:13.600
 frequented it will go through an area 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:17.240
 of 10 step and makes several commands 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.890
 me and you usually have to first 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.680
 always do the first drive will be 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:25.630
 units and where the data is contained 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.630
 of the own windows system folder 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:33.700
 there are people who use the 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.700
 but you pass from the province 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:43.580
 It's the way it is and nobody gets it. 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:48.020
 make the best foot for a good and a bench 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:51.520
 the bank's manufacturer then understood these 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:55.910
 programs can see each other and if so 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.670
 flawed the looks of many law or 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.920
 those who find this use some 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:05.540
 programs that actually rather than 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:09.140
 organize all the data of the unit and 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.790
 organize the execution unit then give 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.550
 this impression that the computer is 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.190
 faster by passing a program in the 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.580
 reality the program only macchio the thing 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:22.550
 and when he will see him lose to and 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:26.600
 worse than a hd is losing the data 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:29.840
 contents of having here the 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:36.370
 preserving the system can also be used 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:40.010
 a small folder and remembering doubts 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.420
 www.g1 som matos when you were about to 

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.380
 with br br 

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.380
 a hug
