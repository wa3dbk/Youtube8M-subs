about<00:00:07.740> posting<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.790> so<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.510> figured<00:00:09.900> uh<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.290> know

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
about posting it so I figured uh I know

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.379 
about posting it so I figured uh I know
one<00:00:10.740> guy<00:00:10.889> asked<00:00:11.340> me<00:00:11.460> if<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.759> could<00:00:11.910> show<00:00:12.150> some

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
one guy asked me if I could show some

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.650 
one guy asked me if I could show some
basic<00:00:12.929> stuff<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.849> one<00:00:14.849> thing<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.299> just

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
basic stuff and one thing is just

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.720 
basic stuff and one thing is just
cleaning<00:00:16.080> morels<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.800> how<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.070> prepare<00:00:17.609> them

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
cleaning morels and how I prepare them

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.450 
cleaning morels and how I prepare them
so<00:00:18.060> that's<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.199> take<00:00:19.890> my<00:00:19.949> morels

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
so that's what this is I take my morels

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.109 
so that's what this is I take my morels
and<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.359> slice<00:00:21.720> them<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.020> half<00:00:22.490> lengthwise<00:00:23.490> and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
and I slice them in half lengthwise and

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.210 
and I slice them in half lengthwise and
then<00:00:26.359> the<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.660> rule<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.289> never<00:00:28.769> wash<00:00:29.189> a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
then the the rule is you never wash a

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.370 
then the the rule is you never wash a
mushroom<00:00:30.000> but<00:00:30.449> when<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.689> comes<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.050> morels

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
mushroom but when it comes to morels

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.500 
mushroom but when it comes to morels
there's<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.949> many<00:00:32.040> pits<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:33.270> only<00:00:33.360> way

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
there's so many pits that the only way

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.000 
there's so many pits that the only way
you're<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.780> get<00:00:33.960> them<00:00:34.050> clean<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.680> by

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
you're going to get them clean is by

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.729 
you're going to get them clean is by
washing<00:00:35.250> them<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.780> will<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.320> take<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
washing them and I will just take the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.690 
washing them and I will just take the
half's<00:00:38.629> fill<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.809> with<00:00:39.989> water<00:00:40.550> rinse<00:00:41.550> them

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
half's fill this with water rinse them

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400 
half's fill this with water rinse them
off<00:00:41.790> real<00:00:42.090> good<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.510> then<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.840> keep<00:00:43.020> rinsing

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
off real good and then just keep rinsing

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.770 
off real good and then just keep rinsing
and<00:00:43.680> changing<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> water<00:00:44.460> until<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.450> think

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
and changing the water until I think

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810 
and changing the water until I think
they're<00:00:45.960> clean<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.710> lot<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.309> times<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:47.640> get<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
they're clean a lot of times they get a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.150 
they're clean a lot of times they get a
lot<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.090> sand<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.510> them<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.719> stuff<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:50.010> uh

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
lot of sand in them and stuff so it's uh

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.740 
lot of sand in them and stuff so it's uh
it's<00:00:50.730> something<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.090> don't<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.719> I

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
it's something I don't like to do I

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.150 
it's something I don't like to do I
don't<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.110> washing<00:00:52.559> them<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.010> does

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
don't like washing them because it does

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.740 
don't like washing them because it does
take<00:00:53.370> some<00:00:53.430> flavor<00:00:53.879> out<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.480> kind<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
take some flavor out but you kind of

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.400 
take some flavor out but you kind of
have<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
have to

some<00:01:46.290> lightly<00:01:46.770> breaded<00:01:47.159> morels<00:01:48.049> that<00:01:49.049> are

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
some lightly breaded morels that are

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.510 
some lightly breaded morels that are
ready<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.979> fried<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.460> butter

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
ready to be fried in butter

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.520 
ready to be fried in butter
usually<00:01:53.520> butter<00:01:53.790> butter<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.420> garlic<00:01:54.570> or

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
usually butter butter and garlic or

usually butter butter and garlic or
olive<00:01:56.009> oil<00:01:56.810> or<00:01:57.810> canola<00:01:57.960> oil<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.829> we'll<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.189> is

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
olive oil or canola oil what we'll do is

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.330 
olive oil or canola oil what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:59.579> uh<00:01:59.750> well<00:02:00.750> sometimes<00:02:01.170> do<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.560> 5050

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
we'll uh well sometimes do like 5050

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.410 
we'll uh well sometimes do like 5050
butter<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.850> canola<00:02:03.270> oil<00:02:04.399> because<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:06.090> canola

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
butter and canola oil because the canola

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.040 
butter and canola oil because the canola
oil<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:07.610> less<00:02:08.610> likely<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.060> burn

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
oil is less likely to burn

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.530 
oil is less likely to burn
then<00:02:10.770> olive<00:02:11.190> oil<00:02:11.520> or<00:02:12.060> butter<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:14.270> also<00:02:15.270> it's<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
then olive oil or butter and also it's a

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.910 
then olive oil or butter and also it's a
little<00:02:15.780> bit<00:02:15.900> healthier<00:02:16.110> for<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.710> than<00:02:16.890> just

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
little bit healthier for you than just

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.230 
little bit healthier for you than just
