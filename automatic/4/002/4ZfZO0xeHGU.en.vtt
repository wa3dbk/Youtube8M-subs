actually looks really really similar to

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.820 
actually looks really really similar to
the<00:02:34.980> outfit<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.520> he<00:02:35.610> had<00:02:35.880> on<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.620> show<00:02:37.620> when

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
he was on the island now obviously it's

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.180 
he was on the island now obviously it's
not<00:02:39.840> gonna<00:02:39.960> be<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.110> hundred<00:02:40.290> percent<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.950> as

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
not gonna be a hundred percent so as

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.040 
not gonna be a hundred percent so as
always<00:02:41.760> with<00:02:42.120> these<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.510> know<00:02:42.600> it's<00:02:42.780> just<00:02:42.930> the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
always with these you know it's just the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.750 
always with these you know it's just the
outfit<00:02:43.350> I'm<00:02:43.470> not<00:02:43.590> trying<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.010> make<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.340> exact

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
outfit I'm not trying to make the exact

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.760 
outfit I'm not trying to make the exact
character<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:45.900> if<00:02:46.020> like<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.320> face<00:02:46.560> and

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
character so if like the face and

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.370 
character so if like the face and
everything<00:02:46.860> doesn't<00:02:47.400> look<00:02:47.520> 100%<00:02:48.020> it's<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.170> game

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
everything doesn't look 100% it's a game

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.230 
everything doesn't look 100% it's a game
and<00:02:49.740> obviously<00:02:50.130> we<00:02:50.340> can't<00:02:50.550> do<00:02:50.670> too<00:02:50.820> much<00:02:50.850> about

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
and obviously we can't do too much about

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.420 
and obviously we can't do too much about
that<00:02:51.450> but<00:02:52.140> it's<00:02:52.290> still<00:02:52.500> nonetheless<00:02:52.770> I<00:02:53.160> think

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
that but it's still nonetheless I think

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.860 
that but it's still nonetheless I think
is<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.610> great<00:02:53.820> outfit<00:02:54.090> especially<00:02:54.450> if<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.600> do

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
is a great outfit especially if you do

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.780 
is a great outfit especially if you do
love<00:02:55.110> those<00:02:55.380> shows<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.010> our<00:02:56.070> fan<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.520> them<00:02:56.610> and

the<00:05:22.110> blood<00:05:22.590> tears<00:05:23.069> and<00:05:23.340> I<00:05:23.400> make<00:05:23.849> up<00:05:24.060> the
