00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
opinion is really how they work the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.990 
opinion is really how they work the
gloss<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> mat<00:00:43.620> together<00:00:44.010> up<00:00:44.550> above<00:00:44.879> the

gloss with the mat together up above the
fold<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.450> you're<00:00:45.539> gonna<00:00:45.660> see<00:00:45.840> all<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.050> our

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
fold here you're gonna see all of our

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.319 
fold here you're gonna see all of our
carbon<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.640> matted<00:00:47.879> out<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
carbon is going to be matted out and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.240 
carbon is going to be matted out and
then<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.870> get<00:00:48.989> into<00:00:49.200> these<00:00:49.289> gloss<00:00:49.590> areas<00:00:49.980> with

then you get into these gloss areas with

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.799 
then you get into these gloss areas with
the<00:00:50.370> stripe<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.210> some<00:00:51.390> carbon<00:00:51.719> that

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the stripe and you see some carbon that

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.389 
the stripe and you see some carbon that
still<00:00:52.050> has<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.379> gloss<00:00:52.710> coating<00:00:53.100> at<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
out of bounds with a fast graphic but

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.740 
out of bounds with a fast graphic but
it's<00:00:59.309> unique<00:00:59.489> enough<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.239> set<00:01:00.480> itself

really quickly here in the back also see
how<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.660> carbon<00:02:23.990> fiber<00:02:24.170> pops<00:02:24.500> when<00:02:24.740> you<00:02:24.830> put

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
how that carbon fiber pops when you put

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.230 
how that carbon fiber pops when you put
the<00:02:25.070> gloss<00:02:25.250> coating<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.000> can<00:02:26.030> get

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
the gloss coating on it so you can get
