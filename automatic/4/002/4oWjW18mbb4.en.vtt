00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.550 
they are really hard to get on to this
so<00:02:18.580> if<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.880> have<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.300> one<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:20.650> ski<00:02:21.130> mask

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
so if you have this one this ski mask

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.350 
so if you have this one this ski mask
this<00:02:23.560> one<00:02:23.830> would<00:02:23.890> work<00:02:24.040> too<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:27.430> yeah<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.000> then

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
this one would work too so yeah and then

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.350 
this one would work too so yeah and then
you<00:02:28.390> can<00:02:28.570> put<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.840> goggle<00:02:29.230> covers<00:02:29.820> like<00:02:30.820> CNN<00:02:31.210> I

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
you can put the goggle covers like CNN I

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.730 
you can put the goggle covers like CNN I
try<00:02:31.540> putting<00:02:31.810> them<00:02:31.900> on<00:02:31.990> but<00:02:32.230> they<00:02:32.350> just<00:02:32.500> like

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
try putting them on but they just like

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.710 
try putting them on but they just like
slide<00:02:33.070> off<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.520> if<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:33.850> have<00:02:34.060> this<00:02:34.330> one<00:02:34.570> yet

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
slide off so if you have this one yet

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.650 
slide off so if you have this one yet
looks<00:02:34.930> better<00:02:35.170> too<00:02:35.380> i'll<00:02:35.470> show<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.710> both<00:02:36.190> ways

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
looks better too i'll show you both ways

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:47.100 
looks better too i'll show you both ways
then<00:02:37.660> put<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:39.090> things<00:02:40.090> on<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:46.600> that's<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> way

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
then put the things on so that's the way

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.670 
then put the things on so that's the way
you<00:02:47.410> will<00:02:47.560> look<00:02:48.000> with<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.209> one<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:49.870> you

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
you will look with that one on so you

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.050 
you will look with that one on so you
could<00:02:50.800> kind<00:02:51.070> of<00:02:51.190> tell<00:02:51.250> which<00:02:51.520> one<00:02:51.940> looks

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
could kind of tell which one looks

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.520 
could kind of tell which one looks
better<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.750> I'll<00:02:52.840> just<00:02:52.900> put<00:02:53.140> this<00:02:53.260> one<00:02:53.500> on

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
better so I'll just put this one on

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.979 
better so I'll just put this one on
since<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:53.950> one<00:02:54.160> will<00:02:54.310> be<00:02:54.340> more<00:02:54.840> easier<00:02:55.840> to

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
since that one will be more easier to

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.890 
since that one will be more easier to
get<00:02:56.140> in<00:02:56.350> one<00:02:56.800> up<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:58.060> then<00:02:58.300> for<00:02:58.480> his<00:02:58.570> weapon

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
get in one up and then for his weapon

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.540 
get in one up and then for his weapon
you<00:02:58.989> could<00:02:59.140> just<00:02:59.260> use<00:02:59.500> any<00:02:59.709> sniper<00:03:00.070> rifle<00:03:00.430> you

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
you could just use any sniper rifle you

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.770 
you could just use any sniper rifle you
have<00:03:00.730> i'm<00:03:00.910> using<00:03:01.270> this<00:03:01.450> one<00:03:02.380> right<00:03:02.530> here<00:03:03.780> so

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
have i'm using this one right here so

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.060 
have i'm using this one right here so
then<00:03:04.930> that<00:03:05.110> when<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.350> can<00:03:05.470> just<00:03:05.530> clip<00:03:05.860> right

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
then that when you can just clip right

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.040 
then that when you can just clip right
there<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.580> if<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.180> guys<00:03:07.330> want<00:03:07.540> me<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.690> do<00:03:07.810> any
