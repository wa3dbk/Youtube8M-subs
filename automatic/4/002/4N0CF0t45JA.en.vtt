00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
grow that plan it was just there so it's

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.509 
grow that plan it was just there so it's
a<00:03:43.480> zero-carbon<00:03:43.959> footprint<00:03:44.650> way<00:03:44.889> of<00:03:45.190> eating

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
a zero-carbon footprint way of eating

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.689 
a zero-carbon footprint way of eating
this<00:03:45.849> foraging<00:03:46.389> thing<00:03:46.659> it's<00:03:47.260> free<00:03:47.590> food<00:03:47.829> not

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
this foraging thing it's free food not

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.059 
this foraging thing it's free food not
to<00:03:48.879> mention<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.359> it's<00:03:49.569> mostly<00:03:50.069> superior

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
to mention that it's mostly superior

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.399 
to mention that it's mostly superior
nutrition<00:03:51.280> so<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.359> cultivated<00:03:52.930> vegetables

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
nutrition so the cultivated vegetables

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.479 
nutrition so the cultivated vegetables
don't<00:03:53.560> even<00:03:53.859> compare<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:55.680> these<00:03:56.680> wild<00:03:57.069> plants

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
don't even compare to these wild plants

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.909 
don't even compare to these wild plants
