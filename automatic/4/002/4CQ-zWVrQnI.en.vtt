00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.760
 Y 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.779
 now 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.750
 once an idea I liked it was like that 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.120
 get to see it makes you want to hit with 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.460
 she borders the universe paints the 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.800
 stars I will lose myself with rhythms with the 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.980
 gang cheer the most the just 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.500
 the micros brothers union of different 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.980
 roads to him I'll go and in this 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.200
 empty glass hip hop not strong one my life 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.020
 there is lost because there was never 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.660
 looked for a sums of seconds molding 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.119
 between hovering around the world fighting with 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.250
 a present from before vagabonds 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.650
 dodging while they do not feel that 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.170
 they win in life I have it in front of me 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.830
 behind a boat to follow with the current 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:22.210
 and keep touching a soul 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.479
 music and music 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.760
 today I am the same as always who has 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.800
 touched the bottom sail against the current 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.600
 but here I remain firm with the 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.450
 also what is born to be fucking 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.950
 I no matter what makes me consider myself a 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.070
 word in a living saying with 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.180
 improvisation because I never got something 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.130
 learned from time 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.740
 that's not the same to hear rap 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.450
 so that you listen to them and that this is love 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.610
 not because I want to see them if it's not 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.250
 same to love and to love already said it advice 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.530
 it took my life totally the time 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.990
 I just take it big wallet only 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.850
 it was horrifying that it is as robust as the 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.369
 victim's body in your pocket there's no 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.410
 a weight only in my words I 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.630
 I would like to take life more pleasant where 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.060
 do not shoot weapons better shoot being 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.789
 dams a time sir consider me 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.250
 macula many stories marijuana me alone 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.440
 for a line always sincere in what my 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.390
 hand writes I only do what is necessary 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.870
 where the heart asks me 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.840
 Well, what the heart asks, not what 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.090
 my heart give me one day today 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.459
 different 3 and rumble that we play the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.970
 valve of your heart to be 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.459
 conscious lose the reason although dry 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.980
 the melody do varnish neurons gives me 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.440
 deep pleasure it seems to me when he 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.930
 I was 16 annoyed the hormone I have 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.970
 anxiety of being able to show you ma'am 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.190
 vanity that what matters is the are very 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.120
 slow between the days of its quality we are 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.480
 three 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.930
 the ones that are of the caliber of the most 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.269
 very high level neglect we know where 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.610
 come we leave tears and sweat in 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.250
 alleys in suburbs that they gave us 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.799
 battle but never show the flag 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.810
 white look do not feel listen to us 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.569
 Catalans inside you that we gave you 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.970
 a sense of faith in your ear when you introduce yourself 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.760
 our sonar rhythm doctoroff 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.470
 unique clinical catatonic sense of 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.470
 this our lyrical alphabet 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.140
 Real h I am sects and that house 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.140
