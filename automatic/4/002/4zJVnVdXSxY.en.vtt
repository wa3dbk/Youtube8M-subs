way to turn but if I turn my body is
some<00:02:08.009> power<00:02:08.369> comes<00:02:08.819> out<00:02:10.459> but<00:02:11.459> by<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.090> time<00:02:12.450> we

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
some power comes out but by the time we

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.780 
this by the time it goes up here look we
inhale<00:03:45.359> like<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.139> priest<00:03:46.859> under<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.549> elbow

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
the same thing with like the stocking -

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.670 
the same thing with like the stocking -
in<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:53.099> middle<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.609> her<00:03:53.849> body<00:03:54.319> that<00:03:55.319> all

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
in the middle of her body that all

direction treasure

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.220 
direction treasure
Sammy<00:03:58.049> into<00:03:58.409> me<00:03:58.639> then<00:03:59.639> go<00:04:00.060> out<00:04:00.829> so<00:04:01.829> that<00:04:02.069> energy

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
Sammy into me then go out so that energy

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.860 
Sammy into me then go out so that energy
and<00:04:04.230> go<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.560> save<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.879> mom<00:04:06.150> now<00:04:06.450> all<00:04:06.689> the

and go to save the mom now all the
direction<00:04:07.379> but<00:04:07.889> that's<00:04:08.129> called<00:04:08.599> eight<00:04:09.599> energy

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
direction but that's called eight energy

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:24.290 
direction but that's called eight energy
clean<00:04:13.049> energy<00:04:13.109> of<00:04:14.069> fire<00:04:14.780> direction<00:04:23.300> someone

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
clean energy of fire direction someone

00:04:24.300 --> 00:05:14.290 
clean energy of fire direction someone
practice<00:04:25.020> this

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.520 

when<00:05:15.300> you<00:05:15.389> turn<00:05:15.810> all<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.290> way<00:05:16.320> through<00:05:16.620> here's

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
when you turn all the way through here's

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:31.850 
when you turn all the way through here's
the<00:05:19.530> Lord<00:05:20.030> turn<00:05:21.030> first<00:05:23.060> turn<00:05:24.060> here<00:05:30.139> just<00:05:31.139> by

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
the Lord turn first turn here just by

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.909 
the Lord turn first turn here just by
the<00:05:32.010> time<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.460> respond<00:05:33.030> if<00:05:34.020> an<00:05:34.169> engine<00:05:34.500> is<00:05:34.710> to

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
the time to respond if an engine is to

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.469 
the time to respond if an engine is to
care<00:05:35.220> of<00:05:35.550> old<00:05:36.110> expansions<00:05:37.110> for<00:05:37.200> Agnes<00:05:38.039> Molina

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
care of old expansions for Agnes Molina

00:05:38.479 --> 00:06:01.070 
care of old expansions for Agnes Molina
yeah<00:05:56.960> that's<00:05:57.960> how<00:05:58.349> this<00:05:58.650> move<00:05:59.099> should<00:05:59.789> be<00:06:00.080> for

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
yeah that's how this move should be for

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.160 
yeah that's how this move should be for
x-ray<00:06:01.650> for<00:06:01.950> every<00:06:03.169> every<00:06:04.169> branch<00:06:04.680> of<00:06:04.889> thing
