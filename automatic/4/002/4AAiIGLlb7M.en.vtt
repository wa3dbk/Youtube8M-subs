also<00:03:55.849> the<00:03:56.849> presser<00:03:57.120> foot<00:03:57.269> should<00:03:57.689> be<00:03:57.840> in<00:03:57.930> the

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
also the presser foot should be in the

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.619 
also the presser foot should be in the
up<00:03:58.200> position<00:03:58.549> okay<00:03:59.579> always<00:04:00.090> do<00:04:00.269> that<00:04:00.420> before

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
up position okay always do that before

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.009 
up position okay always do that before
you<00:04:00.750> start<00:04:00.840> like<00:04:01.769> if<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.040> could<00:04:02.220> have<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:03.019> we

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
you start like if you could have it we

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.449 
you start like if you could have it we
have<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.439> throw<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.709> wrapped<00:04:04.980> around<00:04:05.159> the

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
have to throw it wrapped around the

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.940 
have to throw it wrapped around the
attention<00:04:05.819> assembly<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:07.079> next<00:04:07.349> step<00:04:07.530> is<00:04:07.709> to

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
attention assembly the next step is to

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:16.189 
attention assembly the next step is to
throw<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.280> through<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:09.390> ticket<00:04:09.780> lever<00:04:15.199> cut

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
throw it through the ticket lever cut

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:25.279 
throw it through the ticket lever cut
from<00:04:16.650> here<00:04:16.949> down<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:20.459> then<00:04:20.729> you<00:04:20.880> see<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:25.110> hook

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
from here down and then you see the hook

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.510 
from here down and then you see the hook
right<00:04:25.560> there<00:04:26.180> can<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:27.210> hook<00:04:27.510> it<00:04:27.690> in<00:04:28.250> okay<00:04:29.250> and

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
right there can you hook it in okay and

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.890 
right there can you hook it in okay and
then<00:04:29.669> you<00:04:29.789> have<00:04:29.820> one<00:04:30.240> more<00:04:30.590> just<00:04:31.590> clip<00:04:32.280> right

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
then you have one more just clip right

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.219 
then you have one more just clip right
here<00:04:35.449> and<00:04:36.449> then<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:36.780> thread<00:04:37.050> your<00:04:37.080> needle

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
here and then you thread your needle

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.490 
here and then you thread your needle
from<00:04:37.710> front<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.490> back<00:04:38.900> now<00:04:39.900> you<00:04:39.960> have<00:04:40.229> thread

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
from front to back now you have thread

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.350 
from front to back now you have thread
is<00:04:40.710> your<00:04:40.919> solution<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:41.820> have<00:04:41.970> to<00:04:42.120> wind

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
is your solution and you have to wind

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.270 
is your solution and you have to wind
the<00:04:42.510> bobbin<00:04:42.539> it's<00:04:43.289> time<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.770> put<00:04:43.979> the<00:04:44.100> bobbin

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
the bobbin it's time to put the bobbin

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.300 
the bobbin it's time to put the bobbin
into<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.880> bobbin<00:04:45.270> case<00:04:47.960> okay<00:04:49.100> there's<00:04:50.100> your

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
into the bobbin case okay there's your

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.340 
into the bobbin case okay there's your
bobbin<00:04:51.169> oops

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
bobbin oops

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
bobbin oops
you<00:04:53.130> drop<00:04:53.430> it<00:04:53.610> in<00:04:53.760> there<00:04:54.710> see<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.830> little<00:04:56.160> slot

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
you drop it in there see the little slot

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.900 
you drop it in there see the little slot
right<00:04:56.400> there

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
right there

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.140 
right there
you<00:04:57.449> bring<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.840> thread<00:04:58.080> through<00:04:58.699> and<00:04:59.699> this

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
you bring the thread through and this

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.430 
you bring the thread through and this
way<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:01.020> let<00:05:01.889> the<00:05:02.039> thread<00:05:02.370> hang<00:05:03.020> on<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.289> other

bobbin thread and now the bobbin thread
is<00:05:41.410> up<00:05:44.280> you<00:05:45.280> don't<00:05:45.400> have<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.670> do<00:05:45.940> this<00:05:46.090> we'll

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
is up you don't have to do this we'll

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.420 
is up you don't have to do this we'll
just<00:05:46.510> slide<00:05:46.690> plates<00:05:47.080> open<00:05:47.530> the<00:05:47.950> reason<00:05:48.280> I'm

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
just slide plates open the reason I'm

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.310 
just slide plates open the reason I'm
doing<00:05:48.640> this<00:05:48.790> all<00:05:49.000> you<00:05:49.210> can<00:05:49.390> see<00:05:49.630> exactly<00:05:49.990> what

doing this all you can see exactly what

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.220 
doing this all you can see exactly what
happens<00:05:51.240> okay<00:05:52.240> close<00:05:52.720> the<00:05:52.870> back<00:05:54.840> and<00:05:55.840> now<00:05:56.020> your

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
happens okay close the back and now your

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.340 
happens okay close the back and now your
machine<00:05:56.560> is<00:05:56.710> ready<00:05:56.980> now<00:05:57.840> that<00:05:58.840> we're<00:05:58.990> machine

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
machine is ready now that we're machine

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.700 
machine is ready now that we're machine
is<00:05:59.500> rather<00:05:59.710> simple<00:06:00.070> it<00:06:00.520> has<00:06:01.140> the<00:06:02.140> stitch<00:06:02.410> width

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
is rather simple it has the stitch width

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.280 
is rather simple it has the stitch width
selector<00:06:03.580> and<00:06:03.790> then<00:06:04.330> needle<00:06:04.720> position

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
selector and then needle position

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.550 
selector and then needle position
selector<00:06:05.770> and<00:06:06.390> also<00:06:07.390> depart<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:08.170> pattern

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
selector and also depart the pattern

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.070 
selector and also depart the pattern
selector<00:06:09.040> and<00:06:09.490> of<00:06:09.820> course<00:06:10.150> you<00:06:10.750> have<00:06:10.900> the
