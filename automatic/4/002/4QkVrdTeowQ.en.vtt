playing over there I mean it was just uh

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.890 
playing over there I mean it was just uh
a<00:00:19.170> little<00:00:19.619> smaller<00:00:20.310> ice<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.699> mean<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:20.970> had<00:00:21.119> to

a little smaller ice I mean you had to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.300 
a little smaller ice I mean you had to
create<00:00:22.080> space<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.710> yourself<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:23.220> different

I mean for me I think there was no
difference<00:00:39.120> from<00:00:39.210> back<00:00:39.420> home<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.690> mean<00:00:40.079> of

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
difference from back home I mean of

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.940

course<00:00:41.270> I<00:00:42.270> mean<00:00:42.899> people<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> think<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> game

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
course I mean people I think the game

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.380 
course I mean people I think the game
over<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.340> more<00:00:44.489> physical<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> mean

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
over here is more physical but I mean

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.350 
over here is more physical but I mean
sometimes<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> case<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.000> think

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
sometimes it's not the case but I think

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.529 
sometimes it's not the case but I think
it<00:00:48.690> was<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:49.289> right<00:00:49.879> Victor<00:00:50.879> love<00:00:51.149> over<00:00:51.390> there

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.819 
of ourselves Lou you know we're always
on<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> ice<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> gym<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.770> think

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
on the ice and in a gym so I think

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:35.990 
on the ice and in a gym so I think
that's<00:01:35.159> something<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.700> they<00:01:35.790> don't<00:01:35.850> really

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that's something that they don't really

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.109 
that's something that they don't really
have<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.360> tell<00:01:37.259> us

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
have to tell us

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.010 
have to tell us
obviously<00:01:39.119> bucked<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.570> bit<00:01:39.720> over<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
obviously bucked up a bit over the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.109 
obviously bucked up a bit over the
course<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> season<00:01:40.710> do<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
course of the season do you think that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.490 
course of the season do you think that

particular<00:01:50.189> thing<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:50.759> gonna<00:01:50.850> be

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
particular thing it's gonna be

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.060 
particular thing it's gonna be
everything<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.020> mean<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.320> become<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> better

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.880 
player
you<00:01:53.610> can't<00:01:53.790> focus<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:54.990> thing<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.619> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
you can't focus on one thing I think to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.859 
you can't focus on one thing I think to
get<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.430> next<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:56.790> whatever<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.479> was<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
get the next up whatever that was the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.490 
get the next up whatever that was the
every<00:01:58.440> aspect<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.860> your<00:01:58.920> game<00:01:59.070> has<00:01:59.369> improved

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
every aspect of your game has improved

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.630 
every aspect of your game has improved
obviously<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.650> played<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:02.040> three<00:02:02.430> teams

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
obviously you played for three teams

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.399 
obviously you played for three teams
this<00:02:02.850> year<00:02:02.909> plus<00:02:03.360> player<00:02:03.810> representing

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
this year plus player representing

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.719

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
Sweden in the world juniors what do you

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.950 
Sweden in the world juniors what do you
think<00:02:05.880> was<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.030> biggest<00:02:06.300> challenge<00:02:06.450> between

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
think was the biggest challenge between

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.600 
think was the biggest challenge between
the<00:02:07.050> four<00:02:07.229> teams<00:02:08.630> it's<00:02:09.630> hard<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.959> say<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.289> was<00:02:10.610> I

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the four teams it's hard to say it was I

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.910 
the four teams it's hard to say it was I
mean<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.480> hard<00:02:12.630> question<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:13.050> think<00:02:13.110> there

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
mean it's a hard question I think there

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.460 
mean it's a hard question I think there
weren't<00:02:14.069> really<00:02:14.130> any<00:02:14.280> challenges<00:02:15.180> uh<00:02:15.470> coming

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
weren't really any challenges uh coming

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.860 
weren't really any challenges uh coming
I<00:02:16.590> mean<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:17.610> was<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.760> fun<00:02:18.390> playing<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.750> every

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
I mean it was a fun playing on every

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.850 
I mean it was a fun playing on every
team<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.230> think<00:02:19.350> we<00:02:19.470> had<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.890> great<00:02:20.010> time<00:02:21.770> do<00:02:22.770> you

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
team I think we had a great time do you

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.410 
team I think we had a great time do you
think<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.280> being<00:02:23.489> able<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.819> come<00:02:23.970> down<00:02:24.000> here

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
think that being able to come down here

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.780 
think that being able to come down here
for<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> World<00:02:24.930> Juniors<00:02:25.260> made<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> impact<00:02:26.250> on<00:02:26.459> I

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
for the World Juniors made a impact on I

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.940 
for the World Juniors made a impact on I
guess<00:02:26.970> your<00:02:27.180> adjustment<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.840> being<00:02:28.380> in<00:02:28.560> Canada

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
guess your adjustment to being in Canada

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.210 
guess your adjustment to being in Canada
once<00:02:29.130> he<00:02:29.250> got<00:02:29.400> here<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:30.140> mean<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.260> think<00:02:31.320> the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
once he got here I mean I think the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.220 
once he got here I mean I think the
hockey<00:02:32.400> from<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.820> world<00:02:33.000> unis<00:02:33.300> HL<00:02:34.080> was<00:02:34.200> a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
hockey from the world unis HL was a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.259 
hockey from the world unis HL was a
little<00:02:34.470> different<00:02:34.769> so<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:34.920> think<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:36.120> might

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
little different so I think it might

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.090 
little different so I think it might
have<00:02:36.390> helped<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.660> little<00:02:36.750> bit<00:02:36.989> but<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.230> but<00:02:37.980> then

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
have helped a little bit but I but then

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.640 
have helped a little bit but I but then
again<00:02:38.220> when<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.519> came<00:02:38.640> back<00:02:38.790> over<00:02:39.440> took<00:02:40.440> some

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
again when I came back over took some

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.459 
again when I came back over took some
time<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.860> get<00:02:41.040> adjusted<00:02:41.400> to
