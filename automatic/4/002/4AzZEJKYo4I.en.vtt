vehicle did not have a full tow package
for<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> hot<00:01:44.670> lead<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.569> brake<00:01:45.780> lead<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
for a hot lead and a brake lead the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.109 
for a hot lead and a brake lead the
other<00:01:46.890> half<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> connector<00:01:47.640> will<00:01:47.819> not<00:01:48.000> be

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
other half of a connector will not be

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.109 
other half of a connector will not be
used<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.740> we'll<00:01:49.860> simply<00:01:50.160> tape<00:01:50.369> up<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.729> end<00:01:50.910> and

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
used so we'll simply tape up the end and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.309 
used so we'll simply tape up the end and
secure<00:01:51.959> it<00:01:52.050> out<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.289> way<00:01:54.110> then<00:01:55.110> we'll<00:01:55.229> go

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
secure it out of the way then we'll go

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:56.570 
secure it out of the way then we'll go
ahead<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.619> zip-tie<00:01:55.770> our<00:01:55.950> wires<00:01:56.190> make<00:01:56.459> sure

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
ahead and zip-tie our wires make sure

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.010 
ahead and zip-tie our wires make sure
you're<00:01:56.729> safe<00:01:56.940> and<00:01:57.090> secure<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.630> out<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.959> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
you're safe and secure and out of the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.320 
you're safe and secure and out of the
way<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.649> case<00:01:58.890> we<00:01:59.039> zip<00:01:59.220> tie<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.399> wires<00:01:59.670> to

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
way this case we zip tie the wires to

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330 
way this case we zip tie the wires to
existing<00:02:00.810> wiring<00:02:01.649> that's<00:02:01.950> close<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.160> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
existing wiring that's close to the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.190 
existing wiring that's close to the
license<00:02:02.670> plate<00:02:02.850> light<00:02:03.030> alright<00:02:03.840> everything

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
license plate light alright everything

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.990 
license plate light alright everything
installed<00:02:04.470> it's<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.250> good<00:02:05.369> idea<00:02:05.459> to<00:02:05.610> try<00:02:05.819> it<00:02:05.880> out

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
installed it's a good idea to try it out

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.430 
installed it's a good idea to try it out
with<00:02:06.030> test<00:02:06.360> light<00:02:06.539> before<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.959> try<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.200> out<00:02:07.289> in

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
with test light before you try it out in

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.040 
with test light before you try it out in
a<00:02:07.500> trailer<00:02:08.300> ok<00:02:09.300> we'll<00:02:09.539> go<00:02:09.630> ahead<00:02:09.720> take<00:02:09.929> your

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
a trailer ok we'll go ahead take your

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.170 
a trailer ok we'll go ahead take your
tester<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.530> ground<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.009> white<00:02:11.940> wire

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
tester and ground it to the white wire

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.350 
tester and ground it to the white wire
which<00:02:12.959> we<00:02:13.080> -<00:02:13.230> bare<00:02:13.380> lead<00:02:13.730> next<00:02:14.730> one<00:02:14.940> up<00:02:15.090> will<00:02:15.240> be

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
which we - bare lead next one up will be

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.240 
which we - bare lead next one up will be
a<00:02:15.540> running<00:02:15.840> light<00:02:15.930> circuit<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:17.160> you

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
a running light circuit and you

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.699 
a running light circuit and you
typically<00:02:17.520> goes<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.910> brown<00:02:18.120> wire<00:02:18.709> alright

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
typically goes to a brown wire alright

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.380 
typically goes to a brown wire alright
then<00:02:20.250> we'll<00:02:20.340> go<00:02:20.490> ahead<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.640> check<00:02:20.849> our<00:02:21.060> left

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
then we'll go ahead and check our left

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.210 
then we'll go ahead and check our left
turn<00:02:21.540> signal<00:02:21.599> which<00:02:22.470> usually<00:02:22.830> goes<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
turn signal which usually goes to a

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.940 
turn signal which usually goes to a
yellow<00:02:23.490> wire<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.720> very<00:02:25.020> top<00:02:25.230> will<00:02:25.380> be<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
yellow wire and the very top will be the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.530 
yellow wire and the very top will be the
right<00:02:26.099> turn<00:02:26.310> signal<00:02:26.340> which<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.030> typically<00:02:27.330> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
right turn signal which is typically a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.839 
right turn signal which is typically a
green<00:02:27.810> wire<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.200> then<00:02:28.740> we'll<00:02:29.550> go<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.790> check

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
green wire and then we'll go and check

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.640 
green wire and then we'll go and check
for<00:02:30.120> brake<00:02:30.300> signal<00:02:30.690> they'll<00:02:31.140> be<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.319> solid

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
for brake signal they'll be a solid

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.770 
for brake signal they'll be a solid
signal<00:02:31.830> from<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.670> green<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.180> yellow<00:02:33.540> wires

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
signal from the green and yellow wires

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.900 
signal from the green and yellow wires
all<00:02:34.770> right<00:02:34.890> well<00:02:35.040> that's<00:02:35.190> I'll<00:02:35.430> finish<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.880> for
