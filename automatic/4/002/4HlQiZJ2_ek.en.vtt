00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.369
 today we did something 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.220
 of rather particular we sank a boat 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.250
 yours giang 137 an old boat from 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.350
 fishing that was belonged to a 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.530
 Chinese company and that was posted 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.030
 by maurice by ibm phishing so we have 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.190
 sunk a boat on a site in the area 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.899
 35 meters to make a reef 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.850
 artificial that will be you the substrate 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.500
 steel so that the corals can 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.540
 push on it so it's an old 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.800
 boat and his thirties he has 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.199
 well said well navigate everywhere and 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.949
 now he will live a second life 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.760
 and it will become a habitat for them 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.719
 fish corals 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.070
 it's an operation that's pretty 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.109
 complex because there are a lot 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.629
 many stakeholders many partners 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.250
 So the many contributions the 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.000
 ports 1 supported everything that is 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.770
 towing which is very expensive thank you 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.380
 so to all the port partners 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.380
 ibm phishing has given us somewhere 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.990
 the boat doing a little pressure 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.670
 at the owner's house is also all 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.220
 operators of the diving center the 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.810
 monusco badaling associations and 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.210
 people who helped him an operation 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.880
 who learned about a month and a half 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.290
 to implement and who in 15 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.689
 minutes we were able to sink the boat so 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.070
 it's concentrating that you could 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.020
 see maybe on the pictures but 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.490
 behind there is quite a work on the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.810
 permits and authorizations at the level of 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.409
 crisis sheets permits at the level of 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.479
 to the environment and the level of 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.930
 guard ribs so at quite a 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.610
 machinery behind which is engaged 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.590
 about thirty people 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.450
 who have implemented and created a 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.549
 synergy to sink the boat so the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.860
 boat sank today good ago 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.299
 still a little bit of residue that has 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.880
 stayed in the machine room little 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.219
 a little oil screw memory 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.810
 evaporate and in three weeks already 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.970
 there will be first Alps so the 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.070
 fish are coming and in three months 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.890
 already rivera corals so this boat 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.340
 to be quickly colonized and will be able to 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.239
 serve as supportive substrates for 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.239
 all marine life
