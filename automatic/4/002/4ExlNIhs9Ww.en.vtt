big<00:01:40.740> important<00:01:41.610> here<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:41.790> go<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.210> want<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.689> say

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
big important here we go I want to say

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.289

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.649 
actually I think the right fielder would
jump<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.130> front<00:01:47.159> yep<00:01:47.579> he<00:01:47.759> does<00:01:47.939> makes<00:01:48.299> us<00:01:48.450> play

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
jump in front yep he does makes us play

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
I couldn't even get a second but now

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.450 
I couldn't even get a second but now
with<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:14.020> speed<00:05:14.440> with<00:05:14.680> everything<00:05:14.710> going<00:05:15.190> on

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460

hitting<00:05:19.000> by<00:05:19.180> a-rod<00:05:19.390> and<00:05:19.810> really<00:05:20.500> if<00:05:20.680> I<00:05:20.800> get<00:05:20.979> on

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
hitting by a-rod and really if I get on

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.980 
hitting by a-rod and really if I get on
base<00:05:21.250> a<00:05:21.490> rod<00:05:21.760> performs<00:05:22.300> because<00:05:22.690> they<00:05:22.810> would

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
base a rod performs because they would

have<00:05:23.080> solely<00:05:23.350> been<00:05:23.560> declining<00:05:24.040> I<00:05:24.190> think<00:05:24.400> it's

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
have solely been declining I think it's

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.990 
have solely been declining I think it's
contacts<00:05:25.030> like<00:05:25.180> 68<00:05:25.660> power<00:05:25.930> 75<00:05:26.620> so<00:05:27.370> if<00:05:27.520> he<00:05:27.640> if<00:05:27.820> he

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
contacts like 68 power 75 so if he if he

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.909 
contacts like 68 power 75 so if he if he
can<00:05:28.180> perform<00:05:28.570> up<00:05:29.110> to<00:05:29.140> the<00:05:29.320> stand<00:05:29.530> then<00:05:29.710> maybe

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
can perform up to the stand then maybe

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.130 
can perform up to the stand then maybe
he<00:05:30.100> was<00:05:30.220> before<00:05:30.550> we<00:05:31.240> could<00:05:31.479> you<00:05:31.690> know<00:05:31.720> bring
