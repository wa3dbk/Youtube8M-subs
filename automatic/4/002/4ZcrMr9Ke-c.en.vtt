00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.849 

I'm<00:00:05.850> going<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.089> show<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.420> now<00:00:06.750> how<00:00:06.990> we<00:00:07.319> can<00:00:07.529> do

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
I'm going to show you now how we can do

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.940 
I'm going to show you now how we can do
things<00:00:08.099> like<00:00:08.719> freeze<00:00:09.719> frames<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.410> slowdown

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
things like freeze frames and slowdown

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.320 
things like freeze frames and slowdown
clips<00:00:11.280> so<00:00:11.610> if<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.849> tap<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.019> clip<00:00:14.000> if<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.089> look

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
clips so if I tap the clip if you look

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.820 
clips so if I tap the clip if you look
at<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.540> adjustment<00:00:15.990> tools<00:00:16.260> at<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> bottom

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
at the adjustment tools at the bottom

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.480 
at the adjustment tools at the bottom
the<00:00:17.520> we've<00:00:18.240> got<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.750> motion<00:00:19.170> tool<00:00:19.740> next<00:00:20.310> to

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
the we've got the motion tool next to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.109 
the we've got the motion tool next to
the<00:00:20.640> scissors<00:00:21.029> but<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.930> part<00:00:22.170> like<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.119> this

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the scissors but a part like so and this

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.939 
the scissors but a part like so and this
now<00:00:24.330> gives<00:00:24.570> me<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.779> option<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.170> slow<00:00:25.560> down<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
now gives me the option to slow down the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.750 
now gives me the option to slow down the
clip<00:00:26.189> or<00:00:26.400> speed<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.090> up<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.599> if<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.429> speed<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
clip or speed it up so if I speed up the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.910 
clip or speed it up so if I speed up the
if<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.330> surf<00:00:30.660> or<00:00:30.929> drag<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.320> towards<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
if I surf or drag it towards the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.319 
if I surf or drag it towards the
tortoise<00:00:33.140> it<00:00:34.140> will<00:00:34.260> actually<00:00:34.620> make<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> clip

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
tortoise it will actually make the clip

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.970 
tortoise it will actually make the clip
slower<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.690> you'll<00:00:37.050> notice<00:00:37.290> also<00:00:37.739> at<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
slower and you'll notice also at the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.520 
slower and you'll notice also at the
clip<00:00:38.340> now<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.850> extended<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.840> lasts

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
clip now is extended because it lasts

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.819 
clip now is extended because it lasts
longer<00:00:41.210> because<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.480> slower<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.500> spy

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
longer because it's slower so if it spy

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.100 
longer because it's slower so if it spy
that<00:00:43.950> back<00:00:44.539> see<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.870> slow<00:00:46.230> motion<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:49.020> I

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
that back see it's in slow motion and I

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.600 
that back see it's in slow motion and I
might<00:00:49.260> even<00:00:49.410> want<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.649> trim<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.129> now<00:00:50.250> as<00:00:50.430> well

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
might even want to trim it now as well

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:01.880 
might even want to trim it now as well
just<00:00:51.510> go<00:00:51.719> back<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.110> scissor<00:00:52.320> tool<00:00:53.120> trim<00:00:54.120> it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.790 

I<00:01:01.920> got<00:01:02.610> back<00:01:02.960> there<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.140> goats<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.500> slow

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
I got back there the goats in slow

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.370 
I got back there the goats in slow
motion<00:01:05.040> he<00:01:05.880> doing<00:01:06.240> slow<00:01:06.630> motion<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
motion he doing slow motion and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.470 
motion he doing slow motion and
someone's<00:01:08.100> talking<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.790> will<00:01:08.970> affect<00:01:09.330> their

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
someone's talking it will affect their

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.200 
someone's talking it will affect their
speech<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.800> for<00:01:10.950> example<00:01:11.280> with<00:01:11.370> Jennifer<00:01:11.760> here

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
speech so for example with Jennifer here

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.450 
speech so for example with Jennifer here
make<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.660> fast<00:01:12.990> there<00:01:13.290> she's<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.190> to<00:01:14.280> talk

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
make it fast there she's going to talk

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.719 
make it fast there she's going to talk
faster<00:01:18.440> if<00:01:19.440> I<00:01:19.890> make<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.790> clip<00:01:21.000> slower

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
faster if I make it the clip slower

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.440 
faster if I make it the clip slower
she's<00:01:23.729> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.810> talk<00:01:25.140> very<00:01:25.680> slow<00:01:26.450> you'll

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
she's going to talk very slow you'll

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.990 
she's going to talk very slow you'll
notice<00:01:27.960> along<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.560> line<00:01:28.800> there's<00:01:29.400> one

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
notice along the line there's one

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.740 
notice along the line there's one
particular<00:01:30.900> -<00:01:31.550> that<00:01:32.550> goes<00:01:32.760> further<00:01:33.180> down<00:01:33.540> and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
particular - that goes further down and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.890 
particular - that goes further down and
that's<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.200> normal<00:01:34.800> see<00:01:35.479> your<00:01:36.479> notice<00:01:36.780> has

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
that's you normal see your notice has

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.800 
that's you normal see your notice has
got<00:01:37.080> times<00:01:37.440> one<00:01:38.270> there<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> go

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
got times one there you go

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.180 
got times one there you go
see<00:01:40.200> next<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.960> times<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.440> half<00:01:46.190> so

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
see next to it times one and a half so

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.270 
see next to it times one and a half so
you<00:01:47.490> want<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.790> times<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:49.200> get<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.890> reset

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
you want it on times one to get to reset

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.350 
you want it on times one to get to reset
a<00:01:50.310> button<00:01:50.729> all<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:52.970> might<00:01:53.970> want<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.180> make<00:01:54.330> a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
a button all I might want to make a

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.240 
a button all I might want to make a
freeze-frame<00:01:54.780> right<00:01:55.259> freeze<00:01:55.590> frame<00:01:55.890> at<00:01:56.100> some

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
freeze-frame right freeze frame at some

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.930 
freeze-frame right freeze frame at some
margin<00:01:56.810> halfway<00:01:57.810> through<00:01:58.229> poor<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.070> T<00:01:59.369> if

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
margin halfway through poor and the T if

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.210 
margin halfway through poor and the T if
freeze<00:02:00.360> frames<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.990> into<00:02:01.410> like<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> photograph

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
freeze frames it into like a photograph

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.760 
freeze frames it into like a photograph
so<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:03.090> want<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.390> freeze<00:02:03.600> frame<00:02:03.630> save<00:02:04.170> up<00:02:04.320> there

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
so I want the freeze frame save up there

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.140 
so I want the freeze frame save up there
all<00:02:05.190> I<00:02:05.250> do

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
all I do

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.150 
all I do
tap<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:07.020> clip<00:02:07.459> go<00:02:08.459> into<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.590> speed<00:02:10.590> control

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
tap the clip go into the speed control

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.550 
tap the clip go into the speed control
tab<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.019> you'll<00:02:13.019> notice<00:02:13.260> there's<00:02:13.410> an<00:02:13.470> option

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
tab and you'll notice there's an option

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.120 
tab and you'll notice there's an option
free<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:14.370> if<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.549> tap<00:02:14.820> freeze<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.739> yellow<00:02:16.739> bar<00:02:17.100> is

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
free so if I tap freeze a yellow bar is

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.490 
free so if I tap freeze a yellow bar is
appeared<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.150> that's<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.660> section<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.260> clip

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
appeared and that's the section the clip

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.970 
appeared and that's the section the clip
that<00:02:20.190> will<00:02:20.400> be<00:02:20.730> just<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.600> still<00:02:21.989> frame<00:02:22.260> so

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
that will be just like a still frame so

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.410 
that will be just like a still frame so
if<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.340> play<00:02:24.000> pushes<00:02:24.570> back<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:24.870> play

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.330 

Moses<00:02:30.420> asked<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:30.959> still<00:02:31.260> frame<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.890> then<00:02:32.010> back

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
Moses asked on still frame and then back

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.900 
Moses asked on still frame and then back
again<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:34.200> yellow<00:02:34.530> bar<00:02:34.830> here<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.459> where

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
again this this yellow bar here is where

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.910 
again this this yellow bar here is where
it's<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.360> freeze<00:02:36.630> frame<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.260> extend<00:02:37.709> it

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
it's a freeze frame and I can extend it

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.500 
it's a freeze frame and I can extend it
if<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.070> want<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.700> I'll<00:02:38.820> make<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.120> freeze

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
if you want to so I'll make that freeze

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:49.130 
if you want to so I'll make that freeze
frame<00:02:39.540> last<00:02:40.200> longer<00:02:40.530> as<00:02:40.769> well<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:48.140> just

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
frame last longer as well so I just

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.530 
frame last longer as well so I just
stopped<00:02:49.680> at<00:02:49.890> mount<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.820> can<00:02:50.910> see<00:02:51.150> that's

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
stopped at mount so you can see that's

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.539 
stopped at mount so you can see that's
the<00:02:51.810> beginning<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.530> that's<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:53.010> end<00:02:53.190> of

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
the beginning and that's the end of

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.330 
the beginning and that's the end of
where<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:55.489> freeze<00:02:56.489> frame<00:02:56.519> happens<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:58.340> turn

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
where the freeze frame happens I turn

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.140 
where the freeze frame happens I turn
and<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.910> can<00:03:00.090> adjust<00:03:00.360> that<00:03:01.220> all<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.579> all<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:02.910> have

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
and I can adjust that all I all I have

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.640 
and I can adjust that all I all I have
to<00:03:03.269> do

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.160 

just<00:03:06.650> tap<00:03:07.130> out<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.370> little<00:03:07.610> bit<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:08.030> kinda<00:03:08.930> just

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
just tap out a little bit I kinda just

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.809 
just tap out a little bit I kinda just
didn't<00:03:09.500> make<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.709> last<00:03:09.739> longer<00:03:10.010> or<00:03:10.550> make<00:03:10.670> it

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
didn't make it last longer or make it

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.740 
didn't make it last longer or make it
less<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.480> make<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.870> shorter<00:03:12.349> for<00:03:12.380> wanting<00:03:13.750> okay

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
less it make it shorter for wanting okay

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.430 
less it make it shorter for wanting okay
so<00:03:14.810> that's<00:03:15.260> how<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.560> do<00:03:15.739> freeze-frame
