proud what did you hope to capture in

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.240 
proud what did you hope to capture in
the<00:02:15.380> film<00:02:15.680> our<00:02:16.190> culture<00:02:17.320> is<00:02:18.320> very<00:02:18.560> talented<00:02:18.860> in

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
the film our culture is very talented in

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.970 
the film our culture is very talented in
football<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.850> it<00:02:20.570> that<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:21.950> a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
football that it that it is it is a

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.310 
football that it that it is it is a
unique<00:02:22.340> opportunity<00:02:22.730> for<00:02:23.240> all<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.780> us<00:02:23.930> but<00:02:24.260> at

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
unique opportunity for all of us but at

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.560 
unique opportunity for all of us but at
the<00:02:24.560> same<00:02:24.800> time<00:02:25.100> there's<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:25.940> much<00:02:26.060> more<00:02:26.330> to

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
the same time there's so much more to

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.900 
the same time there's so much more to
our<00:02:27.230> culture<00:02:27.710> I<00:02:27.890> think<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.370> anything<00:02:28.820> we

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
our culture I think that anything we

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.570 
our culture I think that anything we
pursue<00:02:29.270> not<00:02:29.450> just<00:02:29.690> football<00:02:30.250> could<00:02:31.250> be<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.370> huge

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
pursue not just football could be a huge

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.920 
pursue not just football could be a huge
opportunity<00:02:32.180> for<00:02:32.210> us<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.630> football

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
opportunity for us and that football

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.490 
opportunity for us and that football
should<00:02:33.740> be<00:02:33.890> used<00:02:34.160> carefully<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.690> think<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.470> is

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
should be used carefully I think it is

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.230 
should be used carefully I think it is
an<00:02:36.830> opportunity<00:02:37.340> but<00:02:37.580> that<00:02:37.970> shouldn't

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
an opportunity but that shouldn't

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.720 
an opportunity but that shouldn't
shouldn't<00:02:39.050> be<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.320> end-all<00:02:39.590> be-all<00:02:39.730> Howard

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.000 
thought that you know telling that side
of<00:02:57.140> gangs<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.920> hoping<00:02:58.490> that<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:58.820> changes

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
of that that was the whole purpose

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.520
