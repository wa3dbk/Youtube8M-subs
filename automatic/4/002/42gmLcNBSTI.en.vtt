00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.110
 Do you want big holes in the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.009
 fix body or rust spots 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.270
 remove 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.620
 remove by means of a 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.110
 screwdrivers and crude 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.870
 Sandpaper first rust particles and 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.880
 Old loose-fitting paint residues grind 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.490
 They then three to four centimeters around the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.050
 hole to be repaired 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.240
 then use a motif polyester 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.490
 Repair Kit cut one piece 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.710
 glass fabric which is about two centimeters 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.500
 larger than the hole to be covered 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.949
 Now you have to use the polyester resin with the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.949
 harder 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.640
 now they fear the edge around the hole 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.620
 around with the polyester resin mixture 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.399
 Now put the piece of glass cloth too 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.840
 the moistened edges of the hole 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.270
 then wear additional polyester resin 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.600
 Mix on the glass cloth until it is wet 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.030
 completely covered is then 45 minutes 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.750
 let dry 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.230
 grind with a sandpaper 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.010
 dry the edges around the hole 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.870
 then you need one 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.760
 Polyester spatula taking care of it 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.489
 should pay attention to the quality with the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.960
 blue lettering to use 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.200
 Now mix the spatula well with 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.909
 the exact quantity harder they carry the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.970
 putty using the attached 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.000
 spatula south close the hole 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.070
 let dry completely for 30 minutes 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.689
 then grind again 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.400
 with sandpaper until she gets one 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.130
 get completely smooth surface 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.390
 the non-machined metal parts 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.670
 must be covered 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.310
 Now you can do the motive priming 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.110
 Apply this substrate to wear 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.750
 best in several thin layers 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.380
 When spraying, it is recommended a 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.090
 distance of 25 centimeters 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.130
 then let it dry for 30 minutes 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.570
 After that you can wet the primer 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.399
 sand with sanding paper 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.380
 but before you go with them

 fat-free is wearing the fashion in the car 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.600
 color best in several thin ones 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.610
 layers on which they spray one 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.250
 distance of 25 centimeters 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.170
 should be the best results 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.170
 achieved when they flush the cloister 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.190
 metallic colors should conclude with 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.870
