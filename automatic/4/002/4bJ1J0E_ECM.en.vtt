00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 i 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.730
 good first thing we're going to do 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.190
 sauté the seeds a little oil 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.870
 hot, we're going to sauté them 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.450
 separated 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.760
 because not all are going to do the 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.010
 way where we're going to go the antennas 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.130
 I'm going to see that the pipes are like that 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.740
 little corradina because we already heard something 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.740
 the next one is doing 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:42.070
 and we do a little more process of 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.350
 sesame that are dangerous 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.750
 thing that we judge we already have all the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.640
 seeds nieces and grip we return a 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.860
 little and we're going to add chocolate and 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.210
 also stir 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.210
 we add the chocolate that we can 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.640
 it's a molasses with cane oil and two 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.660
 spoonfuls 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.660
 I had the face 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.380
 and also a 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.890
 and those that are not 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.020
 and I go to people with dad 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.650
 good while sofia stir us 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.650
 as well 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.100
 once we have the molasses made as 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.100
 we have it now 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.619
 our are here not 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:55.730
 so we will look for the best the bars and 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:00.830
 we are a little bit like that and we mark it a 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:03.680
 9 a conecenten bowl wants to knit elongated 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.880
 what are the things we have done for 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:11.320
 the grill work we support the idea and 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.320

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.280
 so you can see melo for the mass and so 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.700
 then you can see how we can be 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.700
 seed 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.379
