 I'm going to evolve it with stone and 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.050
 well all these are my pokemons that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.600
 they are following me everywhere 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.310
 heavy with the balls that you let me 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.530
 I want to make a tutorial leave me 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.270
 quiet good but I'm going to save it 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.400
 he knew that bolt because I see that I do not 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.030
 they're going to leave then I'm going to leave 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.000
 some for example pikachu and I explain 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.610
 ok and chub only evolves with 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.140
 stone you know not so good I 'm going to 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.610
 let's give it a thunderstone to see 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.870
 how it evolves we are going to see the stone 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.330
 thunder so you take it or you do not want it 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.520
 take for you 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.080
 it's not like I was not giving the stone 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.340
 natural was not giving the fire in 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.340
 end let's give him the stone 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.740
 picacho is evolving when 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.480
 he gets nervous starts to run from the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.520
 nerves and see how it evolves now 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.860
 they put themselves like targets look like digimon 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.600
 I only swear I think we said good 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.620
 start as to change structure it 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.430
 modify your DNA and here is the evolution 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.960
 by rachel still 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.179
 see what happened is super big now 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.430
 that I'm fixing reich to see where 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.110
 is ray his words and we look 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.110
 up we have 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.530
 well let's evolve another pokémons 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.360
 differently that is helio charm for 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.290
 take means that begin to stick to 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.830
 hosts come to respect or if the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.320
 austria 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.580
 let's see if we get out of this fight 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.350
 to the medium as you well know you are evolving 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.000
 sharif 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.530
 and he does it at level 36 I think I remember 36 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.120
 I do not know because the only thing that we have to 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.590
 to do is to give him rare candies worth the 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.480
 rare candies are to evolve the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.700
 pokemon who has played pokemon 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.650
 you will know it says a canary is 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.820
 evolving oh my god I do not know how it goes 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.170
 to evolve update because 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.970
 throw me lions bigger than ariza 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.770
 roses that we are going to lift 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.770
 put here or let's see 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.170
 it's going to be giant 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.069
 there are costs 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.409
 holy god piece of fare 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.999
 but you are seeing the chamizal more 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:15.150
 great that I've seen in pixel money that 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:18.180
 you are going to see you is giant or is it 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.129
 Twice as oh by the way fijaros 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.049
 in my new pokemon kit which 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.030
 I will use to do combats 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.379
 pokemon with subscribers you already know 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.969
 you can then point to a gameplay that 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.319
 I will do then be attentive to 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.540
 channel to sign up and fight 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.380
 against me it's good, so let's continue 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.490
 with the pokemons we are going to take ibi 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.940
 here is good 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.670
 snow 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.319
 and we are going to give him a stone of fire to 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:49.769
 that to evolve get it 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.769
 bastard stake and put the catch 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.410
 he does not pick it up because he does not pick it up here 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.760
 here 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.739
 wrong asks for wrong work of 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.519
 stone is surely another that is by 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.870
 here it was supposed to be that but I do not know 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.819
 I 've seen it sounded to me in the series 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.160
 and then he has caught him I'm going to take the 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.050
 Water 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.380
 I do not know for trying you know let's give it 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.550
 here stones to see if it evolves is 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.550
 I suppose it's that of a verve 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.130
 I do not know is that I have not reviewed the 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.169
 stones and that's what happened to me now 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.970
 that has bound it, nothing, yes, I suppose 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.780
 that if we give him candy, he will 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.780
 evolve to 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.479
 a flavio negra not if iris is 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.970
 evolving is worth normal stone to the 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.470
 level 15 as it evolves to flower I think 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.870
 remember do not do much case let's 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.320
 check it to see I think if it was 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.480
 flower and once 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.480
 I do not know what's wrong 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.830
 entitled to polio 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.930
 but if it does not give the stone good 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:59.000
 in the end yes it has been given to me and has 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:01.009
 caught no and came to see the hunter debut 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.729
 here you see the first group I am 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:07.639
 watching I do not already have steam here eo and I 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.469
 takes out the ibi in the end the first vessel caught 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.240
 of pixel mont look there is little but 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.889
 this is the first one that caught you know this 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.389
 it does not usually happen but well let's 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.800
 throw to the fourth hotel you know that 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.349
 evolves crushed and fixed as the 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.879
 rooftops the epic epic septic and let's 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.069
 give him funny candies until he gets 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:23.240
 obese and evolve here are not 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:27.469
 saying that he is learning an attack 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.330
 as is normal and I think that at level 35 to 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:32.200
 same as to throw half a 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.120
 evolved let's see 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.470
 the hostility left impressive me 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.600
 I think he has left the best pokemon 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.050
 to me that I liked has been the target 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.820
 of the primaries yes and here is 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.340
 evolving fourth list evolving 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.810
 let's see what we can already good 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.700
 you know but good to see how it is 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.050

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.050
 big and I want a dish and believe me 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.129

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:05.709
