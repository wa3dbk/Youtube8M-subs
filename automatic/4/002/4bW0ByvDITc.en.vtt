00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.700
 hello friends we are in time of strawberries 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.919
 so today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.049
 delicious strawberry jam for 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.669
 prepare our jam as always 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.769
 we have prepared here the 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:15.440
 ingredients that we are going to need and 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.010
 we will need to take note one kilo of 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.960
 Strawberries 700 grams of sugar and juice 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.850
 half lemon a very short recipe 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.970
 we are also going to need some jars 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.800
 because packaging we have to preserve it and 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.990
 with these ingredients we are going to start 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.960
 with this recipe the first thing we're going to 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.450
 to do is going to be washed very well 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.580
 our strawberries without removing the leaves 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.440
 once washed and drained 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.890
 we will remove the leaves and chop them 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.530
 we have the average size 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.420
 I already have all our slices cut 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.000
 He has assured me once that I have 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.340
 had clean and chopped I had a 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.410
 just kilo is convenient to always have 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.660
 something else because you lose amount 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.680
 when we clean them now we are going to 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.680
 put the sugar 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.210
 and we're going to stir it up and 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.210
 Mix 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.340
 we have already mixed our 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.670
 prey with sugar is already starting to drop 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.640
 the juice itself strawberry then we go to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.280
 cover with plastic wrap and we'll leave them in 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.490
 the fridge to kill during all the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.649
 night as I said before and so we go 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.720
 to get the juice of the strawberry itself 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.280
 to make our jam without having 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.220
 to add that to any other type of 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.410
 liquid so see you tomorrow 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.120
 after having spent the whole night in 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.020
 the fridge our strawberries with the sugar 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.759
 they have already left all their juice 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.399
 macerating looking at how much liquid 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.590
 they have released so we do not need to put 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.710
 no water or fluids 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.770
 more we only have to put a pot 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.319
 expand to fire and pour all the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.149
 content of our vote for all the 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.299
 juice of strawberries and the sugar that remains in 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.219
 the fund will also incorporate the 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.740
 half lemon juice that we have already 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.709
 squeezed and strained we incorporated it 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.330
 completely and only we have left 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.160
 take it to the fire we will have it 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.810
 first cooking until it breaks the 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.460
 boil over high heat and then you 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.950
 we will lower the fire 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.990
 while we waited for our 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.060
 strawberries start to boil tell you that 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.120
 I have a pot here on the fire with 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.220
 abundant water and I already have it boiling and 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.660
 here I will sterilize our boats 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.490
 although they are scourged it is always 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.040
 convenient to sterilize the germs 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.140
 so that our jam lasts so 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.470
 least one year carefully 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.830
 we introduce into the water dt carlos the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.170
 boats and lids 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.600
 we are going to leave them in the boiling water 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.850
 for 15 minutes we will extinguish the fire 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.270
 we will leave them there past 15 minutes 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.420
 that are cooling in the water itself 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.220
 already begins to boil our jam and 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.650
 let's have it let's go down a little bit 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.480
 the fire will cook over medium heat and 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.890
 we will be here removing from time to time 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.200
 when about 45 to 60 minutes until 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.000
 we have the perfect point during the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.910
 cooking we will see how it is going 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.830
 being left to be removed so that the strawberries 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.760
 that are so whole, go away 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.760
 breaking a bit 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.290
 45 minutes have passed and we have 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.760
 our jam at the perfect point 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.910
 think though we see it liquid here 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.450
 in the pot when it cools if it stays 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.790
 fuck dita and let's do the test 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.520
 we prepare and we see that the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.550
 brand 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.890
 perfect 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.720
 I put the jam in a jar and 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.430
 I have the boats that I have taken from 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.650
 water and I have let them drain on a 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.870
 paper napkin upside down so that 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.850
 are completely dry and we are only 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.410
 it is to fill them with care of not 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.410
 burn us because it was very hot 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.750
 who likes jam more 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.430
 crushed then simply at the end 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.349
 pass it a little bit the tÃºrmix or for a 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.780
 we'll add a texture and we'll have it with a texture 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.000
 very fine I like to find 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.860
 the tripping of strawberry if we know that 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.690
 It is homemade jam and it is delicious 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.650
 and we leave without reaching the top of the 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.530
 all 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.500
 to make a little camera like this will be 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.020
 enough now we close the boats 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.180
 squeezing well 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.120
 taking care not to burn us because it's 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.449
 really hot 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.090
 and we just have to turn it around and 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:38.639
 leave them in this position for 24 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.010
 so the vacuum chamber will be made 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.630
 fund and we will keep our boat 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.249
 perfectly preserved and we 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.219
 will last up to one year 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:50.679
 we already have our jam ready and 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:53.199
 ready to remember you and we will have it 

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:54.879
 saved put a label with the date 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.429
 to always keep in mind on the date 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.619
 that we have prepared it and nothing to tell you 

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:01.899
 that is delicious delicious and not us 

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:04.209
 It has cost nothing to prepare it 

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:05.889
 I say as always try it 

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:08.680
