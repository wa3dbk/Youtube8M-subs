what<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> black<00:00:38.070> would<00:00:38.280> have<00:00:38.399> looked<00:00:38.550> like

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
what the black would have looked like

you've<00:00:41.790> got<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.180> great<00:00:42.540> look<00:00:42.840> there<00:00:43.050> where

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
you've got a great look there where

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.569 
you've got a great look there where
you've<00:00:43.290> left<00:00:43.500> some<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.040> skin<00:00:44.219> showing

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.830 
you've left some of that skin showing
through<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.300> doesn't<00:00:45.570> look<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
through so it just doesn't look like a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.380 
through so it just doesn't look like a
solid<00:00:46.230> beard<00:00:46.469> really<00:00:47.190> nice<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.120> drawing

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
itself is just so accurate this is

itself is just so accurate this is
really<00:00:51.270> really<00:00:51.449> well<00:00:51.690> done<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.230> looking<00:00:52.680> at<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860

especially that upper corner it's kind
of<00:01:04.530> cut<00:01:04.860> off<00:01:05.070> weird<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.150> you're<00:01:06.299> gonna

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
of cut off weird so that you're gonna

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.149

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
going to make the other side look a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.580 
going to make the other side look a
little<00:01:09.510> too<00:01:09.750> small<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.080> you're<00:01:10.200> gonna<00:01:10.290> need<00:01:10.470> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
little too small so you're gonna need to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.350 
little too small so you're gonna need to
balance<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.950> out<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.850> want<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.150> sure

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
balance that out you want to make sure

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.969 
balance that out you want to make sure

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
that the iris is completely completely

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.160

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
right side of the portrait needs to be

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.700 
right side of the portrait needs to be
more<00:01:18.090> rounded<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.689> well<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.110> kind<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.320> opens

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
more rounded as well so it kind of opens

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.410

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.630 
that'll make it much easier for you to
be<00:01:28.110> able<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> tell<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> differences<00:01:29.490> are

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
be able to tell what the differences are

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.330 
be able to tell what the differences are
basically<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:31.049> lay<00:01:31.439> your<00:01:31.740> reference<00:01:32.130> photo

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
basically just lay your reference photo

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.160 
basically just lay your reference photo
on<00:01:32.579> top<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.090> yours<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.570> add<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> bit<00:01:34.079> of

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
on top of yours I add a bit of

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.780 
on top of yours I add a bit of
transparency<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.280> then<00:01:35.400> adjust<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
transparency to it and then adjust the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.390 
transparency to it and then adjust the
size<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:37.049> matches<00:01:37.320> up<00:01:37.650> as<00:01:37.829> close<00:01:38.189> as

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
size so that it matches up as close as

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.160 
size so that it matches up as close as
possible<00:01:38.430> usually<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.360> will<00:01:39.570> line<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> lips

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
possible usually I will line up the lips

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.390 
possible usually I will line up the lips
in<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> eyes<00:01:40.619> because<00:01:41.009> they<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> most

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
in the eyes because they are the most

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.130 
in the eyes because they are the most
obvious<00:01:41.939> when<00:01:42.180> you're<00:01:42.270> layering<00:01:42.509> photos<00:01:42.960> like

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
obvious when you're layering photos like

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.859 
obvious when you're layering photos like
this<00:01:43.350> once<00:01:44.070> you've<00:01:44.310> got<00:01:44.579> those<00:01:44.850> lined<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.659> go

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
this once you've got those lined up I go

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
this once you've got those lined up I go
ahead<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.259> adjust<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.890> opacity<00:01:47.100> back<00:01:47.399> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
ahead and adjust the opacity back to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.149 
ahead and adjust the opacity back to
completely<00:01:48.420> opaque<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.710> reference

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
completely opaque for your reference

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.830 
completely opaque for your reference
photo<00:01:50.399> once<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.030> those<00:01:51.149> laid<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.509> top<00:01:51.720> of

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
photo once you have those laid on top of

photo once you have those laid on top of
each<00:01:51.960> other<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.680> increased

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
each other and then have increased

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.980 
each other and then have increased
opacity<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.909> your<00:01:54.030> reference<00:01:54.360> photo<00:01:54.540> back<00:01:54.810> to

you click it on and off on and off back
and<00:02:01.890> forth<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.490> you'll<00:02:02.790> start<00:02:03.090> to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
and forth like that it you'll start to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.630 
and forth like that it you'll start to
notice<00:02:03.479> what<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.320> slightly<00:02:04.950> different<00:02:05.460> about

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
notice what is slightly different about

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.490 
notice what is slightly different about
the<00:02:05.820> expression<00:02:06.210> or<00:02:06.450> little<00:02:06.869> teeny<00:02:07.079> details

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the expression or little teeny details

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.710 
the expression or little teeny details
that<00:02:07.710> are<00:02:07.829> off<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.310> will<00:02:08.459> also<00:02:08.670> work<00:02:08.910> sort<00:02:09.569> of

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
that are off this will also work sort of

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.029 
that are off this will also work sort of
if<00:02:09.959> your<00:02:10.170> drawing<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.590> not

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
if your drawing is not

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.770 
if your drawing is not
but<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.430> think<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:11.909> most<00:02:12.180> useful<00:02:12.269> on<00:02:12.750> a

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
but I think that it's most useful on a

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.839 
but I think that it's most useful on a
drawing<00:02:13.079> that<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.349> so<00:02:13.769> close<00:02:14.189> like<00:02:14.430> yours<00:02:14.640> is

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
drawing that is so close like yours is

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.360 
drawing that is so close like yours is
here<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.480> can<00:02:15.689> really<00:02:16.049> see<00:02:16.439> what<00:02:16.739> variations

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
here you can really see what variations

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.470 
here you can really see what variations
there<00:02:17.549> are<00:02:17.579> and<00:02:17.939> it<00:02:18.000> makes<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.239> more<00:02:18.329> obvious

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
there are and it makes it more obvious

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.390 
there are and it makes it more obvious
what<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.049> need<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.349> adjust<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.739> your<00:02:19.859> piece

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
what you need to adjust on your piece

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.740 
what you need to adjust on your piece
besides<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.969> minor<00:02:21.150> adjustments<00:02:21.599> on<00:02:21.689> the

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
besides the minor adjustments on the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.910 
besides the minor adjustments on the
eyes<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.049> other<00:02:22.079> thing<00:02:22.379> that<00:02:22.500> kind<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.709> stands

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
eyes the other thing that kind of stands

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.039 
eyes the other thing that kind of stands
out<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.189> me<00:02:23.219> is<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.879> skin<00:02:24.150> tone<00:02:24.390> you've<00:02:24.840> got<00:02:25.019> a

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
out to me is the skin tone you've got a

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.649 
out to me is the skin tone you've got a
lot<00:02:25.500> more<00:02:25.530> saturation<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.609> your<00:02:26.730> color<00:02:26.969> a<00:02:27.239> lot

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
lot more saturation in your color a lot

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.780 
lot more saturation in your color a lot
darker<00:02:28.079> oranges<00:02:28.739> whereas<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.519> reference

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
darker oranges whereas the reference

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.089 
darker oranges whereas the reference
photo<00:02:30.000> has<00:02:30.180> more<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> neutral<00:02:30.870> colors<00:02:31.530> so

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
photo has more of the neutral colors so

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.069 
photo has more of the neutral colors so
this<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:33.000> while<00:02:33.329> it<00:02:33.450> does<00:02:33.599> create<00:02:33.810> more

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
this is while it does create more

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.440 
this is while it does create more
dimension<00:02:34.859> in<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.099> piece<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.549> also<00:02:35.790> makes<00:02:36.329> it

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
dimension in the piece it also makes it

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.879 
dimension in the piece it also makes it
look<00:02:36.629> a<00:02:36.720> little<00:02:36.930> bit<00:02:37.049> less<00:02:37.200> realistic<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.799> if

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:37.889 
look a little bit less realistic so if

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.589 
look a little bit less realistic so if
you<00:02:37.980> neutralize<00:02:38.430> those<00:02:38.670> soften<00:02:39.209> those<00:02:39.389> up

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
you neutralize those soften those up

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.030 
you neutralize those soften those up
quite<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> bit<00:02:40.049> I<00:02:40.200> think<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.709> will<00:02:40.889> make<00:02:40.920> a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
quite a bit I think that will make a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.679 
quite a bit I think that will make a
difference<00:02:41.129> for<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.670> too<00:02:41.849> my<00:02:42.239> last<00:02:42.450> step<00:02:42.569> is

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
difference for you too my last step is

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.210 
difference for you too my last step is
on<00:02:42.810> his<00:02:42.930> hair<00:02:43.139> you've<00:02:43.349> actually<00:02:43.500> gone<00:02:43.739> quite<00:02:44.189> a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
on his hair you've actually gone quite a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.710 
on his hair you've actually gone quite a
bit<00:02:44.459> darker<00:02:44.760> than<00:02:44.879> it<00:02:44.939> is<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.209> your<00:02:45.389> reference

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
bit darker than it is on your reference

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.059 
bit darker than it is on your reference
photo<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.230> you're<00:02:46.439> going<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.590> see<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.739> lot<00:02:46.950> of

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
photo and you're going to see a lot of

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.099 
photo and you're going to see a lot of
the<00:02:47.159> detail<00:02:47.609> that<00:02:47.849> would<00:02:48.000> be<00:02:48.180> in<00:02:48.389> there<00:02:48.629> a<00:02:48.780> lot

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
the detail that would be in there a lot

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.569 
the detail that would be in there a lot
of<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.319> shine<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.590> highlights<00:02:50.189> so<00:02:50.370> working

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
of the shine and highlights so working

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
working in prison must take white and

working in prison must take white and
cream<00:02:53.760> colors<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.359> can<00:02:54.480> add<00:02:54.689> highlights

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
cream colors and you can add highlights

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.199 
cream colors and you can add highlights
right<00:02:55.650> on<00:02:55.889> top<00:02:56.099> not<00:02:56.310> over<00:02:56.579> all<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.939> the<00:02:57.030> hair

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
right on top not over all of the hair

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.670 
right on top not over all of the hair
but<00:02:57.359> anywhere<00:02:57.659> that<00:02:57.810> requires<00:02:58.109> highlights

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
but anywhere that requires highlights

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.170 
but anywhere that requires highlights
this<00:02:59.069> is<00:02:59.250> both<00:02:59.400> going<00:02:59.639> to<00:02:59.669> make<00:02:59.849> him<00:03:00.000> look<00:03:00.120> more

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
this is both going to make him look more

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.569 
this is both going to make him look more
blond<00:03:00.659> but<00:03:01.139> it<00:03:01.230> will<00:03:01.409> also<00:03:01.739> give<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.310> more<00:03:02.459> of

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
blond but it will also give you more of

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.610 
blond but it will also give you more of
that<00:03:02.730> detail<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.480> dimension<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:04.139> make<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
that detail and dimension and make the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.530 
that detail and dimension and make the
hair<00:03:04.769> look<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.069> lot<00:03:05.220> shinier<00:03:05.700> nothing<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.299> there

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
hair look a lot shinier nothing on there

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.300 
hair look a lot shinier nothing on there
is<00:03:06.689> drawn<00:03:07.019> wrong<00:03:07.319> it<00:03:07.620> just<00:03:07.650> doesn't<00:03:08.159> feel<00:03:08.250> like

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
is drawn wrong it just doesn't feel like

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.619 
is drawn wrong it just doesn't feel like
you've<00:03:08.519> finished<00:03:08.879> with<00:03:08.970> your<00:03:09.030> shading<00:03:09.480> and

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
you've finished with your shading and

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:10.819 
you've finished with your shading and
highlights<00:03:09.959> for<00:03:10.349> me<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.590> when<00:03:10.680> doing

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
highlights for me and when doing

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.050 
highlights for me and when doing
portraits<00:03:11.129> when<00:03:11.579> I'm<00:03:11.669> trying<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.879> get<00:03:12.030> a

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
portraits when I'm trying to get a

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.940 
portraits when I'm trying to get a
really<00:03:12.329> realistic<00:03:12.569> look<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:12.989> find<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.439> mixing

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
really realistic look I find that mixing

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.740 
really realistic look I find that mixing
my<00:03:14.069> polychromos<00:03:14.549> with<00:03:14.790> wax<00:03:15.120> based<00:03:15.299> pencil

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
my polychromos with wax based pencil

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.509 
my polychromos with wax based pencil
which<00:03:16.169> would<00:03:16.379> be<00:03:16.530> luminance<00:03:17.099> in<00:03:17.220> my<00:03:17.340> case

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
which would be luminance in my case

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.759 
which would be luminance in my case
mixing<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.329> two<00:03:18.540> works<00:03:18.900> really<00:03:19.199> well<00:03:19.409> because

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
mixing the two works really well because

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.020 
mixing the two works really well because
the<00:03:19.919> wax<00:03:20.040> based<00:03:20.220> pencil<00:03:20.579> gives<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.849> that

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
the wax based pencil gives you that

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.490 
the wax based pencil gives you that
great<00:03:21.359> smoothness<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:22.109> need<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.409> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
great smoothness that you need in the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.199 
great smoothness that you need in the
skin<00:03:22.739> but<00:03:23.099> then<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.310> polychromos<00:03:23.760> being<00:03:24.060> an

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
skin but then the polychromos being an

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.969 
skin but then the polychromos being an
oil-based<00:03:24.479> and<00:03:24.840> being<00:03:25.349> that<00:03:25.530> they<00:03:25.620> hold<00:03:25.799> a

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:25.979 
oil-based and being that they hold a

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.099 
oil-based and being that they hold a
fine<00:03:26.250> tip<00:03:26.549> so<00:03:26.760> well<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.180> makes<00:03:27.599> it<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:27.959> much

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
fine tip so well it makes it so much

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.569 
fine tip so well it makes it so much
easier<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.500> get<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.709> detail<00:03:29.040> around<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.400> eyes

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
easier to get the detail around the eyes

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.460 
easier to get the detail around the eyes
and<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> hair<00:03:30.359> and<00:03:30.569> just<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.900> fine<00:03:31.169> fine

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
and in the hair and just that fine fine

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.680 
and in the hair and just that fine fine
detail<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.549> is<00:03:32.669> a<00:03:32.699> lot<00:03:32.940> harder<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.359> do<00:03:33.540> with

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
detail that is a lot harder to do with

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.420 
detail that is a lot harder to do with
some<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.079> wax<00:03:34.260> based<00:03:34.470> pencils<00:03:34.979> so<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.340> think

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
some of the wax based pencils so I think

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.099 
some of the wax based pencils so I think
by<00:03:35.639> adding<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:36.030> few<00:03:36.150> polychromos<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.989> your

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
by adding a few polychromos to your

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.390 
by adding a few polychromos to your
collection<00:03:37.409> it'll<00:03:37.769> make<00:03:37.919> your<00:03:38.010> goal<00:03:38.220> of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
collection it'll make your goal of

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.949 
collection it'll make your goal of
making<00:03:38.549> your<00:03:38.729> portraits<00:03:39.120> more<00:03:39.299> realistic<00:03:39.780> a

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
making your portraits more realistic a

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.199 
making your portraits more realistic a
lot<00:03:40.229> easier<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.739> achieve<00:03:41.040> not<00:03:41.549> that<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.879> can't

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
lot easier to achieve not that it can't

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.879 
lot easier to achieve not that it can't
be<00:03:42.419> done<00:03:42.569> just<00:03:42.629> with<00:03:42.959> prismacolor<00:03:43.379> i<00:03:43.709> think

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
be done just with prismacolor i think

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.229 
be done just with prismacolor i think
we've<00:03:43.979> all<00:03:44.069> seen<00:03:44.129> Heather<00:03:44.519> Rooney<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.120> can

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
we've all seen Heather Rooney you can

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.059 
we've all seen Heather Rooney you can
obviously<00:03:45.690> make<00:03:45.870> prisoner<00:03:46.409> colors<00:03:46.680> look

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
obviously make prisoner colors look

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.250 
obviously make prisoner colors look
totally<00:03:47.699> realistic<00:03:48.030> but<00:03:48.540> your<00:03:48.780> top<00:03:48.959> will<00:03:49.139> be<00:03:49.229> a

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
totally realistic but your top will be a

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.110 
totally realistic but your top will be a
lot<00:03:49.530> easier<00:03:50.069> if<00:03:50.220> you've<00:03:50.370> got<00:03:50.549> pencils<00:03:50.760> that

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
lot easier if you've got pencils that

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.939 
lot easier if you've got pencils that
hold<00:03:51.359> that<00:03:51.449> fine<00:03:51.780> point<00:03:52.169> better<00:03:52.409> you've<00:03:52.799> done

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
hold that fine point better you've done

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.949 
hold that fine point better you've done
