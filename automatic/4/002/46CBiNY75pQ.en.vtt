00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
and this really is a test bed so we're

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.430 
and this really is a test bed so we're
making<00:02:18.240> parts<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.750> we<00:02:18.870> sell<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.350> the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440

to do a bit of development on the car

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.470 
to do a bit of development on the car
before<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.310> goes<00:02:35.460> in<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.700> container<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.300> news

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
before it goes in the container to news

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.360 
before it goes in the container to news
in<00:02:36.630> for<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.930> tiger<00:02:37.260> alley<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:38.160> great

in for the tiger alley and the great

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.790 
in for the tiger alley and the great
thing<00:02:38.400> here<00:02:38.940> who<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.840> we<00:02:39.990> run<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.320> same<00:02:40.530> road

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
thing here who is we run the same road

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.160 
thing here who is we run the same road
time<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.490> time<00:02:41.640> again<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:42.720> can<00:02:42.870> run<00:02:43.020> it

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
time and time again so we can run it

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.840 
time and time again so we can run it
make<00:02:43.470> some<00:02:43.650> changes<00:02:44.040> go<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.400> try<00:02:44.580> them<00:02:44.790> again

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
make some changes go and try them again

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.380 
make some changes go and try them again
and<00:02:45.330> your<00:02:45.750> target<00:02:46.200> really<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.500> get<00:02:46.620> one<00:02:46.860> shot

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
and your target really you get one shot

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.350 
and your target really you get one shot
good<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.540> that's<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:49.020> so<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.320> got<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.530> be<00:02:49.590> right

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
good I that's it so it's got to be right

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.250 
good I that's it so it's got to be right
you<00:02:51.360> know<00:02:51.480> when<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.750> start<00:02:51.960> out<00:02:52.140> with<00:02:52.200> a

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
you know when you start out with a

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.440 
you know when you start out with a
Nissan<00:02:52.710> GTR<00:02:53.100> it's<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.610> super<00:02:53.970> car<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.330> it's

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
Nissan GTR it's a super car and it's

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.510 
Nissan GTR it's a super car and it's
very<00:02:54.660> hard<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.990> actually<00:02:55.170> make<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.650> better<00:02:55.830> so

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
very hard to actually make it better so

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.350 
very hard to actually make it better so
what<00:02:56.670> you're<00:02:56.820> going<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.030> do<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.180> you're<00:02:57.240> going

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.110 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:02:57.450> be<00:02:57.540> very<00:02:57.690> careful<00:02:58.170> with<00:02:58.290> what<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.530> improve

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
to be very careful with what you improve

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.220 
to be very careful with what you improve
we've<00:03:00.120> given<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.510> car<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.720> little<00:03:00.900> bit<00:03:00.990> more

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
we've given the car a little bit more

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.650 
we've given the car a little bit more
power<00:03:01.470> by<00:03:01.770> way<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.010> boost<00:03:02.460> we've<00:03:03.360> put<00:03:03.570> on

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
power by way of boost we've put on

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.000 
power by way of boost we've put on
different<00:03:03.810> brakes<00:03:04.200> we've<00:03:04.410> put<00:03:04.590> on<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.710> carbon

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
different brakes we've put on a carbon

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.860 
different brakes we've put on a carbon
ceramic<00:03:05.340> brake<00:03:05.790> which<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.150> much<00:03:06.390> lighter<00:03:06.690> than

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
ceramic brake which is much lighter than

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.810 
ceramic brake which is much lighter than
the<00:03:07.080> standard<00:03:07.380> cast-iron<00:03:07.800> break<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
the standard cast-iron break and the

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.820 
the standard cast-iron break and the
very<00:03:09.210> verge<00:03:09.390> with<00:03:09.540> brakes<00:03:09.810> we've<00:03:10.560> got<00:03:10.740> an

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
very verge with brakes we've got an

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.220 
very verge with brakes we've got an
infinitely<00:03:11.310> adjustable<00:03:11.520> suspension<00:03:12.240> the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
infinitely adjustable suspension the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.200 
infinitely adjustable suspension the
stillen<00:03:13.650> sway<00:03:14.130> bars<00:03:14.400> which<00:03:14.700> we<00:03:14.820> can<00:03:14.970> adjust

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
stillen sway bars which we can adjust

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.960 
stillen sway bars which we can adjust
from<00:03:15.390> hard<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.870> steph<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.830> Penske<00:03:17.610> still<00:03:17.850> in

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
from hard to steph the Penske still in

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.490 
from hard to steph the Penske still in
shock<00:03:18.150> absorbers<00:03:18.570> which<00:03:18.780> we<00:03:18.930> can<00:03:19.080> change<00:03:19.290> the

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
shock absorbers which we can change the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.890 
shock absorbers which we can change the
bump<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:20.010> rebound<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.640> spring<00:03:20.910> rate<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.750> the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
bump the rebound the spring rate so the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.150 
bump the rebound the spring rate so the
number<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.260> things<00:03:22.470> there<00:03:22.680> which<00:03:22.830> make<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
number of things there which make the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.190 
number of things there which make the
car<00:03:23.370> adjustable<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.270> different<00:03:24.300> roads<00:03:24.810> and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
car adjustable for different roads and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.449 
car adjustable for different roads and
then<00:03:25.770> of<00:03:25.920> course<00:03:26.100> we've<00:03:26.250> got<00:03:26.370> the

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
then of course we've got the

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.020 
then of course we've got the
aerodynamics<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.180> car<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.280> on<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.430> as

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
aerodynamics of the car and so on so as

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.120 
aerodynamics of the car and so on so as
you<00:03:30.209> can<00:03:30.300> see<00:03:30.510> it's<00:03:30.660> mildly<00:03:31.110> tuned<00:03:31.530> because

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
you can see it's mildly tuned because

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:45.510 
you can see it's mildly tuned because
it's<00:03:32.459> such<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:32.610> great<00:03:32.790> car<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.120> side<00:03:33.420> with

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.580 

you
