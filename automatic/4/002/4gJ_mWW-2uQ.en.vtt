00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:07.751
 Mike, I understand you're upset, 

00:00:07.902 --> 00:00:10.668
 but you accept that Scarlett has kicked you ... 

00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:13.960
 These are my things! 

00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:15.333
 ... and that children do not love you, very negative. 

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.315
 Would you reduce the music? 

00:00:18.777 --> 00:00:21.532
 It's really nagging, is not it? There is no positive side. 

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:25.573
 Mike O'Donnell is aged ... 37 YEARS 

00:00:25.573 --> 00:00:28.222
 ... of which life seems to be wasted. 

00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:31.896
 You probably want to start from the beginning. - You bet! 

00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:36.017
 But in an unusual moment ... 

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:37.835
 Get out of there! 

00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:40.330
 ... the clock will turn 

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:43.947
 and he will become 17 ... 

00:00:47.248 --> 00:00:48.825
 ... one more time. 

00:00:51.573 --> 00:00:53.662
 Unbelievable! - You're crazy about me. 

00:00:53.662 --> 00:00:55.520
 I'm crazy! I'm a puber. 

00:00:56.481 --> 00:01:00.958
 I will start my life from the beginning. I'm going back to school, Ned. 

00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.600
 Do not even think to get me involved in this! 

00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:06.601
 I want to record my son. - Hello. 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.351
 What are you wearing ?! - This is modern. 

00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:11.059
 Do not Kay Fed? 

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:13.805
 And what are you wearing? You look like Clay Aiken. 

00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:17.961
 Now ... 

00:01:17.983 --> 00:01:20.802
 Why did the new boy take me out? - ... he returns to school. 

00:01:20.952 --> 00:01:23.121
 What are you eating? - I do not know! I know I'm hungry 

00:01:24.682 --> 00:01:26.013
 and it constantly! 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.316
 ... and returns to the game. 

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:29.786
 Hello Mom. This is Mark. 

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:33.317
 You are terribly like my husband. 

00:01:33.678 --> 00:01:35.965
 Very strange ... "" Yeah, weird. 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.945
 THIS SPRING 

00:01:36.945 --> 00:01:41.119
 Maggie has a boyfriend? He harasses your little brother! 

00:01:41.356 --> 00:01:42.912
 Do not you think you're my father ?! 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.241
 He has one more chance ... 

00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:47.346
 I want to help Alex and Maggie. 

00:01:49.258 --> 00:01:50.729
 ... to fix things. 

00:01:50.726 --> 00:01:52.306
 Who won? - We were on a par. 

00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:54.521
 YouTube looked like he was beating you mercilessly. 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.560
 When you are young, it often seems like life is over. 

00:02:01.304 --> 00:02:02.380
 But it's not like that. 

00:02:03.432 --> 00:02:04.777
 Just the beginning. 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.445
 I went to the basketball team. - Proud of you! 

00:02:14.445 --> 00:02:17.095
 Me too! It was great! 

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.644
 Mark, it's super inappropriate. 

00:02:20.584 --> 00:02:22.689
 17 AGAIN
