00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
down and try to spin this out hop in the

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.390 
down and try to spin this out hop in the
leg<00:02:35.500> joints<00:02:35.859> off<00:02:35.980> because<00:02:36.129> they're<00:02:36.310> very

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
leg joints off because they're very

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.679 
leg joints off because they're very
sensitive<00:02:36.969> so<00:02:37.060> when<00:02:37.150> you're<00:02:37.269> transforming

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
sensitive so when you're transforming

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.020 
sensitive so when you're transforming
this<00:02:37.989> thing<00:02:38.230> keep<00:02:39.069> that<00:02:39.250> in<00:02:39.370> mind

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
this thing keep that in mind

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.789 
this thing keep that in mind
it's<00:02:40.659> got<00:02:40.780> like<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.959> ball<00:02:41.260> joint<00:02:41.469> and<00:02:41.620> then<00:02:41.769> a

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
it's got like a ball joint and then a

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.059 
it's got like a ball joint and then a
little<00:02:42.069> swivel<00:02:42.280> joint<00:02:42.579> in<00:02:42.730> there<00:02:42.879> as<00:02:42.999> well<00:02:44.069> and

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
little swivel joint in there as well and

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.390 
little swivel joint in there as well and
there<00:02:46.060> we<00:02:46.209> go

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
there we go

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.589 
there we go
so<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.519> it<00:02:48.639> touch<00:02:48.849> fidgety<00:02:49.359> when<00:02:49.480> you're

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
so is it touch fidgety when you're

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.569 
so is it touch fidgety when you're
trying<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.840> get<00:02:49.930> him<00:02:50.049> to<00:02:50.079> stand<00:02:50.379> but<00:02:51.040> it's<00:02:51.430> not

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
trying to get him to stand but it's not

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.390 
trying to get him to stand but it's not
that<00:02:51.790> bad<00:02:51.989> it's<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.139> solid<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.859> solid<00:02:53.980> little

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
that bad it's a solid a solid little

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.179 
that bad it's a solid a solid little
figure<00:02:55.019> which<00:02:56.019> once<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:56.859> get<00:02:57.010> him<00:02:57.099> the

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
figure which once you get him the

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.589 
figure which once you get him the
transform<00:02:57.609> we<00:02:57.669> get<00:02:57.760> those<00:02:57.909> feet<00:02:58.090> just<00:02:58.359> right

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
transform we get those feet just right

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.530 
transform we get those feet just right
because<00:02:58.959> these<00:02:59.969> bottom<00:03:00.969> pieces<00:03:01.000> right<00:03:01.480> here

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
because these bottom pieces right here

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.439 
because these bottom pieces right here
swivel<00:03:02.049> back<00:03:02.199> and<00:03:02.469> forth<00:03:02.680> but<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:04.030> doesn't

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:04.449 
swivel back and forth but it doesn't

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:06.059 
swivel back and forth but it doesn't
take<00:03:04.599> away<00:03:04.629> from<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.079> figure<00:03:05.319> it<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.739> really

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
take away from the figure it is really

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.379 
take away from the figure it is really
meant<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.340> nice<00:03:06.579> cool<00:03:06.819> figure<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.180> like<00:03:07.299> the

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
meant the nice cool figure I like the

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.089 
meant the nice cool figure I like the
purple<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:07.870> everything<00:03:08.169> a<00:03:08.379> nice<00:03:08.650> purple

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
purple and everything a nice purple

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.569 
purple and everything a nice purple
paint<00:03:09.489> up<00:03:10.359> on<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.629> chest<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.019> everything

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
paint up on the chest and everything

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.099 
paint up on the chest and everything
yeah<00:03:12.579> it's<00:03:12.819> definitely<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.359> plus<00:03:13.629> when<00:03:13.959> it

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
yeah it's definitely a plus when it

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.059 
yeah it's definitely a plus when it
comes<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.319> these<00:03:14.439> figures<00:03:16.439> back<00:03:17.439> here<00:03:17.769> just

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
comes to these figures back here just

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.309 
comes to these figures back here just
now<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:19.359> looks<00:03:19.540> at<00:03:19.629> a<00:03:19.689> figure<00:03:19.840> from<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.139> back

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
now it looks at a figure from the back

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.649 
now it looks at a figure from the back
right<00:03:20.819> but<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:21.970> it's<00:03:22.209> got<00:03:22.329> a<00:03:22.359> nice<00:03:22.509> little

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659 
right but and it's got a nice little

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.830 
right but and it's got a nice little
purple<00:03:23.590> Decepticon<00:03:24.189> logo<00:03:24.639> right<00:03:25.419> here<00:03:25.479> on<00:03:25.720> his

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
purple Decepticon logo right here on his

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.039 
purple Decepticon logo right here on his
shoulder<00:03:26.169> and<00:03:27.099> again<00:03:27.430> quick<00:03:27.669> comparison<00:03:28.269> you

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
shoulder and again quick comparison you

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.390 
shoulder and again quick comparison you
can<00:03:29.079> see<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.470> dark<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.799> moon<00:03:29.949> one<00:03:30.099> here

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
can see the dark of the moon one here

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.189 
can see the dark of the moon one here
versus<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.900> RIT<00:03:32.530> one<00:03:32.739> very<00:03:33.430> cool<00:03:33.689> so<00:03:34.689> yeah

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
versus the RIT one very cool so yeah

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.449 
versus the RIT one very cool so yeah
they<00:03:35.319> kind<00:03:35.500> of<00:03:35.560> cheaped<00:03:35.799> out<00:03:35.919> on<00:03:35.979> this<00:03:36.280> deal

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
they kind of cheaped out on this deal

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.759 
they kind of cheaped out on this deal
here<00:03:36.810> again<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.900> only<00:03:38.079> major<00:03:38.530> difference

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
here again the only major difference

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.929 
here again the only major difference
here<00:03:39.040> is<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:40.209> hole<00:03:40.359> here<00:03:41.189> and<00:03:42.189> in<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.519> hands

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
here is the hole here and in the hands

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.710 
here is the hole here and in the hands
they<00:03:43.449> made<00:03:43.629> it<00:03:43.750> so<00:03:43.870> he<00:03:44.109> can<00:03:44.259> hold<00:03:44.379> the<00:03:44.560> weapon

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
they made it so he can hold the weapon

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.949 
they made it so he can hold the weapon
like<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:47.819> try<00:03:48.819> to<00:03:48.879> get<00:03:49.090> these<00:03:49.180> in<00:03:49.389> there<00:03:49.569> there

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
like so try to get these in there there

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:50.749 
like so try to get these in there there
you<00:03:50.139> go

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:50.759 
you go

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.920 
you go
but<00:03:51.759> yeah<00:03:51.909> it's<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.150> nice<00:03:52.299> figure<00:03:52.629> it's<00:03:52.780> got

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
but yeah it's a nice figure it's got

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.140 
but yeah it's a nice figure it's got
decent<00:03:53.229> articulation<00:03:54.129> on<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.310> legs<00:03:54.519> nothing

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
decent articulation on the legs nothing

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.119 
decent articulation on the legs nothing
at<00:03:55.419> the<00:03:55.509> knee<00:03:55.659> and<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:56.319> course<00:03:56.560> these<00:03:56.739> awkward

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
at the knee and of course these awkward

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.569 
at the knee and of course these awkward
feet<00:03:57.639> spin<00:03:58.120> back<00:03:58.359> and<00:03:58.599> forth<00:03:58.810> but<00:03:59.049> no<00:04:00.040> elbow<00:04:00.400> or

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
feet spin back and forth but no elbow or

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.129 
feet spin back and forth but no elbow or
anything<00:04:00.969> but<00:04:01.299> it<00:04:01.389> does<00:04:01.479> move<00:04:01.689> up<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:01.959> down<00:04:02.079> a

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
anything but it does move up and down a

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.020 
anything but it does move up and down a
little<00:04:02.290> bit<00:04:02.469> here<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:03.099> a<00:04:03.489> little<00:04:03.519> bit<00:04:03.819> ball

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
little bit here and a little bit ball

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.110 
little bit here and a little bit ball
joint<00:04:04.329> there<00:04:04.859> yeah<00:04:05.859> there's<00:04:06.189> a<00:04:06.250> close-up<00:04:07.030> of

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
joint there yeah there's a close-up of

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.839 
joint there yeah there's a close-up of
the<00:04:07.209> face<00:04:07.389> really<00:04:07.629> quick<00:04:08.519> come<00:04:09.519> on<00:04:09.579> get<00:04:09.729> into

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
the face really quick come on get into

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.879 
the face really quick come on get into
focus<00:04:10.180> there<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:13.180> there<00:04:13.539> we<00:04:13.599> go<00:04:13.719> yeah<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.680> kind

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
focus there and there we go yeah it kind

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.949 
focus there and there we go yeah it kind
of<00:04:14.919> looks<00:04:15.099> like<00:04:15.159> a<00:04:15.280> mangled<00:04:15.699> face<00:04:16.120> but<00:04:16.539> if<00:04:16.810> you

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
of looks like a mangled face but if you

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.289 
of looks like a mangled face but if you
remember<00:04:17.139> it<00:04:17.349> from<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:18.180> movie<00:04:19.180> and

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
remember it from the the movie and

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.839 
remember it from the the movie and
everything<00:04:19.329> it<00:04:19.719> is<00:04:19.750> kind<00:04:20.109> of<00:04:20.169> accurate<00:04:20.849> but

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
everything it is kind of accurate but

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.700 
everything it is kind of accurate but
yeah<00:04:22.150> they<00:04:22.300> eat<00:04:22.539> out<00:04:22.750> making<00:04:23.169> this<00:04:23.260> guy<00:04:23.440> for

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
yeah they eat out making this guy for
