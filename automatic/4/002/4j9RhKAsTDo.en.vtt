well<00:00:50.850> over<00:00:51.149> 1,900<00:00:51.719> while<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> iphone<00:00:52.559> five

scores<00:00:53.100> over<00:00:53.309> 1,600<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.270> should<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780

actually pull a stronger signal strength

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.370 
actually pull a stronger signal strength
now<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.790> run<00:01:30.000> these<00:01:30.150> over<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.600> over<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.290> over
