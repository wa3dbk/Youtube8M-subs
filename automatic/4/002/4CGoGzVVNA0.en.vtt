00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello, friends, I am 2106 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.609
 and here I am going to talk about some tips that are very useful for the 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:08.399
 game resident evil 4 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:12.539
 no matter what difficulty you are playing these tips will serve as 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:13.279
 help 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:17.460
 oquelÃ­ the first thing we should know is that here the ammunition is not achieved so 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.630
 easily so I'm not spending it crazy 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.710
 when we face the cattle it is best to kill them using the knife 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.930
 to use it the best is to wait for them to attack you then you walk away a little 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.700
 you approach and nails it is the knife by the face and then you kick it 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.910
 You dressed in the karate kid movie 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.870
 When there are many enemies in front of you, you can do the following and 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.330
 shoot a cattle by the head then you do the kick and you leave them dazed in 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.180
 soil 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.480
 there are times like in chapter 1 points 2 after talking to Luis 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.120
 you will have to face several wins if you are playing on difficulty 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.060
 difficult, I recommend that you use the shotgun every time you try to kill 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.170
 there are not several enemies the idea is that you collect the pieces without killing 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.730
 you save ammunition 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.270
 at the beginning of the game when you enter a place where there will be a lot of cattle 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.070
 in the house that is on the left 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.710
 the chainsaw will come out next but you'll have 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.550
 maybe more shotgun ammunition when you kill him on the right hand side of the 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.240
 bonfire entered the house and lock the door with such a piece of furniture when 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.810
 accumulate you throw a hand grenade and kill much 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.030
 when you face the first giant kill or use five or six grenades 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.790
 hand so you'll have more eyeballs 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.280
 they have to save the dog that is starting the game because he 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.580
 will help the same with the can kill him with a grenade and with the gun do not spend 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.690
 a lot of shotgun ammunition when they are starting to have more money 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.310
 of life but do not buy until you get to the castle the only thing you can buy is 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.720
 a rocket launcher and medicines and I do not think that much at the beginning of 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.450
 game 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.170
 when you face the savers do not run and hear them 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.130
 blades like wolverine the exams there's a chance that you're locked in with a 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.149
 charger uses a hand grenade to open the padlock of the cage and so on 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.509
 killing him easily with salazar killed with a rocket launcher was easier and 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.659
 finally the jj shoot him in the head it will be easier to kill them 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.340
 if they are starting I recommend these punishing weapons explain to them 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.579
 semi-automatic rifle and the broken 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.319
 that has been all until the next
