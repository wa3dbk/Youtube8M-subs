Natsu<00:04:44.660> so<00:04:44.870> that's<00:04:45.380> really<00:04:45.530> all<00:04:45.830> the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
Natsu so that's really all the

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.370 
Natsu so that's really all the
development<00:04:46.460> we<00:04:46.610> technically<00:04:47.300> had<00:04:47.720> in<00:04:48.110> this

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
development we technically had in this

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.560 
development we technically had in this
episode<00:04:48.950> which<00:04:49.340> is<00:04:49.370> fun<00:04:49.700> oh<00:04:49.729> good<00:04:50.090> pause<00:04:50.360> the

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
episode which is fun oh good pause the

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.840 
episode which is fun oh good pause the
progression<00:04:51.110> just<00:04:51.710> I<00:04:51.979> guess<00:04:52.160> this<00:04:52.340> episode

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
progression just I guess this episode

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.400 
progression just I guess this episode
was<00:04:52.970> kind<00:04:53.180> of<00:04:53.210> lacking<00:04:53.450> compared<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.260> the

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
was kind of lacking compared to the

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.870 
was kind of lacking compared to the
other<00:04:54.650> episodes<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.400> main<00:04:55.580> thing<00:04:55.760> that<00:04:55.790> makes

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
other episodes the main thing that makes

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.480 
other episodes the main thing that makes
this<00:04:56.120> episode<00:04:56.600> so<00:04:57.139> good<00:04:57.500> is<00:04:57.830> because<00:04:58.190> the

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
this episode so good is because the

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.040 
this episode so good is because the
dragons<00:04:59.030> were<00:04:59.180> there<00:04:59.330> this<00:04:59.510> entire<00:04:59.840> episode

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
dragons were there this entire episode

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.110 
dragons were there this entire episode
kicking<00:05:00.800> some<00:05:00.950> fucking<00:05:01.280> ass<00:05:01.400> or<00:05:01.610> just<00:05:02.000> their
