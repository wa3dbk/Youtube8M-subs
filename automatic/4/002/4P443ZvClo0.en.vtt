stumbled upon that doing quads one day

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.660 
stumbled upon that doing quads one day
which<00:00:33.629> quads<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.710> you're<00:00:35.010> not<00:00:35.190> familiar<00:00:35.340> with

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
which quads if you're not familiar with

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.410 
which quads if you're not familiar with
them<00:00:35.970> are<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.620> fill<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.430> done<00:00:38.699> by<00:00:38.730> playing

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
them are a fill that are done by playing

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.590 
them are a fill that are done by playing
two<00:00:39.890> strokes<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> toms<00:00:41.550> two<00:00:42.000> strokes<00:00:42.390> on

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the kick drum and so it's con goes like

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:56.480 
the kick drum and so it's con goes like
this

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
so you notice that last one was a triple

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.160 
so you notice that last one was a triple

to play those three strokes right in a

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.160 
to play those three strokes right in a
row<00:02:00.520> it's<00:02:00.910> going<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.179> take<00:02:01.390> some<00:02:01.600> technique<00:02:01.990> so

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
row it's going to take some technique so

row it's going to take some technique so
what<00:02:02.319> I'll<00:02:02.410> do<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:03.300> zoom<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.479> camera<00:02:04.509> in<00:02:04.990> on<00:02:05.140> my

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
what I'll do is zoom the camera in on my

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.260 
what I'll do is zoom the camera in on my
foot<00:02:05.530> on<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.800> triple<00:02:06.130> stroke<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.640> let<00:02:07.119> you

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
foot on the triple stroke and let you

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.609 
foot on the triple stroke and let you
see<00:02:07.420> how<00:02:07.569> it<00:02:07.720> sounds<00:02:08.110> I'll<00:02:08.289> play<00:02:08.470> it<00:02:08.560> again

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619

here<00:02:08.950> real<00:02:09.100> quick

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.600 

so<00:02:12.569> I'll<00:02:12.720> zoom<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.080> camera<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.920> play<00:02:14.520> it

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
so I'll zoom the camera in and play it

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:23.300 
so I'll zoom the camera in and play it
for<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.910> few<00:02:15.060> times

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.190 

so<00:02:24.310> I'll<00:02:24.370> play<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:24.730> same<00:02:25.300> figure<00:02:25.780> again<00:02:26.020> now

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
so I'll play that same figure again now

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.250 
so I'll play that same figure again now
that<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.530> can<00:02:26.710> see<00:02:26.860> what<00:02:27.190> my<00:02:27.340> foot<00:02:27.520> is<00:02:27.640> doing

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.380 

so<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.290> talked<00:02:34.560> about<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.010> before<00:02:35.220> doing<00:02:36.209> a

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
so I talked about this before doing a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.180 
so I talked about this before doing a
double<00:02:36.720> stroke<00:02:39.410> my<00:02:40.410> foot<00:02:40.680> almost<00:02:41.010> just

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
double stroke my foot almost just

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.190 
double stroke my foot almost just
bounces<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.819> pedal<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.330> I'll<00:02:42.420> slow<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.900> down

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
bounces the pedal so I'll slow that down

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.690 
bounces the pedal so I'll slow that down
and<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.709> see<00:02:43.950> what<00:02:44.130> I'm<00:02:44.220> doing<00:02:44.489> on<00:02:44.610> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
and you can see what I'm doing on the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:03:00.890 
and you can see what I'm doing on the
triple<00:02:45.030> stroke<00:02:59.120> so<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.209> can<00:03:00.360> also<00:03:00.480> use<00:03:00.720> that

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
triple stroke so you can also use that

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.509 
triple stroke so you can also use that
triple<00:03:01.290> stroke<00:03:01.560> if<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.860> were<00:03:01.980> splitting<00:03:02.340> up

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
triple stroke if you were splitting up

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.740 
triple stroke if you were splitting up
sextuplets<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.630> fill<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:04.170> instance<00:03:05.750> triple

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
sextuplets in a fill for instance triple

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.270 
sextuplets in a fill for instance triple
it<00:03:11.569> so<00:03:12.569> if<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.810> need<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.709> come<00:03:13.860> back<00:03:14.040> into

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
it so if you need that to come back into

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.250 
it so if you need that to come back into
another<00:03:14.730> measure<00:03:15.180> on<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.569> downbeat<00:03:16.019> where

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
another measure on the downbeat where

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.690 
another measure on the downbeat where
you're<00:03:16.410> hitting<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.739> cymbal<00:03:17.099> maybe<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.670> you

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
you're hitting a cymbal maybe and you

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:40.130 
you're hitting a cymbal maybe and you
want<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:17.970> kick<00:03:18.150> drum<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.510> would<00:03:18.630> go<00:03:18.750> like<00:03:18.780> this

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.030 

so<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.230> can<00:03:41.350> see<00:03:41.470> that's<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.740> little<00:03:41.830> bit

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
so you can see that's a little bit

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.780 
so you can see that's a little bit
harder<00:03:42.580> there<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.150> squeeze<00:03:43.390> those<00:03:43.750> in

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
harder there to squeeze those in

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.040 
harder there to squeeze those in
recently<00:03:45.790> I've<00:03:46.000> been<00:03:46.150> experimenting<00:03:46.600> with

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
recently I've been experimenting with

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.590 
recently I've been experimenting with
the<00:03:47.170> tension<00:03:47.440> on<00:03:47.710> my<00:03:47.910> bass<00:03:48.910> drum<00:03:49.240> where<00:03:49.450> my

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
the tension on my bass drum where my

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.900 
the tension on my bass drum where my
kick<00:03:49.780> drum<00:03:49.810> pedal<00:03:50.410> spring<00:03:50.800> just<00:03:51.520> recently

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
kick drum pedal spring just recently

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.830 
kick drum pedal spring just recently
reading<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.300> modern<00:03:52.900> drummer<00:03:54.420> was<00:03:55.420> it<00:03:55.570> Joey

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840

Jordison<00:03:56.700> from<00:03:57.700> Slipknot<00:03:58.270> just<00:03:58.600> talking

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
Jordison from Slipknot just talking

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.930 
Jordison from Slipknot just talking
about<00:03:59.080> how<00:03:59.230> he<00:03:59.290> just<00:03:59.560> cranks<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.430> tension<00:04:00.850> on

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
about how he just cranks the tension on

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.990 
about how he just cranks the tension on
his<00:04:01.150> pedal<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:01.690> so<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:02.709> I<00:04:03.040> kind<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.430> tighten

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
his pedal and so I I kind of tighten

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.610 
his pedal and so I I kind of tighten
mine<00:04:04.180> up<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.510> little<00:04:04.750> bit<00:04:04.930> usually<00:04:05.440> I'll<00:04:05.590> have

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
mine up a little bit usually I'll have

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.100 
mine up a little bit usually I'll have
the<00:04:05.920> spring<00:04:06.430> on<00:04:06.610> there<00:04:06.850> just<00:04:07.600> tight<00:04:07.840> enough<00:04:07.870> so

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
the spring on there just tight enough so

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.840 
the spring on there just tight enough so
that<00:04:08.260> doesn't<00:04:08.650> rattle<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.250> tightened<00:04:09.670> it<00:04:09.700> up

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
that doesn't rattle so I tightened it up

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.330 
that doesn't rattle so I tightened it up
a<00:04:09.940> little<00:04:10.060> bit<00:04:10.300> now<00:04:10.870> almost<00:04:11.140> has<00:04:11.860> given<00:04:12.190> me<00:04:12.310> a

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
a little bit now almost has given me a

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.940 
a little bit now almost has given me a
little<00:04:12.610> bit<00:04:12.760> of<00:04:12.989> resistance<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.440> ability<00:04:14.860> to

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
little bit of resistance and ability to

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.710 
little bit of resistance and ability to
play<00:04:15.070> those<00:04:15.310> double<00:04:15.640> strokes<00:04:15.880> so<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:16.329> really

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
play those double strokes so I really

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.990 
play those double strokes so I really
recommend<00:04:17.100> experimenting<00:04:18.100> with<00:04:18.250> that<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.700> kind

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
recommend experimenting with that I kind

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.240 
recommend experimenting with that I kind
of<00:04:19.060> get<00:04:19.180> comfortable<00:04:19.810> in<00:04:20.109> one<00:04:20.590> setting<00:04:20.950> but

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
of get comfortable in one setting but

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.920 
of get comfortable in one setting but
then<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.489> forget<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.910> experiment<00:04:22.540> every<00:04:22.750> once

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
then I forget to experiment every once

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.390 
then I forget to experiment every once
in<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.080> while<00:04:23.169> that's<00:04:23.380> good<00:04:23.680> thing<00:04:23.890> to<00:04:24.010> do<00:04:24.190> I

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
in a while that's good thing to do I

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.820 
in a while that's good thing to do I
