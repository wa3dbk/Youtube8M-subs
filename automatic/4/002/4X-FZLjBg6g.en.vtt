fish<00:00:29.849> into<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> system<00:00:31.380> but<00:00:31.500> let's<00:00:31.679> get<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
fish into the system but let's get a

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
little tunnel right here in the middle

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.219 
little tunnel right here in the middle
for<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> fish<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.420> swim<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.930> out<00:01:13.020> of

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
for the fish to swim in and out of

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.640 
for the fish to swim in and out of
there's<00:01:13.439> lots<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:14.010> places<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.640> place<00:01:14.909> corals

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
there's lots of places to place corals

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.440 
there's lots of places to place corals
if<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.860> side<00:01:17.490> shot<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:19.470> what<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.710> looks<00:01:19.860> like

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
if you side shot and what it looks like

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.820 
if you side shot and what it looks like
trying<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.540> see<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:21.810> there's<00:01:22.170> some<00:01:22.350> levels

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
trying to see like there's some levels

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.120 
trying to see like there's some levels
here<00:01:23.960> definitely<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.259> could<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> lot<00:01:25.860> with

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
here definitely you could do a lot with

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.760 
here definitely you could do a lot with
corals<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.790> aquascaping<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.320> comes<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
corals and aquascaping when it comes to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.920 
corals and aquascaping when it comes to
this<00:01:28.890> rock<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.990> next<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:32.270> it's<00:01:33.270> kind<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.720> like

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
this rock the next one it's kind of like

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.350 
this rock the next one it's kind of like
a<00:01:33.960> u-shaped<00:01:34.799> which<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.610> really<00:01:35.939> good<00:01:36.150> because

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
a u-shaped which is really good because

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.140 
a u-shaped which is really good because
it<00:01:36.750> actually<00:01:37.110> hides<00:01:37.350> most<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> overflow

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
it actually hides most of the overflow

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.690 
it actually hides most of the overflow
box<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.380> kind<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.829> pushed<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.490> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
box and I kind of just pushed it in to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.300 
box and I kind of just pushed it in to
sit<00:01:41.970> right<00:01:42.240> next<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> overflow<00:01:43.100> that<00:01:44.100> way

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
sit right next to the overflow that way

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.789 
sit right next to the overflow that way
it<00:01:44.460> kind<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.790> hides<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.299> if<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.079> pan<00:01:46.320> up<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.619> little

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
it kind of hides it if I pan up a little

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.179 
it kind of hides it if I pan up a little
you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.310> see<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.420> as<00:01:48.630> well<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.799> one<00:01:50.009> also

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
you can see that as well this one also

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.429 
you can see that as well this one also
has<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.909> bit<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.240> character<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.259> got<00:01:52.380> a

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
excited about life rock I don't know

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.740 
excited about life rock I don't know
maybe<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.590> me<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.360> then<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.479> last
