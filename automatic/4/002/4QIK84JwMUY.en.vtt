I<00:01:05.810> actually<00:01:06.810> remember<00:01:07.260> my<00:01:07.710> brother<00:01:08.010> playing

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
I actually remember my brother playing

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.510 
I actually remember my brother playing
quake<00:01:08.880> fairly<00:01:09.630> often<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.380> also<00:01:10.920> remember<00:01:11.400> that

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
quake fairly often I also remember that

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.270 
quake fairly often I also remember that
I<00:01:11.580> never<00:01:12.060> ever<00:01:12.210> got<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.780> chance<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.229> play<00:01:13.470> just

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
I never ever got a chance to play just

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.050 
I never ever got a chance to play just
as<00:01:14.460> well<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> sucked<00:01:15.299> at<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.810> then<00:01:16.080> all

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
as well I sucked at it like then all

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.929 
as well I sucked at it like then all
these<00:01:18.060> low-res<00:01:18.869> textures<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.799> polygons<00:01:20.369> were

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
these low-res textures and polygons were

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.410 
these low-res textures and polygons were
actually<00:01:21.360> breaking<00:01:21.869> edge<00:01:22.290> back<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> 90s

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.780 

now<00:01:28.020> Call<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> Duty<00:01:28.830> is<00:01:28.920> actually<00:01:29.310> based<00:01:29.550> on

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
now Call of Duty is actually based on

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.750 
now Call of Duty is actually based on
the<00:01:30.120> quake<00:01:30.479> 3<00:01:30.900> game<00:01:31.380> engine<00:01:31.800> which<00:01:32.370> came<00:01:32.610> out

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
the quake 3 game engine which came out

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.010 
the quake 3 game engine which came out
in<00:01:32.909> 1999<00:01:34.729> you<00:01:35.729> probably<00:01:36.090> can't<00:01:36.360> tell<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.990> by

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
in 1999 you probably can't tell just by

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.230 
in 1999 you probably can't tell just by
looking<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:37.800> this<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.790> actually<00:01:39.210> a

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
looking at it but this is actually a

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.740 
looking at it but this is actually a
very<00:01:39.720> versatile<00:01:40.440> engine<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:41.250> its<00:01:41.340> time<00:01:44.750> so

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
very versatile engine for its time so

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.420 
very versatile engine for its time so
this<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.110> Call<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.380> Duty<00:01:46.500> 1<00:01:46.979> which<00:01:47.250> was

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
this is Call of Duty 1 which was

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.030 
this is Call of Duty 1 which was
released<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.060> 2003<00:01:48.900> by<00:01:49.229> Infinity<00:01:49.860> Ward<00:01:52.040> so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
released in 2003 by Infinity Ward so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.880 
released in 2003 by Infinity Ward so
this<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> first<00:01:53.810> adaptation<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:55.020> the
