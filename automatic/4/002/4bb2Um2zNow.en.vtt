were confirmed playing healer is by far

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.840 
were confirmed playing healer is by far
the<00:01:13.619> hardest<00:01:13.830> thing<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> game<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the hardest thing to do in the game a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.460 
the hardest thing to do in the game a
lot<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.330> people<00:01:15.420> say<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.080> know<00:01:16.229> this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
lot of people say that you know this

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
lot of people say that you know this
expansion<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.280> particularly<00:01:17.850> hard<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.420> heal

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
expansion was particularly hard to heal

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.999 
expansion was particularly hard to heal
and<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.170> might<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.439> true<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.740> might<00:01:19.860> be

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and I that might be true it might be

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.830 
and I that might be true it might be
harder<00:01:20.280> than<00:01:20.310> usual<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.150> think<00:01:21.479> healing

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
harder than usual but I think healing

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.240 
harder than usual but I think healing
has<00:01:21.960> always<00:01:22.320> been<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> hardest<00:01:22.799> thing<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.100> do

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
has always been the hardest thing to do

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.420 
has always been the hardest thing to do
in<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> game<00:01:23.720> just<00:01:24.720> because<00:01:25.380> your<00:01:26.040> mistakes

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.479 
scenarios I get myself into are pretty
tough<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.689> I<00:03:00.720> like<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.959> heal<00:03:01.079> tsg<00:03:01.620> because<00:03:02.340> it

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
tough and I like to heal tsg because it

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.800 
tough and I like to heal tsg because it
makes<00:03:02.639> the<00:03:02.790> positioning<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.389> hard<00:03:03.569> I<00:03:03.689> was

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
makes the positioning so hard I was

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.990 
makes the positioning so hard I was
playing<00:03:04.019> some<00:03:04.230> hunter<00:03:04.620> warlock<00:03:05.069> miss<00:03:05.819> Weaver

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
playing some hunter warlock miss Weaver

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.869 
playing some hunter warlock miss Weaver
like<00:03:06.420> double<00:03:06.750> ranged<00:03:07.139> me<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.829> that<00:03:08.459> was<00:03:08.609> much

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
like double ranged me and that was much

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.490 
like double ranged me and that was much
more<00:03:08.909> manageable<00:03:09.269> positioning<00:03:10.049> wise<00:03:10.200> just

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
more manageable positioning wise just

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.349 
more manageable positioning wise just
because<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.889> range<00:03:11.129> gps<00:03:11.549> or<00:03:11.700> way<00:03:11.909> easier<00:03:12.269> to

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
because to range gps or way easier to

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.490 
because to range gps or way easier to
heal<00:03:12.510> because<00:03:12.659> they're<00:03:12.930> typically<00:03:13.290> going<00:03:13.409> to

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
heal because they're typically going to

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.979 
heal because they're typically going to
be<00:03:13.560> closer<00:03:13.859> to<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.189> pillar<00:03:14.459> closer<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.269> not

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
be closer to a pillar closer to you not

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.539 
be closer to a pillar closer to you not
get<00:03:16.230> me<00:03:16.349> running<00:03:16.590> around<00:03:16.650> as<00:03:16.920> much<00:03:17.099> but<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.370> like

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
get me running around as much but I like

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.479 
get me running around as much but I like
healing<00:03:17.760> tsg<00:03:18.269> because<00:03:18.599> it's<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:19.190> tactic<00:03:20.190> the

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
healing tsg because it's a tactic the

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.400 
healing tsg because it's a tactic the
games<00:03:20.699> are<00:03:20.970> for<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.510> most<00:03:21.540> part<00:03:21.750> pretty<00:03:22.049> quick

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
games are for the most part pretty quick

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.860 
games are for the most part pretty quick
and<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:23.639> like<00:03:23.819> that<00:03:23.970> it's<00:03:24.150> it's<00:03:24.359> really<00:03:24.540> fast

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
and I like that it's it's really fast

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.780 
and I like that it's it's really fast
paced<00:03:25.169> there's<00:03:25.470> not<00:03:25.620> like<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:25.919> was<00:03:26.069> healed<00:03:26.459> some

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
paced there's not like I was healed some

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.640 
paced there's not like I was healed some
