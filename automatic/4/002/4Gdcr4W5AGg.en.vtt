00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
so but yeah then I've not completely

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.570 
so but yeah then I've not completely
ruled<00:02:16.230> out<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.470> other<00:02:16.620> games<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.040> will<00:02:17.250> do<00:02:17.400> some

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
ruled out in other games I will do some

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.460 
ruled out in other games I will do some
GTA<00:02:17.730> videos<00:02:18.300> that's<00:02:18.480> for<00:02:18.600> sure<00:02:18.750> I'll<00:02:19.170> try<00:02:19.440> and

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
GTA videos that's for sure I'll try and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.020 
GTA videos that's for sure I'll try and
make<00:02:19.620> them<00:02:19.770> driving<00:02:20.010> focused<00:02:20.550> on<00:02:20.820> how<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
make them driving focused on how the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.910 
make them driving focused on how the
channels<00:02:21.360> going<00:02:21.600> but<00:02:22.110> also<00:02:22.290> not<00:02:22.530> completely

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
channels going but also not completely

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.490 
channels going but also not completely
ruled<00:02:23.100> out<00:02:23.390> doing<00:02:24.390> other<00:02:24.510> games<00:02:24.750> eventually

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
ruled out doing other games eventually

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.270 
ruled out doing other games eventually
as<00:02:25.590> well<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.440> know<00:02:28.740> it<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:28.890> friends<00:02:29.190> how

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
as well so you know it just friends how

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.410 
as well so you know it just friends how
it<00:02:29.370> goes<00:02:29.490> if<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.700> racing<00:02:30.000> things<00:02:30.120> go<00:02:30.240> really

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
it goes if the racing things go really

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.620 
it goes if the racing things go really
well<00:02:30.600> then<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.840> won't<00:02:30.960> need<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:32.240> better<00:02:33.240> racing

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
well then I won't need to better racing

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.960 
well then I won't need to better racing
things<00:02:33.810> kind<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.340> not<00:02:35.340> doing<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.550> great<00:02:35.670> then

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
things kind of not doing that great then

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.160 
things kind of not doing that great then
I'll<00:02:36.060> probably<00:02:36.180> start<00:02:36.570> branching<00:02:36.780> out<00:02:36.990> but

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
I'll probably start branching out but

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.390 
I'll probably start branching out but
we'll<00:02:37.410> see<00:02:37.560> how<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.770> goes<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.130> future

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
we'll see how that goes in the future

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.060 
we'll see how that goes in the future
anyway<00:02:38.930> but<00:02:39.930> yeah<00:02:40.020> for<00:02:40.230> now<00:02:40.260> I'm<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.650> moved

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
anyway but yeah for now I'm just moved

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.170 
anyway but yeah for now I'm just moved
if<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.370> racing<00:02:41.640> game<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:41.970> looking

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
know so we'll figure that out but I sort

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.930 
know so we'll figure that out but I sort
of<00:03:01.650> might<00:03:01.739> be<00:03:01.830> quite<00:03:01.980> fun<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.400> series<00:03:02.760> and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
of might be quite fun to a series and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.540 
of might be quite fun to a series and
there<00:03:03.600> we<00:03:03.690> go<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.970> driving<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.180> channel<00:03:06.720> update

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
there we go so driving a channel update

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.110 
there we go so driving a channel update
certainly<00:03:08.550> been<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.670> bit<00:03:08.790> different<00:03:09.000> i<00:03:09.030> hope

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
certainly been a bit different i hope

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.490 
certainly been a bit different i hope
you<00:03:09.209> can<00:03:09.360> hear<00:03:09.510> me<00:03:09.570> everything<00:03:09.989> if<00:03:10.110> not<00:03:10.140> really

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
you can hear me everything if not really

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.350 
you can hear me everything if not really
a<00:03:10.580> three<00:03:11.580> minutes<00:03:11.820> in<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.970> bit<00:03:12.090> late<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:12.300> you

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
a three minutes in a bit late so you

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.090 
a three minutes in a bit late so you
think<00:03:12.510> about<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:13.019> I'm<00:03:13.739> doing<00:03:13.980> my<00:03:14.070> best

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
think about that but I'm doing my best

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.160 
think about that but I'm doing my best
and<00:03:14.489> just<00:03:14.600> driving<00:03:15.600> home<00:03:15.630> from<00:03:15.750> works<00:03:15.989> in<00:03:16.140> a
