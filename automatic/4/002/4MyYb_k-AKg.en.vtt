I'm hoping that what my gut is right and
I<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.239> have<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.450> feeling<00:02:58.840> it's<00:02:58.959> gonna<00:02:59.140> go

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
I and I have a feeling it's gonna go

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.640 
I and I have a feeling it's gonna go
even<00:02:59.530> lower<00:02:59.830> so<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.430> kept<00:03:01.120> some<00:03:01.420> cash<00:03:01.900> aside<00:03:02.350> to

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
even lower so I kept some cash aside to

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.740 
even lower so I kept some cash aside to
to<00:03:03.459> get<00:03:03.640> some<00:03:03.910> more<00:03:04.090> when<00:03:04.269> it<00:03:04.360> does<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:06.750> that's

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
to get some more when it does so that's

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.199 
to get some more when it does so that's
about<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.310> as<00:03:09.310> long<00:03:09.519> as<00:03:09.549> they're<00:03:09.790> gonna<00:03:09.940> keep

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
about it as long as they're gonna keep

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.940 
about it as long as they're gonna keep
printing<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:11.049> you<00:03:12.450> know<00:03:13.450> there's<00:03:13.750> no<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:14.500> mean
