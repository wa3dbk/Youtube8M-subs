00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
to this and the semi stainless steel

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.940 
to this and the semi stainless steel
we've<00:01:26.250> got<00:01:26.579> and<00:01:27.299> these<00:01:27.840> are<00:01:27.990> also<00:01:28.140> mid<00:01:28.530> height

we've got and these are also mid height
kind<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.369> about<00:01:29.520> fifty<00:01:30.240> millimeters<00:01:30.720> maybe

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
kind of about fifty millimeters maybe

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.230 
kind of about fifty millimeters maybe
fifty-one<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.220> quite<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.460> tall<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:33.060> these

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
fifty-one so not quite as tall as these

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.120 
fifty-one so not quite as tall as these
but<00:01:33.420> not<00:01:33.570> super<00:01:33.990> short<00:01:34.200> either<00:01:34.439> good

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130

middle-of-the-road

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
middle-of-the-road

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.719 
middle-of-the-road
we've<00:01:36.329> got<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> shorter<00:01:37.470> all<00:01:37.680> stainless<00:01:38.340> sakai

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
we've got a shorter all stainless sakai

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.960 
we've got a shorter all stainless sakai
takayuki<00:01:39.540> stainless<00:01:40.350> Damascus<00:01:40.950> wah<00:01:41.579> handled

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
takayuki stainless Damascus wah handled

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.520 
takayuki stainless Damascus wah handled
about<00:01:42.090> forty<00:01:42.479> five<00:01:42.630> millimeter<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.380> is

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
about forty five millimeter so this is

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.080 
about forty five millimeter so this is
shorter<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> shorter<00:01:44.729> nakiri

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
shorter so if you like a shorter nakiri

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
shorter so if you like a shorter nakiri
it's<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:45.750> stainless<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.320> might<00:01:46.469> be<00:01:46.619> right

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
it's all stainless this might be right
