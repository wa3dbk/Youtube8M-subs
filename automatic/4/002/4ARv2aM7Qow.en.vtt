movie appearance the Atari portfolio I'm
not<00:00:35.010> sure<00:00:35.340> when<00:00:35.579> they<00:00:35.700> stopped<00:00:36.149> making<00:00:36.660> them

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
not sure when they stopped making them

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.490 
not sure when they stopped making them
but<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:38.910> made<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.120> 1989<00:00:40.020> which<00:00:40.290> was

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
but this one was made in 1989 which was

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.360 
but this one was made in 1989 which was
the<00:00:40.680> year<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.920> was<00:00:41.010> introduced<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:43.370> acquired

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the year it was introduced and acquired

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.799 
the year it was introduced and acquired
a<00:00:44.550> little<00:00:44.789> bit<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.000> work<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.390> get<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.629> working

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
a little bit of work to get it working

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:46.430 
a little bit of work to get it working
again

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
again

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.650 
again
but<00:00:47.219> nothing<00:00:47.610> serious<00:00:47.989> here<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:50.570> what<00:00:51.570> I've

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
but nothing serious here it is what I've

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.930 
but nothing serious here it is what I've
had<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.440> machine<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:53.160> relocate

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
had to do to this machine was relocate

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.689 
had to do to this machine was relocate
the<00:00:54.390> screen<00:00:54.899> hinges<00:00:55.320> because<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:56.579> were

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the screen hinges because they were

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.639 
the screen hinges because they were
there<00:00:57.239> were<00:00:57.329> too<00:00:57.570> stiff<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.199> fact<00:00:58.440> they<00:00:58.590> were

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
there were too stiff in fact they were

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.560 
there were too stiff in fact they were
so<00:00:58.949> stiff<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.609> thought<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> plastic<00:01:00.449> was

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
so stiff that I thought the plastic was

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.360 
so stiff that I thought the plastic was
going<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.899> break<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.289> luckily<00:01:01.530> there<00:01:01.949> there

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
going to break but luckily there there

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.899 
going to break but luckily there there
were<00:01:02.489> no<00:01:02.699> signs<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.300> damage<00:01:04.460> other<00:01:05.460> than<00:01:05.640> that

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
were no signs of damage other than that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.539 
were no signs of damage other than that
it<00:01:06.180> had<00:01:06.360> sat<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:07.020> about<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.470> couple<00:01:07.799> years<00:01:08.340> or

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
it had sat for about a couple years or

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.500 
it had sat for about a couple years or
so<00:01:09.409> before<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.680> was<00:01:10.740> last<00:01:11.070> turned<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.330> when

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
so before it was last turned on so when

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.480 
so before it was last turned on so when
I<00:01:12.540> got<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.049> time<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.470> go<00:01:13.590> power<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.159> after

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
I got it time to go power it up after

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.910 
I got it time to go power it up after
putting<00:01:14.790> fresh<00:01:15.090> batteries<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.229> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
putting fresh batteries in it and it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.149 
putting fresh batteries in it and it
wouldn't<00:01:17.189> turn<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:18.229> took<00:01:19.229> several<00:01:19.530> attempts

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
wouldn't turn on took several attempts

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.499 
wouldn't turn on took several attempts
it<00:01:20.310> still<00:01:20.610> wouldn't<00:01:20.880> turn<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.479> I

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
it still wouldn't turn on so I

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.240 
it still wouldn't turn on so I
disassembled<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.590> checked<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.070> for

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
disassembled it and I checked it for

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.010 
disassembled it and I checked it for
damage<00:01:23.640> during<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.090> didn't<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.780> see

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
damage during I didn't really see

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.980 
damage during I didn't really see
anything<00:01:25.470> wrong<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.880> put<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.869> back

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
anything wrong with it I put it back

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.300 
anything wrong with it I put it back
together<00:01:28.170> again<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.619> let<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.100> sit<00:01:29.280> overnight

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
together again I let it sit overnight

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.270 
together again I let it sit overnight
with<00:01:30.240> fresh<00:01:30.509> batteries<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.920> turned<00:01:32.159> on

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
with fresh batteries and it turned on

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.149 
with fresh batteries and it turned on
the<00:01:32.460> next<00:01:32.700> morning<00:01:33.060> without<00:01:33.150> any<00:01:33.390> problems

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
a little bit about this machine it is

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.850 
a little bit about this machine it is
running<00:01:41.130> ms-dos<00:01:42.590> actually<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.770> I'm

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
running ms-dos actually you know I'm

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.080 
running ms-dos actually you know I'm
sorry<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.310> not<00:01:44.490> ms-dos<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.479> dip<00:01:46.320> dot<00:01:47.090> and

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
sorry it's not ms-dos it's dip dot and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.030 
sorry it's not ms-dos it's dip dot and
that<00:01:48.270> stands<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:51.079> the<00:01:52.079> hell<00:01:52.290> does<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.590> stand

it responds to most of the same commands
this<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.210> actually<00:02:14.720> dip<00:02:14.960> dose<00:02:15.170> 2.11<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:20.170> it

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
this is actually dip dose 2.11 and it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.530 
this is actually dip dose 2.11 and it
does<00:02:21.980> respond<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.850> commands<00:02:23.210> pretty

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
does respond to the commands pretty

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.510 
does respond to the commands pretty
easily<00:02:23.800> like<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:24.950> can<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:27.290> know<00:02:27.380> change

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
and there it is so anyway how does it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.660 
and there it is so anyway how does it
work<00:02:48.709> okay

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
work okay

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.430

well<00:04:17.630> I'm<00:04:17.720> not<00:04:17.840> going<00:04:18.019> to<00:04:18.079> take<00:04:18.200> it<00:04:18.260> out

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
well I'm not going to take it out

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.560 
well I'm not going to take it out
because<00:04:18.560> I<00:04:18.769> have<00:04:18.919> stuff<00:04:19.130> in<00:04:19.310> there<00:04:19.430> but<00:04:19.609> the

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
because I have stuff in there but the

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.180 
because I have stuff in there but the

this door out give that in the camera
right<00:04:25.669> here<00:04:27.460> let's<00:04:28.460> take<00:04:28.610> another<00:04:28.760> close-up

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
right here let's take another close-up

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.940 
right here let's take another close-up
look<00:04:29.539> at<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.840> machine<00:04:30.169> with<00:04:30.349> the<00:04:30.380> memory<00:04:30.710> card
