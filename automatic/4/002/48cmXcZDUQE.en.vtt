00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:27.659 
the season finale I didn't really like
that<00:06:20.290> episode<00:06:20.830> that<00:06:21.010> much<00:06:21.190> so<00:06:26.070> you<00:06:27.070> can<00:06:27.370> buy

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
that episode that much so you can buy

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:34.440 
that episode that much so you can buy
this<00:06:27.729> in<00:06:30.060> both<00:06:31.740> just<00:06:32.740> the<00:06:33.040> flat<00:06:33.460> box<00:06:33.760> or<00:06:34.150> you

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.450 
this in both just the flat box or you

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.129 
this in both just the flat box or you
can<00:06:34.479> get<00:06:34.780> it<00:06:34.900> with<00:06:35.050> the<00:06:35.290> crusty<00:06:36.280> head<00:06:36.460> but<00:06:37.139> you

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
can get it with the crusty head but you

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:39.780 
can get it with the crusty head but you
can't<00:06:38.350> get<00:06:38.560> that<00:06:38.740> you<00:06:39.040> can't<00:06:39.280> get<00:06:39.370> the<00:06:39.460> crusty

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
can't get that you can't get the crusty

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.450 
can't get that you can't get the crusty
head<00:06:39.940> in<00:06:40.060> stores<00:06:40.360> because<00:06:40.810> it<00:06:41.229> was<00:06:41.410> a<00:06:41.460> limited

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
head in stores because it was a limited

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.120 
head in stores because it was a limited
edition<00:06:42.850> I<00:06:43.360> think<00:06:43.539> you<00:06:43.630> can<00:06:43.810> get<00:06:43.960> that<00:06:44.110> on<00:06:44.680> eBay

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
edition I think you can get that on eBay

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.439 
edition I think you can get that on eBay
or<00:06:45.389> something<00:06:46.389> I<00:06:47.280> don't<00:06:48.280> know<00:06:48.370> I<00:06:48.669> don't<00:06:49.240> have

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
or something I don't know I don't have

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:55.650 
or something I don't know I don't have
an<00:06:49.539> eBay<00:06:49.660> account<00:06:50.110> so<00:06:52.800> it's<00:06:54.419> probably<00:06:55.419> worth

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
an eBay account so it's probably worth

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.659 
an eBay account so it's probably worth
the<00:06:55.930> money<00:06:56.169> if<00:06:56.380> you're<00:06:56.560> willing<00:06:56.979> to<00:06:59.400> watch<00:07:00.400> the

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
the money if you're willing to watch the

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:06.920 
the money if you're willing to watch the
episodes<00:07:01.180> more<00:07:01.539> than<00:07:01.720> twice<00:07:04.349> the

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
episodes more than twice the

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.320
