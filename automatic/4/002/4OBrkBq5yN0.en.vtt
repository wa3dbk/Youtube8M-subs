00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.690 

what<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.319> like<00:03:31.530> about<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:31.920> medium<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.520> that

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
what I like about this medium is that

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.729 
what I like about this medium is that
when<00:03:32.819> you<00:03:32.910> mix<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.270> with<00:03:33.420> paint<00:03:33.720> as<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.590> have

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
when you mix it with paint as I have

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.780 
when you mix it with paint as I have
done<00:03:35.010> here<00:03:36.530> it<00:03:37.530> flows<00:03:37.830> onto<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.190> canvas<00:03:38.430> real

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
done here it flows onto the canvas real

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.610 
done here it flows onto the canvas real
quickly<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.180> easily<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:39.599> just<00:03:39.900> spread<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:40.410> on

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
quickly and easily I just spread this on

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.530 
quickly and easily I just spread this on
in<00:03:40.770> a<00:03:40.860> matter<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.340> few<00:03:41.599> seconds<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:43.709> then

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
in a matter of a few seconds and then

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.020 
in a matter of a few seconds and then
you'll<00:03:45.540> see<00:03:45.690> in<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:45.840> next<00:03:46.140> picture<00:03:46.319> I<00:03:47.030> wipe

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
you'll see in this next picture I wipe

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.090 
you'll see in this next picture I wipe
it<00:03:48.180> down<00:03:48.390> with<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.900> rag<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:49.590> now<00:03:49.739> it's<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.920> very

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
it down with a rag so now it's a very

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.160 
it down with a rag so now it's a very
thin<00:03:50.400> coating<00:03:50.790> now<00:03:51.090> this<00:03:51.270> will<00:03:51.420> become<00:03:51.569> it'll

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
thin coating now this will become it'll

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.229 
thin coating now this will become it'll
dry<00:03:52.380> fairly<00:03:52.620> quickly<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.160> become<00:03:53.790> kind<00:03:54.150> of

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
dry fairly quickly and become kind of

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.990 
dry fairly quickly and become kind of
sticky<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.840> it's<00:03:55.350> it's<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.370> feeling<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.819> I

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
sticky and it's it's a feeling that I

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.180 
sticky and it's it's a feeling that I
like<00:03:57.209> when<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.450> paint

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.170 

so<00:04:02.790> I'm<00:04:03.270> going<00:04:03.360> to

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
so I'm going to

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.420 
so I'm going to
in<00:04:04.329> the<00:04:04.450> drawing<00:04:04.750> now<00:04:05.019> now<00:04:05.439> in<00:04:05.590> this<00:04:05.709> case<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:06.159> am

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
in the drawing now now in this case I am

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.449 
in the drawing now now in this case I am
drawing<00:04:07.090> with<00:04:07.420> paint<00:04:07.750> on<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.930> paintbrush<00:04:08.459> but

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
drawing with paint on a paintbrush but

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.429 
drawing with paint on a paintbrush but
the<00:04:09.640> process<00:04:10.209> is<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.569> same<00:04:10.599> as<00:04:11.049> if<00:04:11.200> I<00:04:11.319> were

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
the process is the same as if I were

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.420 
the process is the same as if I were
drawing<00:04:11.709> with<00:04:11.859> charcoal<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:14.159> really<00:04:15.159> the<00:04:15.310> way

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
drawing with charcoal and really the way

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.640 
drawing with charcoal and really the way
I<00:04:15.459> paint<00:04:15.879> is<00:04:16.180> I<00:04:16.209> put<00:04:16.539> something<00:04:16.780> down<00:04:17.199> and<00:04:17.500> then

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
I paint is I put something down and then

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.710 
I paint is I put something down and then
make<00:04:17.859> a<00:04:17.889> judgement<00:04:18.430> about<00:04:18.489> it<00:04:18.820> in<00:04:18.940> most<00:04:19.479> cases

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
make a judgement about it in most cases

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.840 
make a judgement about it in most cases
I<00:04:20.019> find<00:04:20.289> that<00:04:20.410> what<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.590> put<00:04:20.829> down<00:04:21.039> is<00:04:21.250> wrong<00:04:21.549> and

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
I find that what I put down is wrong and

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.150 
I find that what I put down is wrong and
so<00:04:21.910> I<00:04:22.300> have<00:04:22.449> to<00:04:22.539> correct<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:22.960> so<00:04:23.410> for<00:04:23.680> me<00:04:23.830> doing

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
so I have to correct it so for me doing

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.520 
so I have to correct it so for me doing
an<00:04:24.370> oil<00:04:24.729> painting<00:04:25.090> especially<00:04:25.330> a<00:04:25.720> portrait<00:04:26.199> it

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
an oil painting especially a portrait it

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.390 
an oil painting especially a portrait it
is<00:04:26.979> a<00:04:27.030> an<00:04:28.030> extended<00:04:28.600> series<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:29.400> corrections

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
is a an extended series of corrections

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.790 
is a an extended series of corrections
to<00:04:30.699> a<00:04:30.729> bad<00:04:31.389> drawing<00:04:31.690> or<00:04:31.870> bad<00:04:32.020> painting<00:04:32.500> so

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
to a bad drawing or bad painting so

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.100 
to a bad drawing or bad painting so
that's<00:04:33.699> what<00:04:33.880> you'll<00:04:34.000> see<00:04:34.150> here<00:04:34.389> and<00:04:34.570> then

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
that's what you'll see here and then
