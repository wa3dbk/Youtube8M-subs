to have excellent build quality it feels

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.190 
to have excellent build quality it feels
like<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.700> very<00:00:44.940> rugged<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.960> take<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
like it's very rugged like it can take a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.970 
like it's very rugged like it can take a
little<00:00:46.410> bit<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.680> abuse<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:48.289> but<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
little bit of abuse and but the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.529 
little bit of abuse and but the
important<00:00:50.579> thing<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> play<00:00:51.120> sport<00:00:51.390> is

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
important thing with the play sport is

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.840 
important thing with the play sport is
understanding<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
understanding that it is what it is I

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150 
understanding that it is what it is I
think<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> great<00:00:55.050> camera<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.620> outdoor

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
allows us to do some editing where we

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.160 
allows us to do some editing where we
can<00:01:25.530> see<00:01:25.770> true<00:01:26.130> slow-motion<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.720> slow<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
can see true slow-motion so you slow it

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.810 
can see true slow-motion so you slow it
down<00:01:28.320> between<00:01:28.710> frames<00:01:29.040> per<00:01:29.280> second<00:01:29.670> we're
