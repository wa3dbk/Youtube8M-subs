00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.340
 haye it was clear that we have been for two 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.960
 weeks have not uploaded a video 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.130
 yes but I have to do this thing now 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.480
 get up and running again before we 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.460
 I'm not sure 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.880
 if you are just the right person for that 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.609
 leaves 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.949
 why so far everything is okay then should 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.520
 that would be so because only what probably 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:38.280
 his 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:46.289
 the smoke oh shit and you are you 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:50.399
 sure that's how it should be 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:01:00.870
 I eat everything under control 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:03.480
 and you really mean that you are the one 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.439
 right for the job, he doubts 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.520
 because I can remember the ipad 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:13.049
 why this does not shit 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.610
 you can not compare that at all 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.100
 I would advise you anyway 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.759

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.759

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.579
 I saw that very well 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:02.090

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:05.930
