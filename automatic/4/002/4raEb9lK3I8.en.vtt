00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
really took a new biome that PC recently

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.960 
really took a new biome that PC recently
had<00:01:46.259> added<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.310> course<00:01:47.549> mom<00:01:47.759> pack

unfortunately<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> help<00:01:52.020> of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
unfortunately but with the help of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.020 
unfortunately but with the help of
redstone<00:01:52.470> frosty<00:01:53.159> at<00:01:53.340> least<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.610> guys<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:53.939> to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
redstone frosty at least you guys get to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.899 
redstone frosty at least you guys get to
play<00:01:54.149> an<00:01:54.720> amplified<00:01:55.229> version<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.860> um<00:01:56.189> yeah

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
play an amplified version of it um yeah

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.060 
play an amplified version of it um yeah
so<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.420> pretty<00:01:57.540> much<00:01:57.780> identical<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.829> only

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
so it's pretty much identical the only

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.859 
so it's pretty much identical the only
thing<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.490> obviously<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:00.509> not<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
thing is obviously is it's not the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.289 
thing is obviously is it's not the
authentic<00:02:01.290> biome<00:02:01.979> there<00:02:02.520> are<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> few<00:02:03.000> things

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
