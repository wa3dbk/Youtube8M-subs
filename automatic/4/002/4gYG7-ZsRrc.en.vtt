00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.980
 well we saw a note with the baby there 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.600
 for the program 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.029
 especially for the presentation of 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.699
 our album and our show where 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.099
 we just kick the ball 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.099
 making pressure notes cosquÃ­n 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.940
 very good very well between who and who 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.040
 they played 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.199
 francisca and the explorers and after 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.260
 did a favio monologue posca we played in 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.890
 the orange dome but a scenario that the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.480
 dome we just played a half time 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.390
 hour or so and followed several 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.100
 bands afterwards we went to see other shows 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.989
 so it was general was a good 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.210
 good experience mainly we 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.210
 we know here with juli the bass player 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 from childhood with take the drummer who does not 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.220
 is instructing do 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.640
 and we know a lot of fellow 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.930
 school and we always study together 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.800
 blue and we already know 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.140
 but the guy you went to another school 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.880
 another school and we crossed the road by 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.590
 other sides that was not school yes 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.590
 I studied with sergio sainz to be 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.640
 father of every batero minister who 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.740
 took classes under him so 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.000
 it was always taking classes and playing the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.190
 four a year and a half ago but we come 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.820
 playing in the trio well playing already makes 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:41.360
 a couple of years ago we were a group 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.280
 just and when juli came in we decided 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.540
 give another name a name that 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.500
 represent the 4 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.260
 and webÃ³ was the first thing that came out 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.130
 are 12 songs or a dozen 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.130
 eggs we could go 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.060
 some issues have several years already and 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.500
 others more recent and the disk what 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.380
 we just released in February so 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.660
 very little ago my old man sang and 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.180
 played along with the old drummer of 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.560
 tommy that is not finished and in turn the 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:14.960
 Julian's dad was the set designer 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.960
 then we have we have just 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:22.040
 born them so elaborate when we 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.959
 we crossed without knowing four years 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.019
 accompany us the company corrected one of 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.890
 the third grade guys can never 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.750
 the constancy of playing an instrument 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.230
 forever somehow I wanted to 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.030
 be part of the music from somewhere 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.810
 I was recently commissioned a proposal 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.810
 Three sisters 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.819
 manager 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.849
 in the improvement of convincing 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.349
 to achieve it, they want the confidence 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.349
 It is what it is 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.540
 and one of the horses undoubtedly of my 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.540
 family
