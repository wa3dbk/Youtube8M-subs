organization yeah and I think that every
every<00:01:33.869> time<00:01:33.899> after<00:01:34.889> we<00:01:35.009> develop<00:01:35.310> certain

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
every time after we develop certain

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.819 
every time after we develop certain
products<00:01:36.179> we<00:01:36.749> always<00:01:36.990> strove<00:01:37.319> to<00:01:37.349> develop

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
products we always strove to develop

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.949 
products we always strove to develop
more<00:01:38.219> complex<00:01:38.639> products<00:01:38.999> so<00:01:39.569> if<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.719> look<00:01:39.899> at

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
more complex products so if you look at

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.639 
more complex products so if you look at
Bakugan<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.619> example<00:01:41.069> that<00:01:42.649> necessitated

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
Bakugan for example that necessitated

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.940 
Bakugan for example that necessitated
having<00:01:43.919> some<00:01:44.099> TV<00:01:44.459> show<00:01:44.669> it<00:01:45.329> necessitated

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
having some TV show it necessitated

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.450 
having some TV show it necessitated
a<00:01:48.119> collectible<00:01:49.259> line<00:01:50.259> of<00:01:50.560> product<00:01:51.340> that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
a collectible line of product that

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.249 
a collectible line of product that
ranged<00:01:52.030> instead<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:52.329> like<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.630> hundreds<00:01:53.049> and

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
ranged instead of like the hundreds and

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.069 
ranged instead of like the hundreds and
managing<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.100> matrices<00:01:54.549> and<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.719> marketing

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
managing the matrices and the marketing

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.569 
managing the matrices and the marketing
behind<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.469> was<00:01:56.590> totally<00:01:57.009> was<00:01:57.369> very

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
behind that was totally was very

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:58.980 
behind that was totally was very
different<00:01:57.820> than<00:01:58.149> products<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:58.659> come<00:01:58.840> in<00:01:58.929> the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
different than products that come in the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.990 
different than products that come in the

actual sort of innovation process change
you<00:02:14.860> know<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:14.980> think<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.670> methodology<00:02:16.299> is

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
you know I think that the methodology is

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.559 
you know I think that the methodology is
still<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.620> same<00:02:17.860> as<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.400> was<00:02:18.580> ten<00:02:18.910> years<00:02:18.970> ago<00:02:19.209> I

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
still the same as it was ten years ago I

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.570 
still the same as it was ten years ago I
think<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.049> big<00:02:20.200> difference<00:02:20.560> today<00:02:20.860> versus

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
think the big difference today versus

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.460 
think the big difference today versus
then<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.660> team<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:22.959> people<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.380> we

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
then is that the team of people that we

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.069 
then is that the team of people that we
have<00:02:23.590> around<00:02:23.830> us<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:25.209> terms<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.690> people<00:02:25.959> that

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
have around us in terms of people that

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.080 
have around us in terms of people that
can<00:02:26.200> design<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.829> develop<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.370> execute<00:02:27.700> on

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
can design and develop and execute on

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.569 
can design and develop and execute on
our<00:02:28.959> product<00:02:29.319> visions<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.890> much<00:02:30.160> greater<00:02:30.430> than

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
our product visions is much greater than

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.039 
our product visions is much greater than
it<00:02:30.700> was<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.060> past<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.690> gives<00:02:31.870> us<00:02:31.930> the

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
it was in the past and that gives us the

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.020 
it was in the past and that gives us the
capacity<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.530> take<00:02:32.769> on<00:02:32.980> much<00:02:33.190> larger<00:02:33.430> projects

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
capacity to take on much larger projects

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.030 
capacity to take on much larger projects
so<00:02:34.120> for<00:02:34.299> example<00:02:34.690> if<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.870> look<00:02:35.049> at<00:02:35.140> live<00:02:35.380> which

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
so for example if you look at live which

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.979 
so for example if you look at live which
is<00:02:36.069> our<00:02:36.280> first<00:02:36.489> entree<00:02:36.940> into<00:02:37.060> into<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.750> girls

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
have done it five years ago because we

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.030 
have done it five years ago because we
just<00:02:44.319> didn't<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:45.040> girls<00:02:45.549> team<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:47.890> didn't

have it deep base of designers that knew

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.629 
have it deep base of designers that knew
the<00:02:52.000> girls<00:02:52.209> category<00:02:52.420> very<00:02:53.109> well<00:02:53.400> plus<00:02:54.400> also

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
the girls category very well plus also

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.069 
the girls category very well plus also
financially<00:02:55.180> was<00:02:55.329> very<00:02:55.540> expensive<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:55.989> go

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
financially was very expensive to go

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.110 
financially was very expensive to go
into<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.350> category<00:02:56.709> so<00:02:56.980> today<00:02:57.340> we<00:02:57.519> have<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
into that category so today we have the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.460 
into that category so today we have the
death<00:02:58.329> in<00:02:58.510> terms<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.019> people<00:02:59.170> in<00:02:59.380> the

they<00:03:02.049> can<00:03:02.170> pull<00:03:02.380> off<00:03:02.519> launching<00:03:03.519> into<00:03:03.639> a<00:03:03.760> girls

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
they can pull off launching into a girls

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.390 
they can pull off launching into a girls
category<00:03:04.569> plus<00:03:05.410> we<00:03:05.530> were<00:03:05.620> financially<00:03:05.829> able

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
category plus we were financially able

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.440 
category plus we were financially able
to<00:03:06.489> go<00:03:06.579> into<00:03:06.730> those<00:03:06.940> categories<00:03:07.090> it's

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
to go into those categories it's

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.379 
to go into those categories it's
combination<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:08.079> those<00:03:08.620> things<00:03:08.920> but<00:03:09.819> the<00:03:10.030> the

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
combination of those things but the the

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.780 
combination of those things but the the
methodology<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.260> looking<00:03:12.069> at<00:03:12.220> what<00:03:12.549> are<00:03:12.670> the
