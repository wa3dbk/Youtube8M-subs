is this one right here called dim light
and<00:00:21.150> they<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.900> lot<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.199> tons<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.590> different

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
and they have a lot of tons of different

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.779 
and they have a lot of tons of different
shades<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.100> don't<00:00:23.250> know<00:00:23.310> if<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.460> could<00:00:23.580> really

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
shades I don't know if you could really

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.960 
shades I don't know if you could really
tell<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.330> difference<00:00:24.500> right<00:00:25.500> here<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
tell the difference right here but the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.849 
tell the difference right here but the
dim<00:00:27.210> light<00:00:27.240> shade<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.869> matches<00:00:28.320> my<00:00:28.500> skin<00:00:28.560> tone

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
dim light shade it matches my skin tone

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.349 
dim light shade it matches my skin tone
most<00:00:29.460> because<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.820> other<00:00:29.939> ones<00:00:30.150> are<00:00:30.269> really

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
most because the other ones are really

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.359 
most because the other ones are really
pink<00:00:30.689> or<00:00:30.900> they're<00:00:31.019> too<00:00:31.170> bronzy<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.219> use

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
pink or they're too bronzy so I just use

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.590 
pink or they're too bronzy so I just use
it<00:00:32.489> as<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.640> setting<00:00:32.850> powder<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.420> works

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
it as a setting powder and it works

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.180 
it as a setting powder and it works
great<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.380> that's<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.620> whole<00:00:34.770> point<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.040> these

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
great so that's a whole point of these

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.770 
great so that's a whole point of these
powders<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.030> create<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.510> write<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
powders it's to create like I write the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.020 
powders it's to create like I write the
perfect<00:00:36.960> lighting<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.739> your<00:00:38.160> face<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.730> that's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
perfect lighting on your face so that's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.130 
perfect lighting on your face so that's
why<00:00:39.149> they<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.480> many<00:00:39.510> different<00:00:39.809> shades

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
why they have so many different shades

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.750 
why they have so many different shades
and<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.800> create<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.129> whatever<00:00:41.579> you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and you can create like whatever you

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.639 
and you can create like whatever you
want<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:42.870> noticed<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.200> dim<00:00:43.469> light

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
just works really well I creating like a
