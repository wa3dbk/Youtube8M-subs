00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.210
 today girls apple pie 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.940
 yes but it's not the classic apple pie 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.920
 rich in butter, cream and eggs in fact 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.349
 this cake will not use fat 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.509
 animals of any kind nor the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.580
 eggs also because if it is called tosa di 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.130
 less and there must be a reason not 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.990
 in fact, we will prepare this dessert 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.150
 and using many email 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.699
 then we will make a sort of batter 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.980
 dense like whole wheat flour 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.059
 vegetable and cane sugar we prepare 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.300
 together to prepare the apple pie 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.540
 about 200 grams of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.440
 wholemeal flour 80 g of sugar of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.290
 cane 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.800
 then three or four large powdery apples 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.579
 about 900 grams 100 g of raisins 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.100
 sultana a poor glass then 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.590
 we are around 160 thousand liters of oil 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.079
 of seeds and an organic lemon 200 mm of 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.699
 soy milk or even another 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.969
 vegetable milk what you like about 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.970
 more 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.310
 half sachet of baking powder and 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.439
 before baking then to brown the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.340
 surface we will use 20 grams of 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.060
 brown sugar and fishhook already settled on 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.759
 the Apple 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.640
 now I'll show you how to do it 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.049
 we peel I use a vegetables penalty 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.450
 electrical however clearly you can 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.659
 also use the manual one the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.409
 we peel well and then pay them 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.409
 small small combs 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.360
 here I am cutting the last i 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.990
 little bits less and this is the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.180
 result 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.520
 I always advise you to use a 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.320
 ceramic knife to avoid 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.750
 oxidize the active ingredients 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.200
 now what we do we rely on 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.860
 lemon peel that will serve to give a 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.860
 little bit of perfume 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.040
 and then what we do 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:04.610
 cut the lemon in half and tis 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:10.150
 let's take the juice of a destination now 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:14.900
 we can also add seed oil 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.730
 soy milk and mix thoroughly 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.030
 in the meantime something I didn't tell you 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.170
 first I soaked the raisins in 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.310
 hot water so we drained 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.209
 the soaking water raisins 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:40.269
 we always mix add as well 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:42.680
 cane sugar and then gradually 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.800
 we also add our flour 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.750
 integral because slowly because 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.970
 we must reach a right one 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.010
 consistency therefore the dough should not 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.410
 being too soft is not too thick 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.209
 always depends on the type of apple that 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.260
 go and use also from 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.260
 size of small pieces 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.750
 and now also the last ingredient 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.120
 yeast and we always mix in the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.130
 meanwhile we have also turned on the sound 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.840
 and preheated to 180 degrees 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.810
 we prepared a pan in 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.070
 silicone with a diameter of 28 cm you can 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.460
 also clearly use one 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:29.430
 classic hinged cake pan we pour the 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:33.510
 our dough we are leveling the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.330
 surface of the perfect sweet like this e 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.360
 now before we bake, we sponsor 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:44.970
 the surface with a little sugar 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:52.560
 carra and now we can also bake at 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:54.900
 180 degrees for about 40 45 minutes cake 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.670
 apple prontissima then you have seen 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.280
 that also without resorting to use 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.930
 we got some butter and eggs 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.910
 a super apple pie 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.890
 pity that from home you can not a 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.630
 feel the smell of this sweet 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.870
 then you just need to try it too 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.870
 you
