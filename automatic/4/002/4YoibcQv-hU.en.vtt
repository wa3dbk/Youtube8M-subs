numbers

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.590 
numbers
but<00:02:14.190> everything<00:02:14.490> here<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.760> on<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.030> one<00:02:15.210> screen

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
but everything here is on the one screen

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.720

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.770 
network it updates the time and the date
to<00:02:31.020> what<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.410> thinks<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:32.160> your<00:02:32.340> timezone<00:02:32.850> it

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
to what it thinks is your timezone it

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.750 
to what it thinks is your timezone it
might<00:02:34.050> be<00:02:34.230> wrong<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.530> if<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.460> then<00:02:35.730> you

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
might be wrong and if it is then you

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.640 
might be wrong and if it is then you
just<00:02:36.090> need<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.360> go<00:02:36.510> into<00:02:36.750> settings<00:02:37.170> manually

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
just need to go into settings manually

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.270 
just need to go into settings manually
and<00:02:37.950> update<00:02:38.250> your<00:02:38.400> timezone<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.210> that<00:02:40.020> will

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
and update your timezone and that will

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.780 
and update your timezone and that will
immediately<00:02:41.690> change<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.990> for<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.790> very

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
immediately change that for you very

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.760 
immediately change that for you very
next<00:02:45.030> thing<00:02:45.180> it'll<00:02:45.570> probably<00:02:45.870> happen<00:02:46.230> for<00:02:46.650> you

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
next thing it'll probably happen for you

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.020 
next thing it'll probably happen for you
is<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:47.040> will<00:02:47.100> ask<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.610> upgrade<00:02:47.730> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
is it will ask you to upgrade the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.270 
is it will ask you to upgrade the
firmware<00:02:48.180> which<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.870> should<00:02:49.080> obviously<00:02:49.650> do

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
firmware which you should obviously do

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.850 
firmware which you should obviously do
right<00:02:50.550> away<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.030> then<00:02:51.840> once<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.350> firmware<00:02:52.590> is

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
right away and then once the firmware is

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.040 
right away and then once the firmware is
updated<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:55.440> restarts<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.100> radio<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:57.780> have

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
updated it restarts the radio and I have

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.020 
updated it restarts the radio and I have
cut<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.590> down<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.890> little<00:02:59.070> bit<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.760> it

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
cut this down a little bit so that it

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.670 
cut this down a little bit so that it
actually<00:03:00.450> takes<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.810> little<00:03:00.930> bit<00:03:01.110> longer<00:03:01.380> than

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
actually takes a little bit longer than

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.949 
actually takes a little bit longer than
what<00:03:01.830> you're<00:03:02.010> seeing<00:03:02.040> here<00:03:02.430> in<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.850> video<00:03:03.090> so

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
what you're seeing here in this video so

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.230 
what you're seeing here in this video so
after<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.470> after<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.190> radio<00:03:05.490> restarts<00:03:06.120> it

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
after the after the radio restarts it

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.210 
after the after the radio restarts it
initializes<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.050> network<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.770> connects<00:03:08.100> to

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
initializes the network it connects to

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.650 
initializes the network it connects to
your<00:03:08.459> network<00:03:08.880> again<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:12.030> showing
