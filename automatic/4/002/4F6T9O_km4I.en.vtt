00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
materials you normally find in shoulder

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.470 
materials you normally find in shoulder
pads<00:00:26.140> elbows<00:00:27.039> and<00:00:27.369> chins<00:00:27.610> and<00:00:27.940> allowed<00:00:28.330> us<00:00:28.449> to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
pads elbows and chins and allowed us to

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.880 
pads elbows and chins and allowed us to
make<00:00:28.630> a<00:00:28.660> much<00:00:28.869> lighter<00:00:29.080> product<00:00:29.590> that<00:00:29.710> still

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
make a much lighter product that still

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.980 
make a much lighter product that still
performs<00:00:30.340> very<00:00:30.550> well<00:00:30.640> to<00:00:31.539> impact<00:00:31.869> protection

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
performs very well to impact protection

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.560 
performs very well to impact protection
so<00:00:32.739> without<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.310> plastic<00:00:33.760> insert<00:00:34.270> just<00:00:34.390> gonna

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
so without the plastic insert just gonna

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.720 
so without the plastic insert just gonna
really<00:00:34.840> lighten<00:00:35.230> up<00:00:35.320> this<00:00:35.530> stuff<00:00:35.770> I<00:00:35.920> yeah<00:00:36.370> the

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
really lighten up this stuff I yeah the

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.729 
really lighten up this stuff I yeah the
shoulder<00:00:36.970> pad<00:00:37.120> itself<00:00:37.360> is<00:00:37.510> about<00:00:37.600> 750<00:00:38.500> grams

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
shoulder pad itself is about 750 grams

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.260 
shoulder pad itself is about 750 grams
which<00:00:38.980> is<00:00:39.010> half<00:00:39.399> the<00:00:39.610> weight<00:00:39.730> of<00:00:39.790> a<00:00:39.970> typical

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
which is half the weight of a typical

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.940 
which is half the weight of a typical
shoulder<00:00:40.690> pad<00:00:40.840> more<00:00:41.380> shoulder<00:00:41.530> pads<00:00:41.770> are<00:00:41.890> a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
shoulder pad more shoulder pads are a

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.370 
shoulder pad more shoulder pads are a
thousand<00:00:42.399> to<00:00:42.550> 1600<00:00:43.239> grams<00:00:43.300> this<00:00:43.930> one<00:00:44.079> comes<00:00:44.260> in

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
thousand to 1600 grams this one comes in

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.770 
thousand to 1600 grams this one comes in
at<00:00:44.470> 750<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.610> baek's<00:00:45.820> advantage<00:00:46.300> so<00:00:46.480> it<00:00:46.690> was

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
at 750 the baek's advantage so it was

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.630 
at 750 the baek's advantage so it was
really<00:00:47.050> designed<00:00:47.200> to<00:00:47.559> protect<00:00:47.829> you<00:00:48.250> getting

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
really designed to protect you getting

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.549 
really designed to protect you getting
hit<00:00:48.850> but<00:00:49.300> also<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:49.780> person<00:00:50.050> receiving<00:00:50.440> the

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
hit but also the person receiving the

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.680 
hit but also the person receiving the
hit<00:00:50.800> so<00:00:51.430> having<00:00:51.670> this<00:00:51.880> soft<00:00:52.180> cap<00:00:52.450> will

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
hit so having this soft cap will

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.440 
hit so having this soft cap will
actually<00:00:52.960> protect<00:00:53.500> both<00:00:53.770> sides<00:00:54.070> on<00:00:54.460> a<00:00:54.520> hit<00:00:54.820> so

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
actually protect both sides on a hit so

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.869 
actually protect both sides on a hit so
it's<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:55.719> proprietary<00:00:56.290> blend<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:57.129> materials

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
it's a proprietary blend of materials

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.940 
it's a proprietary blend of materials
that<00:00:57.969> we<00:00:58.120> use<00:00:58.329> to<00:00:58.570> design<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:59.020> you<00:00:59.170> foam<00:00:59.440> the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
that we use to design the you foam the

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.380 
that we use to design the you foam the
biggest<00:01:00.250> advantage<00:01:00.670> is<00:01:00.700> it<00:01:00.850> doesn't<00:01:01.000> absorb

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
biggest advantage is it doesn't absorb

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.000 
biggest advantage is it doesn't absorb
weight<00:01:01.690> while<00:01:01.899> you're<00:01:02.050> playing<00:01:02.260> so<00:01:02.829> you<00:01:02.920> can

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
weight while you're playing so you can

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.289 
weight while you're playing so you can
play<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.250> whole<00:01:03.280> game<00:01:03.430> and<00:01:03.789> it<00:01:03.879> stays<00:01:04.089> almost

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
play the whole game and it stays almost

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:05.789 
play the whole game and it stays almost
the<00:01:04.539> same<00:01:04.719> weight<00:01:04.989> as<00:01:05.170> when<00:01:05.350> you<00:01:05.440> start<00:01:05.680> it

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
the same weight as when you start it

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.070 
the same weight as when you start it
typical<00:01:06.400> shoulder<00:01:06.700> pads<00:01:06.880> absorb<00:01:07.330> up<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.600> 700

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
typical shoulder pads absorb up to 700

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.719 
typical shoulder pads absorb up to 700
grams<00:01:08.260> of<00:01:08.440> water<00:01:08.590> so<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.159> just<00:01:09.400> weighs<00:01:09.549> you

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
grams of water so it just weighs you

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:10.920 
grams of water so it just weighs you
down<00:01:09.760> as<00:01:10.030> you<00:01:10.119> go<00:01:10.210> along<00:01:10.270> in<00:01:10.510> the<00:01:10.600> game<00:01:10.690> those

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
down as you go along in the game those

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.350 
down as you go along in the game those
sweats<00:01:11.500> will<00:01:11.650> be<00:01:11.770> beat<00:01:12.280> right<00:01:12.490> off<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:12.970> it's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
sweats will be beat right off and it's

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.789 
sweats will be beat right off and it's
not<00:01:13.540> gonna<00:01:13.659> hold<00:01:13.810> you<00:01:13.990> down<00:01:14.080> at<00:01:14.290> all<00:01:14.380> the

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
not gonna hold you down at all the

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.080 
not gonna hold you down at all the
ventilation<00:01:15.280> is<00:01:15.369> built<00:01:15.549> in<00:01:15.729> you'll<00:01:15.880> see<00:01:15.940> the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
ventilation is built in you'll see the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.210 
ventilation is built in you'll see the
perforation<00:01:16.450> here<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:17.200> foam<00:01:17.380> moly<00:01:17.590> cap<00:01:17.830> the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
perforation here the foam moly cap the

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.520 
perforation here the foam moly cap the
only<00:01:18.369> areas<00:01:18.670> we<00:01:18.820> do<00:01:18.970> have<00:01:19.150> plastic<00:01:19.630> is<00:01:19.810> in<00:01:20.049> the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
only areas we do have plastic is in the

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.380 
only areas we do have plastic is in the
sternum<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.100> in<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.369> back<00:01:21.520> piece<00:01:21.790> because<00:01:22.360> we

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.820 
sternum and in the back piece because we
wanted<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.720> make<00:01:22.810> sure<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.290> perception

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
wanted to make sure the perception

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.170 
wanted to make sure the perception
there's<00:01:23.979> still<00:01:24.220> that<00:01:24.340> level<00:01:24.520> of<00:01:24.820> protection

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
there's still that level of protection

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.609 
there's still that level of protection
if<00:01:25.450> you<00:01:25.540> get<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.689> you<00:01:26.049> know<00:01:26.080> a<00:01:26.170> puck<00:01:26.409> in<00:01:26.439> the
