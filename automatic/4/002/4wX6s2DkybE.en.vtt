00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.070
 well we started making this look 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.170
 chocolate marking the eyebrows a little 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.420
 filling the whole gap with the brush 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.210
 brown and the tone that I'm putting the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.700
 Eyebrow kit is the youngest and one time 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.960
 that I've done this I'm going to start with the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.930
 long wear 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.370
 in this that is a brown shadow 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.280
 included in this super pretty collection 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.710
 it's called be there sweet and I'm going 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.989
 place it on the entire mobile eyelid before 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.760
 to dry with the brush touch the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.890
 that I am using I will give 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.020
 taps to make it look good 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.930
 Smudged on the entire mobile eyelid 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.660
 once I do this I start to 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.950
 have fun with the tones included in the 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.950
 chocolate palette 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.840
 I'm going to position one of the most colors 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.619
 nice and funny from the palette that is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.490
 the spa 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.329
 this I put it tapping 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.570
 positioning just above the 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.210
 shadow in cream 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.760
 is perfect and get an effect like 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.270
 brightest brightest of this 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.570
 way the eye will stay like wet 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.290
 it is super nice the color that I use 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.320
 now also from the palette is a tone 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.790
 champagne is a new edition it 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.130
 includes only in this palette do not 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.110
 you find nowhere else and what 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.310
 you put inside and you can also 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.310
 place in the eye arch 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.159
 it's about using all the shades of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.930
 Have fun well then let's mark a 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.950
 little bone with this other tone that 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.950
 is this in stone color 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.229
 and now to define the most intense eye 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.190
 we are going to place an eyeliner gel this 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.860
 It is also a limited edition 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.340
 included in this in this collection the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.190
 chocolate and I'm going to make the line very 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.200
 pegadito at the birth of the tab the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.870
 brush is the ultra fine to make a 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.180
 well defined line which includes the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.970
 palette that is the eyeliner is perfect 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.650
 also to make this type of lines 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.980
 what I do is take it to the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.900
 final and I do not mind dialing a little bit 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.709
 the corner because I do to 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.830
 then it is to break every frame in the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.120
 inside of the eye on the water line 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.700
 so that it gives me an effect like more 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.600
 dramatic more that have the most look 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.040
 depth 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.990
 I always try to join the bottom part 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.000
 with the one above I say that I can throw 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.210
 a little bit because then what 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.290
 I will do is break that line to mark 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.660
 much more the eye and have more strength what 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.090
 I do with the touch brush the same as I have 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.760
 used before since I have it dirty and 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.570
 I'm worth this color and I'm always going to 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.980
 tend up never I can never 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.890
 do it down because if I do not jo 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.110
 tends to fall frame with breaking intensity 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.230
 the line also the bottom part well 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:26.360
 defined and blurred and this already begins 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.760
 to have a nice color starts to have 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.910
 the combination of this shape palette 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.690
 perfect everyone can do the look 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.280
 who likes it more intensely softer 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.650
 one of my favorite colors that also 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.840
 includes the cocoa palette and with it I'm going 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.970
 to crush everything I've done it before 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.100
 I put on top of the broken line 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.160
 now so I'm going to get a lot more 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.960
 volume in the eye this area here is 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.180
 where I have to put more amount of 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.940
 color and well diffused to the part of 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.240
 down 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.970
 now it ends up giving a touch of light with 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.570
 the boom also included in the palette the 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.820
 brush has put a little touch just in 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.250
 the hollow of the eyebrows the most 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.910
 high and inside the eye this is 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.780
 mate however gives a luminous effect and 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.780
 very elegant to the eye 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.870
 we finish with another of the products that 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.889
 I love it is the mascara 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.620
 chocolate color is a dark chocolate and 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.830
 let's do it as always from the 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.300
 root a zig zag and go towards the tips 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.580
 let's give all the layers that we see 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.189
 necessary with this extreme part and 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.990
 mask because you can work it from the 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.550
 way you want and it will not leave you 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.249
 I'm going to leave the tab 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.259
 completely clean and you decide the 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:47.509
 amount you want to put if you want 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.129
 more natural unless they want for a 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.020
 depth and an effect like more 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:56.139
 finished in the eye you can apply 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.139
