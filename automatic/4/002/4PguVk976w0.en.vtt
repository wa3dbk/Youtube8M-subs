00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.330
 that no friends of youtube of all friends 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.190
 louis of the channel of anglia and in this new 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.830
 video from an application with very useful 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.000
 and well I think that many will like it 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.220
 basically it will serve us for 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.830
 transfer files from our 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.200
 device to the pc or vice versa from the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.410
 pc to our andrés device without 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.970
 data cables or without usb cables so 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.440
 we go quickly with measures but they 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.420
 like the application well you are 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.239
 totally free in place thor 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.329
 flame affects the psv and works from 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.670
 android 2.3 and up and it 's totally 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.170
 What we have to do is free 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.260
 the application obviously download it and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.720
 open it and that would be its interface and then 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.600
 basically here we will have a small 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.460
 settings icon that would be this what 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.980
 is 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.440
 well they are in the username or 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.120
 what would be the password password ok 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.650
 let's quickly change what is the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.090
 username that you can 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.470
 put do not grant me want 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.540
 in my case, Luis 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.430
 and we will accept and we will put here 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.430
 in a password we are going to put this 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.120
 1 2 3 if we are going to accept and accept 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.660
 we eat because we have already created our 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.040
 user and our password so what 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.930
 The only thing we have to do is press 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.910
 active uncle of the option so that it is 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.010
 activated the application and as we see 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.500
 there is a url that is what we are going to 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.370
 copy on our device but from 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.080
 our is our culture so let's go 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.820
 quickly to the computer copy everything 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.590
 is in this state of real and as 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.400
 you can see just as we have to copy it 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.990
 obviously this will vary a lot in the 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.790
 devices holding to change well 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.800
 that everything will look just like these 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.350
 birds then they just have to 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.180
 buy the entire url on your computer 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.690
 so we're going quickly to the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.690
 computer 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.830
 and quickly we go to our 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.220
 computer friends and let's live what 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:13.060
 which is a tab the option of my 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.430
 team and my pc and here we go quickly 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.280
 to copy what is I could reveal 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.170
 we take what appears from our 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.000
 tempe server application that 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.640
 we download in the press simply what 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.800
 they notice as it appears there 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.510
 clearly and it opens a new window 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.299
 that basically will ask us for our 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.049
 the user the password that we 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.049
 possible 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.280
 like people 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.350
 123 so we're going to give you start 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.830
 session and we will automatically access 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.720
 to our basically in our 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.430
 folders files that we have in our 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.290
 Android device how can they succeed 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.850
 the folders we go quickly in this 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.850
 insert basically they want we have 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.460
 all the files and dance properly 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.200
 here as you can see again 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.060
 basically Andrew's folder all 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.480
 the data of the applications and others 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.650
 as you can see here we can see 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.360
 synchronous to retain the data or 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.210
 babies devastate some games that we have 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.070
 installed on the computer we have to 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.990
 visualize what our 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.510
 photographs or videos that we have in 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.370
 our android device and 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.080
 we just go back we go 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.300
 quickly to what is this folder 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.730
 where are we going to create forgiveness up 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.400
 copy what is a game that I have to 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.040
 the painting is this folder is in this 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.240
 case and here we are going to copy this file 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.440
 something quickly to see the size as 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.480
 can see 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.000
 the size of this file is 70 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.030
 friends we are going to completely recovered 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.590
 putting you either drag it 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.590
 or copy and paste 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.400
 quickly that they will start copying the 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.500
 files that we have in the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.630
 minorities already then music photos videos 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.940
 knows some games this case some 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.520
 data of the games I have also spent 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.800
 some data of towns like those of gta 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.450
 san andrés and those up to 8 that 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.960
 will start more than one gigabyte that are 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.280
 comfortable and almost 3 gigas so much that 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.630
 they weigh those games 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.060
 then they have passed without any 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.950
 problem only because it takes like a few 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.110
 five or six minutes or so in 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.970
 copy all the data since all 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.890
 they are a bit heavy that they would be like 2 or 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.440
 3 gigas there are some data of the others 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.080
 heavy but as you can see we get 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.330
 copy what you get this file that 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.070
 start 70 mails and quickly with a 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.110
 minute less than minutes since I already know what 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.150
 have copied directly to our 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.890
 Android device as quickly to 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.890
 copy another file this one do 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:54.000
 so we 're going to pay in this window and 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.860
 Go quickly to our device 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.160
 android 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.230
 then to verify that the one that is 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.840
 this method works and that has us 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.480
 copied that file to our 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.520
 device andrés then we go 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.759
 quickly to what it is 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.759
 to our hungry device 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.880
 and look at them once we have 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.610
 past all the files be they photos 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.130
 music videos and others to our 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.390
 Android device from the PC or from 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.860
 the device press before 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.240
 simply because we come back and 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.910
 we close this application simply 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.280
 personal here to appear and we 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.430
 we go out and go quickly to collaborate 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.830
 that is basically copied from the file that 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.120
 we just moved from the pc to the the 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.860
 device very quickly that the 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.240
 apec apps folder and how can you see 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.030
 here we have what is the file 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.830
 let's copy is the money mont frame 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.110
 the world that is the game so let's go 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.720
 quickly to check also the size 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.110
 so we can see that the truth is that 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.370
 if properly own the 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.190
 as you can see the size is still 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.740
 equal 30 megs so then on the 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.930
 transfer because it was elaborated let's say 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.490
 which is 5th but good there as they can 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.070
 lengthen a method the hour enough 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.590
 quite easy very simple and very useful 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.630
 that after many may serve you 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.270
 You may like it if some do not have 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.550
 data cable so after transferring 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.470
 the files from your computer to 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.950
 device andrés nothing then then 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.560
 I hope 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.150
 the application in the description we leave 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.650
 a link to download what 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.050
 try and see how you like them and if 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.580
 no, it just comes out then 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.050
 basically everything in four days but they 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.610
 I liked you remember you can follow me 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.740
 on facebook and twitter as android app 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.960
 without also checking what is the 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.730
 blog when they will not be able to find more 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.940
 content for your android devices 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.680
 and how do I tell them to get an application and 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.030
 a very easy method to transfer 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.480
 files from our device 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.680
 android to the pc or did versa from the 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.860
 computer to our device to is 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.570
 a data cable or without cables usb the 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.460
 unique and would be that only then 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.170
 this method works equally 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.090
 it fails so it's the only detail but 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.520
 they live outside the truth that everything very 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.830
 practical and easy so they say goodbye 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.040
 Until next time I hope you liked it 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.040
 bye
