00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:17.680
 to introduce yourself before reading these 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:22.300
 twelve fundamental principles and I tell you 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.820
 two things two enemies that this is 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.189
 to the constitution that we will hear that 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.189
 what was the two enemies are indifference 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.839
 to politics, that is, to those who 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.059
 disinterest in politics 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.559
 now you will tell me benign with these 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.079
 come times come and tell us about 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.879
 respect politics not in fact I do not 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.690
 I tell you to respect the policy vi 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:46.869
 I say I love you to love politics is the 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.640
 highest thing the highest thing of the 

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:52.030
 human thought to build ours 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.220
 life together to organize peace e 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.650
 serenity and work is only there 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.290
 politics is not that there is another science 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.420
 and whoever takes care of it knows it so I tell you 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.030
 to love politics not to be interested 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.640
 for politics like 9 the interest for 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.110
 life says i care nothing is 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.640
 how to say how you don't care 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.290
 police do not test you not only yours 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.880
 life but your child's life 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.490
 if he goes to school he will have a good one 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.560
 teaching if he falls ill he will be cured if 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.510
 he will get married if he finds the job no no 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.520
 I care you do you do yourself 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.640
 your son's life of yours this is 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.340
 politics organize our lives 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.720
 the construction of our lives those 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.230
 who wrote these things us 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.450
 we will hear were political men of 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.790
 politics that dealt with politics 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.750
 from morning to evening and have written 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.210
 an immense great thing that saves us 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.490
 these are extraordinary things and then 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.320
 for this we need to be interested in mica 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.330
 much from morning to evening but it is the 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.580
 our life despise politics like 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.400
 despise oneself and one must not 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.409
 confuse let's say the institution with whom 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.659
 the represents it at that time there are 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.549
 of tremendous politicians but if a father 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.280
 let's say slap a son from 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.810
 morning to evening is not paternity 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.049
 horrible paternity is wonderful e 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.149
 that father who is that horrible father and 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.340
 there are politicians we don't love but 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.409
 they are not all the same even those on 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.310
 terrible phrases when politicians are said 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.040
 they are all the same 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.980
 we do a great favor to 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.019
 bad 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.580
 to dishonest people because it's like 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.860
 if we had not recognized them 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.959
 enjoy to have not seen us nobody likes 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.750
 even you 15 notices nobody 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.599
 we are all the same terrible we feed 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.849
 this is the second enemy of the 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.879
 constitution and our living together 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:42.170
 neatly serenely and the vote 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:44.959
 voting to vote is the only tool that 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.680
 we have but to get to the vote there are 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.079
 wanted thousands of people dead for not 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.319
 say millions to give us the 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:57.379
 opportunity to express to express 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.180
 what we desire there is always the 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.970
 difference even between two terrible scenes 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.349
 always one less worse look at that 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.780
 each of us has more power than that 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.349
 who thinks about the world each of us brings 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.780
 his invisible but concrete contribution 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.500
 towards good or evil towards the right 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.410
 and the very little unfair but there is the thing 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.540
 more terrible to call each other do not vote 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.349
 and then you will see well I do what 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.269
 I think it is right 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.040
 the constitution was written precisely 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.870
 for freedom 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.209
 but there is an article on the vote as if it is 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.299
 started you we give you all the possibilities 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.880
 but do n't pull yourself out even if you make mistakes 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.010
 empty one wrong thing you give me to me 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.290
 possibility of fighting each other to say 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.209
 look not only is the agreement there and 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.120
 we organize our lives but if you do 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.880
 pull out is terrible and terrible e 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.669
 as ponzio pilate it goes into the hands of the crowd 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.560
 and the crowd always chooses barabbas always 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:56.380
 power is given to others 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.380
 always barab you do n't have to do a bang 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.069
