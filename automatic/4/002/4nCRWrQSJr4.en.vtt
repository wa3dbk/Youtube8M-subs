00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
1.25 inches in diameter it's 32

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.810 
1.25 inches in diameter it's 32
millimeters<00:01:37.009> compared<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> older

center<00:01:43.920> area<00:01:44.960> 26<00:01:45.960> millimeters<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:47.340> here's<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
center area 26 millimeters so here's the

center area 26 millimeters so here's the
older<00:01:48.149> chip<00:01:48.390> here's<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.290> new<00:01:49.500> version<00:01:51.799> you

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
older chip here's the new version you

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.920 
older chip here's the new version you
can<00:01:53.009> see<00:01:53.280> how<00:01:53.430> much<00:01:53.610> larger<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.299> center<00:01:54.689> area

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
can see how much larger the center area

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.990 
can see how much larger the center area
is<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:58.409> also<00:01:58.890> how<00:01:59.189> much<00:01:59.219> nicer<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> edge

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
is and also how much nicer the edge

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.370 
is and also how much nicer the edge
spots<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.780> chip<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:02.000> Sir<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.210> some<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
older next gen chip so ever perhaps not

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.570 
older next gen chip so ever perhaps not
quite<00:02:10.280> as<00:02:10.660> nice<00:02:11.660> looking<00:02:12.170> as<00:02:12.350> these<00:02:12.590> newer

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580

next-gen ships these blue jet next gen
do<00:02:19.190> feel<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.490> little<00:02:19.700> more<00:02:19.820> plasticky<00:02:21.190> than<00:02:22.190> the

do feel a little more plasticky than the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.270 
do feel a little more plasticky than the
older<00:02:22.610> chips<00:02:23.380> they<00:02:24.380> also<00:02:24.530> feel<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.920> little<00:02:25.160> more

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
older chips they also feel a little more

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.670 
older chips they also feel a little more
slippery<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:30.620> perhaps<00:02:30.830> that's<00:02:31.220> because<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
slippery and perhaps that's because the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.930 
slippery and perhaps that's because the
parameter<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.890> chip<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.340> border<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.730> the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
parameter the chip the border of the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.860 
parameter the chip the border of the
chip<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.720> smaller<00:02:36.170> area<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:37.310> there<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:37.870> less

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
chip is a smaller area so there is less

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.500 
chip is a smaller area so there is less
friction<00:02:39.290> between<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:40.070> chips<00:02:40.510> because

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
friction between the chips because

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.990 
friction between the chips because
there's<00:02:41.750> less<00:02:41.990> surface<00:02:42.320> touching<00:02:43.010> and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
there's less surface touching and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.440 
there's less surface touching and
therefore<00:02:44.390> they<00:02:44.840> slide<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.230> little<00:02:45.410> more<00:02:46.450> than

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
therefore they slide a little more than

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.300 
therefore they slide a little more than
the<00:02:47.630> previous<00:02:48.080> versions<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.830> next-gen

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.199 
the previous versions of the next-gen
they<00:02:49.700> feel<00:02:50.030> about<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.420> same<00:02:51.880> again<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:53.030> do

they feel about the same again you do

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.490 
they feel about the same again you do
have<00:02:53.239> some<00:02:55.570> scuffing<00:02:56.570> from<00:02:56.810> one<00:02:56.989> chip<00:02:57.290> to
