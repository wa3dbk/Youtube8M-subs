biceps are actually only about 33% of
the<00:00:15.450> arm<00:00:15.629> and<00:00:15.959> the<00:00:16.920> rest<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.369> arm<00:00:17.789> is

the arm and the rest of the arm is

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.659 
the arm and the rest of the arm is
actually<00:00:18.270> made<00:00:18.660> up<00:00:18.810> by<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:18.990> tricep<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.890> it's

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
actually made up by the tricep and it's

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:22.550 
actually made up by the tricep and it's
often<00:00:21.029> neglected<00:00:21.540> but<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.140> really<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.500> very

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
often neglected but it really is very

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.170 
often neglected but it really is very
important<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.430> lot<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.610> the<00:00:23.759> pressing

how to do one-armed tricep extensions I

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.619 
how to do one-armed tricep extensions I
like<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.719> bench<00:00:42.929> like<00:00:43.519> this<00:00:44.600> as<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
like to do on the bench like this as a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.329 
like to do on the bench like this as a
matter<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.899> fact<00:00:46.109> this<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.589> only<00:00:46.859> exercise

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
matter of fact this is the only exercise

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.610 
matter of fact this is the only exercise
aside<00:00:48.120> from<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.420> couple<00:00:48.449> of<00:00:48.690> legs<00:00:48.899> exercises

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
aside from a couple of legs exercises

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.099 
aside from a couple of legs exercises
where<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:49.920> actually<00:00:50.309> okay<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.149> extend<00:00:51.749> your

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
where it's actually okay to extend your

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.130 
where it's actually okay to extend your
arm<00:00:52.409> completely<00:00:53.600> I'm<00:00:54.600> actually<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:55.019> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
arm completely I'm actually going to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.090 
arm completely I'm actually going to
keep<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.559> arm<00:00:55.829> here<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.149> tricep<00:00:57.659> and<00:00:58.100> I'm

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
keep this arm here on the tricep and I'm

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.069 
keep this arm here on the tricep and I'm
going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.249> brace<00:00:59.550> my<00:00:59.789> arm<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.600> I'm

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
going to brace my arm with it and I'm

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.079 
going to brace my arm with it and I'm
going<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> lower<00:01:01.499> the<00:01:01.679> weight<00:01:01.969> to<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
going to lower the weight to the

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:04.910 
going to lower the weight to the
opposite<00:01:03.719> side<00:01:04.050> of<00:01:04.170> my<00:01:04.260> chest

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
opposite side of my chest

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.910 
opposite side of my chest
and<00:01:06.380> then<00:01:07.380> extend<00:01:07.890> my<00:01:08.040> arm<00:01:08.220> completely

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.780 

it's<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.550> very<00:01:15.000> very<00:01:15.600> simple<00:01:16.020> movement<00:01:16.640> but<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
it's a very very simple movement but the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.270 
it's a very very simple movement but the
hard<00:01:18.090> part<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.600> actually<00:01:18.900> keeping<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> arm

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
hard part is actually keeping the arm

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.830 
hard part is actually keeping the arm
straight<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.510> not<00:01:22.320> doing<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:24.110> or<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:26.840> this

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
straight and not doing this or this this

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.190 
straight and not doing this or this this
is<00:01:28.470> how<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> tricep<00:01:29.520> extension<00:01:30.080> at<00:01:31.080> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
is how we do the tricep extension at the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.980 
is how we do the tricep extension at the
top<00:01:31.410> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.650> exercise<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:33.060> actually<00:01:33.509> extend

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
top of the exercise we actually extend

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.410 
top of the exercise we actually extend
as<00:01:34.170> far<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.920> go<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.940> should<00:01:36.180> flex

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
as far as we can go and that should flex

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.020 
as far as we can go and that should flex
the<00:01:36.690> tricep<00:01:37.140> my<00:01:37.740> hands<00:01:38.220> although<00:01:38.580> I'm<00:01:38.670> holding

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the tricep my hands although I'm holding

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.770 
the tricep my hands although I'm holding
the<00:01:39.119> weight<00:01:39.300> very<00:01:39.840> securely<00:01:40.909> is<00:01:41.909> relaxed<00:01:42.509> my

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the weight very securely is relaxed my

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.660 
the weight very securely is relaxed my
hand<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.080> very<00:01:43.110> relaxed<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:44.130> arm<00:01:44.400> is<00:01:44.640> just

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
hand is very relaxed this arm is just

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.779 
hand is very relaxed this arm is just
for<00:01:45.090> guidance<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.810> I'm<00:01:46.800> letting<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.610> weights

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
for guidance and I'm letting the weights

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.440 
for guidance and I'm letting the weights
come<00:01:48.149> down<00:01:49.430> not<00:01:50.430> letting<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.789> touch<00:01:50.940> my<00:01:51.149> chest

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
come down not letting it touch my chest

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.480 
come down not letting it touch my chest
so<00:01:51.630> there's<00:01:51.810> still<00:01:51.960> tension<00:01:52.289> and<00:01:52.740> sort<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.399> a

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
so there's still tension and sort of a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.760 
so there's still tension and sort of a
stretch<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.090> tricep<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:54.750> then<00:01:55.200> extending

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
stretch in the tricep and then extending

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:17.620 
stretch in the tricep and then extending
up<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:56.820> that

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.650 

now<00:02:18.220> we're<00:02:19.220> gonna<00:02:19.310> do<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.550> changeup<00:02:20.150> on<00:02:20.390> this

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
now we're gonna do a changeup on this

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.050 
now we're gonna do a changeup on this
exercise<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:22.100> change-up<00:02:22.610> looks<00:02:22.880> like

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
exercise to the change-up looks like

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:33.470 
exercise to the change-up looks like
this

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.650 

and<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:34.140> would<00:02:34.260> not<00:02:34.470> believe<00:02:34.620> how<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:35.250> feels

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
and you would not believe how this feels

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:46.520 
and you would not believe how this feels
after<00:02:36.660> doing<00:02:36.930> several<00:02:37.170> repetitions<00:02:38.510> this<00:02:39.510> way

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.260 

you<00:02:47.100> should<00:02:47.280> actually<00:02:47.430> be<00:02:47.640> moving<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
you should actually be moving the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.900 
you should actually be moving the
weights<00:02:49.100> slowly<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.580> under<00:02:51.360> control<00:02:52.910> however

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
weights slowly and under control however

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.510 
weights slowly and under control however
once<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.020> start<00:02:55.050> fatiguing<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.980> muscle<00:02:56.340> and

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
once you start fatiguing the muscle and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.780 
once you start fatiguing the muscle and
you<00:02:56.940> recognize<00:02:57.630> exactly<00:02:58.350> where<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.709> is<00:02:58.860> then

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
you recognize exactly where it is then

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.440 
you recognize exactly where it is then
you<00:02:59.910> can<00:03:00.090> start<00:03:01.340> pumping<00:03:02.340> iron<00:03:02.550> if<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.030> will

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
you can start pumping iron if you will

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.440 
you can start pumping iron if you will
once<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.110> feel<00:03:04.319> very<00:03:04.500> secure<00:03:04.770> in<00:03:05.400> how<00:03:06.239> you're

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
once you feel very secure in how you're

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.199 
once you feel very secure in how you're
moving<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.020> weights<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:08.880> can<00:03:09.030> actually

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
moving the weights you can actually

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.300 
moving the weights you can actually
start<00:03:09.600> picking<00:03:09.989> up<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.290> momentum<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:11.040> about

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
start picking up the momentum to about

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.640 
start picking up the momentum to about
one<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.790> half<00:03:11.970> times<00:03:12.420> speed<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.530> were

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
one and a half times speed you were

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.190 
one and a half times speed you were
using<00:03:13.980> before<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:17.480> then<00:03:18.480> might<00:03:18.690> change<00:03:18.930> up

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
using before and then might change up

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:28.380 
using before and then might change up
this<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.920> what<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.160> looks<00:03:20.310> like

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.480 

I<00:03:28.450> like<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.260> do<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:29.560> exercise<00:03:29.890> first<00:03:32.490> because

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
I like to do this exercise first because

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.790 
I like to do this exercise first because
it's<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.730> very<00:03:33.910> sharp<00:03:34.390> movement<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:35.319> involves

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
it's a very sharp movement it involves

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.550 
it's a very sharp movement it involves
flexing<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.550> tricep<00:03:37.290> independent<00:03:38.290> from<00:03:38.440> the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
flexing the tricep independent from the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.500 
flexing the tricep independent from the
wave<00:03:38.740> and<00:03:38.980> if<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.520> get<00:03:39.700> my<00:03:39.819> other<00:03:40.000> tricep

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
wave and if I get my other tricep

wave and if I get my other tricep
exercises<00:03:41.050> going<00:03:41.470> I'm<00:03:41.980> really<00:03:42.370> not<00:03:42.490> going<00:03:42.790> to

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
exercises going I'm really not going to

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.970 
exercises going I'm really not going to
have<00:03:43.060> that<00:03:43.240> same<00:03:43.540> kind<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:43.959> sensation<00:03:44.620> because

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
have that same kind of sensation because

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.800 
have that same kind of sensation because
my<00:03:45.190> triceps<00:03:45.640> are<00:03:45.730> going<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:45.910> be<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.270> filled<00:03:46.600> up

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
my triceps are going to be so filled up

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.530 
my triceps are going to be so filled up
and<00:03:47.050> so<00:03:47.500> feeling<00:03:48.070> so<00:03:48.220> powerful<00:03:48.790> I'm<00:03:49.120> not<00:03:49.390> going

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
and so feeling so powerful I'm not going

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.480 
and so feeling so powerful I'm not going
to<00:03:49.630> really<00:03:49.810> be<00:03:50.020> able<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.230> make<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.709> superior

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
to really be able to make that superior

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.280 
to really be able to make that superior
