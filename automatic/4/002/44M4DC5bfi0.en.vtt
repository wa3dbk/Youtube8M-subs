00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
down and you can find individual folders

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.260 
down and you can find individual folders
like<00:01:18.900> if<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.170> had<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.460> database<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.880> single

like if you had a database in a single

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.240 
like if you had a database in a single
folder<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.810> could<00:01:21.990> drill<00:01:22.619> down<00:01:22.830> with<00:01:23.040> this

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
folder you could drill down with this

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.870 
folder you could drill down with this
and<00:01:23.520> try<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> open<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.570> but<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.860> little<00:01:26.759> bit

slow<00:01:42.479> chess<00:01:43.159> correspondence<00:01:44.159> chess<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.549> i

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
slow chess correspondence chess and i

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.359 
slow chess correspondence chess and i
was<00:01:44.700> using<00:01:44.880> chessbase<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:46.049> battle<00:01:46.560> him<00:01:46.710> but

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
was using chessbase to battle him but

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.710 
was using chessbase to battle him but
mostly<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:47.850> i<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.210> i<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.540> thing

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
mostly what i have is i have this thing

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.679 
mostly what i have is i have this thing
called<00:01:48.750> big<00:01:49.170> database<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.329> it's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
called big database and that is it's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.840 
called big database and that is it's
2010<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.680> little<00:01:52.829> bit<00:01:52.950> outdated<00:01:53.159> but

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
2010 so it's a little bit outdated but

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.069 
2010 so it's a little bit outdated but
it<00:01:54.000> has<00:01:54.119> what<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.049> 4<00:01:56.000> million<00:01:57.000> games<00:01:57.299> for

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
it has what is that 4 million games for

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.249 
it has what is that 4 million games for
a<00:01:58.110> half<00:01:58.259> million<00:01:58.500> games<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.390> which<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.570> quite

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
a half million games and which is quite

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.990 
a half million games and which is quite
a<00:02:01.320> bit<00:02:01.469> larger<00:02:01.799> than<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.979> fritz<00:02:02.280> 13<00:02:02.640> database

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
a bit larger than the fritz 13 database

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.330 
a bit larger than the fritz 13 database
so<00:02:03.420> i<00:02:03.450> usually<00:02:03.869> go<00:02:04.020> into<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.649> big<00:02:04.920> database

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
so i usually go into the big database

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.380 
so i usually go into the big database
and<00:02:05.549> what<00:02:06.119> i'll<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.780> double-click<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.740> and

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
and what i'll do is double-click it and

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.029 
and what i'll do is double-click it and
that<00:02:09.390> opens<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:09.869> sort<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> new<00:02:10.500> page<00:02:10.770> and

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that opens up sort of a new page and

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.800 
that opens up sort of a new page and
that<00:02:11.160> has<00:02:11.340> like<00:02:11.550> all<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.970> games<00:02:12.209> four<00:02:12.780> and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
that has like all the games four and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.520 
that has like all the games four and
half<00:02:12.959> million<00:02:13.170> game

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
half million game

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.230 
half million game
so<00:02:13.980> obviously<00:02:14.430> i'm<00:02:14.580> not<00:02:14.610> going<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.910> scroll

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
so obviously i'm not going to scroll

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.090 
so obviously i'm not going to scroll
down<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:15.990> find<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.560> individual<00:02:16.950> game

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
down and like find the individual game

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.860 
down and like find the individual game
that<00:02:17.250> i<00:02:17.340> want<00:02:17.580> i<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.180> click<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.450> board

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
that i want i have to click this board

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.070 
that i want i have to click this board
button<00:02:20.030> right<00:02:21.030> there's<00:02:21.510> all<00:02:21.720> these<00:02:21.870> different

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
button right there's all these different

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.750 
button right there's all these different
folders<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.860> i'm<00:02:23.040> not<00:02:23.160> even<00:02:23.220> sure<00:02:23.430> i<00:02:23.550> mean

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
folders and i'm not even sure i mean

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.130 
folders and i'm not even sure i mean
under<00:02:23.940> statistics<00:02:24.480> you've<00:02:24.630> one<00:02:24.780> called<00:02:24.990> a

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
under statistics you've one called a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.000 
under statistics you've one called a
status<00:02:26.569> tiki<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:27.690> which<00:02:27.990> is<00:02:28.170> probably<00:02:28.440> German

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
status tiki in which is probably German

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.050 
status tiki in which is probably German
but<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.610> mean<00:02:30.000> peace<00:02:30.300> probability<00:02:31.370> how<00:02:32.370> often

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
but I mean peace probability how often

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.760 
but I mean peace probability how often
pieces<00:02:33.569> end<00:02:33.810> up<00:02:34.050> on<00:02:34.170> different<00:02:34.440> squares

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.860 

that's<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:38.340> mean<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.209> not<00:02:39.360> really

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
that's I mean this is like not really

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.670 
that's I mean this is like not really
necessary<00:02:40.500> right<00:02:41.720> okay<00:02:42.720> let's<00:02:42.959> put<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> let's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
necessary right okay let's put a let's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.830 
necessary right okay let's put a let's
put<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.860> night<00:02:47.000> all<00:02:48.000> right<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.480> I've<00:02:48.600> no<00:02:48.750> idea

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
put a night all right so I've no idea

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.330 
put a night all right so I've no idea
how<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.050> how<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.560> works<00:02:49.709> but<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.100> was<00:02:50.220> just

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
how that how that works but I was just

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.400 
how that how that works but I was just
trying<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.670> honestly<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.780> think<00:02:51.870> there's<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.260> lot

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
trying to honestly I think there's a lot

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.100 
trying to honestly I think there's a lot
of<00:02:52.440> unnecessary<00:02:52.830> features<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.790> chessbase<00:02:54.480> 11

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
of unnecessary features in chessbase 11

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.380 
of unnecessary features in chessbase 11
it's<00:02:55.350> pretty<00:02:55.620> bulky<00:02:55.860> program<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.239> only

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
it's pretty bulky program so the only

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.640 
it's pretty bulky program so the only
thing<00:02:57.480> that's<00:02:57.780> actually<00:02:58.080> really<00:02:58.230> useful<00:02:58.290> is

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
thing that's actually really useful is

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.250 
thing that's actually really useful is
you<00:02:58.709> hit<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.920> board<00:02:59.160> button<00:02:59.930> i'm<00:03:00.930> giving<00:03:01.110> you

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
you hit the board button i'm giving you

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.600 
you hit the board button i'm giving you
the<00:03:01.350> honest<00:03:01.769> truth<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.220> wouldn't<00:03:02.430> hear<00:03:02.580> from

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
the honest truth you wouldn't hear from

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.030 
the honest truth you wouldn't hear from
anybody<00:03:02.940> else<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.110> hit<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.500> board<00:03:04.709> button

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
anybody else so you hit the board button

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.830 
anybody else so you hit the board button
and<00:03:05.250> now<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.850> brings<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.180> board<00:03:06.450> okay<00:03:06.780> so

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
and now it brings you a board okay so

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.259 
and now it brings you a board okay so
i'm<00:03:07.380> waking<00:03:07.980> up<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.160> morning<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.700> want<00:03:09.030> to

look at this one line I was I was uh I

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.130 
look at this one line I was I was uh I
was<00:03:12.959> black<00:03:14.000> either<00:03:15.000> way<00:03:15.269> so<00:03:15.569> I<00:03:15.600> want<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.989> look

was black either way so I want to look
at<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.290> one<00:03:16.500> line<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.920> Sicilian<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.820> if

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
at this one line of the Sicilian so if

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.090 
at this one line of the Sicilian so if
they<00:03:18.120> if<00:03:18.420> they<00:03:18.750> play<00:03:20.750> so<00:03:21.750> here<00:03:22.140> here<00:03:22.440> here<00:03:22.980> and

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
they if they play so here here here and

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.509 
they if they play so here here here and
now<00:03:23.190> here<00:03:24.200> okay<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> this<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.400> a

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
now here okay so this is a this is a

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.930 
now here okay so this is a this is a
gambit<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:28.470> think<00:03:28.709> this<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.010> pretty<00:03:29.790> a

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
gambit and I think this is pretty a

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.940 
gambit and I think this is pretty a
pretty<00:03:29.970> interesting<00:03:30.420> line<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.290> after<00:03:31.500> takes

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
pretty interesting line so after takes

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.319 
pretty interesting line so after takes
Knight<00:03:32.280> takes<00:03:32.519> I<00:03:32.640> think<00:03:32.790> it's<00:03:32.880> really<00:03:33.090> strong

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
Knight takes I think it's really strong

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.240 
Knight takes I think it's really strong
and<00:03:33.390> blitz<00:03:33.750> especially<00:03:34.290> at<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.769> amateur

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
and blitz especially at the amateur

the most common moves in this position

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.449 
the most common moves in this position
and<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:57.090> see<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.390> white<00:03:57.600> has<00:03:57.750> gambled<00:03:57.959> upon

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
and you see the white has gambled upon

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.220 
and you see the white has gambled upon
but<00:03:59.459> white<00:04:00.120> will<00:04:00.299> have<00:04:00.420> some<00:04:00.630> initiative<00:04:01.049> for

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
but white will have some initiative for

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.900 
but white will have some initiative for
that<00:04:01.350> pond<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.859> so<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:01.980> was<00:04:02.400> playing<00:04:02.609> this<00:04:02.730> at

that pond and so I was playing this at
the<00:04:03.000> park<00:04:03.239> yesterday<00:04:03.420> so<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:03.750> just<00:04:03.930> wanted<00:04:04.170> to

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
the park yesterday so I just wanted to

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.190 
the park yesterday so I just wanted to

look it up and share it with you guys
for<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.260> hell<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:08.100> let's<00:04:08.760> see<00:04:08.940> so

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
for the hell of it so let's see so

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.900 
for the hell of it so let's see so
knight<00:04:09.680> c6<00:04:10.680> they're<00:04:11.370> probably<00:04:11.609> going<00:04:11.820> to

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
knight c6 they're probably going to

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.960 
knight c6 they're probably going to
transpose<00:04:12.359> Bishop<00:04:13.260> c4<00:04:13.769> that<00:04:14.340> looks<00:04:14.760> like<00:04:14.850> the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
transpose Bishop c4 that looks like the

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.460 
transpose Bishop c4 that looks like the
baby<00:04:15.150> move<00:04:15.329> and<00:04:15.450> now<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.570> six<00:04:16.079> is<00:04:16.229> going<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:16.410> be

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
baby move and now a six is going to be

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.610 
baby move and now a six is going to be
played<00:04:19.280> alright<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.489> six<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:22.200> kind<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:22.500> have

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
played alright so a six you kind of have

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.480 
played alright so a six you kind of have
the<00:04:22.740> structure<00:04:23.039> you're<00:04:23.130> going<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.310> put<00:04:23.400> the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
the structure you're going to put the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.779 
the structure you're going to put the
Queen<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.789> c7<00:04:24.090> etc<00:04:24.659> so<00:04:25.200> now<00:04:25.500> 020<00:04:25.950> is<00:04:26.310> by<00:04:26.460> far<00:04:26.729> the

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
Queen to c7 etc so now 020 is by far the

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:27.350 
Queen to c7 etc so now 020 is by far the
most<00:04:27.000> common

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
most common

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.830 
most common
move<00:04:27.539> and<00:04:27.840> now<00:04:28.439> it<00:04:29.340> looks<00:04:29.460> like<00:04:29.580> night<00:04:29.879> this<00:04:30.689> is

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
move and now it looks like night this is

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.659 
move and now it looks like night this is
what<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.050> shall<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:31.560> woke<00:04:31.830> up<00:04:31.979> thinking<00:04:32.250> about

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
what I shall I woke up thinking about

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.119 
what I shall I woke up thinking about
this<00:04:33.389> line<00:04:33.689> this<00:04:33.719> exact<00:04:34.319> position<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:34.919> I<00:04:34.979> was

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:35.129 
this line this exact position and I was

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:36.890 
this line this exact position and I was
like<00:04:35.310> but<00:04:35.849> you<00:04:35.969> can't<00:04:36.270> play<00:04:36.509> Knight<00:04:36.719> f6

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
like but you can't play Knight f6

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.469 
like but you can't play Knight f6
because<00:04:37.650> then<00:04:37.830> after<00:04:38.250> they<00:04:38.370> play<00:04:38.580> e5<00:04:39.060> and

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
because then after they play e5 and

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.480 
because then after they play e5 and
where<00:04:39.689> does<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:39.960> night<00:04:40.139> go<00:04:40.409> right<00:04:40.919> that's

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
where does this night go right that's

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.820 
where does this night go right that's
what<00:04:42.300> I<00:04:42.330> was<00:04:42.539> thinking<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:43.139> so<00:04:43.560> now<00:04:43.590> with

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
what I was thinking and so now with

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.369 
what I was thinking and so now with
chessbase<00:04:44.580> 11<00:04:45.090> I'm<00:04:45.300> able<00:04:45.599> to<00:04:45.750> see<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:46.110> in

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379 
chessbase 11 I'm able to see that in

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.890 
chessbase 11 I'm able to see that in
this<00:04:46.680> exact<00:04:47.219> position<00:04:47.699> the<00:04:48.120> most<00:04:48.300> common<00:04:48.689> move

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
this exact position the most common move

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.279 
this exact position the most common move
is<00:04:49.139> night<00:04:49.860> g<00:04:50.189> to<00:04:50.310> e<00:04:50.340> 7<00:04:50.849> which<00:04:51.479> avoids<00:04:51.810> that<00:04:52.050> you

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
is night g to e 7 which avoids that you

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.110 
is night g to e 7 which avoids that you
five<00:04:52.500> push<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:53.310> now<00:04:53.430> if<00:04:53.580> they<00:04:53.729> play<00:04:53.909> Bishop

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
five push so now if they play Bishop

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.959 
five push so now if they play Bishop
here<00:04:54.539> you<00:04:54.990> actually<00:04:55.169> play<00:04:55.439> f6<00:04:55.889> to<00:04:55.979> f5<00:04:56.340> they

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:56.969 
here you actually play f6 to f5 they

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.409 
here you actually play f6 to f5 they
retreat<00:04:57.360> with<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:57.569> bishop<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.680> play<00:04:58.889> b5

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
retreat with the bishop and you play b5

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:05.990 
retreat with the bishop and you play b5
be<00:05:01.669> 3926<00:05:03.439> night<00:05:04.439> centralizes<00:05:05.129> Bishop<00:05:05.430> e7<00:05:05.580> this

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
be 3926 night centralizes Bishop e7 this

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.749 
be 3926 night centralizes Bishop e7 this
is<00:05:06.090> pretty<00:05:06.270> interesting<00:05:06.569> so<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:07.259> king<00:05:07.469> is

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 
is pretty interesting so the king is

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.990 
is pretty interesting so the king is
somewhat<00:05:08.759> safe<00:05:09.029> with<00:05:09.599> these<00:05:09.779> pawns<00:05:11.000> Queen

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
somewhat safe with these pawns Queen

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.610 
somewhat safe with these pawns Queen
comes<00:05:12.210> out<00:05:12.360> to<00:05:12.449> h5<00:05:12.719> that's<00:05:12.960> a<00:05:13.110> pretty<00:05:13.409> good

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
comes out to h5 that's a pretty good

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.640 
comes out to h5 that's a pretty good
move<00:05:13.770> probably<00:05:14.250> take<00:05:15.180> stakes<00:05:15.569> so<00:05:16.409> this<00:05:16.560> is

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
move probably take stakes so this is

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.290 
move probably take stakes so this is
just<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.949> most<00:05:17.069> commonly<00:05:17.669> played<00:05:17.879> line<00:05:18.090> but

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
just the most commonly played line but

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.879 
just the most commonly played line but
doesn't<00:05:18.629> mean<00:05:18.689> that<00:05:18.840> it's<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.110> best<00:05:19.289> so<00:05:19.860> let's

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
doesn't mean that it's the best so let's

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.749 
doesn't mean that it's the best so let's
go<00:05:20.250> back<00:05:20.460> for<00:05:20.490> a<00:05:20.789> moment<00:05:20.849> and<00:05:22.039> this<00:05:23.039> position<00:05:23.669> i

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
go back for a moment and this position i

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:28.129 
go back for a moment and this position i
think<00:05:24.060> i<00:05:25.819> think<00:05:26.819> the<00:05:26.939> disposition<00:05:27.750> was<00:05:27.810> it<00:05:27.960> was

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
think i think the disposition was it was

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.200 
think i think the disposition was it was
interesting<00:05:28.620> add<00:05:28.830> less<00:05:29.279> so<00:05:29.729> the<00:05:30.000> cool<00:05:30.180> thing

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210

and see the he played night here but
here<00:05:49.139> and<00:05:49.349> then<00:05:49.440> he<00:05:49.589> just<00:05:49.800> played<00:05:49.949> b5

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
here and then he just played b5

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.230 
here and then he just played b5
immediately<00:05:51.139> Bishop<00:05:52.139> b3<00:05:52.289> Bishop<00:05:52.919> d7<00:05:53.240> he

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
immediately Bishop b3 Bishop d7 he

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.879 
immediately Bishop b3 Bishop d7 he
avoided<00:05:54.629> playing<00:05:54.839> f6<00:05:55.259> which<00:05:55.440> I<00:05:55.560> think<00:05:55.740> makes

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
avoided playing f6 which I think makes

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.360 
avoided playing f6 which I think makes
upsets<00:05:56.310> because<00:05:56.520> f6<00:05:56.819> does<00:05:57.029> create<00:05:57.300> weaknesses

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
upsets because f6 does create weaknesses

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.159 
upsets because f6 does create weaknesses
so<00:05:59.370> you<00:05:59.490> put<00:05:59.669> the<00:05:59.759> Queen<00:05:59.969> to<00:06:00.089> be<00:06:00.210> 8<00:06:00.360> and<00:06:00.599> then

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
so you put the Queen to be 8 and then

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.209 
so you put the Queen to be 8 and then
move<00:06:01.439> to<00:06:01.469> the<00:06:01.589> night<00:06:01.800> away<00:06:01.949> and<00:06:02.389> you<00:06:03.389> see<00:06:03.599> that

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:04.219 
move to the night away and you see that

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.890 
move to the night away and you see that
this<00:06:05.219> is<00:06:05.370> a<00:06:05.430> pretty<00:06:05.639> pretty<00:06:06.449> interesting

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
this is a pretty pretty interesting

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.329 
this is a pretty pretty interesting
position<00:06:07.259> it<00:06:07.379> looks<00:06:07.680> like<00:06:07.860> white<00:06:08.099> doesn't

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:08.339 
position it looks like white doesn't

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:11.689 
position it looks like white doesn't
quite<00:06:08.819> have<00:06:09.150> enough<00:06:10.099> for<00:06:11.099> the<00:06:11.159> pond<00:06:11.400> with

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
quite have enough for the pond with

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.649 
quite have enough for the pond with
perfect<00:06:12.479> play<00:06:12.659> by<00:06:12.839> black<00:06:13.639> but<00:06:14.639> here's<00:06:15.029> King<00:06:15.240> f7

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
perfect play by black but here's King f7

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.079 
perfect play by black but here's King f7
that<00:06:15.750> looks<00:06:15.900> pretty<00:06:16.080> dangerous<00:06:16.229> so<00:06:17.089> white

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:18.089 
that looks pretty dangerous so white

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:21.290 
that looks pretty dangerous so white
does<00:06:18.360> win<00:06:18.539> the<00:06:18.659> pawn<00:06:18.839> back<00:06:19.849> so<00:06:20.849> now<00:06:20.969> we're

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
does win the pawn back so now we're

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.119 
does win the pawn back so now we're
pretty<00:06:21.479> far<00:06:21.689> to<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:21.960> opening<00:06:22.289> I'm<00:06:22.439> maybe

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:23.129 
pretty far to the opening I'm maybe

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:25.189 
pretty far to the opening I'm maybe
kamsky<00:06:23.580> just<00:06:23.789> outplayed<00:06:24.089> him<00:06:24.330> it<00:06:24.960> looks<00:06:25.080> like

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
kamsky just outplayed him it looks like

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.010 
kamsky just outplayed him it looks like
you<00:06:25.289> did<00:06:25.500> it<00:06:26.069> looks<00:06:26.219> like<00:06:26.689> looks<00:06:27.689> like<00:06:27.810> this

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
you did it looks like looks like this

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.589 
you did it looks like looks like this
was<00:06:28.229> maybe<00:06:28.379> a<00:06:28.500> blunder<00:06:28.889> because<00:06:29.159> of<00:06:29.250> Knight<00:06:29.370> f6

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 
was maybe a blunder because of Knight f6

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.629 
was maybe a blunder because of Knight f6
right<00:06:30.599> forking<00:06:31.259> the<00:06:31.319> two<00:06:31.439> pieces<00:06:31.740> Betty<00:06:32.460> way

strongest player who played this

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.380 
strongest player who played this
position<00:06:46.410> because<00:06:46.920> not<00:06:47.280> not<00:06:47.910> always<00:06:48.210> the<00:06:48.330> most

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.390 
position because not not always the most

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.710 
position because not not always the most
commonly<00:06:48.840> played<00:06:49.110> position<00:06:49.500> is<00:06:49.950> the<00:06:50.820> best

position right so you kind of find a

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.460 
position right so you kind of find a
balance<00:06:53.880> you<00:06:54.330> try<00:06:54.750> to<00:06:54.810> follow<00:06:55.080> the<00:06:55.200> best

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470

follow you know what is most commonly
played<00:06:59.610> and<00:06:59.850> sort<00:07:00.030> of<00:07:00.090> find<00:07:00.390> you<00:07:01.080> know<00:07:01.230> where

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:01.730 
played and sort of find you know where

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.410 
played and sort of find you know where
where<00:07:02.730> it<00:07:02.850> works<00:07:03.030> for<00:07:04.910> where<00:07:05.910> it's<00:07:06.060> good<00:07:06.240> for

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
where it works for where it's good for

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.250 
where it works for where it's good for
both<00:07:06.510> players<00:07:06.660> so<00:07:08.090> you<00:07:09.090> can<00:07:09.240> see<00:07:09.420> that<00:07:09.600> in<00:07:09.810> this

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 
both players so you can see that in this

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.710 
both players so you can see that in this
position<00:07:10.740> you<00:07:11.100> know<00:07:11.220> it<00:07:12.000> looks<00:07:12.030> like<00:07:12.360> white

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 
position you know it looks like white

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.300 
position you know it looks like white
has<00:07:12.930> one<00:07:13.170> about<00:07:13.380> forty<00:07:13.650> percent<00:07:13.680> and<00:07:14.190> then

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
has one about forty percent and then

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.890 
has one about forty percent and then
black<00:07:14.580> is<00:07:14.820> one<00:07:15.030> about<00:07:15.210> forty<00:07:15.540> percent<00:07:15.750> so

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 
black is one about forty percent so

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.120 
black is one about forty percent so
there's<00:07:16.050> about<00:07:16.170> twenty<00:07:16.500> two<00:07:16.620> percent<00:07:16.740> drawers

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.130 
there's about twenty two percent drawers

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.470 
there's about twenty two percent drawers
or<00:07:17.310> something<00:07:17.640> they<00:07:18.030> should<00:07:18.210> make<00:07:18.330> it<00:07:18.360> a

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.480 
or something they should make it a

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.210 
or something they should make it a
little<00:07:18.630> more<00:07:18.720> explicit<00:07:19.050> there's<00:07:19.950> way<00:07:20.190> too

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 
little more explicit there's way too
