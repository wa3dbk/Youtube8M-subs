00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.740
 hello people would have come back to one 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.640
 another brand video yes in this video 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.780
 for you a little secret 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.760
 I now show shelter 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.080
 I've already built a while 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.400
 times such a video made by a while 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.780
 but there were a few important ones missing 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.250
 Commodities such as 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.160
 the chip with table and it changes the 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.779
 it came later and now everything is 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.920
 introduce my video and also such a 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.010
 attach a small tutorial 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.480
 the everything is still a bit declare 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.559
 well in rough I have him such a horny 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.449
 Club made under the earth 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.979
 really all broken in a box 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:40.359
 have it open or rafting tate 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:42.789
 what you need so everything to life 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.229
 in minecraft and yes I have too 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.429
 try not only to weigh with 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.229
 an oven with a chest 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.489
 we can make us very small 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.870
 but you might also want to 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.609
 can live comfortably in it and for 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.670
 a longer time we hide 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.620
 must or has occurred at night and where 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.139
 which one can be used as an idea, for example 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.089
 all over the map distributed in the soil 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:02.079
 and since you always everywhere so 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.210
 small shelter no matter where you are 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.860
 if one is not provided by virtue of 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.420
 and everywhere monsters more concrete and so 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.550
 further and immediately you can feel good 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.100
 hide and live in it, too 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.930
 not only here says the variant is one 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.400
 bit cheap, well then just times 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.850
 I 've built over there fly times 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.890
 short over 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.100
 you can not see from above but if 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.450
 you get here so know that too 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.920
 it is unlikely and here 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.930
 there is a small button underneath 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.200
 if you press it you have to go fast 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.940
 overrun here and then opens 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.520
 after a while, this luca comdirect 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.560
 Here in sky hiding over here is there 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.800
 another button can always push 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.970
 you climb up very comfortably then and 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.620
 there you come again I would 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.290
 But there we come again high 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.960
 house later explain how exactly that 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.430
 works yes i will maybe 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.990
 Also that we are very many huts are 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.160
 just because I have no 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.810
 Wanted to waste blocks 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.130
 So if you are now in the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.350
 holzblock could then I would be quite 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.660
 Waste on flat because a wooden castle 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.100
 usually does not bring you one 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.420
 but already and I wanted to go now 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.280
 really do not waste blocks 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.570
 because I have everything easy with oven 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.460
 you can never fill enough 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.320
 if you have it from the mini comes with 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.080
 Iron because it's always good if you can 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.580
 I have many in the ground here in the two 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.040
 Great training done so yes 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.260
 can stow something about it 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.450
 no blog free for no blog so 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.740
 I put the floor as no 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.540
 problem here is also the ender test 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.700
 because she takes another change with it 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.840
 you can still stay there 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.400
 not good if you have several 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.960
 it could have been easy 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.120
 changed it do in every shelter 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.850
 you can test the edges everywhere 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.760
 still able to be here is whole with 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.290
 brewing the potions I stand 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.670
 here and and the water pool in 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.410
 the middle of the entertainment page 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.209
 Bookshelves where then the whole 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.180
 fly letter series then you can 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.470
 until level just under 24 is pretty good already 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.330
 420 decide more I still have it 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.410
 do not get 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.540
 I think it's an achievable one 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.520
 level one has here too 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.830
 Example 3 11 and 24 thinks it is 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.110
 really good because 24 have more level 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.390
 you do not normally and 11 and 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.600
 3 at the few level has when you 11 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.400
 level again around the corner it is 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.190
 424 are quite good when you 're four years old 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.390
 You have the bed here as well 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.019
 works even if i am 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.980
 to trick 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.100
 then you can pen &amp; touch works 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.830
 I have such a little bit over here too 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.580
 pumpkin farmville bypassed because change 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.040
 here the melon 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.970
 I do not know if there is gone now and 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.950
 There you can eat a bit 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.440
 get it just broke as 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.000
 would have creative in the capital the 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.590
 jukebox I have a torch on it 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 made over here you can see the faith 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.400
 I will not turn it down because otherwise 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.450
 there can help out any letters 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.160
 you do not even sit down 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.989
 one activates one which I always believe 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.910
 and otherwise there is more free here 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.360
 this is just a block of wood because of me 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.920
 about the ladder came about 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.120
 I think you could post on the blog here 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.440
 still replace by the oven 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.980
 but i think i really have here 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.569
 enough in it is still strong table and yes 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.769
 otherwise everything is actually here 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.680
 I have installed it will me here 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.780
 tear down and show you how it works 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.000
 everything works here i have gone 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.599
 being small kristic space over this 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.389
 button here 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:22.320
 you activate in wetzlar and there are 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.210
 a mechanism here free and over 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.780
 this mechanism is opened by the 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.210
 Runways ever hurt in the exact 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:36.630
 over here is the runway 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:39.630
 opened in classroom opens 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.690
 here the home club the c block moves away 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:47.220
 and that is governed by this 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.870
 circle and I'll say it in the back 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.280
 here is the button behind this one 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:59.639
 stone behind it is the water basin 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:05:02.789
 I put here button in activated there 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.490
 There was a signal that day was over 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.650
 These repeaters will be the best 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.550
 activated I show you first here 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.550
 between because we do not want that 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.830
 that the runways are extended 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.180
 perhaps best best I sit 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.690
 here my slopes here you can do it 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.300
 You can see better slopes for pistes here 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.820
 for example if we are here 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:32.669
 sit down 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:37.550
 no not so now here the slopes 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.550
 Reintermit and that they activate 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.690
 Wade through the peter I believe that 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.820
 Everyone knows how they work then 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.080
 open the slopes here and we 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.310
 but want that before home 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.590
 is folded and then once a 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.330
 horse and out again why has the luca 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.919
 once to open and you have to stop 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.940
 here 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:00.250
 I do not know about the better one 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.970
 Variant gives like the block take that 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.330
 sit down and behind a repeater one 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.800
 bet and therefore you activate 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.199
 and just stop by this little one 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.220
 press the button makes the since 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:19.630
 a short time out of the house 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:22.180
 if you do that then here you press the 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.010
 short over you over the 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.820
 then it will open quite well 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.050
 close again 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.250
 as a matter of course like that 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.880
 works if you still have questions 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.810
 power can still answer yes 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.520
 otherwise you can actually quite 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.510
 good self-appropriate if you stop 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.960
 little bit experimenting with it so and so 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.889
 if that's my little special 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.039
 additional what installed here 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:49.090
 namely the self-destructive button 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:52.389
 to do it a bit here again 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:58.900
 aesthetically, both look the same 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:07:00.669
 no longer plays zac if you 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.870
 hide your in the situation somehow 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:03.370
 would have to because somebody is coming or something 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.740
 and I have too many resources anyway 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.870
 must make way before at lübz please 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.289
 not through the city 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.090
 then you can do that 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:12.870
 activate self destruct mechanism 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.870
 and 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.730
 Are you pretty dead? 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.990
 then there is still a nice degree there 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.010
 it is a multiplayer server 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.710
 maybe not so appropriate to that 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.720
 because yes you can think 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.120
 Does not look very nice if you 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.230
 son guessed world otherwise have 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.520
 base for the video 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.350
 rather, I do not agree 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.880
 say if you still have questions like 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.010
 She writes the comments she says 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.230
 I am also a personal message 

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.490
 to reach more often 

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.840
 otherwise what the video thank you 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.840
 for watching and see you next time
