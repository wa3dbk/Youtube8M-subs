name<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.059> kind<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.300> sounded<00:00:12.660> better<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:13.019> me<00:00:13.139> but

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
name it kind of sounded better to me but

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.400 
name it kind of sounded better to me but
it's<00:00:14.280> pretty<00:00:14.519> much<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.790> same<00:00:14.969> thing<00:00:15.299> but<00:00:16.230> this

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
it's pretty much the same thing but this

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.590 
it's pretty much the same thing but this
game<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.830> definitely<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.460> huge<00:00:18.000> upgrade<00:00:18.240> from

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
game is definitely a huge upgrade from

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.380 
game is definitely a huge upgrade from
FIFA<00:00:18.869> 11<00:00:19.279> the<00:00:20.279> only<00:00:20.490> thing<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.910> kind<00:00:21.330> of

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
FIFA 11 the only thing that kind of

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.670 
FIFA 11 the only thing that kind of
disappointing<00:00:21.900> me<00:00:22.050> was<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.350> there's<00:00:22.529> no

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
disappointing me was that there's no

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.070 
disappointing me was that there's no
online<00:00:22.890> which<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:24.390> kind<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.779> step<00:00:25.050> back

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
online which it's kind of a step back

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.500 
online which it's kind of a step back
because<00:00:25.800> why<00:00:26.460> wouldn't<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.820> have<00:00:26.939> online<00:00:27.150> if

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
because why wouldn't you have online if

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.359 
because why wouldn't you have online if
you<00:00:27.630> had<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:27.960> 11<00:00:28.320> doesn't<00:00:29.039> really<00:00:29.189> make

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
you had it in 11 doesn't really make

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.620 
you had it in 11 doesn't really make
sense<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.670> me<00:00:29.760> but<00:00:30.029> that's<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.269> only<00:00:30.420> bad

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
sense to me but that's the only bad

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.260 
sense to me but that's the only bad
thing<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:32.340> definitely<00:00:32.520> made<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:33.059> for

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
thing but it's definitely made up for

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.750 
thing but it's definitely made up for
with<00:00:33.329> all<00:00:33.750> these<00:00:33.930> new<00:00:34.800> features<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.520> game

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.330 
with all these new features in this game

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
I think it's a lot more in-depth and it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.310 
I think it's a lot more in-depth and it
just<00:00:38.670> has<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> lot<00:00:39.030> more<00:00:39.090> replay<00:00:39.690> value<00:00:39.899> than

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
just has a lot more replay value than

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.830

challenges like in FIFA 11 this time
around<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.760> actually<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.359> money<00:01:00.629> for

winning matches in the manager mode
which<00:01:03.539> i<00:01:03.660> think<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.290> lot<00:01:04.559> more<00:01:04.739> realistic

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
which i think is a lot more realistic

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.580 
which i think is a lot more realistic
and<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:06.360> kind<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.659> makes<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> game<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> lot<00:01:07.560> more

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and it kind of makes the game a lot more

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.370 
and it kind of makes the game a lot more
in-depth<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.630> money<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.200> can

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
in-depth because with that money you can

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.020 
in-depth because with that money you can
use<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.890> upgrade<00:01:11.310> your<00:01:11.430> club

time around I'm not sure if that was in
FIFA<00:02:09.860> 11<00:02:10.069> but<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:10.970> don't<00:02:11.390> think<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.690> was<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.110> I'm

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
FIFA 11 but I don't think it was so I'm

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.660 
FIFA 11 but I don't think it was so I'm
just<00:02:12.680> gonna<00:02:12.830> go<00:02:13.010> out<00:02:13.129> and<00:02:13.220> say<00:02:13.370> it's<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.550> new

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
just gonna go out and say it's a new

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.729 
just gonna go out and say it's a new
feature<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.300> as<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.019> see<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.200> have<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> guy

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
feature and as you see I have a guy

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.190 
feature and as you see I have a guy
named<00:02:16.010> after<00:02:16.220> myself<00:02:16.810> playing<00:02:17.810> out<00:02:17.989> on<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
named after myself playing out on the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.320

fields<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.769> he's<00:02:19.430> actually<00:02:19.610> been<00:02:20.030> doing

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
fields and he's actually been doing

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.350 
fields and he's actually been doing
pretty<00:02:20.450> good<00:02:20.569> I<00:02:20.870> think<00:02:21.110> he's<00:02:21.260> my<00:02:21.440> striker<00:02:21.830> so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
pretty good I think he's my striker so

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.089 
pretty good I think he's my striker so
it's<00:02:23.360> been<00:02:23.540> pretty<00:02:23.989> cool<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.230> have<00:02:24.500> him<00:02:24.769> in<00:02:25.010> the

it's been pretty cool to have him in the

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.180 
it's been pretty cool to have him in the
game<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.550> then<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.810> main<00:02:26.989> feature<00:02:27.650> I'd<00:02:27.950> say

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
game and then the main feature I'd say

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.630

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
lot of fun with that I really like that

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.500 
lot of fun with that I really like that
mode<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:15.950> haven't<00:03:16.670> gotten<00:03:16.819> too<00:03:17.030> far<00:03:17.060> yet

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
mode I haven't gotten too far yet

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.940 
mode I haven't gotten too far yet
because<00:03:17.840> I've<00:03:18.079> been<00:03:18.200> playing<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.709> lot<00:03:18.829> of

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
because I've been playing a lot of

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.819 
because I've been playing a lot of
manager<00:03:19.370> mode<00:03:19.660> but<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:20.690> mode<00:03:21.139> is<00:03:21.170> pretty<00:03:21.410> fun

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
manager mode but that mode is pretty fun

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.059 
manager mode but that mode is pretty fun
in<00:03:22.069> itself<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.760> that's<00:03:23.690> probably<00:03:24.019> one<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:25.010> my

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
in itself so that's probably one of my

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.490 
in itself so that's probably one of my
favorite<00:03:25.459> features<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.819> this<00:03:26.060> game<00:03:26.500> but

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
favorite features of this game but

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.710 
favorite features of this game but
that's<00:03:27.769> pretty<00:03:28.010> much<00:03:28.220> all<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:29.180> new<00:03:29.299> features

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
that's pretty much all the new features

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
thing I did in FIFA 11 which is go

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.740 
thing I did in FIFA 11 which is go
through<00:03:51.889> four<00:03:52.519> games<00:03:52.819> at<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.060> time<00:03:53.299> and

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
through four games at a time and

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.199 
through four games at a time and
hopefully<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:55.130> should<00:03:55.370> definitely<00:03:55.670> be<00:03:56.030> able<00:03:56.120> to
