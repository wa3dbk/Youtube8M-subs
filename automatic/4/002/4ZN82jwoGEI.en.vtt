so<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:01.949> p85<00:00:02.550> unload<00:00:03.000> some<00:00:03.090> back

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
so this is the p85 unload some back

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.559 
so this is the p85 unload some back
roads<00:00:03.600> in<00:00:03.899> menlo<00:00:04.710> park<00:00:04.980> area<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.580> it<00:00:06.359> feels

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
roads in menlo park area and it feels

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.780 
roads in menlo park area and it feels
pretty<00:00:06.720> good<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:08.160> can<00:00:08.340> definitely<00:00:08.519> feel

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
pretty good and you can definitely feel

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.419 
pretty good and you can definitely feel
that<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.360> heavy<00:00:09.630> car<00:00:10.139> drives<00:00:11.070> kind<00:00:11.370> of

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
that this is a heavy car drives kind of

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.930 
that this is a heavy car drives kind of
like<00:00:11.550> my<00:00:11.670> M<00:00:12.059> Class<00:00:13.250> Mercedes<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.700> go<00:00:14.820> around

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
like my M Class Mercedes and go around

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
like my M Class Mercedes and go around
the<00:00:15.089> curves<00:00:15.299> can<00:00:15.420> definitely<00:00:15.809> feel<00:00:15.900> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
the curves can definitely feel the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.349 
the curves can definitely feel the
weight<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:17.340> really<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> much<00:00:18.150> lower

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
weight but it's really a much lower

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.250 
weight but it's really a much lower
center<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.810> gravity<00:00:19.010> you<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.130> adjust<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.670> to

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
center of gravity you can adjust it to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.810 
center of gravity you can adjust it to
the<00:00:22.260> right<00:00:22.619> height<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.310> right<00:00:23.490> now<00:00:23.519> we're<00:00:23.789> on

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the right height so right now we're on

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.310 
the right height so right now we're on
standard<00:00:24.330> if<00:00:24.449> I'm<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.750> get<00:00:24.840> sporty-er<00:00:25.289> I

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
standard if I'm going to get sporty-er I

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.679 
standard if I'm going to get sporty-er I
would<00:00:25.500> go<00:00:25.619> too<00:00:25.680> low<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.939> if<00:00:27.240> we're<00:00:27.510> in

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
would go too low and then if we're in

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.540 
would go too low and then if we're in
the<00:00:27.810> city<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.289> would<00:00:28.830> put<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.010> high<00:00:29.310> or<00:00:29.490> very

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the city I would put on high or very

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.060 
the city I would put on high or very
high<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.300> avoid<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.869> speed<00:00:31.619> bumps<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
high so I can avoid that speed bumps and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.799 
high so I can avoid that speed bumps and
curve<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.669> whatnot<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> country

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
curve and whatnot but in the country

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.819 
curve and whatnot but in the country
roads<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.410> if<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.250> feels<00:00:35.610> great<00:00:35.910> and

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
roads like this if it feels great and

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.190 
roads like this if it feels great and
right<00:00:37.829> now<00:00:38.010> I'm<00:00:38.190> going<00:00:38.489> 45<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.809> feel<00:00:40.050> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
right now I'm going 45 and I feel that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.020 
right now I'm going 45 and I feel that
isolated<00:00:41.010> sense<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.460> driving<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.760> vehicle

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
isolated sense of driving the vehicle

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.010 
isolated sense of driving the vehicle
words<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:43.170> feels<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.739> luxury<00:00:43.980> car<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:45.020> it

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
words it feels like a luxury car and it

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.720 
words it feels like a luxury car and it
doesn't<00:00:46.320> feel<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.530> some<00:00:46.890> out-of-control

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
doesn't feel like some out-of-control

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.000 
doesn't feel like some out-of-control
sports<00:00:48.329> car<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.190> muscle<00:00:50.190> car<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:51.739> that<00:00:52.739> is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
sports car or a muscle car that that is

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.939 
sports car or a muscle car that that is
unwieldly<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.750> acceleration<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.620> pretty

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
unwieldly and the acceleration is pretty

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.250 
unwieldly and the acceleration is pretty
good<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.730> has<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> regenerative<00:00:57.420> braking<00:00:58.079> which

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
good it has a regenerative braking which

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.529 
good it has a regenerative braking which
means<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.710> right<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.239> it's<00:01:00.239> actually

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
means like right now it's actually

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.139 
means like right now it's actually
putting<00:01:00.719> energy<00:01:00.930> back<00:01:01.320> into<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.649> battery<00:01:02.149> so

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
putting energy back into the battery so

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.830 
putting energy back into the battery so
that<00:01:03.300> should<00:01:03.420> help<00:01:03.449> when<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:04.040> drive<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.840> stop

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
that should help when we drive and stop

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.530 
that should help when we drive and stop
and<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.080> traffic<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:08.670> after<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.299> go<00:01:09.360> around

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
and go traffic and after you go around

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.250 
and go traffic and after you go around
these<00:01:09.630> curves<00:01:09.869> or<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.310> again<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.549> very

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
these curves or just again it's very

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.039 
these curves or just again it's very
smooth<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.560> don't<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:14.180> anybody<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.479> that

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
smooth I don't think anybody that that

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.870 
smooth I don't think anybody that that
jumps<00:01:16.320> into<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.619> would<00:01:16.830> really<00:01:17.009> notice<00:01:17.369> that

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
jumps into this would really notice that

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.800 
jumps into this would really notice that
it's<00:01:18.060> not<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> car<00:01:18.720> too<00:01:19.650> too<00:01:20.040> too<00:01:20.549> much

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
it's not like a car too too too much

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
it's not like a car too too too much
more<00:01:21.810> difficulty<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.380> drive<00:01:22.650> compared<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
more difficulty to drive compared to a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.929 
more difficulty to drive compared to a
big<00:01:24.600> luxury<00:01:24.990> car<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.520> if<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.640> do<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.909> any

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
big luxury car and if you do have any

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.300 
big luxury car and if you do have any
issues<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.299> their<00:01:27.659> he's<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.310> breaking

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
issues with their he's going to breaking

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.910 
issues with their he's going to breaking
we<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.939> switch<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> low<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:31.590> it'll<00:01:31.799> be

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
we can switch it to low and it'll be

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.830 
we can switch it to low and it'll be
less<00:01:32.100> noticeable<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.850> know<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.570> lot<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.750> people

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
less noticeable I know a lot of people

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.440 
less noticeable I know a lot of people
have<00:01:34.079> mentioned<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.950> then<00:01:35.670> creep<00:01:36.210> is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
have mentioned this and then creep is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.010 
have mentioned this and then creep is
another<00:01:36.659> function<00:01:36.920> where<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:39.509> drives

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
another function where and it drives

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.350 
another function where and it drives
more<00:01:40.290> naturally<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> gas-powered<00:01:41.909> car<00:01:42.240> so

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
more naturally like a gas-powered car so

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.289 
more naturally like a gas-powered car so
you<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.810> worry<00:01:42.899> about

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
you don't really have to worry about

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.580 
you don't really have to worry about
adapting<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.450> whole<00:01:45.689> new<00:01:45.930> driving

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
adapting to a whole new driving

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.590 
adapting to a whole new driving
experience<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.700> go<00:01:47.820> ahead<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.329> go<00:01:48.479> around

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
experience can we go ahead and go around

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.180 
experience can we go ahead and go around
these<00:01:48.780> curves<00:01:48.960> and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
these curves and

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.150 
these curves and
see<00:01:52.190> what<00:01:52.280> it's<00:01:52.430> like<00:01:56.530> big<00:01:57.530> heavy<00:01:57.710> car<00:01:57.950> I've

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
see what it's like big heavy car I've

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.920 
see what it's like big heavy car I've
never<00:01:58.310> felt<00:01:58.520> toward<00:01:59.150> this<00:01:59.270> heavy<00:01:59.450> break<00:01:59.750> down

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
never felt toward this heavy break down

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.670 
never felt toward this heavy break down
smoothly<00:02:00.230> yeah<00:02:01.070> didn't<00:02:01.580> get<00:02:01.700> any<00:02:01.850> nose<00:02:02.090> dive

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
smoothly yeah didn't get any nose dive

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.630 
smoothly yeah didn't get any nose dive
down<00:02:03.680> i<00:02:03.740> guess<00:02:04.100> that's<00:02:04.280> partially<00:02:04.490> because

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
down i guess that's partially because

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.730 
down i guess that's partially because
we're<00:02:04.880> already<00:02:05.000> close<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:06.380> ground<00:02:06.470> and

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
we're already close to the ground and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.139 
we're already close to the ground and
the<00:02:06.830> battery<00:02:07.100> packs<00:02:07.370> run<00:02:07.640> for<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.850> entire

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
the battery packs run for the entire

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:31.600 
the battery packs run for the entire
floor<00:02:08.510> correct<00:02:09.110> and

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.770 

also<00:02:32.610> gonna<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.910> transmission<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.630> it's

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
also gonna have a transmission so it's

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.960 
also gonna have a transmission so it's
all<00:02:33.930> flat<00:02:34.170> floor<00:02:34.440> first<00:02:35.310> time<00:02:35.520> ever<00:02:35.730> that's

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
all flat floor first time ever that's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:46.220 
all flat floor first time ever that's
comfortable<00:02:36.510> as<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.020> rear<00:02:37.170> seat<00:02:37.410> no<00:02:45.200> now<00:02:46.200> I

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
comfortable as in the rear seat no now I

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
comfortable as in the rear seat no now I
would<00:02:46.410> say<00:02:46.500> that's<00:02:46.680> almost<00:02:46.890> too<00:02:47.100> much<00:02:47.190> power

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
would say that's almost too much power

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.550 
would say that's almost too much power
for<00:02:47.580> us<00:02:47.910> again<00:02:48.180> what<00:02:48.600> we<00:02:48.690> just<00:02:48.810> experienced<00:02:49.470> I

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
for us again what we just experienced I

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.130 
for us again what we just experienced I
mean<00:02:49.770> really<00:02:50.600> launches<00:02:51.600> from<00:02:51.750> zero<00:02:52.050> to

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
mean really launches from zero to

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.000 
mean really launches from zero to
whatever<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.770> was<00:02:53.000> without<00:02:54.000> any<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.840> all

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
whatever that was without any of it all

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:21.380 
whatever that was without any of it all
rabbits

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.090 

so<00:03:22.390> this<00:03:22.660> is<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:23.050> is<00:03:23.170> nice<00:03:23.350> because<00:03:23.650> the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
so this is this is nice because the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.280 
so this is this is nice because the
regen<00:03:24.670> breaking<00:03:25.390> sort<00:03:25.660> takes<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.930> place<00:03:26.140> of

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
regen breaking sort takes a place of

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.310 
regen breaking sort takes a place of
downshifting<00:03:26.920> or<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:28.210> holding<00:03:28.510> of<00:03:28.660> holding<00:03:29.230> a

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
downshifting or the holding of holding a

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.100 
downshifting or the holding of holding a
gear<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.710> transmission
