00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.470
 Magallanes is a region with landscapes 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.230
 almost intact its biological diversity its 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.180
 location between mountain ranges 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.490
 surrounded by ice and enrich and 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.030
 enhance their generous nature 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.400
 nature and biodiversity and from 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.460
 a while ago it has been threatened by 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.720
 an invasive algae that is silently 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.860
 it reached some rivers in the region 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.860
 to fill up 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.720
 your name 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:06.080
 we live the minimum is a food route a 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.780
 microscopic unicellular algae that creates 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.130
 a biomass shaped stems very 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.810
 thick adhering rocks and floors 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.259
 covering it are of a brown layer and my 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.259
 wife 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.190
 this endemic alga of the countries 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.590
 Scandinavians was identified the year 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.340
 1819 in the Faroe Islands and then in 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.340
 North America 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.220
 in 2004 it was detected for the first time 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.970
 time in the southern hemisphere in new 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.960
 zeland in just three years it spread to 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:51.220
 almost 70% of the bodies of water of the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.860
 South Island of that country in 2010 is 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.830
 detected in chile in river on 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.720
 region of the lakes and in aysén 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.480
 when the region was detected 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.370
 of aysén the henchman located immediately 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.660
 a project to monitor the bodies 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.580
 of continental waters the region of 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.800
 magallanes not finding the presence 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.570
 of the algae but until 2013 in 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.100
 regular sampling was detected the 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.630
 positive presence of we live in the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.080
 province earth of fire in rivers 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.080
 big white 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.040
 he lives and is able to reproduce 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.980
 quickly becoming large 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.330
 masses that cover large areas of the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.310
 long river bottoms 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.010
 the habitat we live in are the waters 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.260
 mainly the rivers in 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.930
 them the didymo covers large quantities 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.940
 of substrates which clearly generates a 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.040
 visual impact however in others 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.170
 countries have been documented damage to 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.750
 ecosystem among those who are 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.280
 impacts on the benthic fauna that is 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.070
 Fish food mainly 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.260
 native fish that besides not having 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.260
 food could not have where to spawn 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.970
 the place transforms into a stage 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.330
 devastating covered by the seaweed creating 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.000
 a landscape of its lucid similar to a 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.230
 great concentration of toilet paper or 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.670
 wool wet by water 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.310
 this is a river that I was 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.870
 used to visit today is very sad 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.209
 see them since your fund is 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.780
 completely covered in wine and 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.540
 altered the fragile ecosystem of risk 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.819
 we must become aware and prevent 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.680
 imagine you are the minimum reach the 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.040
 rivers and lakes of Torres del Paine by 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.700
 example 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.799
 this invasive algae and is very resistant and 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.379
 can survive out of water by 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:46.650
 prolonged periods or up to 40 days 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:49.500
 in wanderers and felt boots 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.439
 since Cequa Foundation detected the 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.720
 presence of it in our region the 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.129
 Undersecretariat of Fisheries and Agriculture in 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.700
 set with the scientific center 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.739
 regional is who carries out actions 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.650
 of permanent monitoring in this matter 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.260
 have developed an action plan for 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.609
 prevent its spread in other rivers and 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.609
 lakes in the region of magallanes 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.729
 it spreads very easily from a 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.829
 place to another mainly by action 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.660
 of the man who transports them 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.960
 involuntarily in his footwear 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.169
 fishing gear or clothing on 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.479
 vehicles it is important to apply measures 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:34.130
 special to avoid dispersion 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:37.080
 taking the following precautions 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.900
 after using your implements 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.770
 fishing remove all organic material 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.620
 that his market has been adhered to 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.630
 from 1 to 2 minutes in a bucket with 10 cm and 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.280
 pieces of water with some solution 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.160
 disinfectant 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.660
 does not return to the river the water your quota for 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.900
 disinfect 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.920
 avoid wearing boots forever and footwear or 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.660
 denies facts of absorbent material 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.150
 the vehicles and boats that 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.400
 they came in contact with the water too 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.710
 they must be cleaned with a solution 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.520
 disinfectant 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.220
 clean the tires and the bottom of 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.980
 your vehicle if you came in contact with the 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.740
 Water 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:27.010
 the divine can only survive in 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.070
 humid environments if you could not disinfect 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:33.220
 your equipment and fishing gear let it 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:36.100
 dry for at least 48 hours before 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.230
 they use are again 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.490
 always but always must develop 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.690
 this preventive action because the 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.520
 bodies of water are tremendously 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.990
 vulnerable and if you know you were 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.120
 in contact with a river polluted with 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.830
 we said you should perform these measures of 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.830
 disinfection immediately 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.039
 any activity that takes place in a 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.880
 aquatic environment is a potential vector 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:01.340
 to transport it between rivers and lakes 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.860
 the last one is so tough that it can 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.020
 survive in a drop of water and although 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.720
 it is a harmless alga for health 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.850
 human can modify ecosystems 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.670
 in what proliferates causing a 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:16.700
 irreparable devastation 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:20.930
 and all of us depend on having this 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:26.350
 plague inform yourself and inform others for 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.350
 tell both the minimum and magallanes
