40k and I was well impressed with it the
they<00:03:30.390> even<00:03:30.600> go<00:03:30.690> into<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.989> detail<00:03:31.290> on<00:03:31.320> how<00:03:31.620> they

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
they even go into the detail on how they

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.050 
they even go into the detail on how they
made<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.980> side<00:03:32.160> effects<00:03:32.549> for<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.760> boulder

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
made the side effects for the boulder

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.460 
made the side effects for the boulder
because<00:03:33.329> everybody<00:03:33.750> likes<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.140> think<00:03:34.350> of

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
because everybody likes to think of

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.400 
because everybody likes to think of
boelter<00:03:34.890> firing<00:03:35.250> in<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.430> different<00:03:35.730> way<00:03:35.850> and

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
boelter firing in a different way and

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.710 
boelter firing in a different way and
you<00:03:37.410> know<00:03:37.500> that's<00:03:37.739> basically<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.480> of<00:03:39.480> course

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
you know that's basically it of course

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.670 
you know that's basically it of course
that's<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.049> for<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.320> ten<00:03:41.989> so<00:03:42.989> my<00:03:43.019> opinions<00:03:43.560> on

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
about a week and four days and I've been

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.930 
about a week and four days and I've been
counting<00:03:49.799> how<00:03:50.040> many<00:03:50.070> times<00:03:50.400> I've<00:03:50.549> watched<00:03:50.760> it

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.690 
just to see how nerdy I am I've watched
the<00:03:53.160> 18<00:03:53.610> times<00:03:53.910> so<00:03:54.420> far<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:55.070> no<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.250> haven't<00:03:56.459> got

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.430 
the 18 times so far and no I haven't got
bored<00:03:56.880> of<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.030> yet<00:03:57.239> it's<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.630> short<00:03:57.900> movie<00:03:58.079> but

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
bored of it yet it's a short movie but

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.560 
bored of it yet it's a short movie but
at<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.620> same<00:03:58.799> time<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.459> feels<00:03:59.910> long<00:04:00.299> i<00:04:00.420> mean

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
at the same time is it feels long i mean

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.960 
at the same time is it feels long i mean
i<00:04:00.810> still<00:04:01.530> i<00:04:01.650> paused<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.130> at<00:04:02.250> 20<00:04:02.579> minutes<00:04:02.850> and

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
i still i paused it at 20 minutes and

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.580 
i still i paused it at 20 minutes and
thought<00:04:03.239> i'd<00:04:03.390> been<00:04:03.570> watching<00:04:03.930> for<00:04:04.110> a<00:04:04.170> good<00:04:04.350> 45

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
thought i'd been watching for a good 45

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.340 
thought i'd been watching for a good 45
minutes<00:04:04.890> so<00:04:05.510> there's<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.600> lot<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:06.780> stuff<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.049> get

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
minutes so there's a lot of stuff to get

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.120 
minutes so there's a lot of stuff to get
in<00:04:07.500> there<00:04:07.700> I<00:04:09.049> enjoyed<00:04:10.049> watching<00:04:10.200> it<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.950> weird

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
in there I enjoyed watching it the weird

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.530 
in there I enjoyed watching it the weird
thing<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.400> though<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:11.700> can't<00:04:12.090> really

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
thing is though I can't really

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.110 
thing is though I can't really
understand<00:04:13.109> why<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:14.070> was<00:04:14.250> given<00:04:14.519> such<00:04:14.850> a<00:04:14.880> low

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
understand why it was given such a low

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.849 
understand why it was given such a low
budget<00:04:15.329> I<00:04:15.630> mean<00:04:15.840> these<00:04:15.989> guys<00:04:16.049> yes<00:04:16.500> codex

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
budget I mean these guys yes codex

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.670 
budget I mean these guys yes codex
productions<00:04:17.310> not<00:04:17.640> very<00:04:18.030> well<00:04:18.209> renowned<00:04:18.680> but

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
productions not very well renowned but

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.409 
productions not very well renowned but
they<00:04:19.799> did<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:19.979> really<00:04:20.070> good<00:04:20.489> job<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.090> can't

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
they did a really good job and I can't

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.420 
they did a really good job and I can't
turn<00:04:22.140> on<00:04:22.349> and<00:04:22.530> slag<00:04:22.740> them<00:04:22.950> off<00:04:23.070> for<00:04:23.310> that

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
turn on and slag them off for that

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.760 
turn on and slag them off for that
because<00:04:23.610> this<00:04:24.419> is<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.690> very<00:04:24.960> hard<00:04:25.289> thing<00:04:25.349> to<00:04:25.620> get

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
because this is a very hard thing to get

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.469 
because this is a very hard thing to get
right<00:04:25.800> because<00:04:26.370> there's<00:04:26.550> so<00:04:26.849> many<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.270> you
