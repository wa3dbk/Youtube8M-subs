it's kind of like playing clucks have

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.010

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
need a little bit of clarification there

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.959 
need a little bit of clarification there
and<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> idea<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.399> owner<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.950 
and the idea is that the owner of the
mansion<00:00:54.149> mr.<00:00:54.750> X<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.350> very<00:00:55.920> appropriate<00:00:55.980> name<00:00:56.550> I

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
mansion mr. X a very appropriate name I

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.930 
mansion mr. X a very appropriate name I
has<00:00:58.070> disappeared<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.370> there's<00:00:59.670> something

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
has disappeared or there's something

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.240 
has disappeared or there's something
that's<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.629> bit<00:01:00.840> fishy<00:01:01.079> about<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.710> so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
that's a little bit fishy about it so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.410 
that's a little bit fishy about it so
your<00:01:02.340> goal<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.670> actually<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:03.090> through<00:01:03.120> all

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
your goal is to actually go through all

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.380 
your goal is to actually go through all
the<00:01:03.570> different<00:01:03.690> rooms<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:05.030> do<00:01:06.030> these<00:01:06.210> items

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the different rooms and I do these items

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.050 
the different rooms and I do these items
searches<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.140> eventually<00:01:07.939> reach<00:01:08.939> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
searches and then eventually reach a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.280 
searches and then eventually reach a
point<00:01:09.240> where<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.570> learn<00:01:09.780> more<00:01:09.990> about<00:01:10.080> the

power-ups<00:02:56.850> as<00:02:57.090> energy<00:02:57.450> things<00:02:57.630> which<00:02:57.780> we'll

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
power-ups as energy things which we'll

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.110 
power-ups as energy things which we'll
talk<00:02:57.930> about<00:02:58.080> just<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.650> second<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.550> simply<00:02:59.820> tap

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
in terms of difficulty you know this is

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.810 
in terms of difficulty you know this is
a<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:07.410> know<00:03:07.500> it's<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.010> challenging<00:03:08.460> game<00:03:08.520> at

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
a you know it's a challenging game at

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.460 
a you know it's a challenging game at
the<00:03:08.970> same<00:03:09.120> time<00:03:09.270> it's<00:03:09.480> not<00:03:09.720> as<00:03:09.960> hard<00:03:10.140> as<00:03:10.260> some

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
the same time it's not as hard as some

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.720 
the same time it's not as hard as some
of<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.590> other<00:03:10.710> ones<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.070> we<00:03:11.160> have<00:03:11.310> seen<00:03:11.610> in

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
of the other ones that we have seen in

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.590 
of the other ones that we have seen in
the<00:03:11.820> genre<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:13.170> with<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.440> might<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:14.600> depending

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
the genre so with that might I depending

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.449 
the genre so with that might I depending
on<00:03:15.690> how<00:03:15.810> into<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.500> are<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.890> may<00:03:17.130> or<00:03:17.190> not

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
on how into this you are you may or not

on how into this you are you may or not
may<00:03:17.850> or<00:03:17.970> may<00:03:18.060> not<00:03:18.090> be<00:03:18.240> put<00:03:18.510> off<00:03:18.540> by<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:19.490> so<00:03:20.490> you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
may or may not be put off by this so you

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.550 
may or may not be put off by this so you
know<00:03:21.570> it's<00:03:21.690> hard<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.990> it's<00:03:22.110> hard<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.350> say<00:03:22.500> but

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
know it's hard to it's hard to say but

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.750 
know it's hard to it's hard to say but
in<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:22.830> long<00:03:23.040> run<00:03:23.070> we're<00:03:23.400> going<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.610> say<00:03:23.700> this

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
in the long run we're going to say this

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.940 
in the long run we're going to say this
is<00:03:23.880> about<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.090> medium<00:03:24.300> difficulty<00:03:24.780> perhaps<00:03:25.709> no

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
is about a medium difficulty perhaps no

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.860 
is about a medium difficulty perhaps no
more<00:03:25.980> than<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.550> in<00:03:26.970> most<00:03:27.180> cases<00:03:27.450> we<00:03:27.690> didn't

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
more than that in most cases we didn't

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.360 
more than that in most cases we didn't
have<00:03:27.990> any<00:03:28.080> trouble<00:03:28.410> finding<00:03:28.590> things<00:03:28.980> except

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
have any trouble finding things except

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.440 
have any trouble finding things except
for<00:03:29.520> maybe<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.760> few<00:03:29.970> of<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.240> later

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
for maybe a few of the later

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.870 
for maybe a few of the later
playthroughs<00:03:31.140> as<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.100> can<00:03:32.220> play<00:03:32.370> each<00:03:32.520> level

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
playthroughs as you can play each level

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.730 
playthroughs as you can play each level
multiple<00:03:33.240> times<00:03:33.480> sometimes<00:03:33.750> you're<00:03:34.140> in<00:03:34.470> sort

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
multiple times sometimes you're in sort

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.190 
multiple times sometimes you're in sort
of<00:03:34.800> this<00:03:35.209> torch<00:03:36.209> like<00:03:36.540> thing<00:03:36.900> where<00:03:37.080> you're

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
of this torch like thing where you're

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.840 
of this torch like thing where you're
going<00:03:37.470> around<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.770> just<00:03:37.950> whatever<00:03:38.490> light<00:03:38.730> is

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
going around in just whatever light is

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.699 
going around in just whatever light is
illuminated<00:03:39.030> by<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.420> torch<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.930> then<00:03:40.590> you

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
illuminated by the torch and then you

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.199 
illuminated by the torch and then you
tap<00:03:41.160> items<00:03:41.490> as<00:03:41.580> you<00:03:41.670> find<00:03:41.880> them<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.090> that's

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
tap items as you find them so that's

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.640 
tap items as you find them so that's
slightly<00:03:42.480> harder<00:03:42.810> but<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.080> long<00:03:43.260> run<00:03:43.290> it's

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
slightly harder but in the long run it's

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.140 
slightly harder but in the long run it's
not<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.100> much<00:03:44.160> about<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.610> as<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.060> about

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
not so much about that as it is about

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150 
not so much about that as it is about
the<00:03:45.390> story<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.959> about<00:03:46.440> gaining<00:03:46.680> items<00:03:47.040> in

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
the story and about gaining items in

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.910 
the story and about gaining items in
inventory<00:03:47.640> etc<00:03:48.830> hooray<00:03:49.830> i<00:03:50.070> will<00:03:50.790> put<00:03:51.920> another

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
inventory etc hooray i will put another

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.199 
inventory etc hooray i will put another
idea<00:03:53.250> here<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.490> that<00:03:53.550> as<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.760> go<00:03:53.970> through<00:03:54.180> the

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
idea here is that as you go through the

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.910 
idea here is that as you go through the
levels<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.720> do<00:03:54.840> acquire<00:03:55.020> inventory<00:03:55.650> items

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
levels you do acquire inventory items

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.290 
levels you do acquire inventory items
that<00:03:56.070> unlock<00:03:56.280> other<00:03:56.490> aspects<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.180> app

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
that unlock other aspects of the app

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.810 
that unlock other aspects of the app
other<00:03:57.840> levels<00:03:58.320> etc<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:59.310> that's<00:03:59.459> pretty<00:03:59.640> cool

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
other levels etc so that's pretty cool

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.030 
other levels etc so that's pretty cool
we<00:03:59.910> always<00:04:00.150> like<00:04:00.300> that<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.590> course<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.920> do

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
we always like that and of course you do

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.280 
we always like that and of course you do

farmville in that sense as you're

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.630 
farmville in that sense as you're
playing<00:04:18.660> it<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:18.959> free<00:04:19.260> but<00:04:19.830> subsidized<00:04:20.370> via

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
purchases which we're going to go

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.430 
purchases which we're going to go
come<00:04:23.639> out<00:04:23.759> I've<00:04:24.150> got<00:04:24.330> this<00:04:24.449> energy<00:04:24.870> meter<00:04:25.289> at

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
come out I've got this energy meter at

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.469 
come out I've got this energy meter at
along<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.770> top<00:04:25.979> there<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.550> says<00:04:27.000> 50<00:04:27.360> out<00:04:27.449> of

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
along the top there that says 50 out of

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.270 
along the top there that says 50 out of
50<00:04:27.810> so<00:04:27.960> at<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.110> moment<00:04:28.289> I'm<00:04:28.830> pretty<00:04:29.069> high<00:04:29.250> on

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
50 so at the moment I'm pretty high on

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.580 
50 so at the moment I'm pretty high on
energy<00:04:29.690> but<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.750> thing<00:04:30.810> is<00:04:30.990> this<00:04:31.169> time<00:04:31.379> goes

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
energy but the thing is this time goes

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.200 
energy but the thing is this time goes
on<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:32.039> do<00:04:32.099> more<00:04:32.370> rooms<00:04:32.580> that<00:04:32.789> takes<00:04:33.030> energy

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
on and I do more rooms that takes energy

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.210 
on and I do more rooms that takes energy
