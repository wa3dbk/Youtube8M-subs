this<00:00:08.610> little<00:00:09.510> add-on<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.200> wrote<00:00:10.940> this

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
this little add-on that I wrote this

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.060 
this little add-on that I wrote this
little<00:00:12.240> script<00:00:12.480> assigns<00:00:12.900> random<00:00:13.590> materials

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
little script assigns random materials

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.310 
little script assigns random materials
from<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> objects<00:00:15.120> list<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.540> materials<00:00:15.660> to

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
from the objects list of materials to

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.890 
from the objects list of materials to
each<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.859> every<00:00:17.160> face<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> mesh<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.779> it

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
each and every face on the mesh and it

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.050 
each and every face on the mesh and it
works<00:00:19.050> nicely<00:00:19.380> with<00:00:19.740> cycles<00:00:20.220> or<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.760> blender

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
works nicely with cycles or the blender

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
variations that add realism which is

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.740 
variations that add realism which is
actually<00:00:31.890> what<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.250> needed<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.820> mostly<00:00:33.180> for<00:00:33.540> as

when you go to the 3d view you're going
to<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.960> little<00:01:25.200> panel<00:01:25.560> here<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.330> this

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
to see this little panel here and this

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.429 
to see this little panel here and this
panel<00:01:27.750> has<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.380> act<00:01:29.630> options<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:31.020> we're

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
panel has to act options which we're

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.289 
panel has to act options which we're
going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.650> see<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.909> second<00:01:34.340> but<00:01:35.340> first<00:01:35.400> let's

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
going to see in a second but first let's

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.300 
going to see in a second but first let's
just<00:01:36.540> have<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> look<00:01:36.810> at<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.079> cube<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.920> cube

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
just have a look at this cube this cube

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.120 
just have a look at this cube this cube
actually<00:01:38.970> has<00:01:39.210> been<00:01:39.479> subdivided<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.799> number<00:01:41.040> of

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
actually has been subdivided a number of

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
actually has been subdivided a number of
times<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.759> you<00:01:44.759> actually<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.210> quite<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.930> few

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
times so you actually have quite a few

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.429 
times so you actually have quite a few
places<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.759> also<00:01:47.909> has<00:01:48.439> seven

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
places here and it also has seven

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.999 
places here and it also has seven
materials<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:51.350> seven<00:01:52.350> materials<00:01:52.829> which

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
materials you have seven materials which

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.420 
materials you have seven materials which
have<00:01:53.040> different<00:01:53.759> names<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.479> different<00:01:55.430> colors

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
have different names in different colors

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.830 
have different names in different colors
of<00:01:56.460> course<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.950> when<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.340> go<00:01:59.729> to<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> add-on

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
of course and when you go to the add-on

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.389 
of course and when you go to the add-on
and<00:02:00.990> press<00:02:01.320> change<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.369> randomization<00:02:03.119> seed

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
and press change the randomization seed

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.990 
and press change the randomization seed
it's<00:02:05.399> going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.700> apply<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:07.459> random<00:02:08.459> material

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
it's going to apply a random material

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.210 
it's going to apply a random material
from<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> list<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:10.470> each<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.860> every<00:02:11.039> one<00:02:11.160> of

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
from the list to each and every one of

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.990 
from the list to each and every one of
the<00:02:11.400> faces

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
the faces

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.480 
the faces
so<00:02:14.000> that's<00:02:14.240> one<00:02:14.450> thing<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.780> can<00:02:14.990> do<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.490> each

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
so that's one thing it can do and each

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.570 
so that's one thing it can do and each
time<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:16.970> change<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.900> seed<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.980> will<00:02:19.280> change

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
time you change the seed it will change

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.140 
time you change the seed it will change
the<00:02:19.790> way<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:21.160> randomizes<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.370> materials<00:02:22.910> on

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
the way the randomizes the materials on

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.670 
the way the randomizes the materials on
the<00:02:23.300> object<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:23.990> can<00:02:24.140> play<00:02:24.320> with<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.530> until

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
the object so you can play with it until

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.930 
the object so you can play with it until
you<00:02:24.920> find<00:02:25.160> something<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.640> like<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:28.520> that's

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
you find something you like so that's

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.660 
you find something you like so that's
one<00:02:29.210> thing<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.780> another<00:02:30.500> thing<00:02:31.250> we<00:02:31.430> have<00:02:31.640> here

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
one thing and another thing we have here

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.300 
one thing and another thing we have here
is<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:32.510> prefix<00:02:33.350> or<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:34.060> filter<00:02:35.060> actually<00:02:35.690> and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
is this prefix or a filter actually and

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.180 
is this prefix or a filter actually and
this<00:02:37.310> enables<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:37.970> just<00:02:38.360> filter<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.500> few<00:02:39.950> of

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
this enables you to just filter a few of

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.160 
this enables you to just filter a few of
the<00:02:40.310> materials<00:02:40.760> on<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.210> list<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.690> not<00:02:41.990> use

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
the materials on the list and not use

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.660 
the materials on the list and not use
all<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:42.530> them<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:42.920> if<00:02:43.130> I'm<00:02:43.250> going<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.460> press

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
all of them so if I'm going to press

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.220 
all of them so if I'm going to press
Matt<00:02:44.090> here<00:02:46.540> you're<00:02:47.540> going<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.720> see<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:47.960> it

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
Matt here you're going to see that it

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.130 
Matt here you're going to see that it
actually<00:02:48.260> uses<00:02:49.070> now<00:02:49.370> just<00:02:49.760> all<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.690> materials

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
actually uses now just all the materials

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.560 
actually uses now just all the materials
that<00:02:51.200> have<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.740> word<00:02:51.770> Matt<00:02:52.610> somewhere<00:02:53.360> in

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
that have the word Matt somewhere in

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.470 
that have the word Matt somewhere in
there<00:02:53.960> and<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:55.520> other<00:02:55.640> materials<00:02:56.180> are<00:02:56.300> not

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
there and the other materials are not

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.460 
there and the other materials are not
used<00:02:56.870> at<00:02:57.140> all<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.640> now<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:59.510> only<00:02:59.660> uses<00:03:00.170> these

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
used at all so now it only uses these

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.690 
used at all so now it only uses these
three<00:03:00.890> first<00:03:01.400> materials<00:03:02.270> here<00:03:03.400> if<00:03:04.400> I'm<00:03:04.580> going

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
three first materials here if I'm going

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.790 
three first materials here if I'm going
to<00:03:04.790> remove<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.090> filter<00:03:06.050> it's<00:03:06.470> going<00:03:06.740> to

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
to remove the filter it's going to

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.910 
to remove the filter it's going to
return<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.700> using<00:03:08.150> all<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:09.110> materials<00:03:09.830> from

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
return to using all the materials from

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.850 
return to using all the materials from
the<00:03:10.070> list<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:11.540> this<00:03:11.810> is<00:03:11.990> one<00:03:12.200> thing<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:12.470> can<00:03:12.740> do

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
the list so this is one thing you can do

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.750 
the list so this is one thing you can do
with<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.210> which<00:03:14.210> is<00:03:14.390> nice<00:03:15.160> but<00:03:16.160> actually<00:03:16.370> it's

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
with it which is nice but actually it's

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.700 
with it which is nice but actually it's
not<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.090> purpose<00:03:17.570> for<00:03:17.600> which<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:18.110> wrote<00:03:18.470> the

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
not the purpose for which I wrote the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.740 
not the purpose for which I wrote the
script<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.310> actually<00:03:19.700> wanted<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.120> use<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.360> for

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
script I actually wanted to use it for

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.550 
script I actually wanted to use it for
something<00:03:21.740> else<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.370> we<00:03:23.090> can<00:03:23.240> see<00:03:23.480> this<00:03:23.720> in

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
something else and we can see this in

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.530 
something else and we can see this in
this<00:03:24.770> little<00:03:25.040> example<00:03:25.430> here<00:03:25.460> first<00:03:26.270> I'm<00:03:26.420> going

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
this little example here first I'm going

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.540 
this little example here first I'm going
to<00:03:26.600> switch<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.380> cycles<00:03:27.770> rendering<00:03:28.160> engine

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
to switch to the cycles rendering engine

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.860 
to switch to the cycles rendering engine
and<00:03:30.070> this<00:03:31.070> object<00:03:31.640> what<00:03:32.210> we<00:03:32.330> have<00:03:32.540> if<00:03:32.750> I'm

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
and this object what we have if I'm

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.860 
and this object what we have if I'm
going<00:03:33.020> to<00:03:33.110> switch<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.680> rendered<00:03:34.220> view<00:03:34.750> what<00:03:35.750> we

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
going to switch to rendered view what we

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.750 
going to switch to rendered view what we
have<00:03:36.110> here<00:03:36.440> is<00:03:36.790> an<00:03:37.790> array<00:03:38.150> of<00:03:38.320> faces<00:03:39.320> that<00:03:39.350> have

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
have here is an array of faces that have

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.590 
have here is an array of faces that have
leaf<00:03:40.760> materials<00:03:41.420> assigned<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:42.050> them<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.620> you

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
leaf materials assigned to them and you

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.950 
leaf materials assigned to them and you
have<00:03:44.650> several<00:03:45.650> variations<00:03:46.040> of<00:03:46.490> these<00:03:47.030> leaves

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
have several variations of these leaves

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.350 
have several variations of these leaves
which<00:03:50.350> we<00:03:51.350> can<00:03:51.530> see<00:03:51.800> if<00:03:52.670> I'm<00:03:52.880> going<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.090> split

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
which we can see if I'm going to split

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.060 
which we can see if I'm going to split
my<00:03:53.420> window<00:03:53.900> actually<00:03:54.620> I'm<00:03:54.680> going<00:03:54.860> to<00:03:54.920> do<00:03:54.980> it

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
my window actually I'm going to do it

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.820 
my window actually I'm going to do it
again<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.490> I'll<00:03:56.030> show<00:03:56.240> you<00:03:56.270> the<00:03:56.420> node<00:03:56.600> editor

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
again and I'll show you the node editor

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.560 
again and I'll show you the node editor
you<00:03:57.830> can<00:03:57.860> see<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.310> each<00:03:58.790> material<00:03:59.120> has<00:03:59.390> a

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
you can see that each material has a

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.860 
you can see that each material has a
slight<00:04:00.410> variation<00:04:01.040> on<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:02.390> diffuse<00:04:02.840> color

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
slight variation on the diffuse color

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.290 
slight variation on the diffuse color
diffuse<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:04.420> material<00:04:06.070> so<00:04:07.070> the<00:04:07.700> diffuse

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
diffuse a material so the diffuse

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.660 
diffuse a material so the diffuse
texture<00:04:08.720> goes<00:04:09.110> through<00:04:09.440> some<00:04:09.740> processes<00:04:10.460> here

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
texture goes through some processes here

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.180 
texture goes through some processes here
it's<00:04:10.790> gonna<00:04:10.940> be<00:04:11.720> multiplied<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.650> get<00:04:12.920> a<00:04:12.950> little

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
it's gonna be multiplied to get a little

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.030 
it's gonna be multiplied to get a little
bit<00:04:13.400> darker<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.150> here<00:04:14.930> it<00:04:15.080> gets<00:04:15.680> a<00:04:15.920> little

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
bit darker and here it gets a little

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.349 
bit darker and here it gets a little
brighter<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:17.450> one<00:04:18.040> again<00:04:19.210> makes<00:04:20.210> a

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
brighter and this one again makes a

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.250 
brighter and this one again makes a
little<00:04:20.600> bit<00:04:20.690> darker<00:04:21.049> but<00:04:21.230> less<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:23.260> you

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
little bit darker but less so and you

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.060 
little bit darker but less so and you
have<00:04:24.440> a

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
have a

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.710 
have a
variations<00:04:25.700> this<00:04:25.940> changes<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.360> color<00:04:26.630> a

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
variations this changes the color a

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.500 
variations this changes the color a
little<00:04:26.900> bit<00:04:27.140> and<00:04:27.640> as<00:04:28.640> well<00:04:28.940> takes<00:04:29.300> a<00:04:29.420> little

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
little bit and as well takes a little

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.760 
little bit and as well takes a little
bit<00:04:29.690> more<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:29.960> yellow<00:04:30.440> or<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.310> red<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:32.770> so

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
bit more to yellow or to the red and so

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.420 
bit more to yellow or to the red and so
without<00:04:35.800> getting<00:04:36.800> into<00:04:36.950> this<00:04:37.160> too<00:04:38.890> deeply<00:04:39.890> we

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
without getting into this too deeply we

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.280 
without getting into this too deeply we
can<00:04:40.580> see<00:04:40.820> that<00:04:40.970> each<00:04:41.120> material<00:04:41.360> has<00:04:41.690> a<00:04:41.960> little

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
can see that each material has a little

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.080 
can see that each material has a little
bit<00:04:42.410> of<00:04:42.440> variation<00:04:42.890> and<00:04:43.310> what<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.490> want<00:04:43.760> to<00:04:43.910> do

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
bit of variation and what I want to do

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
bit of variation and what I want to do
is<00:04:45.340> I<00:04:46.340> actually<00:04:46.580> wanted<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.120> just<00:04:50.080> you<00:04:51.080> know

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
is I actually wanted to just you know

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.990 
is I actually wanted to just you know
assign<00:04:51.590> one<00:04:51.830> of<00:04:51.950> these<00:04:52.070> randomly<00:04:52.640> to<00:04:52.910> each

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
assign one of these randomly to each

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.310 
assign one of these randomly to each
other<00:04:53.180> faces<00:04:53.390> and<00:04:53.660> this<00:04:53.750> is<00:04:53.870> something<00:04:54.050> that

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
other faces and this is something that

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.710 
other faces and this is something that
the<00:04:54.770> add-on<00:04:55.040> does<00:04:55.310> so<00:04:56.150> if<00:04:56.270> I'm<00:04:56.390> going<00:04:56.570> to

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
the add-on does so if I'm going to

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.900 
the add-on does so if I'm going to
change<00:04:57.500> your<00:04:57.650> in<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.890> randomization<00:04:58.700> seed

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
change your in the randomization seed

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.540 
change your in the randomization seed
you<00:04:59.030> can<00:04:59.090> see<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.510> it<00:04:59.630> actually<00:04:59.660> uses<00:05:00.550> all

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
you can see that it actually uses all

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.510 
you can see that it actually uses all
the<00:05:01.730> materials<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.480> all<00:05:02.720> of<00:05:02.840> these<00:05:02.990> faces<00:05:03.520> so

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
the materials to all of these faces so

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.710 
the materials to all of these faces so
this<00:05:04.700> is<00:05:04.850> something<00:05:05.030> that's<00:05:05.300> very<00:05:05.420> useful

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
this is something that's very useful

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.020 
this is something that's very useful
when<00:05:06.230> you're<00:05:06.470> using<00:05:09.400> objects<00:05:10.400> it's<00:05:10.550> create

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
when you're using objects it's create

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.160 
when you're using objects it's create
been<00:05:11.330> created<00:05:11.720> by<00:05:11.870> add-ons<00:05:12.410> like<00:05:13.660> the<00:05:14.660> sapling

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
been created by add-ons like the sapling

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.270 
been created by add-ons like the sapling
tree<00:05:15.200> add-on<00:05:15.890> or<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:17.030> IV<00:05:17.990> generator<00:05:18.410> and<00:05:18.740> they

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
tree add-on or the IV generator and they

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.650 
tree add-on or the IV generator and they
both<00:05:19.550> create<00:05:20.030> these<00:05:20.270> leaves<00:05:20.770> that<00:05:21.770> are<00:05:22.660> just

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
both create these leaves that are just

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.100 
both create these leaves that are just
plain<00:05:24.080> meshes<00:05:24.560> with<00:05:24.800> faces<00:05:25.460> distributed<00:05:26.450> so

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
plain meshes with faces distributed so

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.970 
plain meshes with faces distributed so
you<00:05:27.170> can<00:05:27.590> use<00:05:27.770> these<00:05:28.010> to<00:05:28.870> randomize<00:05:29.980> the

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
you can use these to randomize the

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.730 
you can use these to randomize the
materials<00:05:31.490> and<00:05:32.170> actually<00:05:33.170> have<00:05:33.350> much<00:05:33.560> more

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
materials and actually have much more

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.860 
materials and actually have much more
variation<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:34.580> if<00:05:34.730> we<00:05:34.910> look<00:05:35.060> at<00:05:35.210> an<00:05:35.690> image

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
variation and if we look at an image

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.230 
variation and if we look at an image
where<00:05:36.830> I<00:05:36.860> actually<00:05:37.520> rendered<00:05:38.200> both<00:05:40.240> versions

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
where I actually rendered both versions

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.170 
where I actually rendered both versions
one<00:05:41.780> with<00:05:42.530> just<00:05:42.830> one<00:05:43.070> material<00:05:43.400> on<00:05:43.760> it<00:05:43.790> and<00:05:44.090> the

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
one with just one material on it and the

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.220 
one with just one material on it and the
other<00:05:44.300> would<00:05:44.680> random<00:05:45.730> materials<00:05:46.810> /<00:05:47.810> face<00:05:48.080> you

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
other would random materials / face you

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.340 
other would random materials / face you
can<00:05:48.380> see<00:05:48.590> that<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:49.420> randomized<00:05:50.420> version<00:05:51.230> is

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
can see that the randomized version is

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.880 
can see that the randomized version is
much<00:05:51.500> more<00:05:51.710> realistic<00:05:51.860> and<00:05:52.370> much<00:05:52.490> more<00:05:52.730> varied

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
much more realistic and much more varied

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.640 
much more realistic and much more varied
so<00:05:54.890> this<00:05:55.820> is<00:05:55.970> actually<00:05:56.120> why<00:05:56.510> you<00:05:56.570> can<00:05:56.810> do<00:05:57.020> with

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
so this is actually why you can do with

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.080 
so this is actually why you can do with
this<00:05:57.770> little<00:05:58.040> add-on<00:05:58.250> and<00:05:58.580> I<00:05:58.610> hope<00:05:58.790> it's<00:05:58.970> gonna

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
this little add-on and I hope it's gonna

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.380 
this little add-on and I hope it's gonna
be<00:05:59.480> useful<00:05:59.780> for<00:05:59.810> you<00:06:00.020> can<00:06:00.970> use<00:06:01.970> it<00:06:02.120> for<00:06:02.210> just

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
be useful for you can use it for just

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.930 
be useful for you can use it for just
anything<00:06:02.870> you'd<00:06:03.110> like<00:06:03.140> and<00:06:03.670> feel<00:06:04.670> free<00:06:04.700> to
