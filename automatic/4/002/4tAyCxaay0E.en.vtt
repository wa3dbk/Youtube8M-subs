00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
shots except for at the end I kind of

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.830 
shots except for at the end I kind of
failed<00:03:02.430> really<00:03:02.790> badly<00:03:03.000> but<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.510> guys<00:03:03.629> will

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
see that that was I was kind of

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.570 
see that that was I was kind of
surprised<00:03:07.409> I<00:03:07.590> didn't<00:03:07.800> get<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:07.950> quick<00:03:08.310> scope

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
surprised I didn't get that quick scope

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.690 
surprised I didn't get that quick scope
there<00:03:08.819> I<00:03:09.540> can't<00:03:10.019> really<00:03:10.230> tell<00:03:10.650> from<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.610> video

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
there I can't really tell from the video

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.880 
there I can't really tell from the video
quality<00:03:12.000> right<00:03:12.420> now<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:12.750> kind<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.110> skippy

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
quality right now it's kind of a skippy

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.300 
quality right now it's kind of a skippy
but<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:15.290> think<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.409> may<00:03:16.650> have<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:16.860> shot<00:03:17.250> a

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
but I think I may have just shot a

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.729 
but I think I may have just shot a
little<00:03:17.489> too<00:03:17.760> soon<00:03:18.030> at<00:03:18.239> Anna<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.290> didn't<00:03:19.620> get

little too soon at Anna I didn't get

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.910 
little too soon at Anna I didn't get
into<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.190> skull<00:03:20.519> before<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.970> shot<00:03:21.319> but<00:03:22.319> no<00:03:22.709> big

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
into the skull before I shot but no big

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.649 
into the skull before I shot but no big
deal<00:03:23.190> got<00:03:23.640> another<00:03:23.849> round<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.420> play<00:03:26.659> don't

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
deal got another round to play don't

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.570 
deal got another round to play don't
even<00:03:27.840> know<00:03:27.930> what<00:03:28.019> my<00:03:28.049> score<00:03:28.349> is<00:03:28.379> now<00:03:28.709> but<00:03:29.430> at

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
even know what my score is now but at

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.130 
even know what my score is now but at
the<00:03:29.700> end<00:03:29.730> it's<00:03:30.000> pretty<00:03:30.180> good<00:03:30.330> so<00:03:30.659> that's<00:03:30.959> all

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140
