this<00:00:32.989> library<00:00:33.470> let<00:00:34.129> me<00:00:34.280> point<00:00:34.519> out<00:00:34.760> that<00:00:35.239> i

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
this library let me point out that i

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.930 
this library let me point out that i
have<00:00:35.600> set<00:00:35.900> up<00:00:36.050> spaces<00:00:36.470> to<00:00:37.010> add<00:00:37.190> a<00:00:37.460> little<00:00:37.699> bit

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
have set up spaces to add a little bit

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.840 
have set up spaces to add a little bit
more<00:00:38.210> room<00:00:38.449> to<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.870> sound<00:00:39.140> but<00:00:40.070> besides<00:00:40.430> that

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
more room to the sound but besides that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.400 
more room to the sound but besides that

magic<00:00:51.260> slider<00:00:51.530> in<00:00:51.769> a<00:00:51.830> minute<00:00:52.159> but<00:00:52.460> I<00:00:52.489> turn<00:00:52.909> it

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
magic slider in a minute but I turn it

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.079 
magic slider in a minute but I turn it
down<00:00:53.180> from<00:00:53.479> now<00:00:54.100> notice<00:00:55.100> this<00:00:55.400> little<00:00:55.729> yellow

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
down from now notice this little yellow

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.689 
down from now notice this little yellow
LED<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:57.140> switches<00:00:57.680> between<00:00:57.860> two<00:00:58.430> different

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
LED the switches between two different

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.299 
LED the switches between two different
sets<00:00:59.180> of<00:00:59.360> samples<00:00:59.869> let<00:01:00.589> me<00:01:00.710> show<00:01:00.949> you<00:01:00.979> the

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
sets of samples let me show you the

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:21.710 
sets of samples let me show you the
modern<00:01:01.610> said<00:01:01.909> first

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.960 

the<00:01:22.720> modern<00:01:23.050> set<00:01:23.410> is<00:01:23.650> tuned<00:01:24.010> to<00:01:24.040> perfect<00:01:24.700> pitch

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
the modern set is tuned to perfect pitch

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.390 
the modern set is tuned to perfect pitch
but<00:01:25.660> if<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:25.960> prefer<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.470> sound<00:01:26.860> with<00:01:27.130> more

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
but if you prefer a sound with more

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.360 
but if you prefer a sound with more
character<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:28.120> it<00:01:28.150> simply<00:01:29.140> turn<00:01:29.410> this<00:01:29.650> led<00:01:30.160> off

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
character to it simply turn this led off

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.760 
character to it simply turn this led off
and<00:01:30.760> you<00:01:31.210> will<00:01:31.360> notice<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.230> sound<00:01:32.530> is<00:01:32.710> a

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
and you will notice that the sound is a

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.070 
and you will notice that the sound is a
little<00:01:33.190> bit<00:01:33.340> out<00:01:33.550> of<00:01:33.580> tune<00:01:33.970> let<00:01:34.720> me<00:01:34.840> show<00:01:35.050> you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
little bit out of tune let me show you

00:01:35.080 --> 00:02:15.270 
little bit out of tune let me show you
this

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.630 

ok<00:02:16.280> cool<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:17.540> next<00:02:17.750> we<00:02:18.110> have<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.650> sticks<00:02:19.280> patch

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
ok cool so next we have the sticks patch

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.210 
ok cool so next we have the sticks patch
and<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.540> time<00:02:20.810> we<00:02:21.140> hit<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.530> strings<00:02:21.890> on<00:02:22.190> the

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
and this time we hit the strings on the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.050 
and this time we hit the strings on the
guitar<00:02:22.360> with<00:02:23.360> wooden<00:02:23.660> drumsticks<00:02:24.490> so<00:02:25.490> let<00:02:25.910> me

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
guitar with wooden drumsticks so let me

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.960 
guitar with wooden drumsticks so let me
get<00:02:26.270> rid<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.900> magic<00:02:27.350> again<00:02:27.710> and<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:28.910> time

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
get rid of the magic again and this time

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.990 
get rid of the magic again and this time
I<00:02:29.390> will<00:02:29.480> use<00:02:29.960> the<00:02:30.440> character<00:02:31.130> set<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.520> samples

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
I will use the character set of samples

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.690 
I will use the character set of samples
a<00:02:32.350> little<00:02:33.350> adjustment<00:02:33.800> on<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.190> low-pass

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
a little adjustment on the low-pass

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.860 
a little adjustment on the low-pass
filter<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:37.130> think<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:37.970> are<00:02:38.120> good<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.450> go<00:02:38.480> so

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
filter and I think we are good to go so

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:59.810 
filter and I think we are good to go so
this<00:02:39.080> is<00:02:39.230> what<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.710> sounds<00:02:39.890> like

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.060 

so<00:03:00.820> let<00:03:01.030> me<00:03:01.060> show<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.510> this<00:03:01.960> banding<00:03:02.470> sound<00:03:02.770> on

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
so let me show you this banding sound on

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:24.690 
so let me show you this banding sound on
top<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.670> velocity<00:03:03.910> range<00:03:04.420> really<00:03:04.840> quick

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.550 

the<00:03:25.700> cool<00:03:25.940> thing<00:03:25.970> is<00:03:26.269> that<00:03:26.810> we<00:03:26.989> use<00:03:27.230> two

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
the cool thing is that we use two

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.800 
the cool thing is that we use two
strings<00:03:27.950> tuned<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.549> same<00:03:28.819> pitch<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.480> this

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
strings tuned to same pitch and this

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.410 
strings tuned to same pitch and this
produce<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.620> speed<00:03:30.860> frequency<00:03:31.459> and<00:03:31.670> allowed

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
produce the speed frequency and allowed

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.110 
produce the speed frequency and allowed
us<00:03:32.629> to<00:03:32.659> band<00:03:33.079> just<00:03:33.470> one<00:03:33.650> of<00:03:33.799> them<00:03:34.010> so<00:03:34.849> let<00:03:35.000> me

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
us to band just one of them so let me

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.270 
us to band just one of them so let me
show<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.420> another<00:03:35.720> example<00:03:36.079> using<00:03:37.010> lower

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
show you another example using lower

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:51.120 
show you another example using lower
velocity<00:03:37.970> values

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.510 

okay<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.360> get<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.840> idea<00:03:53.040> let's<00:03:54.040> move<00:03:54.250> on

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
okay so you get the idea let's move on

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.390 
okay so you get the idea let's move on
to<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.150> next<00:03:55.180> patch<00:03:55.720> which<00:03:56.320> is<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.710> brushes

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
to the next patch which is the brushes

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.150 
to the next patch which is the brushes
mellow<00:03:57.670> patch<00:03:58.030> and<00:03:58.710> this<00:03:59.710> is<00:03:59.860> a<00:03:59.890> good

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
mellow patch and this is a good

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.020 
mellow patch and this is a good
opportunity<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:01.210> explain<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.930> magic<00:04:02.320> slider

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
opportunity to explain the magic slider

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.990 
opportunity to explain the magic slider
basically<00:04:04.030> what<00:04:04.600> it<00:04:04.630> does<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:06.100> controls<00:04:06.670> the

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
basically what it does it controls the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.360 
basically what it does it controls the
volume<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.720> another<00:04:08.170> additional<00:04:08.770> sound<00:04:09.100> layer

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
volume of another additional sound layer

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.970 
volume of another additional sound layer
which<00:04:10.210> enhances<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.110> overtones<00:04:11.650> and

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
which enhances the overtones and

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.910 
which enhances the overtones and
brightens<00:04:12.520> up<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.730> whole<00:04:13.030> sound<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:14.500> let<00:04:14.800> me

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
brightens up the whole sound so let me
