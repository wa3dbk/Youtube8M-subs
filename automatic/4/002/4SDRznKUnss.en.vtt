00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
the you know extensions begin and that's

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.130 
the you know extensions begin and that's
going<00:00:46.940> to<00:00:47.000> give<00:00:47.150> me<00:00:47.180> some<00:00:47.510> very<00:00:47.660> natural

layering<00:00:48.590> effect<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.580> the<00:00:49.940> best<00:00:50.060> way<00:00:50.270> to<00:00:50.300> have

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
layering effect so the best way to have

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.330 
layering effect so the best way to have
a<00:00:50.510> messy<00:00:50.900> side<00:00:51.080> braid<00:00:51.140> is<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.560> have<00:00:51.680> layers<00:00:52.010> in

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
a messy side braid is to have layers in

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.500 
a messy side braid is to have layers in
your<00:00:52.370> hair<00:00:52.490> because<00:00:52.880> then<00:00:53.030> you<00:00:53.120> have<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.390> end

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510
