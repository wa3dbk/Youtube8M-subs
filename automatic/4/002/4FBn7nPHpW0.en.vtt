hello and welcome to this week's edition
of<00:00:04.049> Spain<00:00:04.529> online<00:00:05.250> movie<00:00:05.670> reviews<00:00:06.089> which<00:00:06.810> film

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
of Spain online movie reviews which film

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.560 
of Spain online movie reviews which film
should<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.859> talk<00:00:07.950> about<00:00:08.010> first<00:00:08.300> well<00:00:09.300> we<00:00:09.420> have

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
should we talk about first well we have

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.419 
should we talk about first well we have
in<00:00:09.750> between<00:00:09.900> errs<00:00:10.290> too<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.830> planes<00:00:11.070> Fire<00:00:11.400> and

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
in between errs too and planes Fire and

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.220 
in between errs too and planes Fire and
Rescue<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.389> guess<00:00:12.719> we'll<00:00:12.900> start<00:00:13.049> with

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
Rescue so I guess we'll start with

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.509 
Rescue so I guess we'll start with
planes<00:00:13.410> Fire<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.740> Rescue<00:00:13.889> because<00:00:14.309> that's

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
planes Fire and Rescue because that's

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.689 
planes Fire and Rescue because that's
the<00:00:14.700> less<00:00:14.880> controversial<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> two<00:00:16.230> okay

the less controversial of the two okay

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
this is the follow on from planes which

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.170 
this is the follow on from planes which
was<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> spinoff<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.490> cars

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
was a spinoff of cars

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
just kind of not really referred to but

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.590 
just kind of not really referred to but
long<00:00:32.130> story<00:00:32.160> short<00:00:32.460> he<00:00:32.790> has<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.059> go<00:00:33.180> off<00:00:33.329> and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
trained by ed Harris who plays a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.740 
trained by ed Harris who plays a
helicopter<00:00:38.040> mm-hmm<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.390> sounds<00:00:39.510> like

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
helicopter mm-hmm this just sounds like

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.450 
helicopter mm-hmm this just sounds like
a<00:00:39.840> dream<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.200> had<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.649> ahead<00:00:40.950> Harris<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
a dream I had but so ahead Harris was a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.670 
a dream I had but so ahead Harris was a
helicopter<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.239> Dane<00:00:42.450> Cook<00:00:42.719> was<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> plane<00:00:43.170> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
helicopter and Dane Cook was a plane and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.670 
helicopter and Dane Cook was a plane and
then<00:00:43.920> he<00:00:43.980> had<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> become<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.370> firefighter<00:00:44.670> and

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
then he had to become a firefighter and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.990 
then he had to become a firefighter and
yeah<00:00:46.680> look<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.100> very<00:00:47.250> much<00:00:47.489> following<00:00:47.700> on

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
yeah look it's very much following on

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.160 
yeah look it's very much following on
from<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.300> same<00:00:48.480> kind<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.750> formula<00:00:49.140> that

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
from the same kind of formula that

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.410 
from the same kind of formula that
planes<00:00:49.559> add<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:51.390> know

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
planes add in that it's you know

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.630 
planes add in that it's you know
relatively<00:00:52.079> short<00:00:52.440> relatively<00:00:53.219> simple<00:00:53.550> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
relatively short relatively simple to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.920 
relatively short relatively simple to
follow<00:00:53.789> there's<00:00:54.270> not<00:00:54.420> really<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.690> whole<00:00:54.870> lot

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
follow there's not really a whole lot

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.080 
follow there's not really a whole lot
going<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.649> terms<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.070> story<00:00:56.430> order<00:00:56.910> than

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
going on in terms of story order than

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.660 
going on in terms of story order than
just<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:58.020> know<00:00:58.050> they're<00:00:58.949> doing<00:00:59.190> here<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.550> now

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670

be honest I was watching it and it's
kind<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.610> hard<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.850> feel<00:01:06.659> bad<00:01:07.200> about<00:01:07.229> over<00:01:07.740> you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and I think any accompanying parents

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.899 
and I think any accompanying parents
will<00:01:18.450> be<00:01:18.630> bored<00:01:19.350> because<00:01:19.979> isn't<00:01:20.490> there's<00:01:20.759> not

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:21.320 
will be bored because isn't there's not
a<00:01:20.939> lot<00:01:21.150> of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
a lot of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.870 
a lot of
even<00:01:21.960> slow<00:01:22.259> humor<00:01:22.740> aimed<00:01:22.920> at<00:01:23.159> anyone<00:01:23.430> above

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
even slow humor aimed at anyone above

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.990 
even slow humor aimed at anyone above
the<00:01:24.030> age<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.450> five<00:01:24.659> or<00:01:24.840> six<00:01:25.460> I<00:01:26.460> thought

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the age of like five or six I thought

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.130 
the age of like five or six I thought
some<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> visuals<00:01:27.630> actually<00:01:27.930> pretty

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
some of the visuals actually pretty

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
some of the visuals actually pretty
great<00:01:28.290> especially<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.189> bigger<00:01:29.369> fire<00:01:29.640> stuff

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
great especially the bigger fire stuff

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.520 
great especially the bigger fire stuff
that<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> fight<00:01:30.659> later<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.290> I

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that you have to fight later on I

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.810 
that you have to fight later on I
thought<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.950> was<00:01:32.040> actually<00:01:32.310> pretty<00:01:32.490> good<00:01:32.549> in

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
thought that was actually pretty good in

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.550 
thought that was actually pretty good in
some<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> sequences<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:33.930> there<00:01:34.200> kind<00:01:34.500> of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
some of the sequences in there kind of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.520
