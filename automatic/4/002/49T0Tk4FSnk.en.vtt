00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.860
 he ran optimally we defend ourselves 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.330
 wanted us from today as planned 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.040
 At the beginning of an adversary they make pressure 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.900
 can not make the construction and 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.510
 they forward them pressure have errors 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.279
 made and run optimally 40 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.119
 at half-time I have never been 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.480
 experienced take her hat 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.060
 yes super player is of course amazing 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.550
 bochum beats at home 50 stops 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.230
 nobody expected that before, but the one 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.820
 Coach very well adjusted to that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.070
 play on the opponent and I think we 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.540
 have implemented it very well and put 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.040
 even over weeks was surprised by 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.920
 our pressing that we really are very 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.290
 have played well and at the end of the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.610
 day is deserved 15 music i am 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.800
 overjoyed that today we are also in the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.030
 height in the week could be in the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.170
 not anticipated also because the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.550
 bochumer of a very strong 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.710
 outbound series traveled to here 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.809
 we knew that today either her 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.449
 or our series breaks and of course 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.030
 very happy that our home year 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.470
 has held and her series is torn 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.490
 in advance, for example, has the most cordial 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.510
 Congratulations to you and then mine 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.470
 troop then club 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.799
 It was an important experience here 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.350
 for the first time in Heidenheim mood in 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.000
 stadion excelling your performance well 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.009
 I have to comment on that 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.600
 unfortunately so accept 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.770
 in many many situations a number 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.200
 too big for us today 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.539
 it was seen for us on our to 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.470
 a totally used day all that 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.370
 we 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.170
 did not work out at the beginning 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.870
 things against which we wanted to defend ourselves 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.910
 which we also see coming from 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.650
 we had no chance in the 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.040
 fight themselves who were necessary 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.630
 after assignment was from our trip 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.610
 unfortunately not the passion to see 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.020
 I partially seen at Heidenheim 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.540
 and then have to get the day is in 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.900
 Today as well as what results 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.360
 opponent of everything in the counter 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.430
 opponent used on used day 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.880
 has a deserved defeat also in 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.680
 this height for us from the defeat 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.240
 we take it then I am convinced of 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.470
 been convinced that is not 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.040
 somehow think such a clichÃ© 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.450
 we take a whole lot with in the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.950
 refurbishment of the error was the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.000
 Team creative these mistakes we 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.750
 We have done today 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.180
 not done yet 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.209
 but we have so far but always 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.380
 managed to go there old mistakes 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.980
 to work up that for not 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.340
 to repeat 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.080
 to new, I believe that this 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.600
 Team today quite huge 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.640
 huge in the report says on the face 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.010
 But now is the possibility 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.989
 has to get up again and that 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.670
 we get up again, I 'm convinced 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.019
 Of course big compliment to mine 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.930
 Team today it was a great game 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.280
 What she showed in advance has us 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.989
 also busy drilling has already 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.489
 on thursday has played on friday 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.019
 probably regeneration training 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.910
 had already made on Saturday with the 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.560
 bus will get a day longer 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.840
 time and that's why we have too 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.280
 decided today a high 30 too 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.350
 playing opponents early under pressure too 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.870
 of course, also with the risk 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.310
 that one misses oneself that is then 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.230
 Of course sometimes it can get tight 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.850
 the very first situation in the game who 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.830
 remembered we saw one 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.600
 run in counter where luckily nothing 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.519
 happened but I think that was half 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.620
 really really risk something 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.830
 the team has scary earlier 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.799
 we have compactly attacked the two 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.950
 earlier up and in the switching game 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.850
 we also used our chances 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.900
 Standards situations are as important as that 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.820
 to the 1 0 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.200
 Of course, they help believe then 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.709
 The strategy will become even bigger 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.470
 to let 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.599
 one must not forget first of all 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.920
 peter as a person as a trainer anyway 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.060
 but also before that a big one 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.650
 team 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.840
 we are still in need of a newcomer 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.430
 we have to get used to everything 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.099
 we have to develop and have to do everything first 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.349
 deserve and that's why it's already 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.190
 madness what happened today to 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.250
 half time 40 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.390
 great football i think it was 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.370
 of course one of our best games 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.610
 or at all in the voith arena what 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.630
 our fans have seen us too 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.650
 It was important at half past time 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.140
 to address 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.819
 the first game does not win somehow 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.560
 There have been prominent examples of where 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.630
 even a 4 0 still in danger and 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.549
 I said the team if they did 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.829
 the power has if you like it too 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.120
 has to continue playing like that now 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.940
 do not start managing but 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.169
 keep on investing so on 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.550
 to do the same as we do 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.320
 made at the beginning 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.850
 It was a little bit of a rush in the 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.290
 second half where the opponent again 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.810
 has become stronger where you have seen 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.520
 that's what the enemy is capable of 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.800
 But underlined we have us 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.240
 have played a rush in front of everyone 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.470
 but also very well defended and 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.630
 it was the key to me today 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.950
 has success meant she says peter take 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.600
 very much out of the game 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.330
 then it is important that we do a lot 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.979
 learn from the game namely a 50 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.410
 that one can also make big mistakes 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.030
 make some things then 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.680
 does not change the well of the 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.140
 team and there we are now 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.370
 of course, take care of that once 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.260
 to give the team two days now 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.510
 but then five 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.070
 We have concentrated training days 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.660
 play only one during the week tomorrow 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.570
 in the week to prepare then 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.210
 on leipzig because we have to go back 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.639
 100 percent can be there otherwise that can us 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.139
 Sometimes we just happen 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.490
 do not get into the game as we do 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.380
 then make it yourself peter 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.750
 Of course, for the course of the 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.539
 another round everything good we look 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.770
 on bochum and know what you are 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.770
 today what is waiting for us
