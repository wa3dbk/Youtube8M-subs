00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.670 

so<00:00:06.250> question<00:00:06.640> number<00:00:06.669> 48<00:00:07.210> the<00:00:07.899> movement<00:00:08.440> of

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:08.680 
so question number 48 the movement of

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.100 
so question number 48 the movement of
gene<00:00:09.010> from<00:00:09.400> one<00:00:09.460> linkage<00:00:10.299> group<00:00:10.629> to<00:00:10.870> another

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
gene from one linkage group to another

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.490 
gene from one linkage group to another
is<00:00:11.410> called<00:00:12.030> now<00:00:13.030> let's<00:00:13.240> see<00:00:13.480> first<00:00:13.959> what<00:00:14.350> is

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
is called now let's see first what is

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.700 
is called now let's see first what is
linkage<00:00:15.010> group<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.900> let's<00:00:17.080> say<00:00:17.260> this<00:00:17.500> is<00:00:17.560> a

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
linkage group so let's say this is a

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.300 
linkage group so let's say this is a
chromosome<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:19.600> the<00:00:20.080> chromosome<00:00:20.619> there<00:00:21.189> is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
chromosome on the chromosome there is

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.829 
chromosome on the chromosome there is
presence<00:00:21.849> of<00:00:22.119> genes<00:00:22.810> in<00:00:23.259> our<00:00:23.560> linear<00:00:24.249> manner

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:24.839 
presence of genes in our linear manner

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.429 
presence of genes in our linear manner
all<00:00:25.839> the<00:00:26.409> genes<00:00:26.650> present<00:00:27.369> on<00:00:27.579> a<00:00:27.609> chromosome

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
all the genes present on a chromosome

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.609 
all the genes present on a chromosome
represents<00:00:29.439> linked<00:00:30.130> genes<00:00:30.249> and<00:00:31.259> this<00:00:32.259> will

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
represents linked genes and this will

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.710 
represents linked genes and this will
represent<00:00:33.100> one<00:00:33.940> linkage<00:00:34.720> group<00:00:36.060> now<00:00:37.060> in<00:00:37.420> the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
represent one linkage group now in the

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.260 
represent one linkage group now in the
organism<00:00:38.470> the<00:00:38.770> number<00:00:39.190> of<00:00:39.370> linkage<00:00:39.880> groups

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
organism the number of linkage groups

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.750 
organism the number of linkage groups
that<00:00:40.540> is<00:00:40.750> equaling<00:00:41.410> to<00:00:41.770> number<00:00:42.550> of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
that is equaling to number of

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.150 
that is equaling to number of
chromosomes<00:00:43.750> in<00:00:44.140> haploid<00:00:45.070> condition<00:00:47.160> now

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
chromosomes in haploid condition now

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.860 
chromosomes in haploid condition now
this<00:00:48.730> is<00:00:49.050> one<00:00:50.050> linkage<00:00:50.590> group<00:00:50.890> right<00:00:51.760> so<00:00:52.660> let's

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
this is one linkage group right so let's

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.910 
this is one linkage group right so let's
see<00:00:53.110> this<00:00:53.470> is<00:00:53.710> a<00:00:53.790> different<00:00:54.790> chromosome

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
see this is a different chromosome

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.130 
see this is a different chromosome
there's<00:00:56.920> different<00:00:57.370> chromosome<00:00:57.910> and<00:00:58.270> these

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
there's different chromosome and these

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.670 
there's different chromosome and these
are<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.500> genes<00:00:59.920> which<00:01:00.400> are<00:01:00.580> present<00:01:01.150> on<00:01:01.390> it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.399 

right<00:01:05.680> so<00:01:06.369> these<00:01:06.549> are<00:01:06.610> different<00:01:07.409> chromosomes

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
right so these are different chromosomes

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.240 
right so these are different chromosomes
representing<00:01:09.400> different<00:01:09.700> linkage<00:01:10.540> groups<00:01:11.250> so

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
representing different linkage groups so

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.710 
representing different linkage groups so
if<00:01:12.670> our<00:01:13.000> segment<00:01:13.659> of<00:01:13.870> chromosome<00:01:14.440> from<00:01:14.890> here

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
if our segment of chromosome from here

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.560 
if our segment of chromosome from here
it<00:01:16.720> gets<00:01:17.110> transferred<00:01:18.010> to<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:18.940> chromosome

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
it gets transferred to this chromosome

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.219 
it gets transferred to this chromosome
and<00:01:19.860> segment<00:01:20.860> of<00:01:21.040> chromosome<00:01:21.550> from<00:01:21.850> here<00:01:22.390> that

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
and segment of chromosome from here that

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.710 
and segment of chromosome from here that
is<00:01:23.380> transferred<00:01:24.040> to<00:01:24.220> this<00:01:24.520> chromosome<00:01:25.180> then

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
is transferred to this chromosome then

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
is transferred to this chromosome then
this<00:01:26.200> type<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.880> condition<00:01:27.880> will<00:01:28.090> appeal

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.770 

yes<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:56.259> due<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.619> exchange<00:01:56.950> of<00:01:57.780> segments

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
yes so due to the exchange of segments

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.230 
yes so due to the exchange of segments
now<00:01:59.350> this<00:01:59.829> type<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.430> condition<00:02:01.000> will

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
now this type of the condition will

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.889 
now this type of the condition will
appear<00:02:02.049> so<00:02:03.039> you<00:02:03.070> can<00:02:03.399> see<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:04.149> transfer<00:02:04.780> of

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
appear so you can see that transfer of

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.550 
appear so you can see that transfer of
the<00:02:05.049> genes<00:02:05.350> has<00:02:05.770> occurred<00:02:06.579> from<00:02:07.360> one<00:02:07.869> linkage

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
the genes has occurred from one linkage

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.120 
the genes has occurred from one linkage
group<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.670> another<00:02:10.509> this<00:02:11.410> transfer<00:02:12.099> of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
group to the another this transfer of

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.000 
group to the another this transfer of
the<00:02:12.400> genes<00:02:12.640> from<00:02:13.090> one<00:02:13.209> linkage<00:02:14.110> group<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.769> D

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
the genes from one linkage group to D

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.860 
the genes from one linkage group to D
another<00:02:15.599> this<00:02:16.650> represents<00:02:19.290> translocation

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
another this represents translocation

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.949 
another this represents translocation
right<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.709> out<00:02:24.069> of<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.459> four<00:02:24.730> options<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
right so out of the four options so the

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.250 
right so out of the four options so the
right<00:02:26.170> option<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.130> option<00:02:27.849> number<00:02:28.000> four<00:02:31.260> so

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
right option is option number four so

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.430 
right option is option number four so
this<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.920> answer<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.810> now<00:02:34.959> after<00:02:35.080> this

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
this is the answer so now after this

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:43.470 
this is the answer so now after this
let's<00:02:35.920> see<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.400> question<00:02:36.519> number<00:02:37.000> 49<00:02:37.569> here<00:02:42.480> so

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
let's see the question number 49 here so

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.229 
let's see the question number 49 here so
coming<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.810> question<00:02:44.170> number<00:02:44.500> 49<00:02:45.250> the

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
coming to question number 49 the

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.809 
coming to question number 49 the
following<00:02:46.750> graph<00:02:47.049> represents<00:02:47.890> population<00:02:48.640> of

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
following graph represents population of

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.860 
following graph represents population of
two<00:02:49.260> herbivores<00:02:50.260> in<00:02:50.680> grassy<00:02:51.489> field<00:02:51.910> so<00:02:52.690> we

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
two herbivores in grassy field so we

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.860 
two herbivores in grassy field so we
have<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.530> see<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:54.069> correct<00:02:54.670> option<00:02:55.360> for<00:02:55.630> these

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
have to see the correct option for these

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.039 
have to see the correct option for these
two<00:02:56.260> populations<00:02:57.329> so<00:02:58.329> if<00:02:58.420> we<00:02:58.540> look<00:02:58.750> at<00:02:58.900> the

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
two populations so if we look at the

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.699 
two populations so if we look at the
population<00:02:59.470> we<00:02:59.890> look<00:03:00.280> at<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.640> option<00:03:01.120> one

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
population we look at it option one

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.069 
population we look at it option one
population<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:03.000> consumed<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.329> members<00:03:04.840> of

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
population a consumed the members of

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.849 
population a consumed the members of
population<00:03:05.859> B<00:03:06.720> now<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.780> these<00:03:08.470> two

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
population B now the these two

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.970 
population B now the these two
population<00:03:09.790> they<00:03:10.000> are<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.299> herbivores<00:03:11.139> so

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
population they are of herbivores so

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.370 
population they are of herbivores so
they<00:03:12.160> will<00:03:12.310> feed<00:03:12.670> on<00:03:13.090> plants<00:03:13.900> they<00:03:14.019> will<00:03:14.049> not

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
they will feed on plants they will not

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.360 
they will feed on plants they will not
feed<00:03:14.739> upon<00:03:15.130> each<00:03:15.340> other<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.180> is<00:03:16.359> wrong

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
feed upon each other so this is wrong

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.300 
feed upon each other so this is wrong
both<00:03:18.370> plant<00:03:19.000> populations<00:03:19.989> in<00:03:20.290> this<00:03:20.590> habitat

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
both plant populations in this habitat

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.479 
both plant populations in this habitat
decrease<00:03:22.440> yes<00:03:23.440> they<00:03:23.769> are<00:03:23.799> not<00:03:24.040> plant

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
decrease yes they are not plant

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.270 
decrease yes they are not plant
population<00:03:25.299> they<00:03:25.630> are<00:03:25.709> herbivores<00:03:26.709> they<00:03:26.980> are

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
population they are herbivores they are

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.870 
population they are herbivores they are
animals<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:28.329> this<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:28.750> also<00:03:28.959> wrong<00:03:29.760> coming<00:03:30.760> to

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
animals so this is also wrong coming to

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.199 
animals so this is also wrong coming to
the<00:03:30.970> third<00:03:31.180> option<00:03:31.709> population<00:03:32.709> be<00:03:33.209> completed

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
the third option population be completed

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.349 
the third option population be completed
more<00:03:34.620> successfully<00:03:35.620> for<00:03:36.430> food<00:03:36.910> than

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
more successfully for food than

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.770 
more successfully for food than
population<00:03:38.290> E<00:03:38.440> yes<00:03:39.280> this<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:39.850> quite<00:03:40.150> visible

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
population E yes this is quite visible

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.190 
population E yes this is quite visible
population<00:03:41.560> B<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.910> number<00:03:43.239> is<00:03:43.359> increasing

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
population B the number is increasing

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.860 
population B the number is increasing
the<00:03:44.410> size<00:03:44.620> is<00:03:44.920> increasing<00:03:45.639> and<00:03:45.870> the

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
the size is increasing and the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.370 
the size is increasing and the
population<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:48.519> size<00:03:48.760> is<00:03:49.139> decreasing<00:03:50.139> so

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
population a the size is decreasing so

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.180 
population a the size is decreasing so
this<00:03:50.739> is<00:03:50.920> right<00:03:51.250> option<00:03:52.090> yes<00:03:53.079> that<00:03:53.709> this<00:03:53.980> is

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
this is right option yes that this is

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.089 
this is right option yes that this is
more<00:03:54.639> superior<00:03:55.239> as<00:03:55.900> compared<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:56.799> the

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
more superior as compared to the

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.469 
more superior as compared to the
population<00:03:57.970> of<00:03:58.319> herbivore<00:03:59.319> a<00:04:00.090> now<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.150> fourth

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
population of herbivore a now the fourth

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.229 
population of herbivore a now the fourth
option<00:04:01.889> population<00:04:02.889> a<00:04:03.130> produces<00:04:04.000> more

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
option population a produces more

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.170 
option population a produces more
offsprings<00:04:05.019> again<00:04:05.410> this<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:05.859> wrong<00:04:06.280> so

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
offsprings again this is wrong so

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.630 
offsprings again this is wrong so
we<00:04:07.299> will<00:04:07.450> say<00:04:07.719> the<00:04:08.109> right<00:04:08.349> option<00:04:09.159> for<00:04:09.519> this

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
we will say the right option for this

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.179 
we will say the right option for this
question<00:04:10.209> is<00:04:10.359> option<00:04:10.780> number<00:04:10.810> three<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.980> let's

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.189 
question is option number three so let's

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:21.599 
question is option number three so let's
move<00:04:15.549> on<00:04:15.879> to<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:16.539> question<00:04:16.900> number<00:04:17.139> 50<00:04:17.620> here

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.669
