00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
test part of the video but now it's time

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:50.679 
test part of the video but now it's time
to<00:01:47.990> move<00:01:48.770> on<00:01:48.979> to<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.340> review<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:49.969> decided<00:01:50.509> to

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
to move on to the review I decided to

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.380 
to move on to the review I decided to
start<00:01:50.929> to<00:01:51.170> come<00:01:51.350> forward<00:01:51.619> again<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:53.210> would

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
start to come forward again and I would

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.319 
start to come forward again and I would
give<00:01:53.539> them<00:01:53.719> four<00:01:54.259> out<00:01:54.530> of<00:01:54.590> five<00:01:55.179> because<00:01:56.179> they

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
give them four out of five because they

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.899 
give them four out of five because they
really<00:01:56.719> are<00:01:57.069> comfortable<00:01:58.069> and<00:01:58.369> they<00:01:58.670> feel

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
really are comfortable and they feel

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.349 
really are comfortable and they feel
like<00:01:59.149> a<00:01:59.179> thick<00:02:00.020> sock<00:02:00.289> really<00:02:00.979> soft<00:02:01.399> sock<00:02:01.670> but

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
like a thick sock really soft sock but

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.029 
like a thick sock really soft sock but
only<00:02:02.509> thing<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.020> really<00:02:03.259> didn't<00:02:03.649> like<00:02:03.679> was

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
only thing that I really didn't like was

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.339 
only thing that I really didn't like was
that<00:02:04.069> it<00:02:04.399> feels<00:02:04.579> like<00:02:04.819> there's<00:02:05.689> too<00:02:06.200> much

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
that it feels like there's too much

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:08.979 
that it feels like there's too much
space<00:02:06.500> here<00:02:06.950> in<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:07.759> heel<00:02:07.969> and<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.660> feels<00:02:08.840> like

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
space here in the heel and it feels like

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.470 
space here in the heel and it feels like
your<00:02:09.200> ear<00:02:09.379> can<00:02:09.709> really<00:02:10.129> feel<00:02:10.340> all<00:02:10.610> this<00:02:10.789> space

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
your ear can really feel all this space

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.729 
your ear can really feel all this space
here<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.489> it<00:02:13.489> really<00:02:13.760> felt<00:02:14.120> kind<00:02:14.599> of<00:02:14.720> weird<00:02:15.500> at

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
here so it really felt kind of weird at

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.130 
here so it really felt kind of weird at
first<00:02:15.769> but<00:02:16.239> you<00:02:17.239> get<00:02:17.390> used<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.810> after<00:02:17.959> a

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
first but you get used to it after a

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.900 
first but you get used to it after a
while<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.799> maybe<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.220> might<00:02:19.400> just<00:02:19.670> be<00:02:19.879> that

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
while and maybe it might just be that

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.500 
while and maybe it might just be that
this<00:02:20.629> might<00:02:20.900> be<00:02:21.079> a<00:02:21.410> half<00:02:21.680> size<00:02:21.950> too<00:02:22.310> big<00:02:22.819> for<00:02:23.420> me

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
this might be a half size too big for me

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.940 
this might be a half size too big for me
usually<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.930> go<00:02:24.170> with<00:02:25.569> Europe<00:02:26.569> size<00:02:26.810> 42<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:27.890> a

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
usually I go with Europe size 42 and a

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.640 
usually I go with Europe size 42 and a
half<00:02:28.099> and<00:02:28.400> these<00:02:28.549> are<00:02:28.840> 43<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:30.440> might<00:02:30.620> be

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
half and these are 43 so that might be

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.410 
half and these are 43 so that might be
the<00:02:30.829> reason<00:02:30.950> for<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:32.150> stud

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
the reason for that the stud

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.080 
the reason for that the stud
configuration<00:02:32.629> on<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.739> magista<00:02:34.340> bra<00:02:34.670> feels

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
configuration on the magista bra feels

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.809 
configuration on the magista bra feels
really<00:02:35.480> natural<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.049> good<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:37.160> this<00:02:37.519> is<00:02:37.640> the

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
really natural and good and this is the

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.089 
really natural and good and this is the
firm<00:02:38.090> ground<00:02:38.450> version<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.140> I've<00:02:39.650> been<00:02:39.859> using

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
firm ground version and I've been using

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.039 
firm ground version and I've been using
this<00:02:40.340> on<00:02:40.670> artistic<00:02:41.180> artificial<00:02:41.780> ground

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
this on artistic artificial ground

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.460 
this on artistic artificial ground
without<00:02:42.920> any<00:02:43.250> problems<00:02:43.730> maybe<00:02:44.120> they're

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
without any problems maybe they're

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.300 
without any problems maybe they're
artificial<00:02:45.470> ground<00:02:45.709> version<00:02:46.129> would<00:02:46.250> be

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
artificial ground version would be

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.729 
artificial ground version would be
better<00:02:46.609> on<00:02:46.880> hard<00:02:47.150> ones<00:02:47.450> but<00:02:47.780> these<00:02:48.290> are<00:02:48.500> also

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
better on hard ones but these are also

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.270 
better on hard ones but these are also
fine<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.519> you<00:02:50.480> can<00:02:50.690> go<00:02:50.900> wrong<00:02:51.139> with<00:02:51.319> this<00:02:51.500> even

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
fine and you can go wrong with this even

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.009 
fine and you can go wrong with this even
though<00:02:52.430> you're<00:02:52.609> playing<00:02:52.880> on<00:02:53.209> artificial

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
though you're playing on artificial

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.979

ground at the overall feet it's it's

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.199 
ground at the overall feet it's it's
kind<00:02:57.349> of<00:02:57.380> good<00:02:57.590> maybe<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.430> would<00:02:58.910> recommend

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
kind of good maybe I would recommend

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.500 
kind of good maybe I would recommend
going<00:02:59.599> with<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.440> your<00:03:00.950> normal<00:03:01.400> size<00:03:01.609> if

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
going with the your normal size if

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.710 
going with the your normal size if
you're<00:03:02.720> all<00:03:02.780> size<00:03:03.400> size<00:03:04.400> 8<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:05.239> to<00:03:05.450> go<00:03:05.540> with

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
you're all size size 8 you to go with

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.360 
you're all size size 8 you to go with
size<00:03:05.900> 8<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.700> definitely<00:03:07.700> don't<00:03:08.060> buy<00:03:08.540> bigger

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
size 8 and definitely don't buy bigger

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.699 
size 8 and definitely don't buy bigger
bigger<00:03:10.370> pair<00:03:10.760> if<00:03:11.690> they're<00:03:11.989> you<00:03:12.349> should<00:03:12.500> try

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
bigger pair if they're you should try

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.659 
bigger pair if they're you should try
them<00:03:12.889> before<00:03:13.250> buying<00:03:13.459> because<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:15.650> had<00:03:16.430> this

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
them before buying because I had this

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.690 
them before buying because I had this
problem<00:03:17.060> in<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.690> heel<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.200> here<00:03:18.859> because

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
problem in the heel and here because

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.920 
problem in the heel and here because
they<00:03:19.940> feel<00:03:20.269> bit<00:03:21.019> too<00:03:21.440> big<00:03:21.799> for<00:03:22.370> me<00:03:22.569> so<00:03:23.569> I

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
they feel bit too big for me so I

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.259 
they feel bit too big for me so I
recommend<00:03:24.650> going<00:03:24.980> with<00:03:25.160> your<00:03:25.430> normal<00:03:25.790> size<00:03:25.940> or

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
recommend going with your normal size or

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.610 
recommend going with your normal size or
have<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:27.260> half<00:03:27.769> size<00:03:28.040> down<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:30.260> should<00:03:30.470> be

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
have a half size down that should be

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.349 
have a half size down that should be
fine<00:03:31.450> but<00:03:32.450> yeah<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:32.840> over<00:03:33.139> performance<00:03:34.359> it's

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
fine but yeah the over performance it's

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.819 
fine but yeah the over performance it's
quite<00:03:35.599> food<00:03:35.959> um<00:03:37.299> feet<00:03:38.299> could<00:03:38.540> be<00:03:38.750> bit<00:03:39.530> better
