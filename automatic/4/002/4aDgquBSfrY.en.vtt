00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.599
 hello people all the guys here in this video 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.360
 which is sometimes asked about the bottle cutter 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.830
 And what to do if his neck from 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.190
 frankly figs knows where them 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.230
 do 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.690
 but one of the options long ago 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.119
 reviewed on youtube and with 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.310
 bottlenecks can be made 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.170
 Excellent waterproof hiking box 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.529
 for different things that can be reduced 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.429
 pills in bandage money matches and so 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.130
 further and the like 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.780
 let's do for starters take 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.300
 hacksaw and neatly 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.050
 we will cut the neck of the bottle 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.309
 by this one 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.210
 headband neatly slowly than 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:49.110
 smoother and cut off 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:51.180
 the less then there will be such problems 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.520
 blanks we need two things 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.520
 Further, with the help of pressed, we say flaws 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:06.220
 and using sandpaper 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.810
 alignable clear but now we 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.940
 to stick together previously obtained 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.990
 I will do this with the help of 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.979
 super glue 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.180
 You can also take an epoxy can be what 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.670
 some other glue 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.380
 but by no means was anyone 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.430
 I wonâ€™t warn you anything 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:31.030
 immediately especially gifted silicone by the way 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:33.070
 sealant is also not suitable for more 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.330
 high-quality bonding is better to hold 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:40.140
 billet in a vice and so friends now we 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.990
 with you watch our test 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.399
 waterproof hiking box 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.880
 inside the box was placed such 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.369
 special paper which is instant 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.050
 reacts to the water now we will pull out and 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.050
 let's see what we did 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.000
 inside stuck toilet paper if 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.060
 she was wet would see it 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.060
 and since you see it is absolutely dry 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.709
 so here friends here such 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.430
