different types of play style so many
different<00:01:44.760> types<00:01:44.910> of<00:01:45.210> tactics<00:01:45.510> to<00:01:46.050> these

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
different types of tactics to these

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.350 
different types of tactics to these
series<00:01:46.560> because<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.460> fused<00:01:47.790> both<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
series because it fused both the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.620 
series because it fused both the
conquest<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.260> this<00:01:49.650> close-quarter<00:01:50.630> tactical

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
conquest and this close-quarter tactical

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.050 
conquest and this close-quarter tactical
engagements<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.680> be<00:01:53.070> series<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.030> is

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
engagements to be series so this is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.790 
engagements to be series so this is
something<00:01:54.420> we've<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:54.810> seen<00:01:55.140> since<00:01:55.380> nineteen

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
something we've not seen since nineteen

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.100 
something we've not seen since nineteen
forty-two<00:01:56.100> or<00:01:56.400> battlefield<00:01:56.970> two<00:01:57.120> and<00:01:57.390> since

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
forty-two or battlefield two and since

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.230 
forty-two or battlefield two and since
its<00:01:58.290> debut<00:01:58.470> tin<00:01:58.800> 2142<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.730> haven't<00:02:00.030> seen<00:02:00.120> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
its debut tin 2142 we haven't seen the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.290 
its debut tin 2142 we haven't seen the
game<00:02:00.420> mode<00:02:00.600> until<00:02:01.530> now<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.550> carrier<00:02:02.940> soul

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
game mode until now and so carrier soul

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.210 
game mode until now and so carrier soul
is<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.690> be<00:02:03.810> something<00:02:04.200> similar<00:02:04.860> as<00:02:05.040> they

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
is going to be something similar as they

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.070 
is going to be something similar as they
are<00:02:05.340> saying<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.940> going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.180> be<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.300> reimagined

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080
