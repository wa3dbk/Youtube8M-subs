warehouse and today we're going to take
a<00:00:08.340> quick<00:00:08.610> look<00:00:08.849> at<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.210> CCM<00:00:09.780> 7000<00:00:10.679> goalie<00:00:10.799> mask

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
a quick look at the CCM 7000 goalie mask

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.100 
a quick look at the CCM 7000 goalie mask
now<00:00:11.820> starting<00:00:12.179> off<00:00:12.240> on<00:00:12.450> michelle<00:00:12.749> designer

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
now starting off on michelle designer

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.049 
now starting off on michelle designer
this<00:00:13.290> mask<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:14.070> going<00:00:14.249> to<00:00:14.309> be<00:00:14.400> matching<00:00:14.639> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
this mask it's going to be matching the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.660 
this mask it's going to be matching the
wrestler<00:00:15.450> lineup<00:00:15.870> using<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.890> pro<00:00:17.189> inspired

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
wrestler lineup using that pro inspired

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.910 
wrestler lineup using that pro inspired
design<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.420> what<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.689> means<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.260> that

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
design so what that means is that

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.980 
design so what that means is that
they've<00:00:20.490> maximized<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.240> visibility<00:00:21.810> with

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
they've maximized the visibility with

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.410 
they've maximized the visibility with
the<00:00:22.019> facial<00:00:22.410> opening<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.220> one<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.759> as<00:00:24.029> you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the facial opening on this one so as you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.480 
the facial opening on this one so as you
can<00:00:24.509> see<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.840> comes<00:00:25.080> back<00:00:25.320> pretty<00:00:25.650> far<00:00:25.949> here<00:00:26.340> on

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
can see it comes back pretty far here on

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.099 
can see it comes back pretty far here on
the<00:00:26.609> side<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.390> that's<00:00:27.449> going<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.660> help<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.960> open

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the side so that's going to help to open

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.259 
the side so that's going to help to open
up<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> peripheral<00:00:29.099> vision<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.939> then<00:00:30.089> also

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
up the peripheral vision and then also

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.999 
up the peripheral vision and then also
going<00:00:30.660> up<00:00:30.839> and<00:00:31.080> down<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> pretty

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
going up and down you have a pretty

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.460 
going up and down you have a pretty
large<00:00:32.189> opening<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:32.790> well<00:00:32.970> so<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.600> general<00:00:34.110> just

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
large opening as well so in general just

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.990 
large opening as well so in general just
helps<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.770> maximize<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.520> overall<00:00:35.850> visibility

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
helps to maximize the overall visibility

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.120 
helps to maximize the overall visibility
with<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.570> mask<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.170> then<00:00:37.650> going<00:00:37.860> into<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
with the mask and then going into the

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.830 
with the mask and then going into the
shell<00:00:38.610> construction<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.450> one<00:00:39.630> they're

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
shell construction on this one they're

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.330 
shell construction on this one they're
going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.990> be<00:00:40.080> using<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.350> polycarbonate<00:00:41.100> shell

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
going to be using a polycarbonate shell

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.910 
going to be using a polycarbonate shell
construction<00:00:41.780> so<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:42.900> going<00:00:42.990> to<00:00:43.080> help<00:00:43.710> to

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
construction so it's going to help to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.530 
construction so it's going to help to
absorb<00:00:44.040> some<00:00:44.400> of<00:00:44.490> the<00:00:44.580> impact<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.360> help

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
absorb some of the impact and just help

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.790 
absorb some of the impact and just help
to<00:00:45.570> protect<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.080> head<00:00:46.230> meaning<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.620> take

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
to protect the head meaning if you take

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.980 
to protect the head meaning if you take
a<00:00:46.830> shot<00:00:47.130> but<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.150> really<00:00:48.450> isn't<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.930> be

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
a shot but this really isn't going to be

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.390 
a shot but this really isn't going to be
designed<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.500> those<00:00:49.620> guys<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.100> playing

backside you can see they have that nice
large<00:01:09.570> piece<00:01:09.960> that's<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.560> seen

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
large piece that's going to be seen

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.830 
large piece that's going to be seen
throughout<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.939> rest<00:01:12.149> of<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.329> line<00:01:12.539> on<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
throughout the rest of the line on the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.050 
throughout the rest of the line on the
backside<00:01:13.289> here<00:01:13.560> basically<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> little

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
backside here basically it's a little

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.989 
backside here basically it's a little
bit<00:01:15.270> longer<00:01:15.539> than<00:01:15.869> most<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.469> the<00:01:16.590> back<00:01:17.549> pieces

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:17.999 
bit longer than most of the back pieces

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:20.179 
bit longer than most of the back pieces
on<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> market<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.380> does<00:01:19.859> allow<00:01:20.130> you

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
on the market but that does allow you

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.859 
on the market but that does allow you
for<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.579> little<00:01:20.850> bit<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.030> extra<00:01:21.270> protection<00:01:21.810> on

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
for a little bit of extra protection on

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.810 
for a little bit of extra protection on
the<00:01:21.990> back<00:01:22.020> side<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.469> the<00:01:22.649> head<00:01:22.829> now<00:01:23.429> taking<00:01:23.759> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
the back side of the head now taking a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.859 
the back side of the head now taking a
look<00:01:23.850> at<00:01:24.090> their<00:01:24.210> protection<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.719> the<00:01:24.810> inside

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
look at their protection on the inside

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.840 
look at their protection on the inside
you<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.560> see<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.429> to<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.579> using

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you can see it's just going to be using

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.809 
you can see it's just going to be using
a<00:01:26.939> single<00:01:27.390> density<00:01:27.799> VN<00:01:28.799> foam<00:01:29.100> liner<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.640> there

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
a single density VN foam liner on there

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.999 
a single density VN foam liner on there
and<00:01:29.969> that<00:01:30.390> foam<00:01:30.719> liner<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.200> actually<00:01:31.679> very

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
and that foam liner is actually very

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.249 
and that foam liner is actually very
very<00:01:32.460> soft<00:01:32.789> so<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.600> helps<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.960> give<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
very soft so it helps to give you a
