enough<00:00:10.679> for<00:00:10.980> him<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.150> back<00:00:12.300> straight

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
enough for him so in the back straight

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.020 
enough for him so in the back straight
for<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> few<00:00:13.950> strides<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.370> was<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.549> little<00:00:14.820> bit<00:00:14.910> in

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
for a few strides I was a little bit in

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.570 
for a few strides I was a little bit in
danger<00:00:15.389> because<00:00:15.690> he<00:00:15.719> was<00:00:16.289> nearly<00:00:17.190> clipping

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
hills and I was really afraid he was not

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.980 
hills and I was really afraid he was not
going<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.670> take<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> good<00:00:21.090> blow<00:00:21.300> before<00:00:21.720> the
