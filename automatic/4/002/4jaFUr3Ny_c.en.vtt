from<00:01:21.270> c-3po<00:01:22.490> yep<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.790> you've<00:01:23.909> got<00:01:24.000> textures<00:01:24.420> in

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
from c-3po yep so you've got textures in

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.249 
from c-3po yep so you've got textures in
the<00:01:24.600> folder<00:01:24.900> here

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the folder here

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.810 
the folder here
AO<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.549> diffusion<00:01:27.590> or<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:29.460> find<00:01:29.670> out

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
AO is diffusion or you can find out

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.800 
AO is diffusion or you can find out
which<00:01:29.970> ones<00:01:30.180> they<00:01:30.299> are<00:01:30.390> because<00:01:30.570> when<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
which ones they are because when you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.789 
which ones they are because when you
like<00:01:30.960> click<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.520> it'll<00:01:32.520> say<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.740> you<00:01:34.740> know

like click on it it'll say like you know

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.969 
like click on it it'll say like you know
what<00:01:35.540> sort<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:37.140> texture<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.590> needing<00:01:37.890> is

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
what sort of what texture you needing is

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.810 
what sort of what texture you needing is
find<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> folder<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.180> such<00:01:40.549> so<00:01:41.549> that's

you<00:01:42.229> c-3po<00:01:43.229> Yoda<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:45.259> like<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.500> there's<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
you c-3po Yoda I like this one there's a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.429 
you c-3po Yoda I like this one there's a
lot<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.820> them<00:01:49.880> lighting<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.180> don't<00:01:52.140> think<00:01:52.320> I've

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
lot of them lighting I don't think I've

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.929 
lot of them lighting I don't think I've
put<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.610> come<00:01:53.790> with

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
put this in I think it's just come with

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.100 
put this in I think it's just come with
the<00:01:54.030> project<00:01:54.479> file

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.220 

I<00:01:57.790> mean<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:58.880> can<00:01:59.030> take<00:01:59.570> off<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.780> few<00:02:00.080> if<00:02:00.140> you

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
I mean you can take off a few if you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.140 
I mean you can take off a few if you
think<00:02:00.440> there's<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.620> bit<00:02:00.800> too<00:02:00.980> bright<00:02:01.220> I<00:02:01.550> mean<00:02:02.120> I

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
think there's a bit too bright I mean I

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.060 
think there's a bit too bright I mean I
would<00:02:02.480> that<00:02:02.840> looks<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.140> bit<00:02:03.170> too<00:02:03.470> bright<00:02:03.710> that's

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
would that looks a bit too bright that's

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.040 
would that looks a bit too bright that's
the<00:02:04.190> odor<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.610> thought<00:02:05.120> that's<00:02:05.210> pretty<00:02:05.600> decent

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
the odor I thought that's pretty decent

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.580 
the odor I thought that's pretty decent
for<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:06.380> model<00:02:07.869> and<00:02:08.869> then<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.619> back<00:02:11.590> yeah

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
for a model and then the back yeah

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.740 
for a model and then the back yeah
pretty<00:02:13.130> nice<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:14.030> probably<00:02:14.510> won't<00:02:14.630> need

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
pretty nice you probably won't need

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.770 
pretty nice you probably won't need
