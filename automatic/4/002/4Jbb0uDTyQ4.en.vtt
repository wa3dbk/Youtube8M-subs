00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
it's got a very high rate of fire very

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.100 
it's got a very high rate of fire very
accurate<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> they<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.719> pierce<00:00:54.930> through

coat you can look like a casual guy

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.060 
coat you can look like a casual guy
blending<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.420> crowd<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:04.559> got<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> guys

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
blending the crowd so we got the guys

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.649 
blending the crowd so we got the guys
over<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.460> hanging<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.119> their<00:01:06.240> vehicle

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
over there hanging out in their vehicle

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.240 
over there hanging out in their vehicle
we're<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.560> choose<00:01:07.770> straight<00:01:08.040> through

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
we're going to choose straight through

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.399 
we're going to choose straight through
those<00:01:08.430> doors<00:01:08.670> take<00:01:09.119> them<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.540> smash<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
those doors take them out smash the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.260 
those doors take them out smash the
windows<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.040> that's<00:01:11.700> where<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.090> thing

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
windows and that's where this thing

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.450 
windows and that's where this thing
really<00:01:12.479> shines<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.020> mp5<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.950> can't<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.340> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
really shines the mp5 just can't do that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:33.450 
really shines the mp5 just can't do that
on<00:01:14.520> some<00:01:14.909> situations

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.300 

so<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:34.550> can<00:01:34.700> see<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:35.150> rate<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:35.810> fire<00:01:36.080> is

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
so you can see that rate of fire is

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.490 
so you can see that rate of fire is
absolutely<00:01:37.310> ridiculous<00:01:37.869> much<00:01:38.869> faster<00:01:39.320> than

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
absolutely ridiculous much faster than

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.340 
absolutely ridiculous much faster than
the<00:01:39.619> mp5<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:41.240> recoil<00:01:41.690> is<00:01:41.780> extremely

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
the mp5 and the recoil is extremely

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.440 
the mp5 and the recoil is extremely
controllable<00:01:43.310> you've<00:01:43.729> got<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.090> smaller

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
controllable you've got the smaller

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.380 
controllable you've got the smaller
round<00:01:44.810> less<00:01:45.500> recoil<00:01:45.800> all<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.790> penetration

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
round less recoil all the penetration

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:59.350 
round less recoil all the penetration
downrange<00:01:47.930> let's<00:01:48.920> try<00:01:49.070> something<00:01:49.460> else<00:01:58.360> okay

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
downrange let's try something else okay

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.060 
downrange let's try something else okay
so<00:01:59.420> now<00:01:59.840> we've<00:02:00.050> stepped<00:02:00.320> things<00:02:00.530> up<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.890> notch

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
so now we've stepped things up a notch

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.580 
so now we've stepped things up a notch
I've<00:02:01.729> got<00:02:01.970> my<00:02:02.149> mp5<00:02:02.750> here<00:02:03.050> now<00:02:03.229> this<00:02:03.440> is

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
I've got my mp5 here now this is

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.590 
I've got my mp5 here now this is
chambered<00:02:03.920> in<00:02:04.009> 9<00:02:04.250> millimeter<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:05.210> be<00:02:05.330> honest

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
chambered in 9 millimeter to be honest

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.480 
chambered in 9 millimeter to be honest
with<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:05.869> i<00:02:05.899> prefer<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.440> 9-millimeter<00:02:07.190> round

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
with you i prefer the 9-millimeter round

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.240 
with you i prefer the 9-millimeter round
over<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:08.030> 5.7<00:02:08.869> millimeter<00:02:09.050> round<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:10.009> does

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
over that 5.7 millimeter round it does

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.280 
over that 5.7 millimeter round it does
not<00:02:10.429> have<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.940> penetration<00:02:11.600> capabilities

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
not have the penetration capabilities

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.199 
not have the penetration capabilities
but<00:02:12.739> it's<00:02:12.890> got<00:02:13.100> more<00:02:13.370> mass<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.000> it's<00:02:14.090> got

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
but it's got more mass to it it's got

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.940 
but it's got more mass to it it's got
more<00:02:14.480> weight<00:02:14.720> going<00:02:15.080> downrange<00:02:15.500> giving<00:02:15.890> you

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
more weight going downrange giving you

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.370 
more weight going downrange giving you
better<00:02:16.190> knock<00:02:16.459> down<00:02:16.730> power<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.300> even<00:02:18.080> though

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
better knock down power and even though

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.930 
better knock down power and even though
those<00:02:18.560> guys<00:02:18.800> are<00:02:18.980> pretty<00:02:19.160> damn<00:02:19.400> far<00:02:19.640> away

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
those guys are pretty damn far away

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.460
