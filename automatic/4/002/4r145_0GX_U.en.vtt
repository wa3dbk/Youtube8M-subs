00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.330
 well today what we are very very 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.340
 worried as well as the governor as 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.260
 our president and yes a servant 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.890
 on the subject of bullying 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.869
 we want it to get to that beckham to that 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.090
 we are free of bullying especially 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.800
 that people and especially children who 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.539
 they obviously report it to their parents 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.200
 with their teachers because many times 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.010
 even the teachers themselves do not give 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.750
 this information and do not give the notices to 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.590
 who is due we are a little behind 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.870
 but we already want it to come out in these in 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.220
 end of month beginning from September not 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.700
 bother me with many years 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.740
 of support for people 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.690
 Well, I think it's very, very 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.720
 important the fact of receiving two 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.610
 food baskets for each person 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.310
 and then at the community level we are 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.550
 starting today the first event of the 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.100
 twenty-something or today's 21 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.110
 August until September 28 we are going to 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.420
 be all 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.910
 I think that for moms, it's mostly 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.220
 very important because today the subject 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.720
 of spending the subject of today's 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.340
 useful sector expenditures that have to 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.930
 do with uniforms I think it's a 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.210
 way to support our governor 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.370
 our president of course our 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.350
 deputy Aaron Urbina are always very 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.460
 Pending me wanting their 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.460
 mamitas are better 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.280
 we have an infinity of programs in the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.680
 day but one that is very nice to me 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.479
 as well they say it gave me fills me and I 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.820
 it also comes because I finally went 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.410
 mother sun be very young since 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.680
 we have a program of from the 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.110
 12 or 13 years until 19 in that period 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.240
 that the mothers of the ladies 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.210
 young girls are moms in that we help them 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.800
 simply because they have already in 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.320
 your pregnancy have your folic acid 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.660
 that they eat well since their 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.820
 I drink all his vaccines and through 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.619
 different program to help them 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.360
 process a scholarship to follow 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.310
 studying and not because of being 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.440
 so young mothers lose that 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.540
 opportunity to continue then leaving 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.540
 forward that's the hayman program 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.120
 s 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.500
 narvarte for a child who practiced 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.260
 bullying because in the complaints there 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.810
 they thrived on that mechanism that they have 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.470
 difficult to articulate the municipality so that 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.060
 parents on this topic well what 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.880
 main is to have very good 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.500
 communication with schools obviously 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.170
 that of the school allows us 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.910
 center as dif with talks to 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.040
 parents because we have the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.480
 workshops for parents and dorta that 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.670
 schools let us in also with 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.489
 the teachers yesterday that 's a concern 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.470
 from me because you have to get there 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.780
 teachers with nothing more than the 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.880
 parents because what's the use then the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.970
 for the father, everything arrives distressed 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.209
 everything arrives without knowing if it is not 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.549
 teacher did not continue with that supporting him 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.950
 then we in this aspect is the 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.750
 I immediately communicate it to 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.790
 we immediately enter the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.299
 school and obviously the school does not 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.299
 let us allow 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.890
 good as such we attend them or be the 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.379
 open numbers but each of the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.260
 numbers are different is theoretical 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.610
 delicate we provide them 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.010
 specifically because you get beds that is 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:37.489
 so big that we obviously have many 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.489
 sectors to be able to have that alert not 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.340
 this bitter panel 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.280
 today I think the disability program 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.840
 I do not think that as you know in tecámac 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.629
 We have 3 camps that are the centers of 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.519
 Multiple attention being with the all 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.040
 these little ones that is children with 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.349
 disability I think it's the little people 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.300
 that have marked me more than always 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.370
 it gave him that he wanted to adopt them 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.050
 always be attentive to what 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.239
 what you need if you are in a 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.849
 city ​​of wheels if they also need their 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.790
 food basket if they need to 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.349
 example, headbands to listen to so many 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.720
 situations that there are all the little ones 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.790
 I think that children with disabilities is 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.850
 what is not stronger right now 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.060
 we simply delivered that they were almost 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.720
 this almost 100 hearing aids 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.210
 only they could not see it 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.790
 physically here because it was in toluca and 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.710
 if the fact that the photos of a 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.600
 little baby that did not listen only 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.300
 some powers listening did not speak and 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.639
 that he has already heard for me is something 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.510
 very motivating to continue here to follow 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.510
 Helping people
