reliable team that you want to see but

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.609 
reliable team that you want to see but
still<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.250> think<00:01:32.820> at<00:01:33.090> minus-6<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:34.500> know

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619

Cleveland with Hoyer and their and their

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.130 
Cleveland with Hoyer and their and their
issues<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.610> road<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.060> guess<00:01:39.420> I'd<00:01:39.630> lean

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
issues on the road I guess I'd lean

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.600 
issues on the road I guess I'd lean
Cincinnati<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.950> wouldn't<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> strong

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
Cincinnati but it wouldn't be a strong

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.149 
Cincinnati but it wouldn't be a strong
lean<00:01:41.850> total<00:01:42.570> 44<00:01:42.960> 44<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> half<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.040> know

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
lean total 44 44 and a half you know

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.980 
lean total 44 44 and a half you know
since<00:01:44.520> there<00:01:44.670> by<00:01:44.790> Cincinnati<00:01:45.329> got<00:01:45.600> foreign

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
since there by Cincinnati got foreign

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.530 
since there by Cincinnati got foreign
one<00:01:46.229> over<00:01:46.619> under<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.579> Cleveland's<00:01:48.360> been

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
one over under but Cleveland's been

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.749 
one over under but Cleveland's been
trending<00:01:48.810> under<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.710> guess<00:01:49.979> I'd<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.340> a

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
trending under and I guess I'd have a

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.490 
trending under and I guess I'd have a
small<00:01:51.149> lean<00:01:51.329> towards<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> under<00:01:51.990> forty<00:01:52.320> four

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
small lean towards the under forty four

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.350 
small lean towards the under forty four
and<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> half<00:01:52.680> as<00:01:53.009> well<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.460> again<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.299> would

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and a half as well but again that would

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.330 
and a half as well but again that would
be<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.689> very<00:01:54.899> lukewarm<00:01:55.200> lean<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:55.829> sure<00:01:56.100> if

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
be just a very lukewarm lean not sure if

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.709 
be just a very lukewarm lean not sure if
i'd<00:01:56.670> want<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.969> bet<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.240> what's<00:01:57.390> your<00:01:57.509> take<00:01:57.630> on

to<00:02:35.520> be<00:02:35.670> out<00:02:36.240> uh<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:37.380> week<00:02:37.620> again<00:02:37.950> they're

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
to be out uh this week again they're

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.850 
to be out uh this week again they're
tight<00:02:38.730> end<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.320> Cincinnati's<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.350> team<00:02:40.650> that's

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
tight end so Cincinnati's a team that's

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.040 
tight end so Cincinnati's a team that's
very<00:02:41.370> vulnerable<00:02:41.730> against<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.450> run<00:02:42.660> but<00:02:42.900> not

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
very vulnerable against the run but not

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.350 
very vulnerable against the run but not
so<00:02:43.320> good<00:02:43.350> against<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.520> past<00:02:44.760> they<00:02:44.970> actually

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
so good against the past they actually

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.690 
so good against the past they actually
allow<00:02:45.420> whopping<00:02:46.140> 4.8<00:02:46.800> yards<00:02:46.830> per<00:02:47.340> rushing

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
allow whopping 4.8 yards per rushing

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.100 
allow whopping 4.8 yards per rushing
attempt<00:02:48.030> that's<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.450> team's<00:02:48.690> normally

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
attempt that's the team's normally

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.160 
attempt that's the team's normally
getting<00:02:49.350> just<00:02:49.530> 4.1<00:02:50.070> but<00:02:50.430> conversely<00:02:51.170> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
getting just 4.1 but conversely the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.430 
getting just 4.1 but conversely the
whole<00:02:52.350> team's<00:02:53.030> 2.7<00:02:54.030> below<00:02:54.750> their<00:02:55.110> normal

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
whole team's 2.7 below their normal

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.930 
whole team's 2.7 below their normal
average<00:02:55.620> when<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:55.980> comes<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.310> passing<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.910> I

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
average when it comes to passing so I

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.520 
average when it comes to passing so I
think<00:02:57.000> Cleveland<00:02:57.600> their<00:02:57.750> team<00:02:57.990> that<00:02:58.110> prefers

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
think Cleveland their team that prefers

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.460 
think Cleveland their team that prefers
to<00:02:58.800> run<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.130> ball<00:02:59.310> anyway<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.120> now<00:03:00.260> they<00:03:01.260> not

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
to run the ball anyway and now they not

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.040 
to run the ball anyway and now they not
only<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:02.100> 10<00:03:02.730> can<00:03:03.120> really<00:03:03.690> they're<00:03:03.840> not<00:03:03.870> to

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
only on 10 can really they're not to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.750 
only on 10 can really they're not to
change<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.410> strategy<00:03:04.740> they<00:03:05.190> could<00:03:05.400> no<00:03:05.550> pun

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
change the strategy they could no pun

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.520

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
most of the game it just makes me

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.240 
most of the game it just makes me
nervous<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.230> at<00:04:13.440> some<00:04:13.680> point<00:04:13.710> one<00:04:14.010> way<00:04:14.190> or

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250

when<00:04:31.370> you're<00:04:31.520> losing<00:04:31.640> with<00:04:31.970> an<00:04:32.090> underdog<00:04:32.540> and

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
when you're losing with an underdog and

more<00:04:34.670> painful<00:04:35.240> but<00:04:35.330> you<00:04:35.420> don't<00:04:35.600> want<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:35.900> bet

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
more painful but you don't want to bet

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.350 
more painful but you don't want to bet

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
yeah obviously AJ Green is a major

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.910

factor<00:05:01.460> but<00:05:02.060> still<00:05:02.480> still<00:05:03.410> I<00:05:03.440> don't<00:05:03.740> know<00:05:03.830> if

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
factor but still still I don't know if

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.800 
factor but still still I don't know if
he's<00:05:04.040> going<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.430> be<00:05:04.580> one<00:05:04.790> hundred<00:05:04.940> percent<00:05:05.150> and

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
he's going to be one hundred percent and

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.080 
he's going to be one hundred percent and
yeah<00:05:06.500> of<00:05:06.680> course<00:05:07.220> all<00:05:07.400> those<00:05:07.550> things<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:07.970> you

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
yeah of course all those things that you

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.510 
yeah of course all those things that you
say<00:05:08.570> could<00:05:09.200> happen<00:05:09.770> right<00:05:09.800> but<00:05:10.220> I've<00:05:10.280> got<00:05:10.490> to

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
say could happen right but I've got to

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.130 
say could happen right but I've got to
make<00:05:10.730> my<00:05:10.880> picks<00:05:11.150> based<00:05:11.390> on<00:05:11.630> what<00:05:11.750> I<00:05:11.780> think<00:05:12.050> is

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
make my picks based on what I think is

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.380 
make my picks based on what I think is
the<00:05:12.230> most<00:05:12.380> likely<00:05:12.620> scenario<00:05:13.070> and<00:05:13.700> I<00:05:13.790> do<00:05:13.850> not

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
the most likely scenario and I do not

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.990 
the most likely scenario and I do not
charge<00:05:14.720> myself<00:05:15.580> psychological<00:05:16.580> juice<00:05:16.790> but

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
charge myself psychological juice but

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.370 
charge myself psychological juice but
you're<00:05:17.150> right<00:05:17.300> with<00:05:17.510> with<00:05:17.810> a<00:05:17.840> game<00:05:18.110> like<00:05:18.320> this

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
you're right with with a game like this

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.650 
you're right with with a game like this
the<00:05:18.710> totals<00:05:19.040> not<00:05:19.220> super<00:05:20.060> high<00:05:20.210> but<00:05:20.420> I<00:05:20.450> still

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
the totals not super high but I still

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.820 
the totals not super high but I still
think<00:05:20.870> it's<00:05:20.960> a<00:05:21.020> little<00:05:21.080> bit<00:05:21.200> hobby<00:05:21.440> to<00:05:21.620> write

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
think it's a little bit hobby to write

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.670 
think it's a little bit hobby to write
that<00:05:22.550> uh<00:05:22.580> with<00:05:23.480> the<00:05:23.600> total<00:05:23.780> this<00:05:24.050> low<00:05:24.290> you<00:05:24.590> are

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
that uh with the total this low you are

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.590 
that uh with the total this low you are
in<00:05:24.830> danger<00:05:25.010> of<00:05:25.250> paying<00:05:25.550> psychological<00:05:26.390> juice

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
in danger of paying psychological juice

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.030 
in danger of paying psychological juice
when<00:05:26.780> you<00:05:26.840> lose<00:05:27.020> but<00:05:27.230> that's<00:05:27.410> you<00:05:27.860> know<00:05:27.890> you

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
when you lose but that's you know you

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.380 
when you lose but that's you know you
just<00:05:28.250> got<00:05:28.430> a<00:05:28.460> shrug<00:05:28.820> them<00:05:29.000> off<00:05:29.060> you're<00:05:29.270> going

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
just got a shrug them off you're going

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.670 
just got a shrug them off you're going
to<00:05:29.480> win<00:05:29.690> a<00:05:29.720> lot<00:05:30.020> more<00:05:30.170> than<00:05:30.230> you're<00:05:30.470> going<00:05:30.620> to

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
to win a lot more than you're going to

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.280 
to win a lot more than you're going to
lose<00:05:30.860> but<00:05:31.460> you<00:05:31.610> can't<00:05:31.880> have<00:05:32.419> those<00:05:32.690> those

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
lose but you can't have those those

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.590 
lose but you can't have those those
losses<00:05:33.620> really<00:05:34.550> affect<00:05:34.880> your<00:05:35.090> handicapping

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
losses really affect your handicapping

losses really affect your handicapping
too<00:05:35.900> much<00:05:36.110> right<00:05:36.470> well<00:05:36.590> let<00:05:37.070> me<00:05:37.100> just<00:05:37.160> ask<00:05:37.400> you

too much right well let me just ask you

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.220 
too much right well let me just ask you
then<00:05:37.760> why<00:05:38.180> didn't<00:05:38.390> you<00:05:38.419> go<00:05:38.570> for<00:05:38.600> Cincinnati

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
then why didn't you go for Cincinnati

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.720 
then why didn't you go for Cincinnati
minus<00:05:39.650> six<00:05:39.860> here<00:05:40.040> because<00:05:40.280> you<00:05:40.430> know<00:05:40.520> we<00:05:40.640> know

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
minus six here because you know we know

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.310 
minus six here because you know we know
the<00:05:40.850> problems<00:05:41.210> that<00:05:41.270> Cleveland<00:05:41.750> in<00:05:41.870> general

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
the problems that Cleveland in general

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.590 
the problems that Cleveland in general
is<00:05:42.440> having<00:05:43.190> on<00:05:43.370> offense<00:05:43.820> I<00:05:43.940> mean<00:05:44.120> they're<00:05:44.270> okay

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
is having on offense I mean they're okay

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.880 
is having on offense I mean they're okay
but<00:05:44.630> there's<00:05:44.990> certainly<00:05:45.230> nothing<00:05:45.440> too

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
but there's certainly nothing too

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.350 
but there's certainly nothing too
impressive<00:05:46.250> and<00:05:46.640> you<00:05:46.850> just<00:05:47.000> get<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:47.240> feeling

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
impressive and you just get the feeling

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.909 
impressive and you just get the feeling
that<00:05:47.510> if<00:05:47.660> this<00:05:47.750> one<00:05:47.930> starts<00:05:48.230> going<00:05:48.470> score<00:05:48.770> for

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
that if this one starts going score for

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.770 
that if this one starts going score for
score<00:05:49.040> eventually<00:05:50.000> Cincinnati<00:05:50.419> will<00:05:50.600> pull

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
score eventually Cincinnati will pull

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.990 
score eventually Cincinnati will pull
away<00:05:50.930> and<00:05:51.260> that<00:05:51.710> you<00:05:51.890> know<00:05:52.010> unless<00:05:52.220> there's

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
away and that you know unless there's

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.370 
away and that you know unless there's
one<00:05:53.210> of<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.390> classic<00:05:53.780> implosions<00:05:54.260> by

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
one of the classic implosions by

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.720 
one of the classic implosions by
Cincinnati<00:05:54.830> which<00:05:54.980> is<00:05:55.070> always<00:05:55.220> possible<00:05:55.669> but

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
Cincinnati which is always possible but

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.760 
Cincinnati which is always possible but
unless<00:05:56.030> that<00:05:56.240> happens<00:05:56.270> probably<00:05:57.140> Cincinnati

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
unless that happens probably Cincinnati

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.800 
unless that happens probably Cincinnati

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
gets a pretty comfortable win and just

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.360 
gets a pretty comfortable win and just
Cincinnati<00:06:00.290> minus<00:06:00.680> six<00:06:00.890> at<00:06:01.040> first<00:06:01.220> glance

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
Cincinnati minus six at first glance

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.860
