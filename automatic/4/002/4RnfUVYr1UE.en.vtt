00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello everybody I'm here you 're welcome 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.180
 the weekly summary the pound and for two 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.460
 days of the week we had the chance to 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.070
 test the long-awaited trainer of 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.200
 teams and white light came to public 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.700
 talk a little about what they thought 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.710
 programmer he said that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.840
 had two problems they wanted 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.760
 solve using team leader o 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.859
 first is to take the time pressure to 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.359
 you work out with your team what 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.519
 each one will make us know that this 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.400
 was a lot of a fight and honestly it's one of the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.140
 reasons why I did not play and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.820
 not a young man called the city with strangers 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.870
 because always in the fight on the screen 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.309
 champion selection 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.820
 so this is a problem that they 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.040
 want to eliminate and another is that they or 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.960
 team formation today does not take 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.590
 consideration what each player wants 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.850
 do 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.320
 He says that each one plays the league. 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.960
 different footage there are people who like 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.390
 of choosing champions weird positions 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.920
 or stay too far inside the goal then 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.539
 with the team leader 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.910
 they want to get people together 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.469
 have similar will within the game 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.180
 He did not tell me about the times of 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.559
 waiting for you to find a match for 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.500
 team leader 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.619
 he said that most of the players 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.150
 95% of them had waits of minutes or 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.100
 least including those who dream 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.930
 crazy positions that have nothing to do 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.270
 and I think this information from the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.890
 part of it because I actually had 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.570
 problems with time everyone I 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.159
 I also told you had a son with 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.229
 four people we observe from a 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.060
 django has found 10 minutes 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.560
 no one took the field wearing I 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.240
 I want to hear from you, did you like the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.979
 command of the team if you think it's the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.780
 What are you going to use a lot? 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.850
 you think this high time 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.280
 Wait, wait, wait! 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.049
 I really happened me and does 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.250
 was because few people are using it will be 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.049

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.140
 to know of you contains 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.070
 content in the two weeks I was 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.380

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.479

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.610

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.820

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.180
 Can protect your city 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.050
 This can not end so it's time for a 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.209

 I'll show them what the organs 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.380
 they are capable then by the way we go 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.540
 have a new schin in the branch and have a lot of 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.570
 people saying that all this drama is only 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.250
 can be by a legendary corner in this 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.110
 The weekend went there in Poland to 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.480
 large end of the internal mass 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.130
 league of legends for the second year 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.959
 winning the prize was a 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.450
 South Korean team this time was the kit 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.760
 boys that finished completely undefeated 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.290
 without losing a match beyond 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.569
 take the trophy home too 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.980
 took a prize of 60 thousand dollars 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.260
 in second place was the finnet that 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.930
 compresses $ 30,000 in third and 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.930
 room was a cloud nine game with 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.610
 $ 14 thousand each 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.440
 this Monday cnb inaugurated its 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.989
 new house game that is in the region of 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.940
 jabaquara in sao paulo now all 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.790
 team players will live together and 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.079
 train together every day the card 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.030
 the box said that this will be very 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.040
 good for the staff all they do not have to 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.570
 same routine never all focused on the game 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.370
 and it will be much easier to identify 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.440
 the mistakes and correct them 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.810
 already the cnbb director says that he also 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.190
 does not think about the commercial side of 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.410
 since now everyone is going to be in São 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.230
 paulo intends to do some events and 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.480
 promotions and even on the cnb ​​player 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.340
 this newly hired as well as down 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.959
 makes more of the team without remembering that 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.910
 last week I commented that it had been 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.500
 away from the team on suspicion of 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.040
 involvement that link scheme 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.739
 work 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.260
 now that he left the player lives jj 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.480
 back to its adc position on its 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.799
 future in the game edson said he expects 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.049
 that luck apply a just punishment 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.359
 but does not harm many players 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.989
 because many of them are sorry 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:13.700
 Unfortunately, I think these 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.590
 two things do not fit into Haiti 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.430
 fair and do not greatly harm the 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.019
 players 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.209
 Is everyone waiting for a certain way? 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.320
 a very rigid posture of art but let's 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.409
 see what will happen 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.750
 brazil game show bgs announced its new 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:28.400
 format for this year 2014 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.650
 be two seasons with duration of 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.450
 four months each and at the end of each 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.520
 of the seasons will have three events 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.860
 will define the champion of 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.030
 each of the modalities at the beginning of 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.500
 each season there will be a 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.720
 online qualifier you will choose 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.400
 two teams that will join other teams 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.020
 four teams to be chosen 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.790
 by the organizing committee 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.590
 these teams will face two 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.630
 times a week in a better 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.420
 of 2 who wins takes three points and if 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.400
 they draw in each one takes a little and 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.410
 last Sunday she was a 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.360
 beneficent live stream to help 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.280
 South Korean player's family promise 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.810
 that for those who did not see tried suicide 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.180
 then discovered that his former coach 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.490
 manipulated the results for the benefit of 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.900
 own and whether they can raise about 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.360
 of three thousand reais 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.070
 beyond tweetie scenes said that 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.960
 They plan to make a new schin 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.150
 at the time of Easter to give 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.220
 ovinhos to create needy children 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.680
 I found this attitude super cool and I did 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.480
 matter of talking about it here is only personal 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.810
 This was the weekly palm summary that 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.280
 covered the days 10 to 18 of March of 2014 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.169
 we had a bonus day because I 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.180
 behind schedule was great because lots of news 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.890
