00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.490
 devoted to a sweet topic called 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.820
 sweet shoppe that is, we can blind 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.740

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.240
 so it includes a set of the set includes here 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.240
 such three subjects to eat 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.300

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.160
 pieces of cake as well as such 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.630
 knife 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.110
 I'll take a closer look here as well. 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.390
 cute little plates and the stand itself 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.879
 peculiar to me and prompted 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.950
 buy this set she is like natural 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.140
 I even think that you can children's sweets on 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.410
 really fold here in each 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.620
 podstavochki have special grooves 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.149
 to sculpt various figures of the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.989
 there we first disassembled this 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.809
 coaster 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.719
 all just stuck then dried 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.090
 podstavochku collected and laid out these 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.309
 Here are all sorts of beautiful Circuits let's you 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.720
 show closer for example here it is 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.350
 us a cookie of this color as ginger 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.960
 a cookie is a bow of inedible 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.270
 blue we can't do 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.270
 right very clearly, well, everything is so with 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.060
 a child did with a two-year-old I helped 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.939
 and so she can pull it all out 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.939
 I had to do molds from behind 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.970
 there are such little hills so she can 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.960
 pinch your fingers and pull it out 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.820
 something like chocolates various bows 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 let's take a closer look at the turtles shells 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.020
 Bows are now so here it is in Pirozhenko 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.909
 We have three well here again can be done 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.340
 using what with the help of this one 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.380
 molds are molds most 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.689
 the child liked her for two years quite 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.640
 managed the dogs here we lay out 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.770
 mass 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.990
 close the mass and it takes shape 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.799
 such a machine that is wavy at the edges 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.849
 becomes 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:16.220
 further nabchik himself enters such here 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:20.120
 he will try to remove the syringe by hand now 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.950
 here such that there is here, too, for a 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.769
 mass and and the second part of the syringe 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.040
 pushes and turns us 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:31.190
 wavy such a thing here, too, we 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.170
 heard a lot of different colors as well 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.870
 see that is the whole set of chips 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.110
 fully functional but here are the figures 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.180
 at which we can make a child 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.430
 the easiest of course from the last one 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.340
 sculpt it here because it is very 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.769
 major figures from a small naborchiki 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.590
 even it was hard for me to see 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.290
 here as far as small parts and from 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.360
 only 2 masses are suitable for 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.610
 blind and help really 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.370
 the masses are very supple if ordinary 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.140
 which yellow butterflies do not put 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.769
 all very clearly drawn 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.750
 the outlines are all prints but in general this 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.030
 mass for modeling and generally this whole 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.519
 I really liked the set 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.750
 about 500 rubles and we sculpt already 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.170
 a few days take off 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:22.959
 that is, sculpt shove back in again 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.959
 blind you enjoy your creativity
