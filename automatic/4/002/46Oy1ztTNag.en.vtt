00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210 

four<00:00:00.210> times<00:00:00.450> this<00:00:00.750> time<00:00:01.020> I<00:00:01.319> know<00:00:01.949> it<00:00:02.040> says

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
four times this time I know it says

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.130 
four times this time I know it says
ratings<00:00:02.669> particles<00:00:03.149> here<00:00:03.360> but<00:00:03.840> it's<00:00:03.959> really

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
ratings particles here but it's really

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.590 
ratings particles here but it's really
talking<00:00:04.589> about<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.890> importance<00:00:05.509> even<00:00:06.509> though

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
talking about the importance even though

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.070 
talking about the importance even though
it<00:00:06.660> says<00:00:06.839> radiance<00:00:07.230> particles<00:00:08.780> so<00:00:09.780> we've<00:00:09.960> got

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
it says radiance particles so we've got

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.390 
it says radiance particles so we've got
30,000<00:00:10.920> 309<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.940> pour<00:00:12.570> tons<00:00:12.840> here<00:00:13.230> but<00:00:14.099> we<00:00:14.219> do

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
30,000 309 and pour tons here but we do

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.150 
30,000 309 and pour tons here but we do
have<00:00:14.610> 500<00:00:15.450> raised<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.960> those<00:00:16.139> 500<00:00:16.770> raised<00:00:16.920> have

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
have 500 raised in those 500 raised have

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160 
have 500 raised in those 500 raised have
to<00:00:17.310> work<00:00:17.490> with<00:00:17.910> those<00:00:18.119> 30,000<00:00:18.869> radiance

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
to work with those 30,000 radiance

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.670 
to work with those 30,000 radiance
particles<00:00:19.710> or<00:00:20.000> importance<00:00:21.000> i<00:00:21.150> should<00:00:21.330> say<00:00:21.680> all

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
particles or importance i should say all

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.630 
particles or importance i should say all
right<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.010> what<00:00:23.130> I'm<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.369> do<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.550> I'm

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
right so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.580 
right so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> pause<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.150> video<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.570> I'll<00:00:25.350> come

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
going to pause the video and I'll come

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.019 
going to pause the video and I'll come
back<00:00:25.619> when<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.250> finished<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.699> we'll

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
back when this is finished and we'll

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.259 
back when this is finished and we'll
compare<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.539> two<00:00:27.660> images<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.260> see<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.680> got

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
compare the two images and see we got

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.849 
compare the two images and see we got
all<00:00:30.269> right<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:31.109> finished<00:00:31.289> let<00:00:31.650> me<00:00:31.740> go

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
all right it just finished let me go

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.709 
all right it just finished let me go
ahead<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.099> hide<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.820> output<00:00:33.210> window<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
ahead and hide the output window and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.500 
ahead and hide the output window and
whoa<00:00:34.500> look<00:00:34.920> what<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.160> got<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.640> very<00:00:36.300> very

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
whoa look what we got here very very

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.500 
whoa look what we got here very very
interesting<00:00:36.840> all<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:38.219> artifacting<00:00:38.879> went

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
interesting all the artifacting went

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.299 
interesting all the artifacting went
away<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:40.200> have<00:00:40.379> ourselves<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.829> pretty<00:00:41.040> clean

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
away we have ourselves a pretty clean

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.069 
away we have ourselves a pretty clean
render<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.790> mean<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> only<00:00:42.300> thing<00:00:42.420> left<00:00:42.750> now<00:00:42.870> is

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
render I mean the only thing left now is

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.560 
render I mean the only thing left now is
to<00:00:43.140> increase<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.710> anti-aliasing<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.670> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
to increase the anti-aliasing and and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.760 
to increase the anti-aliasing and and
that's<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.899> we'll<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.230> ourselves<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.649> good

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
that's it we'll have ourselves a good

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.130 
that's it we'll have ourselves a good
render<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.420> got<00:00:48.870> rid<00:00:49.110> of

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
render so we can see that we got rid of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.410 
render so we can see that we got rid of
all<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> artifacting<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.309> them<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.120> edges

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
all the artifacting on them on the edges

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.779 
all the artifacting on them on the edges
of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> floor<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.500> ceiling<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.190> most

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
of the floor the ceiling and most

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.610 
of the floor the ceiling and most
definitely<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> most<00:00:54.719> notable<00:00:55.230> difference

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
definitely the most notable difference

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.010 
definitely the most notable difference
is<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.070> walls<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.640> walls<00:00:56.820> are<00:00:57.030> not<00:00:57.210> filled

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
is the walls the walls are not filled

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.689 
is the walls the walls are not filled
with<00:00:58.230> all<00:00:58.410> those<00:00:58.530> artifacts<00:00:59.160> from<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> fort

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
with all those artifacts from the fort

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.540 
with all those artifacts from the fort
and<00:01:00.260> surprisingly<00:01:01.260> enough<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.949> render<00:01:02.340> time

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and surprisingly enough this render time

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.030 
and surprisingly enough this render time
was<00:01:02.820> only<00:01:03.180> two<00:01:03.420> minutes<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.960> 24<00:01:04.589> seconds

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
was only two minutes and 24 seconds

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.550 
was only two minutes and 24 seconds
interesting<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.630> here's<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> before<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
interesting so here's the before and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.820 
interesting so here's the before and
here's<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> after<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:10.140> before<00:01:10.470> render

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
here's the after and the before render

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.640 
here's the after and the before render
it<00:01:11.250> took<00:01:11.549> longer<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.150> render<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.350> quality

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
it took longer to render and the quality

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.460 
it took longer to render and the quality
was<00:01:14.340> unacceptable<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.420> quality<00:01:15.900> was<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.259> bad

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
was unacceptable the quality was so bad

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.859 
was unacceptable the quality was so bad
that<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.979> was<00:01:17.009> totally<00:01:17.520> unacceptable<00:01:17.939> has<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
that it was totally unacceptable has to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
that it was totally unacceptable has to
be<00:01:18.990> thrown<00:01:19.229> away<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.490> work<00:01:20.640> has<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.000> be

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
be thrown away and the work has to be

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.380 
be thrown away and the work has to be
done<00:01:21.119> again<00:01:21.710> with<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> new<00:01:23.070> render<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.060> time

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
done again with the new render the time

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.260 
done again with the new render the time
for<00:01:24.780> rendering<00:01:25.110> was<00:01:25.409> faster<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.400> quality

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
for rendering was faster and the quality

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.020 
for rendering was faster and the quality
was<00:01:27.479> better<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:29.310> when<00:01:29.909> you're

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
was better so as you can see when you're

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.520 
was better so as you can see when you're
familiar<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.479> these<00:01:30.659> settings<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.320> you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
familiar with these settings and you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.039 
familiar with these settings and you
know<00:01:31.619> exactly<00:01:31.770> how<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> tweak<00:01:32.970> them<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.390> what

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
know exactly how to tweak them and what

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.109 
know exactly how to tweak them and what
to<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.590> them<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:35.850> ahead<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
to do with them you can go ahead and

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.690 
to do with them you can go ahead and
squeeze<00:01:36.540> out<00:01:36.810> not<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.409> quality<00:01:38.250> but

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
squeeze out not just quality but

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.550 
squeeze out not just quality but
performance<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.479> render<00:01:39.900> out<00:01:40.020> faster

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
performance you can render out faster

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.880 
performance you can render out faster
and<00:01:40.740> better<00:01:41.960> when<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.079> know<00:01:43.200> exactly<00:01:43.320> what<00:01:43.799> it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and better when you know exactly what it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
and better when you know exactly what it
is<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.040> you're<00:01:44.310> doing<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> trick

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
is that you're doing here so the trick

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.050 
is that you're doing here so the trick
is<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.110> use<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.740> least<00:01:46.920> amount<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.369> port<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.939> as

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
density in a low number of race so

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.820 
density in a low number of race so
that's<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.340> trick<00:02:47.610> low<00:02:48.270> density<00:02:48.810> just<00:02:49.590> enough

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
that's the trick low density just enough

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.320 
that's the trick low density just enough

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
important and keep that in mind ok so
