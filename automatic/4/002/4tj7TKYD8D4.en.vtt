00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.320
 commented commentary do nothing 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.640
 because otherwise it's a bit like that 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.990
 complicated if I imagine this here 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.229
 I hold my nose and then hardly anything 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.500

 I have no real plan here 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.490

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.700

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.470
 only when you play it right, yes 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.100

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.729
 I have already heard loading screen 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.579

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.810
 but well the few seconds we can 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.270
