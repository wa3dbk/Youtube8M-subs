00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.069
 make this video to introduce you to 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.660
 house char so and we will need 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.969
 a bottle of water that I already have 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:20.450
 filled paper straw nodes 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:22.820
 of aluminum the cap a box of the 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.260
 hood of a bump two cigs a 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.630
 box but very big and there holes at 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.390
 background and that's all so we'll start 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:41.420
 so the bottle you fill it 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:46.129
 you make a hole and in the cork 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:58.579
 so we'll take a first 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:01:06.250
 straw we go to the child if in the 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:06.250
 test stopper pretty much 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:19.790
 yes a little bit like that so there he 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:22.340
 must close it has left a small 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.500
 tip of the straw by the thing 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.480
 frankly I do not come here I put 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.700
 a little piece of brown tape is 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.140
 to be able to block it in the hole 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.990
 passion of the hole I do them a little bit more 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.060
 Too big, here you are 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.310
 we can already see you have it done 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:50.360
 bubbles that we aspire so here already 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:55.030
 the face the bottom so after me I put 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.030
 the bath cap 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.720
 so you can see on the bottle 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:26.600
 here I take my box and I push it 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:30.739
 on it and so there they do so so 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.560
 above the box we will put the 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.320
 tobacco so suddenly the birds that 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.700
 prefer a fresu multifruits you 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.810
 take a piece of dali mines from 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.890
 pieces of aluminum and you have 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.270

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.040
