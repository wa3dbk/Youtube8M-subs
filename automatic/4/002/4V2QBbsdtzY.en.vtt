need to reduce the shutter speed a
larger<00:03:14.629> aperture<00:03:15.049> will<00:03:15.200> give<00:03:15.349> you<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.470> softer

larger aperture will give you a softer

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.440 
larger aperture will give you a softer
background<00:03:16.280> whereas<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.700> smaller<00:03:17.030> one<00:03:17.180> and
