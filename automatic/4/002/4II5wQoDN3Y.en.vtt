down this two goes into my mcp 655 pump

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.799 
down this two goes into my mcp 655 pump
from<00:00:45.300> there<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.750> goes<00:00:46.020> up<00:00:46.320> into<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.789> back<00:00:48.030> out

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
from there it goes up into the back out

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.400 
from there it goes up into the back out
of<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.289> tube<00:00:49.620> into<00:00:49.980> my<00:00:50.730> quad<00:00:51.120> radiator<00:00:52.050> up

here<00:00:53.090> which<00:00:54.090> cools<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.719> water<00:00:54.930> down<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.289> bit<00:00:55.620> or

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
here which cools the water down a bit or

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.709 
here which cools the water down a bit or
it<00:00:56.280> heads<00:00:56.520> down<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.210> too<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.510> goes

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it heads down this too and then it goes

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.960 
it heads down this too and then it goes

right there is a flow meter a lot of

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.609 
right there is a flow meter a lot of
bills<00:01:21.000> these<00:01:21.330> days<00:01:21.630> don't<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.229> flow<00:01:22.590> meter

and<00:03:05.150> some<00:03:06.150> UV<00:03:06.599> lights<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.739> see<00:03:11.010> it

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.640 

front<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.740> case<00:03:18.980> here<00:03:20.890> nothing<00:03:21.890> too<00:03:22.070> fancy

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
front of the case here nothing too fancy

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.930 
front of the case here nothing too fancy
that's<00:03:24.650> so<00:03:24.980> that's<00:03:25.220> pretty<00:03:25.550> much<00:03:25.640> it<00:03:26.090> um

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
that's so that's pretty much it um

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
that's so that's pretty much it um
eventually<00:03:28.940> i'll<00:03:29.240> do<00:03:29.900> an<00:03:30.260> upgrade<00:03:31.960> probably

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
eventually i'll do an upgrade probably

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.420 
eventually i'll do an upgrade probably
for<00:03:33.320> a<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:34.430> new<00:03:34.580> p67<00:03:35.390> motherboard<00:03:36.170> and

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
for a the new p67 motherboard and

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.210 
for a the new p67 motherboard and
intel's<00:03:37.430> new<00:03:37.580> sandy<00:03:38.180> bridge<00:03:38.620> still<00:03:39.620> debating

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
intel's new sandy bridge still debating

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.540 
intel's new sandy bridge still debating
between<00:03:40.370> an<00:03:40.970> i7<00:03:42.490> 2600<00:03:43.490> k<00:03:43.670> or<00:03:43.910> i5<00:03:44.290> 2500<00:03:45.290> k<00:03:45.560> but

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
between an i7 2600 k or i5 2500 k but

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.300 
between an i7 2600 k or i5 2500 k but
most<00:03:46.910> likely<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:48.320> 2500<00:03:49.190> k<00:03:50.350> for<00:03:51.350> its<00:03:51.500> price<00:03:51.950> and

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
most likely the 2500 k for its price and

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.000 
most likely the 2500 k for its price and
performance<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:54.130> i<00:03:55.130> will<00:03:55.310> also<00:03:55.340> be<00:03:57.010> replacing

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
performance and i will also be replacing

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.970 
performance and i will also be replacing
that<00:03:58.220> reservoir<00:03:58.700> with<00:03:59.120> coolants<00:04:00.020> dual<00:04:00.739> bay

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
that reservoir with coolants dual bay

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.280 
that reservoir with coolants dual bay
res<00:04:01.630> which<00:04:02.630> supports<00:04:03.560> two<00:04:03.830> of<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.420> mCP<00:04:05.420> 655

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
res which supports two of the mCP 655

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.760 
res which supports two of the mCP 655
pump<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:07.220> you'll<00:04:07.430> definitely<00:04:08.030> see<00:04:08.330> a<00:04:09.080> change

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
pump so you'll definitely see a change

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.490 
pump so you'll definitely see a change
in<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.130> water<00:04:10.370> loop<00:04:11.860> so<00:04:13.870> yeah<00:04:14.870> i'll<00:04:15.260> make<00:04:15.470> a

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
in the water loop so yeah i'll make a

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.599 
in the water loop so yeah i'll make a
video<00:04:15.739> on<00:04:16.130> that<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:18.709> before<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.070> go<00:04:19.370> I've<00:04:19.579> got

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
video on that so before I go I've got

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.490 
video on that so before I go I've got
some<00:04:19.970> reading<00:04:20.390> some<00:04:20.690> temperature<00:04:21.080> readings

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
some reading some temperature readings

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.500 
some reading some temperature readings

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
see Precision's got gtx 580 @ 960 and

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.790 
see Precision's got gtx 580 @ 960 and
here's<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:38.750> recent<00:04:39.160> 3dmark<00:04:40.160> Vantage<00:04:40.669> run

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
here's a recent 3dmark Vantage run

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.090 
here's a recent 3dmark Vantage run
there's<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:43.040> score<00:04:43.990> so<00:04:44.990> that's<00:04:45.470> about<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:45.710> I

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
there's the score so that's about it I

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.140 
there's the score so that's about it I
hope<00:04:46.640> you<00:04:46.790> liked<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.120> video<00:04:49.120> thanks<00:04:50.120> for
