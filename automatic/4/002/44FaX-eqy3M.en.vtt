 give away to someone 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.650
 Well, in general, I decided to make jam. 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.369
 for a long time as if nothing like cooked 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.380

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.380
 the good 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.150
 if anyone wants a pear to be like 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.750
 slices 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.600
 Here is such a not sugared and as if 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.379
 here she was so sweet 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.899
 remained and the jam does not seem so 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.100
 what was 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:48.059
 I have so many slices right now 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:52.530
 tell you how to do it means I 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.660
 cut cleaned pear point rub and so 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.280
 not much carefully on basically so 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.109
 cleaned the rub point and cut the slices and 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:06.210
 put off means big bowl 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.460
 further separate boiled syrup means 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.780
 per pound cleaned pear pounds 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.820
 sugar and a glass of water and boil the syrup 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.380
 boil the sugar to dissolve and 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.549
 water boiled and boiling this syrup 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.270
 throw pears and turn off the syrup from the fire 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.869
 1 lemon well, you can or squeeze the juice I 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.650
 cut cut my daughters 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.650
 and let her put all the costs in this 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.840
 hot syrup will cool three 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.329
 four five hours in the meantime 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.130
 cool well it all froze it 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.340
 says that pears in this syrup 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.409
 Should pro hot syrup soak but 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.079
 he seems to be no longer hot but he 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.409
 Well, that's such a hot little course 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.180
 because vrusha 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.240
 the cool syrup of course has already cooled 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.530
 Well, it cools to the end of the pear 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.880
 soaked in syrup 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.860
 then boil for five minutes when 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.310
 starts to boil and boil at 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.250
 boiling for about five minutes fails and 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.460
 turn off 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.150
 cool again again, turn on for five minutes 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.090
 boiled 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.040
 cools again it says that she 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.620
 when cooled down it is typed in syrup and 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.890
 There are still whole slices and 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.560
 the third time boil for about 10 minutes and everything and 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.040
 this is the end of boiling pears and 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.459
 put in jars and close the pears 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:41.200
 It turns out in such whole slices 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:46.600
 it will be like in such a syrup syrup 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:52.600
 I will be so nice daughters well 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:55.030
 how could such a jam be like that 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.180
 what I cook and see what we have 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.220
 it will turn out I have a pear 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.810
 I also went over the same to some hedgehogs 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.640
 now she starts to turn yellow and 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.310
 then she cleaned it of peel here and there. 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.700
 of course she starts to raise it I 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.940
 went over the second time, too, I 'll clean the second 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.830
 once she make jam and here she is 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.380
 when she already starts very well 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.810
 keep up very well begin 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:31.090
 keep up here when she lies at home here 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:35.019
 such she already becomes such she 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.260
 it becomes juicy and juicy juicy with it 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.190
 sorry here juice flows new she 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.190
 so honey 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.110
 honey honey pear 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.900
 she is in a tree in such a state not 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.660
 it is the kind of variety that keeps it up 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.880
 here to pluck another in such a green 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.829
 state still in such a green and home she 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:06.120
 lies in the midst of mastitis sort of some 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:06.120
 winter then she will yes yes have time 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.450
 the battery sits down and here it becomes 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.900
 such a soft and juicy 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.049
 here is such a straight it is a sock non- flowing 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.970
 everything is so straight I crushed a little and that's it 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.000
 she drips with it here so that's it 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.360
 juicy here is my state of course 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.680
 kush 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.110
 though of course you have to make jam well 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.780
 here until half ready when she 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.599
 such here came of course you can when where 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.330
 it may not be green at all but 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:43.060
 her middle, if she is green at all 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.610
 the middle is very tight you can not cut 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.860
 very little flesh cut off 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.050
 so of course it's better for jam when 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.389
 it already comes up on the half not 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.580
 very softly 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.550
 states she is still solid so firmly 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.259
 a little soft here it will be the very thing 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:08.860
 it's good to make jam with it 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:11.289
 here at this and therefore turns jam 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.360
 per kilogram with per kilogram cleaned 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.779
 pear kilogram of sugar a glass of water 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.060
 make syrup and syrup 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:22.090
 soak the pear and then cook 3 times 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:26.349
 cooking for five minutes all the pear will be 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:29.039
 ready all my dear friends enjoy 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.039
