periodically along the way I don't know
if<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.960> right<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.260> I've

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
if you can see this right here I've

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.399 
if you can see this right here I've
driven<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:12.080> there<00:01:13.080> 3<00:01:13.619> foot<00:01:14.509> 1/2<00:01:15.509> inch<00:01:15.840> rebar

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
driven in there 3 foot 1/2 inch rebar

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.469 
driven in there 3 foot 1/2 inch rebar
pieces<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.009> rebar<00:01:17.189> we've<00:01:17.640> driven<00:01:17.909> them<00:01:18.180> into

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
pieces of rebar we've driven them into

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.499 
pieces of rebar we've driven them into
the<00:01:18.600> ground<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.200> we've<00:01:19.860> used<00:01:20.159> some<00:01:20.580> strapping

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the ground and we've used some strapping

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.510 
the ground and we've used some strapping
on<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> backside<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.740> secure<00:01:23.310> those

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
on the backside of it to secure those

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.010 
on the backside of it to secure those
also<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.930> two<00:01:25.140> by<00:01:25.320> fours<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.830> run<00:01:26.009> along

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
also to the two by fours that run along

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.910 
also to the two by fours that run along
hopefully<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.170> helps<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> bit<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
hopefully that helps with a bit of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.289 
hopefully that helps with a bit of
stability<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.430> don't<00:01:29.579> want<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> thing<00:01:29.939> going

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
stability I don't want the thing going

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.920 
stability I don't want the thing going

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
not straight as an arrow but it's I

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.860 
not straight as an arrow but it's I
think<00:03:42.379> good<00:03:42.620> enough<00:03:42.860> and<00:03:43.459> I've<00:03:44.420> attached

shut into it holds it for now but I'm

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.460 
shut into it holds it for now but I'm
not<00:04:31.650> real<00:04:31.889> comfortable<00:04:32.070> with<00:04:33.080> that<00:04:34.080> being<00:04:34.350> the

on down you can see the inside where

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.530 
on down you can see the inside where
we've<00:04:40.229> run<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:41.340> baseboard<00:04:41.910> two<00:04:42.150> by<00:04:42.300> four

baseboards you can see where we've

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.430 
baseboards you can see where we've

purlins hopefully that's going to hold
it<00:05:09.870> up<00:05:09.990> basically<00:05:10.560> I'm<00:05:10.650> worried<00:05:10.919> about<00:05:11.039> a<00:05:11.100> snow

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.970 

we<00:05:14.690> can<00:05:14.840> just<00:05:14.990> walk<00:05:15.170> down<00:05:15.440> with<00:05:15.530> take<00:05:15.710> a<00:05:15.740> quick

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
we can just walk down with take a quick

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
look at the other end and that's about

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.960 
look at the other end and that's about
it<00:05:17.570> for<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.140> video<00:05:18.320> but<00:05:18.740> you<00:05:19.490> can<00:05:19.520> see<00:05:19.850> the

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
it for the video but you can see the

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.020 
it for the video but you can see the
raised<00:05:20.180> beds<00:05:20.510> that<00:05:20.660> I'd<00:05:20.900> mean<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:22.430> center<00:05:22.820> bed

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
raised beds that I'd mean the center bed

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.550 
raised beds that I'd mean the center bed
was<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.240> first<00:05:23.540> one<00:05:23.750> I've<00:05:23.900> made<00:05:24.140> that<00:05:24.410> was

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
was the first one I've made that was

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.230 
was the first one I've made that was
made<00:05:24.800> with<00:05:25.010> some<00:05:25.190> scraps<00:05:25.550> from<00:05:25.730> wood<00:05:26.000> they're

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
made with some scraps from wood they're

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.480 
made with some scraps from wood they're
really<00:05:26.540> floor<00:05:26.840> joyce's<00:05:27.440> they<00:05:28.010> were<00:05:28.130> scrapped

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
really floor joyce's they were scrapped

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.290 
really floor joyce's they were scrapped
out<00:05:28.730> I<00:05:29.090> took<00:05:29.420> on<00:05:30.730> particle<00:05:31.730> board<00:05:31.940> in<00:05:32.180> between

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
out I took on particle board in between

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.000 
out I took on particle board in between
I'm<00:05:32.750> not<00:05:32.900> sure<00:05:33.110> how<00:05:33.320> many<00:05:33.380> years<00:05:33.710> that's<00:05:33.950> going

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
I'm not sure how many years that's going

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.380 
I'm not sure how many years that's going
to<00:05:34.190> give<00:05:34.340> me<00:05:34.490> but<00:05:34.640> it<00:05:34.790> probably<00:05:34.940> gave<00:05:35.210> me<00:05:35.330> a

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
to give me but it probably gave me a

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.660 
to give me but it probably gave me a
year<00:05:35.660> or<00:05:35.750> two<00:05:35.900> anyway

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
year or two anyway

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.880 
year or two anyway
the<00:05:38.000> second<00:05:38.360> one<00:05:38.480> I<00:05:38.510> made<00:05:38.810> was<00:05:39.110> rough<00:05:39.350> cut<00:05:39.620> one

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
the second one I made was rough cut one

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.210 
the second one I made was rough cut one
by<00:05:40.070> twelve<00:05:40.750> that<00:05:41.750> whole<00:05:41.990> set-up<00:05:42.530> cost<00:05:42.560> me

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
by twelve that whole set-up cost me

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.710 
by twelve that whole set-up cost me
right<00:05:43.520> around<00:05:43.720> $40<00:05:44.720> for<00:05:44.960> wood<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:47.300> other<00:05:47.480> one

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
right around $40 for wood the other one

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.370 
right around $40 for wood the other one
was<00:05:47.960> two<00:05:48.560> by<00:05:48.740> tens<00:05:49.070> that<00:05:49.460> I<00:05:49.490> tried<00:05:49.910> I<00:05:50.240> got<00:05:51.170> those

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
was two by tens that I tried I got those

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.000 
was two by tens that I tried I got those
I<00:05:51.440> believe<00:05:51.860> it<00:05:52.010> Lowe's<00:05:52.630> that's<00:05:53.630> about<00:05:53.930> $35<00:05:54.830> for

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
I believe it Lowe's that's about $35 for

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.550 
I believe it Lowe's that's about $35 for
that<00:05:55.130> setup<00:05:55.750> finally<00:05:56.750> I've<00:05:56.870> decided<00:05:57.260> I've

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
that setup finally I've decided I've

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.170 
that setup finally I've decided I've
gone<00:05:57.770> to<00:05:58.250> rough<00:05:58.850> cut<00:05:58.880> 1<00:05:59.660> by<00:05:59.870> 6<00:06:00.370> oak<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.670> poplar

we found out in the woods so we've been
hitting<00:06:28.860> that<00:06:28.890> mother<00:06:29.250> lode<00:06:29.340> for<00:06:29.760> a<00:06:29.820> little

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
hitting that mother lode for a little

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.810 
hitting that mother lode for a little
while<00:06:31.010> that<00:06:32.010> basically<00:06:32.970> takes<00:06:33.240> the<00:06:33.540> end<00:06:33.660> of<00:06:33.810> it

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
while that basically takes the end of it

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.730 
while that basically takes the end of it
now<00:06:35.820> this<00:06:36.060> hoop<00:06:36.510> house<00:06:36.780> here<00:06:37.110> costs

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.040 

approximately<00:06:40.740> about<00:06:40.880> $500<00:06:41.880> so<00:06:42.090> far<00:06:42.390> maybe

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
approximately about $500 so far maybe

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.330 
approximately about $500 so far maybe
not<00:06:43.290> quite<00:06:43.440> as<00:06:43.650> much<00:06:43.680> but<00:06:45.980> it's<00:06:46.980> going<00:06:47.130> to<00:06:47.250> end

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
not quite as much but it's going to end

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.830 
not quite as much but it's going to end
up<00:06:47.400> being<00:06:47.610> cheaper<00:06:47.880> than<00:06:48.180> the<00:06:48.270> kits<00:06:48.510> whether

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
up being cheaper than the kits whether

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.660 
up being cheaper than the kits whether
it'll<00:06:49.050> be<00:06:49.200> as<00:06:49.320> good<00:06:49.560> as<00:06:49.710> the<00:06:49.830> kits<00:06:50.070> I'm<00:06:50.490> not

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
it'll be as good as the kits I'm not

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.530 
it'll be as good as the kits I'm not
sure<00:06:50.940> but<00:06:51.240> it<00:06:51.360> is<00:06:51.510> a<00:06:51.540> do-it-yourself<00:06:51.900> project

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:53.540 
sure but it is a do-it-yourself project

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.900 
sure but it is a do-it-yourself project
I'm<00:06:54.540> not<00:06:54.840> an<00:06:55.050> expert<00:06:55.320> builder<00:06:55.770> I<00:06:56.190> do<00:06:56.400> have<00:06:56.670> some

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
I'm not an expert builder I do have some

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.790 
I'm not an expert builder I do have some
idea<00:06:57.300> doing<00:06:57.660> stuff<00:06:57.900> and<00:06:58.110> I<00:06:58.170> think<00:06:58.230> we<00:06:58.470> build<00:06:58.710> it

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
idea doing stuff and I think we build it

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.910 
idea doing stuff and I think we build it
pretty<00:06:59.010> sturdy<00:06:59.340> but<00:07:00.380> this<00:07:01.380> is<00:07:01.560> something<00:07:01.770> that

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:01.920 
pretty sturdy but this is something that

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.490 
pretty sturdy but this is something that
you<00:07:02.040> can<00:07:02.190> accomplish
