00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 well let's start let's do it in 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.540
 a wet hair to facilitate the 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.010
 we have drawn a line of ear to 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.759
 ear and we have left all the part of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.759
 front loose back a ponytail 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:17.160
 we bow our heads and let's make one 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.279
 a partition you take a little bit of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.890
 hair combed it up and what 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.680
 let's divide between two once what 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.230
 we have divided between two we are going to 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.450
 cross this hair with a normal knot 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.970
 we cross it over 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.550
 and we pass it below when we 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:41.650
 we have here let's continue I'm going to 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:45.730
 catch a new lock so he combs it jce 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.489
 with patience, do not hurry , comb it 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.540
 jce and this lock that is loose let's go 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:56.170
 to join these two and we 're going to go back to 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:00.160
 cross over and below and 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.970
 we press continue we are going to comb 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.700
 combing little by little 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.130
 well and when you have it here what 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.659
 we hold with these two fingers 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.619
 let's keep taking a new lock 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:21.490
 well more or less so that the line is 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:24.710
 more or less straight and we comb this lock 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.410
 and when we have it more or less here what 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.020
 you have hairstyle we take the two million 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:34.050
 that we have crossed before we passed through 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:39.210
 above and below 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:42.330
 we do the knot like that and we're going to go 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.540
 doing exactly the same thing 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.540
 little while 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.689
 and when you have it, comb it and throw it 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:08.130
 jce backwards you catch it we cross it 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.050
 above and below or try 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.209
 take it all the hair so that we do not 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.120
 these loose projects remain that 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.819
 Sometimes it is inevitable because we have the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.450
 shorter bangs or we have some 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:25.130
 hair that we have more loose and 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.130
 good and keep doing all the same 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.640
 when you have it here what you can 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.640
 do is do some more knot so that 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.300
 give a little tighter this is 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.610
 optional and when you have here the lock 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.410
 good what you have to do is 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.890
 finish fixing it and then the hair we 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:13.220
 it will be all over dry this part 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.020
 it's better to do it in the wet because good 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.970
 It will be easier to tighten and stay 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.190
 better finished and you can even put it 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.640
 a little bit of wax or a little bit of 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:27.340
 combine to make it tight 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.340
 well, this is all
