00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:10.950
 whiskey punkt.de meeting point fine 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.500
 spirits welcome to the whiskey 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.240
 store the meeting place in front of a ghost 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.720
 The distillery Hoben belongs to the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.520
 world famous classic painting of scotland 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.020
 and the 14 year old was with the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.460
 appear this series 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.359
 end of the 80s of the last 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.590
 Century world famous, however 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.539
 he lies in the shadow of his big ones 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.850
 two brothers in this series 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.940
 storage volume talisker the one strong 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.670
 part of this single painting from the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.899
 classic of scotland series occupy the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.969
 above lies not only spatially in between 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:48.450
 it is located in the western highlands 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.309
 the coast and lies between the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.410
 Main region of Speyside in Scotland 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.440
 and the islands where the strong malls 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.270
 be made and so is the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.329
 above with its taste about 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.800
 in between he is not a soft space 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.870
 but haider is not yet 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.479
 tough Allawis go 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.890
 he lies in between and that's exactly what he does 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.130
 his charm lies with his 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.780
 alcohol strength of 43 percent in between 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.799
 lies with his age of 14 years 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.500
 in between not young 12 years and also 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.049
 not as old as some whiskey of all 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.900
 the at 16 or 20 years but clearly 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.270
 older is up there with a lot 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.290
 interesting high bottle so he 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.240
 on every shelf in every bar noticeable 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.430
 and they should if they find somewhere 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.229
 really try 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.650
 It is an enrichment of the flavors 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.650
 sweetheart 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.340
 a 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:58.039
 equal to more than the typical highlands 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:00.409
 smoke aromatic smoke but not so 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.479
 that he now fill the whole room 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:07.159
 that smoke would be in the air 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.069
 would be a lot less but more 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.980
 as the typical spawn whiskeys have 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:18.230
 and that's exactly what the euro is for 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:21.620
 you have to do a bit 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.269
 Smell around behind all the smoke and 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.000
 a delicate alcoholic red now 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.350
 to feel more 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.060
 but that's where they come from 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.680
 fruits some people dense the upper one 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.680
 some salt and I can do it 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.060
 not found 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.840
 I can not find the sea from 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.530
 which should come from these salts or from 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.170
 I find the frequent smoky aroma 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.420
 relatively did 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:58.810
 I find the fruits but salt salt 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.810
 I do not think so let's try it 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:19.620
 sparkling picture 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.409
 it may go out the nose maybe 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.969
 Now you can feel the salt 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.069
 It is a tiny thing a distinct one 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.260
 fun if someone with salt 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:32.099
 it is supposed to be associated with it 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.890
 then it is now as I am for 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.680
 this drive for the aroma that the 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:42.680
 palate rises is the whiskey on the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:46.409
 tongue and in the mouth surprisingly soft 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.980
 Slight dryness taped up a bit 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.750
 on the palate 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.780
 there is a delicate bit of spice on it 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:58.500
 the departure is longer there 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.769
 mouth esophagus studies micro die 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.169
 Esophagus aim warm down more 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:09.329
 when you get from a highland whiskey 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:12.150
 and now where you turn to the smoke 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:19.039
 the flavor used has now come to him 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.039
 aroma also lighter fruits like limes 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.720
 maybe a sour apple hard too 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:40.350
 definitely say early 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:45.330
 problems again not oily relative 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:50.729
 slightly fluid dryness 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:54.180
 tip heat in the esophagus easier 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.979
 Smoke will be delicious in any case 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.180
 more than a typical highland whiskey 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:03.720
 the date but not so I need 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.240
 not so serious not as cheap as 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.229
 in alain wiss, thank you so much 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.940
