00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:08.640
 so hello hi to you it screams by 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.599
 boom and today I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.680
 how do we make a word 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:21.980
 but in a way a little bit to say 3d so 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.980
 first if it takes a black myth end this 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.430
 so first it depends what wanted 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.579
 write me there I'm going to fry to a lol 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.579
 so I did a kind of a curve 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.780
 then I do that and then I made a 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.239
 short in the same way but I want 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.309
 to say this one she goes lower and lower 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.199
 that she is the other then I do that 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.389
 that and I join so how she 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.440
 normal except that after I'm going to do 

00:00:54.389 --> 00:01:01.699
 something a little special that's it 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:06.990
 I'm still making a curve 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:09.210
 I do this I do it here I take 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.039
 and so that's her end she's three 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.450
 dimensions but there it is not yet 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.770
 very very well then what are we going to do 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.770
 we're going to put blacks here 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.220
 why it's better I do not speak 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:36.720
 a lot because you have to me 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:40.770
 focuses on being it because that's it 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.770
 so here we go well I blackened 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.899
 according to if you want you can pass 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.640
 what I'm going to do is I'm going 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.350
 cut and I'll join you when I get 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.479
 finished hockey has more happy 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.909
 so that's it it's a she I find 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:09.569
 that it becomes pretty good then for 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:13.060
 to do the top we do a curve and we 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.620
 continue finally a round 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.730
 we all put Lyon made a round 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.830
 so that's a big enough after that 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.099
 where the party like that must be like 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.099
 this too 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.410
 and then after you understand here that we 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:38.220
 do like that everything does like that in 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.220
 nobody would prefer to do like that 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:47.980
 if not better and I blackened and I you 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.269
 so find out as soon as I finish at the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.850
 happier so that's it I finished I 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.250
 find that it's good enough so we 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:03.329
 will do the second she so from the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.329
 same way 1 1 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:28.190
 here and so I start to blacken 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:32.210
 so let's go back here 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:36.830
 find that it does not hurt so ben 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.030
 so that can be good now 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.630
 what we can do to make still 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.700
 more gay so it's first I do 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.530
 something I cut it down it's done 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.550
 so in fact what we will do is 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.980
 I call it me a gas bomb attack 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.950
 rather like unemployment 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.190
 I invite you to look is rather 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.190
 so that's 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:12.380
 So here we do it like that 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:18.560
 something like that here after 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:20.480
 do two loops here we join them 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.510
 it's a little fast done right or wrong 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:28.490
 capital so years and finally a face 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:33.370
 pretty basic our hearts a mourning 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:39.200
 deep in us shovel that so here's 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:45.530
 that's pretty basic and then we're going 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:47.590
 to make his hand against the hands of 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:55.850
 saab or your attacks are more vulgar 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:57.190
 so that's it's weird hands 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:06.500
 you do them as you want 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:11.570
 then what are you doing this and you 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:15.830
 frame so and in the end you 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.810
 join and that makes me I think that 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.280
 not bad 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.720
 that's all I had 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.400
 obviously show you can do that 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.900
 with all the letters of the alphabet and 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.930
 you can also decorate them by 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:31.250
 example by making a white halo 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.730
 where she like that so that makes a 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.750
 aureole 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.210
 so that's it if you do it and where of a 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.270
 side it takes the fate of the other too 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.790
 so here it is from what I had 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.620
 to show you good ben we end up 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.890
 for the next video so went to 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.890
 background
