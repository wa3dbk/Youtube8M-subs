00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.230
 make this beautiful aquatic flower 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.080
 super easy and also the technique of 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.650
 degraded and with sponge then 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.650
 get out of there 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.630
 first of all 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.930
 I spent two layers of enamel stone 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.489
 white color expect to dry and then 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.650
 increase the dishwashers 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.450
 so I cut a little square of her 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.540
 that I will use to make this decoration 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.710
 I took a layer of max enamel 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:02.720
 rope and then a layer of the 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.100
 dana rhyme and finally moves them through 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.200
 white color screen 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.650
 so that order a strange then 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.650
 other 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.289
 Now I'll get the sponge and I'll take it. 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.300
 from one side of the nail to the other 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.070
 I'm going up and down a little 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.530
 let things go much closer 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:30.950
 if you find it necessary to pass two 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:33.590
 Layers mix a drop of ink 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.080
 acrylic with white to leave a 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.890
 a little clearer and do some 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.570
 leaves on the nail 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.640
 the leaves are very irregular in santa 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.460
 claus port had I know I just slope the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.150
 brush and leads in the same direction from the center 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.979
 at the bottom and then with the title 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.780
 that dark green cape I do some 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.409
 details to give a little shade a 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.820
 little movement to the sheet 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.799
 now I'll get the pure glaze glaze 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.210
 and I'm going to start doing the 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.399
 petals with goleador brush makes the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.200
 long and regular petals do not 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.200
 forget the teacher is underwater 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:22.580
 It's a star-like forest and I hope 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.340
 the dead and here and get acrylic paint 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.470
 pink and I'll touch up flower leaving 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.950
 only the former death knights 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.950
 Appearing 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.850
 this environment is a little bit 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.940
 out of the ordinary and for me or I will 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.650
 black acrylic paint can not be 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.930
 also change for a yellow that I 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.270
 think fit cool also expect the 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.870
 motes and will be applied a layer of 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.870
 extra brightness 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.140

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.650
 I ended up taking the little things, little thing. 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.870
 little and the white votes was the lack 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.350

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.350
