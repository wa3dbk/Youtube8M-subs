and I think last year we raised upwards
of<00:01:14.710> two<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.640> four<00:01:15.759> thousand<00:01:16.119> dollars<00:01:16.420> for<00:01:17.140> them

of two to four thousand dollars for them

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:18.240 
of two to four thousand dollars for them
so<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:17.710> was<00:01:17.829> great

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
so that was great

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.639 
so that was great
I<00:01:18.280> went<00:01:18.970> around<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.479> fraternities<00:01:20.079> last<00:01:20.409> I

I went around to the fraternities last I

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.350 
I went around to the fraternities last I
think<00:01:20.770> was<00:01:20.950> last<00:01:21.159> week<00:01:21.399> telling<00:01:21.790> them<00:01:22.060> about

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
think was last week telling them about

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.789 
think was last week telling them about
the<00:01:22.689> event<00:01:22.960> a<00:01:23.110> lot<00:01:23.259> of<00:01:23.350> them<00:01:23.439> were<00:01:23.530> like<00:01:23.590> oh
