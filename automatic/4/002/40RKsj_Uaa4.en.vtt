to<00:02:45.400> think<00:02:45.640> by<00:02:45.910> this<00:02:45.970> time<00:02:46.150> it's<00:02:46.600> similar<00:02:47.110> to

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
to think by this time it's similar to

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.380 
to think by this time it's similar to
biological<00:02:48.070> warfare<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.700> why<00:02:49.090> would<00:02:49.270> they

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
biological warfare so why would they

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.270 
biological warfare so why would they

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
fused with us if we are such a great

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
threat to them all in all where can this

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.940 
threat to them all in all where can this
take<00:02:55.030> us<00:02:55.240> in<00:02:55.390> terms<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.810> our<00:02:55.960> co-op<00:02:56.320> mode<00:02:56.560> well

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
take us in terms of our co-op mode well

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.949 
take us in terms of our co-op mode well
it<00:02:57.400> leaves<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.730> lot<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:58.030> options<00:02:58.420> really<00:02:58.720> but<00:02:58.930> I

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
it leaves a lot of options really but I

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.930 
it leaves a lot of options really but I
think<00:02:59.350> one<00:02:59.680> that<00:02:59.860> is<00:02:59.950> most<00:03:00.070> fitting<00:03:00.340> would<00:03:00.820> be

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
think one that is most fitting would be

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.730 
think one that is most fitting would be
a<00:03:00.970> cyborg<00:03:01.360> takeover<00:03:02.110> play<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.380> out<00:03:02.470> how<00:03:02.680> you

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
a cyborg takeover play it out how you

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.230 
a cyborg takeover play it out how you

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.910 
the idea of being fused with humans
anymore<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.360> they<00:03:16.540> take<00:03:16.780> over<00:03:16.930> those<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.739> are

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
anymore so they take over those that are

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.680 
anymore so they take over those that are
infused<00:03:18.280> with<00:03:18.580> it<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.910> honestly<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.510> think

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
infused with it and honestly I think

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.870 
infused with it and honestly I think
that<00:03:20.020> this<00:03:20.080> we<00:03:20.260> have<00:03:20.410> very<00:03:20.620> plausible<00:03:21.130> idea<00:03:21.220> it

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
that this we have very plausible idea it

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.430 
that this we have very plausible idea it
would<00:03:21.970> be<00:03:22.090> like<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.239> horde<00:03:22.540> mode<00:03:22.720> like<00:03:22.989> zombies

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
would be like a horde mode like zombies

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.710 
would be like a horde mode like zombies
most<00:03:23.680> likely<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.670> me<00:03:24.820> it<00:03:24.970> just<00:03:25.000> seems<00:03:25.510> very

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
most likely and to me it just seems very

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.630 
most likely and to me it just seems very
plausible<00:03:26.470> what<00:03:26.830> gets<00:03:26.980> me<00:03:27.100> even<00:03:27.310> still<00:03:27.489> as<00:03:27.610> the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
plausible what gets me even still as the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.460 
plausible what gets me even still as the
fact<00:03:27.880> that<00:03:27.910> advanced<00:03:28.270> warfare<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:28.840> all<00:03:29.110> about

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
fact that advanced warfare is all about

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.229 
fact that advanced warfare is all about
ripping<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.860> game<00:03:30.040> from<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.580> headlines<00:03:31.000> and

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
ripping the game from the headlines and

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.000 
ripping the game from the headlines and
the<00:03:31.390> future<00:03:31.690> possibilities<00:03:32.410> well<00:03:32.709> there's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
the future possibilities well there's

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.410 
the future possibilities well there's
your<00:03:33.130> headline<00:03:33.280> it's<00:03:33.730> right<00:03:34.000> down<00:03:34.060> in<00:03:34.360> the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
your headline it's right down in the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.690 
your headline it's right down in the
description<00:03:34.510> below<00:03:34.930> even<00:03:35.799> better<00:03:35.950> still<00:03:36.280> it's

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
description below even better still it's

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.160 
description below even better still it's
just<00:03:37.060> around<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.420> same<00:03:37.630> time<00:03:37.660> frame<00:03:38.110> as

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
just around the same time frame as

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.530 
just around the same time frame as
advanced<00:03:38.799> warfare<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.400> coincidence<00:03:39.940> maybe

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
advanced warfare and coincidence maybe

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.449 
advanced warfare and coincidence maybe
maybe<00:03:41.049> not<00:03:41.170> but<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:41.890> is<00:03:41.980> all<00:03:42.130> for<00:03:42.310> me<00:03:42.430> today

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
maybe not but that is all for me today

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.890 
maybe not but that is all for me today
