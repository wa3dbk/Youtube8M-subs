00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.929
 and canada 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.090
 plus 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.720
 i 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.399
 hello hello to make this roll there's zinc 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.079
 or real base to decorate our 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.579
 Christmas cookies or the cookies that 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.000
 we want to do any day of the year 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.620
 let's occupy an egg white let's 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.079
 to occupy approximately 2 cups of 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.780
 sugar impalpable icing sugar or sugar 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.610
 flower with extend know and this is 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.340
 option before they can put a trickle of 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.200
 lemon juice 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.120
 can occupy an electric mixer or 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.980
 with the same hand they can do it 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.050
 if they want much more they have to go 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.930
 Doubling the amounts is approximate 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.640
 of sugar because you can 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.920
 need a little magician can also 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.869
 that occupy less now we go to the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.670
 preparation start beating these 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.670
 clear until you put a kite 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.340
 once you're there and we'll start adding you 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.170
 the sugar until we achieve the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.439
 consistency that we want for our 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.439
 pleasure 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.310
 well me since it costs a few drops of 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.520
 lemon and now let's check how 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.520
 is 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.960
 as you can see it stays firm it does not fall 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.000
 and this is the point so that it was not 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.790
 real it serves to delineate our 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.520
 cookies now I'm going to show you how 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.380
 you can clarify to clarify it and that we 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.240
 serve for the filling let's put 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.399
 water a teaspoon of go 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.399
 returning again we are returning 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.750
 the texture that has to be left for the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.120
 stuffing has to be like that doctor who 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.420
 you do this and what is falling 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.610
 It goes like getting into when others 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.280
 they mix it is ready, good, I already have 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.620
 I finished the royal addition of colors 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.130
 here they have the green that I started 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.319
 with liquid dyes so I did not put 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.610
 water but spine when you no longer believe as 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.800
 the color the intensity that I wanted 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.989
 I put a little more to exhaust to clarify 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.150
 the other little bit more then you 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.530
 I recommend that they occupy inger and 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.290
 if they do not do it like I did 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.030
 here is red green and white from 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.739
 then the infidel dye is much more 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.989
 intense color these are more key 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.330
 but good is what I have at the moment 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.400
 I hope you liked this recipe 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.470
 this easy way to make royal there 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.560
 without beginning they give me and that they stay very 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.000
 very nice your Christmas cookies or what 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.340
