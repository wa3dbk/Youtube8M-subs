00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
shadow virus there is basically a spot

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.620 
shadow virus there is basically a spot
where<00:00:28.500> there's<00:00:29.099> joy<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.789> keep<00:00:29.970> coming<00:00:30.240> out<00:00:30.359> and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
where there's joy to keep coming out and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.269 
where there's joy to keep coming out and
you<00:00:30.840> can<00:00:30.960> basically<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.470> use<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> force<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
you can basically just use a force on a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
a very good spot to do it in said the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.760 
a very good spot to do it in said the
level<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.600> blue<00:00:39.840> shadow<00:00:40.110> virus<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.649> can

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
level is blue shadow virus and you can

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.069 
level is blue shadow virus and you can
do<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.950> neither<00:00:41.100> story<00:00:41.460> or<00:00:41.700> free<00:00:42.000> play<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.840> I

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
do it neither story or free play but I

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.389 
do it neither story or free play but I
said<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.530> only<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> fourth<00:00:43.920> level<00:00:44.160> I've

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
said this is only the fourth level I've

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.400 
said this is only the fourth level I've
done<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.000> obviously<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.840> story<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.320> it's

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
very easy to do so once you come to this

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.479 
very easy to do so once you come to this
aerial<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.250> those<00:00:50.340> big

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
aerial to be like one of those big

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.920 
aerial to be like one of those big
robots<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.059> shield's<00:00:51.360> around<00:00:51.570> them<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
robots with the shield's around them and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.160 
robots with the shield's around them and
once<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.070> get<00:00:53.219> past<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:54.059> little<00:00:54.660> ways<00:00:54.840> up

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
once you get past that a little ways up

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.350 
once you get past that a little ways up
this<00:00:55.440> hallway<00:00:55.680> right<00:00:55.949> here<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.850> there<00:00:57.210> will

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
this hallway right here but there will

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.119 
this hallway right here but there will
be<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.570> spot<00:00:58.020> where<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.379> two<00:00:58.590> doors<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:59.039> on

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
be a spot where this two doors one on

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.010 
be a spot where this two doors one on
either<00:00:59.219> side<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.760> super<00:01:00.480> droids<00:01:00.629> will<00:01:00.870> just

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
either side and super droids will just

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.090 
either side and super droids will just
come<00:01:01.199> out<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.590> after<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.890> other

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
come out one after the other

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.399 
come out one after the other
until<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.609> close<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.030> door<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.199> could

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
until you close the door so you could

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.960 
until you close the door so you could
just<00:01:04.530> pick<00:01:04.680> one<00:01:04.890> use<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> force<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> like

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
just pick one use the force on it like

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.850 
just pick one use the force on it like
so<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.750> shoot<00:01:07.170> everyone<00:01:07.680> that

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
so and then just shoot everyone that

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.660 
so and then just shoot everyone that
comes<00:01:08.040> out<00:01:09.409> you<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:11.250> might<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.549> already

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
comes out you can you might have already

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
comes out you can you might have already
had<00:01:12.000> some<00:01:12.030> done<00:01:12.689> at<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.290> point<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.680> think<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
had some done at this point I think I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.179 
had some done at this point I think I
had<00:01:14.070> maybe<00:01:14.189> 10<00:01:14.820> or<00:01:15.090> 12<00:01:15.570> maybe<00:01:15.930> 15<00:01:16.080> at<00:01:16.530> this

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
had maybe 10 or 12 maybe 15 at this

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.800 
had maybe 10 or 12 maybe 15 at this
point<00:01:17.430> probably<00:01:17.759> more<00:01:18.090> than<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.420> mean<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
point probably more than that I mean you

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.510 
point probably more than that I mean you
can<00:01:18.930> count<00:01:19.140> them<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.130> had

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
can count them if you like but I had

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.200 
can count them if you like but I had
already<00:01:20.610> done<00:01:20.820> some<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:22.130> yeah<00:01:23.130> basically<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
already done some but yeah basically to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.820 
already done some but yeah basically to
move<00:01:24.330> them<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.540> good<00:01:24.720> spot<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.439> just

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
move them to a good spot and then just

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.640 
move them to a good spot and then just
line<00:01:26.040> them<00:01:26.159> up<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.520> once<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.450> get<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.810> aim<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
line them up and once you get the aim to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.499 
line them up and once you get the aim to
work<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.040> way<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.159> want<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.420> you

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
work the way you want it to and then you

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.280 
work the way you want it to and then you
just<00:01:30.720> kill<00:01:30.869> them<00:01:30.990> all

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
just kill them all

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.940 
just kill them all
it's<00:01:32.130> very<00:01:32.610> simple<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.900> really<00:01:34.470> not<00:01:34.650> hard<00:01:34.799> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
it's very simple not really not hard you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.080 
it's very simple not really not hard you
can't<00:01:35.159> really<00:01:35.310> take<00:01:35.430> any<00:01:35.579> damage<00:01:35.759> while

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
can't really take any damage while

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.730 
can't really take any damage while
you're<00:01:36.299> using<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> force<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.320> super

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
you're using the force on the super

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.130 
you're using the force on the super
droids<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.280> can't<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:38.880> die<00:01:39.140> therefore

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
droids so you can't really die therefore

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.410 
droids so you can't really die therefore
it's<00:01:40.710> really<00:01:40.770> impossible<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.610> mess<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.090> I

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
it's really impossible to mess this up I

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.819 
it's really impossible to mess this up I
said<00:01:42.780> they'll<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.110> keep<00:01:43.229> coming<00:01:43.530> out<00:01:43.619> one

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
said they'll just keep coming out one

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.210 
said they'll just keep coming out one
after<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> other<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.810> after<00:01:45.810> maybe<00:01:46.500> what<00:01:47.189> I

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
after the other and after maybe what I

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.219 
after the other and after maybe what I
think<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.520> video<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.060> 2<00:01:48.299> minutes<00:01:48.930> long

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
think this video is like 2 minutes long

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.530 
think this video is like 2 minutes long
not<00:01:50.100> even<00:01:50.430> after<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.729> take<00:01:50.909> out<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> intro

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
not even after you take out the intro

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.960 
not even after you take out the intro
and<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.689> outro<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.520> maybe<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.640> min<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> half

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
and the outro so maybe a min and a half

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.929 
and the outro so maybe a min and a half
and<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.630> should<00:01:54.810> easily<00:01:55.200> get<00:01:55.380> about<00:01:55.680> 25<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.700> 30

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
and you should easily get about 25 to 30

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.200 
and you should easily get about 25 to 30
of<00:01:57.060> these<00:01:57.240> guys<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.780> dead

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and this is also a very good level to do

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.460 
and this is also a very good level to do
