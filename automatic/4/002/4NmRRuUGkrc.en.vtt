the<00:00:28.539> workshop<00:00:28.990> rearranged<00:00:29.740> into<00:00:29.920> a<00:00:30.070> much

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
the workshop rearranged into a much

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.200 
the workshop rearranged into a much
better<00:00:30.520> semblance<00:00:31.090> of<00:00:31.150> order<00:00:31.259> there<00:00:32.259> is<00:00:32.439> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
better semblance of order there is a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.770 
better semblance of order there is a
remarkable<00:00:34.210> amount<00:00:34.390> of<00:00:34.539> floor<00:00:34.750> space

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
remarkable amount of floor space

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.500 
remarkable amount of floor space
compared<00:00:35.680> to<00:00:35.739> what<00:00:35.950> their<00:00:36.190> they<00:00:37.000> used<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.390> be

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
compared to what their they used to be

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.340 
compared to what their they used to be
now<00:00:38.079> so<00:00:38.470> we<00:00:38.590> are<00:00:38.710> making<00:00:38.860> progress<00:00:40.050> I've<00:00:41.050> taken

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
now so we are making progress I've taken

send the head that I've think I've

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.950 
send the head that I've think I've
probably<00:00:58.480> mentioned<00:00:58.840> it<00:00:59.170> before<00:00:59.469> and<00:01:00.960> it

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
probably mentioned it before and it

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.900 
probably mentioned it before and it
belongs<00:01:02.200> to<00:01:02.320> a<00:01:02.440> friend<00:01:02.620> of<00:01:02.770> mine<00:01:02.950> it's

00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:08.709 
tiger Cup and they normally have

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:12.090 
tiger Cup and they normally have
conventional<00:01:09.520> 14<00:01:09.969> millimeter<00:01:10.740> spark<00:01:11.740> plug<00:01:11.950> in

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
conventional 14 millimeter spark plug in

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.779 
conventional 14 millimeter spark plug in
there<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:12.689> he<00:01:13.689> wants<00:01:13.959> me<00:01:14.079> to<00:01:14.109> fit<00:01:14.409> a<00:01:14.789> second

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
there and he wants me to fit a second

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.779 
there and he wants me to fit a second
spark<00:01:16.090> plug<00:01:17.219> into<00:01:18.219> there<00:01:18.929> and<00:01:20.579> when<00:01:21.579> I<00:01:21.609> was

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
spark plug into there and when I was

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.539 
spark plug into there and when I was
getting<00:01:22.090> one<00:01:22.209> of<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.359> bikes<00:01:22.569> mo<00:01:22.869> teed<00:01:23.170> i

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
getting one of the bikes mo teed i

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.669 
getting one of the bikes mo teed i
scrounged<00:01:24.549> a<00:01:25.090> 10<00:01:25.840> millimeter<00:01:26.170> plug<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.439> I'll

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
scrounged a 10 millimeter plug and I'll

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.349 
scrounged a 10 millimeter plug and I'll
show<00:01:30.130> you<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.310> comparison<00:01:30.639> with<00:01:31.029> the<00:01:31.119> stock

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
show you the comparison with the stock

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:38.429 
show you the comparison with the stock
14

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.889 

so<00:01:39.009> you<00:01:39.159> know<00:01:39.310> quite<00:01:40.179> a<00:01:40.210> bit<00:01:41.369> smaller<00:01:42.899> more

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
so you know quite a bit smaller more

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:51.240 
so you know quite a bit smaller more
from<00:01:44.109> packs

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.860 

so<00:01:51.910> I've<00:01:52.330> got<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.570> try<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:54.210> find<00:01:55.210> room<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.750> get

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
so I've got a try and find room to get

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.660 
so I've got a try and find room to get
in<00:01:56.080> there<00:01:56.290> so<00:01:57.090> these<00:01:58.090> fins<00:01:59.250> will<00:02:00.250> get<00:02:00.430> removed

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
in there so these fins will get removed

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.760 
in there so these fins will get removed
with<00:02:01.150> certain<00:02:01.450> extent<00:02:01.930> well<00:02:02.440> I'll<00:02:02.560> probably

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
with certain extent well I'll probably

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.930 
with certain extent well I'll probably
start<00:02:03.160> off<00:02:03.310> by<00:02:05.010> centering<00:02:06.010> up<00:02:06.160> on<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.670> barrel

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
start off by centering up on the barrel

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.460 
start off by centering up on the barrel
register<00:02:09.179> finding<00:02:10.179> how<00:02:10.300> far<00:02:10.540> this<00:02:10.780> ages<00:02:11.260> from

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
register finding how far this ages from

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.270 
register finding how far this ages from
the<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:12.130> centerline<00:02:13.710> put<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.860> edge<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
the the centerline put the edge of the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.450 
the the centerline put the edge of the
new<00:02:15.460> hole<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:16.080> similar<00:02:17.080> distance<00:02:17.410> away<00:02:17.590> will

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
new hole a similar distance away will

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.640 
new hole a similar distance away will
break<00:02:18.730> through<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.450> then<00:02:20.080> we'll<00:02:20.230> see<00:02:20.440> where

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
break through and then we'll see where

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.310 
break through and then we'll see where
the<00:02:21.460> hole<00:02:21.670> ends<00:02:21.880> up<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.570> just<00:02:23.080> whether

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
the hole ends up and just whether

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.550 
the hole ends up and just whether
there's<00:02:23.650> any<00:02:24.540> metal<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.690> form<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:26.020> seat<00:02:26.230> for<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
there's any metal to form a seat for the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.170 
there's any metal to form a seat for the
plug<00:02:26.770> on<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:29.580> see<00:02:30.580> whether<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:30.850> get<00:02:30.970> away

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
plug on and see whether I get away

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.690 
plug on and see whether I get away
without<00:02:31.450> welding<00:02:32.140> or<00:02:32.440> making<00:02:33.070> up<00:02:33.130> an<00:02:33.280> insert

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
without welding or making up an insert

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.620 
without welding or making up an insert
or<00:02:34.380> something<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:36.209> hopefully<00:02:37.209> that<00:02:37.390> will<00:02:37.510> be

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
or something so hopefully that will be

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:45.240 
or something so hopefully that will be
get<00:02:37.810> getting<00:02:38.200> done<00:02:38.500> before<00:02:39.040> too<00:02:39.250> long<00:02:44.130> on<00:02:45.130> the

get getting done before too long on the
previous<00:02:45.610> video<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:46.030> showed<00:02:46.270> you<00:02:46.570> these<00:02:47.970> damper

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970

rods from the Marini marzocchi Forks I'm
just<00:02:55.810> in<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.019> process<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.590> drawing<00:02:57.430> these<00:02:57.790> all

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
just in the process of drawing these all

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.570 
just in the process of drawing these all
up<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:59.410> I've<00:02:59.590> decided<00:02:59.890> I'm<00:03:00.190> going<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.430> make

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
up and I've decided I'm going to make

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.690 
up and I've decided I'm going to make
new<00:03:00.970> ones<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.890> have<00:03:03.160> managed<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.550> get

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
new ones and I have managed to get

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.960 
new ones and I have managed to get
myself<00:03:03.880> some<00:03:05.580> 50<00:03:06.580> millimeter<00:03:08.550> fairly<00:03:09.550> precise

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
myself some 50 millimeter fairly precise

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.699 
myself some 50 millimeter fairly precise
on<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.330> OD<00:03:11.820> cold<00:03:12.820> drawn<00:03:13.440> seamless<00:03:14.440> tubing

on the OD cold drawn seamless tubing

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.000 
on the OD cold drawn seamless tubing
with<00:03:15.070> a<00:03:15.130> nine<00:03:15.340> millimeter<00:03:15.519> bore<00:03:16.350> which<00:03:17.350> will

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
with a nine millimeter bore which will

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.240 
with a nine millimeter bore which will
get<00:03:18.160> taken<00:03:18.730> out<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.090> ten<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.830> on<00:03:20.860> and

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
get taken out to ten and and so on and

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.490 
get taken out to ten and and so on and
I'll<00:03:21.459> be<00:03:21.640> making<00:03:22.060> up<00:03:22.180> complete<00:03:23.019> new<00:03:23.170> damper

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
I'll be making up complete new damper

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.220 

see<00:03:59.430> those<00:03:59.610> down<00:03:59.880> tubes<00:04:00.240> are<00:04:00.450> quite<00:04:00.630> close<00:04:00.870> to

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
see those down tubes are quite close to

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.790 
see those down tubes are quite close to
the<00:04:01.730> front<00:04:02.730> cylinder<00:04:03.240> head<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.630> they<00:04:04.560> very

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
the front cylinder head and they very

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.630 
the front cylinder head and they very
quickly<00:04:05.570> put<00:04:06.570> a<00:04:06.600> kink<00:04:06.960> in<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.350> frame<00:04:07.590> there<00:04:07.920> to

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
quickly put a kink in the frame there to

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.420 
quickly put a kink in the frame there to
give<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.820> little<00:04:09.150> bit<00:04:09.300> more<00:04:09.480> clearance<00:04:10.310> make<00:04:11.310> it

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
give a little bit more clearance make it

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.729 
give a little bit more clearance make it
easier<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.790> work<00:04:11.940> on<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:14.310> it's<00:04:14.460> got<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.790> yeah

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
easier to work on and it's got the yeah

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.660 
easier to work on and it's got the yeah
