00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 then we want to talk a little bit about 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.049
 breathing 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.320
 let's see a little you brought gods 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.450
 videos that are interested but 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.730
 above all deserve a comment from 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.480
 part of the ass as expert as the why 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.810
 I would not say directing to broadcast 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.820
 and video brought by Dr. Luca Barni e 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.199
 too much to start talking about this 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.210
 what we focus on today 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.520
 on the topic of the diaphragm then a 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.110
 main breathing muscle 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.440
 hence the main motor muscle 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.500
 of breathing is often a muscle 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.440
 not very well known but that is talked about 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.870
 so a muscle so how can you 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000
 see in the top part that has a 100 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.100
 then I frantically tendon part 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.199
 holds as suspended and during the phase of 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.570
 inspirational inspiration acts 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.760
 precisely during the inspiration phase 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.070
 lowering and allowing as you can 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.530
 see now in the graph allowing 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.049
 hence the introduction of area during 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.450
 the exhalation rises thus favoring 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.909
 exhalation the area exit 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.030
 the main thing is we must remember 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.100
 than as a biomechanical mechanism 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.920
 also acts as a regulator of 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.600
 intra-abdominal pressures before yes 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.670
 he spoke of back pain if 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.710
 then these intra-abdominal pressures 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.350
 pressures at the level of viscera do not 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.659
 they are well harmonized also through the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.979
 diaphragm you have problems not only a 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.650
 level of the column but also how it is 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.390
 can see in the video in the perinello 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.860
 of the pelvic floor then 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.040
 problems also in everyone's life 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.130
 the days and for example I mean a can 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.619
 get to phenomena of incontinence such as 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.970
 in women with prostrate problems 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.130
 which in this case also affirmation 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.290
 of the prostate in humans therefore 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.750
 have these balanced games of 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.619
 abdominal pressure is 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.820
 the diaphragm is certainly fundamental 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.149
 chiefly responsible for these 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.590
 pressures for this to be 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.740
 trained and from here also the fort is born 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.660
 collaboration with his dario 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.550
 tools or also used in mine 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.200
 degree thesis just to talk about 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.390
 vertebral immobilizations 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.849
 and chain training 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.709
 respiratory because we don't forget that 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.660
 however the diaphragm seen that in the 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.019
 previous episode we talked about 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.910
 posture is considered the key to 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.629
 time where all the chains cross 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.459
 muscle 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.769
 so for this it turns out to be a 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.840
 fundamental muscle not only in the 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.269
 purely respiratory part but also 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.860
 in the postural part 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.470
 I would say luca and this moment of 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.090
 block the images and then everything 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.540
 what you said let's put it a little 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.010
 in tennis and as the boys used to say 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.260
 as it was said before in the moment in 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.540
 which is then performed a motor gesture 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.510
 breathing is done even more in this 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.090
 case a higher frequency with also 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.160
 a muscular effort is given by twisting 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.900
 if these intra-abdominal pressures e 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.060
 this breathing is not effective 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.569
 naturally limits performance 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.610
 sporty 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.040
 this for what reason as it was said 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.170
 first naturally creates a rigidity there 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.959
 stiffness naturally is not a good one 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.840
 then travel companion in sports 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.549
 reharmonize the diaphragm thugs 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.609
 I read these rare pressures 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.400
 abdominals turns out to be fundamental 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:30.450
 before we talked about Christmas I saw 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.040
 in the video some positions seemed to me 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.950
 anyway to see the moment when he 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.420
 fails to make good and twists 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.150
 fails to extend worth the column 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.299
 be less effective and in the moment in 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.459
 which often not to that reaction to 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.250
 therefore against the opponent's joke 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.579
 this surely can also be 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.579
 implied a bad mechanics of the 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:57.690
 diaphragm should be analyzed in fact 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.940
 I don't call you from the if you want to be 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.880
 realized but apart from the jokes here 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.280
 definitely analyzing his 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.709
 respiratory mechanics we could find 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.690
 something that can be improved for 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.590
 improving performance is yes duke now 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.959
 let's forget about the Christmas you will have 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.840
 probably will have it analyzes kg 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.760
 boys playing tennis that 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.400
 begin the activity of playing tennis 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.370
 but the professional who is sure today 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.250
 by itself that we can give with advice 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.080
 the advice is what he also said 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.750
 in the previous episode that is when 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.949
 let's do a postural analysis 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.330
 we also analyze breathing e 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.040
 therefore also the frames 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.680
 so let's always start from an analysis 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.130
 postural analysis if I post rare 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.740
 results for example in the child with a 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:51.229
 I have to interrupt luca I'm sorry but 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.229
 we continue straight after the line to the director 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.979
 Here we are again in the other studio 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:02.190
 names as I said in the child or in the 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.740
 boy who for example can have a 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.760
 attitude a stenical life one 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.070
 Functional kyphosis is often also due 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.620
 not only the value of some types 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.440
 of spine muscles but often also a 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.479
 a diaphragm that tends to be said 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.460
 however blocked dysfunctional then 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.250
 that does not work well and therefore 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.500
 also determines a not just one person 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.060
 a worse performance in the boy 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.949
 let's talk less about performance 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.810
 but let's talk about the state of health because 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.220
 then this also influences 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.530
 skeletal growth 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.780
 muscle growth therefore yes 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.880
 just talk about prevention too 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.889
 certain issues that can 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.889
 then hit the boy
