00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.879
 why all the same for children and for 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.040
 parents 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.660
 here is the beginning of school life hike in the first 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.719
 class is such a big stress 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.619
 what problems are waiting for a child I think that 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.550
 most often we simply 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.070
 exaggerating those stress and which 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.590
 meet child at school and more often he 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.170
 meets simply the fears of their parents they 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.789
 stress and in fact we are used to 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.550
 control our children us very 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.480
 calmly when we know what will end 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 today where he goes for a walk 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.309
 when he or she comes back and scary 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.770
 scary to go where we do not know 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.750
 that will meet our child probably therefore 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.489
 for us it is stress more sometimes than for 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.320
 child and because with a child it 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.210
 the truth is the whole family goes to school especially 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.980
 first time children are different for one 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.020
 child it will be in time for another 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.030
 It needs to be well, maybe even a year 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.190
 more to help him mom was 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.660
 support means there are probably signs 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.149
 by which you can determine readiness 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.289
 child to school yes of course how are you 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.480
 really not aged 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.940
 readiness probably start with the fact that he 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.100
 or she should already understand the words necessary 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.470
 seemingly simple thing but absolutely not 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.450
 all children at 6 years old without coercion 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.700
 directives calmly and do what they 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.159
 asked and this is important because schools 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.970
 this framework is the rules and regulations rules 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.130
 strangers 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.259
 the child must be ready to stay 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.790
 for a long time with strangers the first time for 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.860
 a child should be able to be human 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.840
 perform consistently complex 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.790
 tasks are hard but those are 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.530
 consist of more than three actions all 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.290
 the school is built on performing 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.450
 task 25 minutes at least a child 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.619
 should be able to 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.570
 concentrate on something most 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.939
 simple action for 25 minutes not 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.400
 coming off this is also a very important lesson. 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.140
 lasts 45 minutes here's really first 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.229
 the problem for all children is that they are not 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.549
 could you sit for 45 min to 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.500
 very easy to determine whether 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.689
 your child can he on his own 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.090
 get dressed undress fast enough well 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.619
 somehow put your things in order not 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.090
 I expect to do it for him some 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.159
 an adult so maybe then 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.380
 act on the principle of the later 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.869
 better and give all the kids back later in 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.119
 school it will be right nadia but you need 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.920
 start from a live child and only 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.720
 a particular child is only his particular 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.400
 the identity of his particular family in which 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.580
 he lives those rules in which the child 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.220
 brought up 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.470
 can answer this question there is still 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.360
 one very interesting question before 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.340
 the child went to school, he was a child 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.780
 garden or brought up at home ir what 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.520
 tell me it seems that if not 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.290
 consider kindergarten to camera 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.620
 storage for the child somewhere for a while 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.150
 you give it away then you get it 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.770
 good because really 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.890
 social adaptation will not provide 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.320
 not bad they are not good club clubs 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.090
 for little kids, he has to go through it 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.310
 but don't count on that 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.570
 visiting the garden will solve all questions 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.550
 school adaptation 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.040
 what skills are needed in school 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.130
 child gets in kindergarten the most 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.380
 most importantly he gets used to the fact that he is already 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.480
 obeys some rules and regulations 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.459
 and whether the child needs in preparation for 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.660
 school house some special treatment 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.660
 to make it easier for him later 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.220
 adapt classic says yes but 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.190
 as in real life, I think that if 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.450
 the whole family does not support the very mode 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.910
 difficult to impose on a single 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.130
 little family member some very 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.810
 correct school rhythm of life therefore 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.360
 one way or another we are really forced 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.400
 yourself enter this mode which is nothing 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.260
 artificially injected is not worth it but remember 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.260
 that the baby will soon start to get up 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.150
 early and walk at a certain time you need 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.550
 maybe it's worth putting it in 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.269
 certain time and wake up or it doesn't 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.310
 will work 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.500
 but I think that with him you need 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.150
 to pack and get up during and only 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.910
 but we just moved smoothly to 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.040
 this topic set up the child to school 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.900
 what are the right words to say baby 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.670
 in order to tune it to this one 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.670
 long school way we can talk 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.530
 that everyone has their own adult or 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.930
 own child's life is right and 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.180
 everyone lives by their rules you are old 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.760
 have you become or have you grown up and now 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.610
 your job is to support the school 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.410
 This is not to exaggerate, of course, some 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.170
 wins which may not be the first 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.519
 time but in no case 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.920
 accent somehow don't anchor on 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.140
 lesions can go to school together 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.600
 very good when parents understand 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.850
 what class on which ports sits them 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.310
 the child will probably be very child 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.269
 it is flattering to show what is already your own 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.500
 place instead of work instead of life and 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.560
 will join all situations which 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.900
 having maximum Endure 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.880
 his and as calm as possible and it seems to me 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.530
 Here in adaptation to school the role of mother 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.540
 most important it is after all 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.730
 at the forefront of putting relationships with 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.889
 child and support him to give 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.960
 maximum support orientation 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.450
 tasks and goals will be solved by him 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.780
 independently entrust him with these tasks 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.540
 already 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.870
 and let go but support more personally 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.190
 and 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.660
 really talk about feeling 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.790
 talk about what's going on alive 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.889
 child in real school in real 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.630
 time is probably the most valuable thing we 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.210
 we can give our children especially the first 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.580
 time well what the first teachers are parents 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.470
 very important people than parents can still 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.650
 help your child adapt to school 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.550
 try not to do it instead of a child 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.750
 school assignment and doing together and 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.820
 try to leave him even for a while 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.290
 on independent work of course 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.780
 monitor intermediate result 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.820
 but still giving him space and 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.040
 give him some kind of zone of his own 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.650
 own growth zone well 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.010
 would divide the place of the game and the place for already 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.080
 new life place for me to work and 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:28.050
 of course how to try to give in school 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.419
 short and very clear tasks are not 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.510
 complicates the already stress which 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:37.650
 created by the child to praise praise and 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.000
 back up good results like 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.220
 understand that the child is enough 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.289
 adapted to school and how much can 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.000
 class time this process of adaptation 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.850
 we are probably the main and key it 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.770
 mood if the child is happy 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.840
 wakes up goes school he has it 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.100
 the mood does not disappear during the day and 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.350
 he comes back and with pleasure 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.360
 tells that today with not 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.400
 it happened first and most probably 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.770
 a clear sign that all is well 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.810
 adaptation is coming and maybe it has already passed 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.270
 successfully of course do not expect it 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.400
 will happen immediately for a month as 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.720
 usually say that about a year children 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.720
 adapt the window see
