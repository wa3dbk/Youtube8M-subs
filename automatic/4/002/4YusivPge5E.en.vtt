and believed in myself I dis believed in

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.730 
and believed in myself I dis believed in
myself<00:00:25.220> that's<00:00:26.220> what<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> did<00:00:26.900> and<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.109> worked

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.380 

was<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> wind<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.309> problem<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> toss

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
it will pay off and you know now it's

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.700 
it will pay off and you know now it's
nice<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.939> see<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.900> starting<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.530> pay

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.300 
nice to see that it's starting to pay
off<00:01:40.740> finally

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.010 

well<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> past<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.479> had<00:01:51.690> problems

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
well I think in the past I had problems

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.880 
well I think in the past I had problems
adjusting<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.820> conditions<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:54.890> they

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
adjusting to the conditions here they

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.620 
adjusting to the conditions here they
are<00:01:56.010> very<00:01:56.250> different<00:01:57.020> also<00:01:58.020> during<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:59.340> day

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
are very different also during the day

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.960 
are very different also during the day
depending<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> time<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.560> day<00:02:01.970> the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
depending on the time of the day the

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.090 
depending on the time of the day the
ball<00:02:03.180> flies<00:02:03.509> during<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> day<00:02:04.140> way<00:02:04.380> more<00:02:04.710> than

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
ball flies during the day way more than

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.520 
ball flies during the day way more than
in<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:06.119> afternoon<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:06.930> evening<00:02:07.050> it's

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
in the afternoon and in the evening it's

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.109 
in the afternoon and in the evening it's
completely<00:02:08.130> different<00:02:08.280> again<00:02:08.729> when<00:02:08.970> it's

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
completely different again when it's

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.770 
completely different again when it's
dark<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.800> I<00:02:10.800> think<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.550> wasn't<00:02:12.090> able<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.450> adjust

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
dark so I think I wasn't able to adjust

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.710 
dark so I think I wasn't able to adjust
well<00:02:12.990> back<00:02:13.830> then<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.610> think<00:02:15.300> now<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.510> also

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
well back then and I think now I also

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.100 
well back then and I think now I also
believe<00:02:16.230> more<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:16.560> my<00:02:16.830> game<00:02:17.630> not<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.840> can

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
believe more in my game not that I can

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.920 
believe more in my game not that I can
only<00:02:19.260> play<00:02:19.590> well<00:02:19.830> at<00:02:20.010> Wimbledon<00:02:20.520> but<00:02:21.270> do<00:02:21.780> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
only play well at Wimbledon but do the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.960 
only play well at Wimbledon but do the
things<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:23.010> different<00:02:23.940> tournaments<00:02:24.630> too

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
things that different tournaments too

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.360 
things that different tournaments too
how<00:02:26.970> much<00:02:27.360> did<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.780> energy<00:02:28.020> ramp<00:02:28.620> up<00:02:28.920> toward

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
how much did the energy ramp up toward

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.640 
how much did the energy ramp up toward
the<00:02:29.459> end<00:02:29.820> when<00:02:30.000> they<00:02:30.360> let<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.380> night
