00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.000
 once it flutters about the food 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:16.450
 of the picnic takes a good dose of fruit 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.579
 and it goes away for a while 10 or 12 bees appear 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.970
 forcing the group to move to another 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:24.090
 where they came from who has left them 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.090
 called 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.090
 bald cold a German zoologist proved 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.550
 that bees have a complex 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.920
 communication system with which between 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.920
 other things can locate the food 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.150
 in his investigations the German placed 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.550
 a bowl with sugar less than 100 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.650
 meters from the hive and watched as the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.730
 scout who found him ran to 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.730
 tell it to others 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.540
 first regurgitated a little to give 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.940
 prove to their partners the quality of 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.010
 food and then started to trace 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.010
 circles in a curious dance 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.320
 the others left in search of sugar 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.280
 drawing circles around the honeycomb 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.280
 to find him 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.800
 von fritsch then moved the bowl and 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.070
 observed that the bee that found it 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.470
 danced a different dance instead of 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.930
 circles wrote a kind of eight 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.480
 drawing a straight line between the two 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.510
 circles while moving the abdomen 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.700
 from one place to another the most surprising is 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.890
 that in this case the bees did not 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.660
 around the honeycomb but that 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.110
 they fired towards the bowl 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.510
 located almost one kilometer 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.700
 moving the bowl and watching the 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.320
 bees with frizz discovered that the 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.320
 bees know math 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.909
 with the help of a chronometer he observed that 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.009
 the frequency of movement of the abdomen 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.119
 was proportional to the distance at which 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.119
 was the food 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.350
 with a transporter he discovered that the 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.750
 straight line that traces the bee in its 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.970
 dance of the abdomen forms an angle with the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.890
 vertical of the honeycomb that corresponds 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.230
 with the angle formed by the lines that 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.500
 they leave the honeycomb towards the sun and towards the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.500
 food 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.710
 years later a one free contributor 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.590
 he built a decoy that imitated 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.720
 perfectly these dances however 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.530
 he did not get any bee to do 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.530
 Case to your message 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.940
 then he recorded the sounds that a 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.940
 bee dancing and he joined them to his 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.370
 decoy was close to getting it but 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.480
 the bees seemed confused and they ended 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.480
 returning to the honeycomb 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.670
 it is likely that the complicated language 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.709
 of the bees and includes some element 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.880
 more than nor have scientists 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.880
 discovered yet
