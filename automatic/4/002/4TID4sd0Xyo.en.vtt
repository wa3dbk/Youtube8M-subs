me but as you come up you want to pull
do<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> toe<00:00:28.140> drag<00:00:28.380> when<00:00:28.740> you're<00:00:28.859> about<00:00:29.099> like<00:00:29.340> top

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
do a toe drag when you're about like top

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
do a toe drag when you're about like top
of<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> circle<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:31.070> then<00:00:32.070> with<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.360> left

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
of the circle and then with the left

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.940 
of the circle and then with the left
analog<00:00:33.719> stick<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.260> come<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.590> move<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.860> up

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
analog stick you come and move it up

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.630 
analog stick you come and move it up
towards<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.610> direction<00:00:35.790> right<00:00:36.239> about<00:00:36.510> here

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
towards this direction right about here

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.229 
towards this direction right about here
Northwest<00:00:39.110> around<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.230> area<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.829> then<00:00:41.239> hit

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
Northwest around that area and then hit

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.030 
Northwest around that area and then hit
make<00:00:42.719> sure<00:00:42.899> you're<00:00:43.350> still<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> toe<00:00:43.800> drag

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
make sure you're still in the toe drag

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.850 
make sure you're still in the toe drag
though<00:00:44.250> hit<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.329> left<00:00:45.780> bumper<00:00:46.079> or<00:00:46.500> hold<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.739> in

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
though hit the left bumper or hold it in

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.500 
though hit the left bumper or hold it in
and<00:00:47.129> don't<00:00:47.520> move<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.879> left<00:00:48.030> hand<00:00:48.180> looks<00:00:48.390> like

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
and don't move the left hand looks like

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.299 
and don't move the left hand looks like
keep<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.809> there<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> right<00:00:50.100> analog

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
keep it there and with the right analog

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.369 
keep it there and with the right analog
stick<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:51.000> let<00:00:51.239> go<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.199> drag

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
stick you let go so it's not in so drag

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.709 
stick you let go so it's not in so drag
anymore<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.550> flick<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:54.059> right<00:00:54.570> about

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
anymore and you flick up right about

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.560 
anymore and you flick up right about
there<00:00:54.960> right<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.370> red<00:00:56.610> thing<00:00:56.850> kind<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.420> I

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
there right on that red thing kind of I

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.560 
there right on that red thing kind of I
it<00:00:57.629> where<00:00:57.989> you'd<00:00:58.469> take<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> wrist<00:00:59.219> shot

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
it where you'd take like a wrist shot

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.330 
it where you'd take like a wrist shot
right<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.199> green<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.309> you

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
right to the right of the green so you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.939 
right to the right of the green so you
come<00:01:02.760> down<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:03.480> chair<00:01:03.780> left<00:01:04.110> bumper<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.769> then

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
come down for chair left bumper and then

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.300 
come down for chair left bumper and then
right<00:01:05.189> flick<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.240> -<00:01:07.040> alright<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.159> that's

right flick it up - alright so that's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.789 
right flick it up - alright so that's
that's<00:01:08.490> kind<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.909> north<00:01:09.150> maybe<00:01:09.780> some<00:01:10.530> north

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
that's kind of north maybe some north

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.390 
that's kind of north maybe some north
east<00:01:11.040> there<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:11.810> pretty<00:01:12.810> north<00:01:13.280> with<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
east there but pretty north with the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.700 
east there but pretty north with the
right<00:01:14.610> stick<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.570> you're<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.590> all

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
right stick so just you're just all

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.010 
right stick so just you're just all
together<00:01:17.119> that<00:01:18.119> one<00:01:18.270> wasn't<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.689> good<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
together that one wasn't really good I

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020 
together that one wasn't really good I
was<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.290> kind<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:19.920> analog<00:01:20.790> stick

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
was just kind of going for analog stick

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.289 
was just kind of going for analog stick
motion<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:21.720> um<00:01:22.759> it's<00:01:23.759> really<00:01:23.880> fun<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
motion there but um it's really fun to

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:24.590 
motion there but um it's really fun to
do

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
do

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.840 
do
I<00:01:24.630> once<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> hang<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.040> works

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
I once you get the hang of it works

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.960 
I once you get the hang of it works
better<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.180> user<00:01:27.450> goes<00:01:27.720> then<00:01:28.820> computer<00:01:29.820> goes

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
better on user goes then computer goes

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.340 
better on user goes then computer goes
because<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> computer<00:01:30.780> boys<00:01:31.020> don't<00:01:31.200> really

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
because the computer boys don't really

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.600 
because the computer boys don't really
bite<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.770> any<00:01:31.920> fakes<00:01:32.220> you'll<00:01:32.460> throw<00:01:32.700> better

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
bite on any fakes you'll throw better

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.640 
bite on any fakes you'll throw better
but<00:01:35.610> um<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:36.329> you're<00:01:36.570> gonna<00:01:36.750> do<00:01:36.960> use<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.439> on

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
but um if you're gonna do use it on

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.800 
but um if you're gonna do use it on
computer<00:01:38.490> goalie<00:01:38.729> try<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.329> five<00:01:39.600> whole

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
computer goalie try and go five whole

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.490 
computer goalie try and go five whole
that's<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> best<00:01:40.470> way<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.520> them<00:01:42.170> but<00:01:43.170> if

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that's the best way to get them but if

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
that's the best way to get them but if
it's<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.220> user<00:01:44.460> goal<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.119> usually<00:01:45.270> just

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
it's a user goal you can usually just

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.210 
it's a user goal you can usually just
fake<00:01:45.750> them<00:01:45.869> out<00:01:45.960> first<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:47.040> pretty

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
fake them out first and it's pretty

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.700 
fake them out first and it's pretty
funny<00:01:47.430> when<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.670> goes<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.049> for<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.380> recap

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
funny when it goes in for just a recap

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.340 
funny when it goes in for just a recap
