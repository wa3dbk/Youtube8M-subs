00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
crawlers so you know what that means

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.549 
crawlers so you know what that means
probably<00:01:00.719> when<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.989> kill<00:01:01.199> them<00:01:01.350> they're

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
probably when you kill them they're

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.290 
probably when you kill them they're
gonna<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> little<00:01:02.250> gas<00:01:02.640> explosion<00:01:03.179> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
gonna have a little gas explosion and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.460 
gonna have a little gas explosion and
you<00:01:03.359> don't<00:01:03.629> want<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.929> get<00:01:04.050> caught<00:01:04.230> in<00:01:04.350> their

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
you don't want to get caught in their

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.200 
you don't want to get caught in their
trail<00:01:04.710> now<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.370> noticed<00:01:05.820> there<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.090> an

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
trail now if you noticed there was an

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.170 
trail now if you noticed there was an
entire<00:01:06.720> horde<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.440> them<00:01:07.590> an<00:01:07.680> entire<00:01:08.010> pack<00:01:08.400> I'm

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
entire horde of them an entire pack I'm

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.490 
entire horde of them an entire pack I'm
assuming<00:01:09.660> on<00:01:09.780> next-gen<00:01:10.140> they're<00:01:10.260> gonna<00:01:10.380> be

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
assuming on next-gen they're gonna be

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.590 
assuming on next-gen they're gonna be
able<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> put<00:01:10.920> more<00:01:11.220> zombies<00:01:11.760> onto<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> map<00:01:12.420> at

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
able to put more zombies onto the map at

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.410 
able to put more zombies onto the map at
least<00:01:12.780> that's<00:01:12.990> my<00:01:13.080> hope<00:01:13.620> now<00:01:14.490> i<00:01:14.790> still<00:01:15.360> believe

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
least that's my hope now i still believe

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.050 
least that's my hope now i still believe
that<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.590> probably<00:01:16.830> gonna<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.760> boss

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
that this is probably gonna be a boss

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.150 
that this is probably gonna be a boss
round<00:01:18.690> I<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.800> thought<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.040> was<00:01:20.100> interesting

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
round I just thought it was interesting

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.140 
round I just thought it was interesting
that<00:01:21.140> I<00:01:22.280> they're<00:01:23.280> bringing<00:01:23.610> back<00:01:23.640> some<00:01:23.970> sort

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
that I they're bringing back some sort

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.370 
that I they're bringing back some sort
of<00:01:24.240> boss<00:01:24.420> round<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.870> don't<00:01:25.050> really<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.350> how

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
of boss round I don't really know how

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.720 
of boss round I don't really know how
hard<00:01:25.830> those<00:01:25.980> things<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:26.280> gonna<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.460> able<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
hard those things are gonna be able to

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.310 
hard those things are gonna be able to
kill<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:26.910> certainly<00:01:27.360> hope<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.690> especially

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320
