00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.940 
and end up with three they're just so
comfortable<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.000> easy<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.720> fling<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.350> I

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
comfortable so easy to fling on and I

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.260 
comfortable so easy to fling on and I
think<00:01:29.280> they<00:01:29.400> still<00:01:29.610> look<00:01:29.729> nice<00:01:29.880> even<00:01:30.180> though

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
think they still look nice even though

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.789 
think they still look nice even though
they're<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.630> t-shirt<00:01:30.869> next<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.650> this

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
they're just a t-shirt next is this

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.280 
they're just a t-shirt next is this
mustard<00:01:32.369> jumper<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.210> mustard<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> strange

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
mustard jumper and mustard is a strange

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.080 
mustard jumper and mustard is a strange
color<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.829> either<00:01:34.950> suits<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.490> or<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.700> doesn't

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
color it either suits you or it doesn't

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.640 
color it either suits you or it doesn't
I<00:01:36.210> think<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.659> looks<00:01:36.840> quite<00:01:37.049> nice<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.470> me

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
I think it looks quite nice for me

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.440 
I think it looks quite nice for me
either<00:01:37.920> way<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:38.820> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
either way I really like it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
either way I really like it
actually<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> was<00:01:39.930> having<00:01:40.170> coffee<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.740> Gabby

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
actually I was having coffee with Gabby

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.639 
actually I was having coffee with Gabby
and<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:42.240> was<00:01:42.360> wearing<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> mustard<00:01:42.990> cardigan<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and I was wearing a mustard cardigan and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.469 
and I was wearing a mustard cardigan and
she<00:01:43.829> said<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.130> really<00:01:44.250> suited<00:01:44.640> me<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.210> think

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
she said it really suited me so I think

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.080 
she said it really suited me so I think
mustard<00:01:46.079> suits<00:01:46.350> my<00:01:46.560> skin<00:01:46.619> tone<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.369> not<00:01:47.670> then

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
mustard suits my skin tone if not then

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.330 
mustard suits my skin tone if not then

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
wearing this recently and it's still

wearing this recently and it's still
cold

cold

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.860 
cold
but<00:02:33.459> notice<00:02:33.700> where<00:02:33.880> shirt<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.420> jumper<00:02:34.780> and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
some wooly tights and it still works

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.650

well<00:02:36.489> you<00:02:36.550> know<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.730> suppose<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.330> who<00:02:37.480> want

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
well you know I suppose of you who want

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.850 
well you know I suppose of you who want
to<00:02:37.690> get<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:37.989> and<00:02:38.110> you're<00:02:38.230> not<00:02:38.350> too<00:02:38.530> sure<00:02:38.560> what

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
to get this and you're not too sure what

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.809 
to get this and you're not too sure what
size<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.819> have<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:41.130> think<00:02:42.130> it's<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.310> 24

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
size to get I have a think it's a 24

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.580 
size to get I have a think it's a 24
inch<00:02:43.060> waist<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.200> an<00:02:44.290> extra<00:02:44.560> small

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
inch waist and this is an extra small

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.309 
inch waist and this is an extra small
and<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.069> fits<00:02:45.250> me<00:02:45.370> perfectly<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.930> guess

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
and this fits me perfectly so I guess

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.630 
and this fits me perfectly so I guess
you<00:02:47.470> can<00:02:47.620> just<00:02:47.860> kind<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.040> work<00:02:48.160> out<00:02:48.310> what<00:02:48.430> size

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
you can just kind of work out what size

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.880 
you can just kind of work out what size
you<00:02:48.790> need<00:02:48.940> from<00:02:49.600> that<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:50.050> I<00:02:50.080> got<00:02:50.350> this<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.680> line

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
you need from that so I got this a line

this and I don't have a nice rucksack

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.000 
this and I don't have a nice rucksack
course<00:04:31.450> it's<00:04:31.660> got<00:04:32.050> straps<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:32.920> can

adjust back pops open up sides as well

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.320 
adjust back pops open up sides as well
so<00:04:35.919> you<00:04:36.010> can<00:04:36.160> fit<00:04:36.340> loads<00:04:36.639> in<00:04:36.880> if<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.120> really

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
so you can fit loads in if you really

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.970 
so you can fit loads in if you really

want to I really like it really happy
with<00:04:39.070> this<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:39.610> if<00:04:39.730> I<00:04:39.910> wasn't<00:04:40.090> spoiled<00:04:40.480> enough

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
with this and if I wasn't spoiled enough

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.050 
with this and if I wasn't spoiled enough
as<00:04:41.080> it<00:04:41.260> is<00:04:41.290> I<00:04:41.710> got<00:04:42.040> a<00:04:42.160> couple<00:04:42.370> pairs<00:04:42.669> of<00:04:42.760> shoes

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
as it is I got a couple pairs of shoes

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.870 
as it is I got a couple pairs of shoes
the<00:04:43.419> first<00:04:43.690> pair<00:04:43.960> are<00:04:44.260> these<00:04:44.560> white<00:04:45.310> trainers

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
the first pair are these white trainers

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.980 
the first pair are these white trainers
I<00:04:46.090> think<00:04:46.270> they<00:04:46.330> make<00:04:46.480> a<00:04:46.510> really<00:04:46.870> nice

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990

alternative<00:04:47.200> to<00:04:47.740> converse<00:04:48.220> they're<00:04:48.610> just

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.430 
alternative to converse they're just
plain<00:04:49.240> white<00:04:49.540> and<00:04:49.780> I<00:04:49.900> think<00:04:50.110> these<00:04:50.200> are<00:04:50.260> gonna

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
plain white and I think these are gonna

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.800 
plain white and I think these are gonna
look<00:04:50.620> great<00:04:50.680> in<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.280> summer<00:04:51.520> with<00:04:52.030> summer

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.740 
look great in the summer with summer
dresses<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.560> skirts<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.880> whenever<00:04:55.330> I<00:04:55.540> just

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
dresses and skirts and whenever I just

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.270

feel<00:04:55.900> like<00:04:55.990> not<00:04:56.200> wearing<00:04:56.350> ankle<00:04:56.740> boots<00:04:56.980> they

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
feel like not wearing ankle boots they

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.770 
feel like not wearing ankle boots they
also<00:04:57.430> have<00:04:57.669> these<00:04:57.760> in<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:57.940> pastel<00:04:58.270> pink<00:04:58.330> and<00:04:58.750> I

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
was debating whether to get the pastel

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.220 
was debating whether to get the pastel
pink<00:05:00.400> or<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.090> white<00:05:01.300> ones<00:05:01.540> but<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:01.990> thought

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
pink or the white ones but I thought

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.420 
pink or the white ones but I thought
I'll<00:05:02.380> get<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.620> white<00:05:02.770> ones<00:05:03.010> I'll<00:05:03.280> be

I'll get the white ones I'll be

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.970 
I'll get the white ones I'll be
practical<00:05:04.000> because<00:05:04.540> how<00:05:05.230> many<00:05:05.290> outfits<00:05:05.710> do<00:05:05.950> I

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
practical because how many outfits do I

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.970

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.740 
have that go with pastel pink shoes not
many<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.580> I<00:05:09.700> don't<00:05:09.940> wear<00:05:10.090> trainers<00:05:10.480> that<00:05:10.510> much
