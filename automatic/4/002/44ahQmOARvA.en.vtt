00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 a beautiful and I welcome you 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.469
 this video i have by my star 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.090
 wars episode 7 analytics video I have 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.219
 get a lot of requests because of me 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.049
 yes i said i have a regional 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.850
 Building a tom hooper helmet here 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.439
 lie down and feel written to me 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.699
 by private message also in the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.400
 comments from because of 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.779
 show me this helmet and what that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.949
 no helmet and why you do not have 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.779
 shown and back and forth 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.849
 and that's why I'll take it to you now 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.160
 here in this video show and indeed 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.649
 that's that good piece and before we do 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.110
 come to that I will show you just 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.210
 the certificate because that is in the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.340
 principle in this little map that can 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.829
 you're probably relative here now 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.039
 hard to recognize here 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.760
 certified official propublica and 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.440
 are then written in English 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.730
 and is from fx incorporated and i do 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.289
 all a bit shorter they 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.140
 insists that is an original 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.860
 replica is that under official 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.330
 license were manufactured by lucasfilm 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.880
 It was all original 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.520
 materials from the films of lucasfilm 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.700
 used and the film is one on one 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.970
 reconstructed from the helmet has from the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.340
 film or was the same press is 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.890
 it completely and made and all 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.939
 qualitative materials for the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.310
 Helmets used in episode 4 5 and 6 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.079
 have been synonymous for this helmet 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.430
 that means in principle you have 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.090
 the original one to one helmet of it 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.610
 I have people now one time 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.689
 here's a little bit shiny 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.759
 moody countries are the eyes here 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.460
 green you will be in the black hat 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.470
 not see it here but otherwise 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.020
 are small such a small elastic band 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.850
 made in matt black here so a 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.649
 bit gray applications that everyone 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.380
 side is blue of the two had 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.549
 ventilation pipes when pairing 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.439
 a reader from behind relative 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.590
 unspectacular and of good you see 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.599
 here's a rubber bar here the lot 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.849
 Foam in the interior that you can 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.470
 I can not raise anything 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.300
 I do not know how they did it 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.290
 you get extremely hot air and me 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.959
 I'll wind up now 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.340
 So let's see how the proportions ago 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:29.760
 is because the thing is quite nice 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.500
 powerful and jallohs you have to be 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.500
 Do not just set it up because it stops 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.500
 you do not have to get away and turn around 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.880
 Now I own the helmet too 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.970
 well, no one can fully enjoy themselves 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.420
 easy jet move again hears the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.700
 vote is now quite I approach 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.880
 also get quite heavy but the air 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.700
 a bit sick but that 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.310
 problem is the circuit would have thieves 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.510
 can beat and accordingly 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.519
 now see it again 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.519
 also probably in a few minutes 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.049
 I will not be able to see anything anymore 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.380
 probably about the things underneath 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.030
 also smothered irony thoughts thing is 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.980
 I once had a youtube channel that 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.750
 is now a new channel because I once 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.220
 I was upset again and I had 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.260
 my channel, i thought only this helmet 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.920
 had on the head and that's it 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.000
 make really very tiring easily 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.870
 we also a little bit more 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.019
 with the thing on the head must first 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.410
 the helmet down again because otherwise 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:41.459
 suffocate in the part as I said that 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.069
 Part cost me about 200 euro 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.079
 bus to buy this helmet is itself 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:51.569
 in the video description below it 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:53.310
 is not so direct at tee and de.com 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.630
 out of my head because I have too 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.430
 saved sometime favorites 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.590
 there could be the frame there too 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.799
 to buy a few lightsaber spit ass 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.389
 if you have something the lightsaber replicate 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.430
 I would like to see you here 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.110
 a lot on the wall hang on wood months 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.540
 in the comments 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.210
 then maybe I could do it too 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.400
 make one or the other video as usual 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.740
 this app currently costs about 200 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.040
 euro at troy palace i would you 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:23.920
 recommend do not buy cheap helmet 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:27.830
 do not buy a year 60 euro hands 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.320
 at amazon or at ebay or something like that 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.650
 they are not good they look like liquid manure 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.030
 they just do not have that quality 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.470
 and I mean such a part that one has 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.220
 not every day on the head that it 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.630
 can break and use a helmet 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.730
 Do not even turn off and if you really 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.620
 what decent want to buy then 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.270
 you have the original ones you have on 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.260
 Most of when I get ready to buy 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.270
 definitely not and so soon episode 789 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.550
 and we still come out and come out now 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.160
 the new helmets will be on offer 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.669
 I'll definitely think so too 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.030
 Buying a new one costs whatever it takes 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:06.260
 that will be my little reviews this 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.300
 helm i just know that directly 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:13.690
 to see each other and influence up 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.690
 next time
