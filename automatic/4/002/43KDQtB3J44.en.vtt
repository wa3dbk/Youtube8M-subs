 to the brothers of minecraft amÃ²dio sono 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.970
 piece today I'm here to introduce you to a 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.600
 new mini game the minigame of today is 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.060
 mushroom mix in description you will find the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.570
 link for this server is a server 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.550
 beautiful but unfortunately only for 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.880
 premium so only premiums can 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.590
 enter this server then there is not 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.170
 so much to say about this game like 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.790
 works practically on the board 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.579
 main what I'm looking at 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.489
 in these seconds I don't know how 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.590
 what flows comes a color us 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.140
 we have to go on that color and if not 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.079
 we will be on that color after about two o 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.079
 three seconds I don't know exactly with 45 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.480
 I do not remember, however, goes to degrees 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.699
 floor will fall and all those on 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.070
 right color will remain alive and 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.470
 They will proceed to the second round 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.850
 acts will fall there will be eliminated there is a 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.369
 only the winner the winner wins 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.220
 I do n't know something like that 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.200
 here too i'm pretty good done 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.310
 three games not won three so great 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.470
 result 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.119
 there is a little bit of a giving moment 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.939
 bother in the lobby where we have to 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.280
 this is unfortunately waiting for people 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.700
 server and is a little-used server 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.860
 in fact I turned to say for many 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.920
 maps there were also minigames on 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.900
 soccer beautiful wonderful facts a lot 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.600
 but very well, however, a little bit more 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.930
 paid I had to solve it and they were 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.920
 empty second great server that 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.759
 then it deserves so much 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.890
 leaving out the mini game that's it 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.840
 so the game and that's enough 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.130
 above all it is simple and fun 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.189
 very nice with friends maximum 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.979
 four players then we are doing 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.990
 we say something of the project is 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.500
 going pretty well we're a little bit 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.649
 back with plug in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.750
 etc. however it is something we say 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.100

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.360

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.060
