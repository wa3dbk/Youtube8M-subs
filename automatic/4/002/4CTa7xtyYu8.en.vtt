to this one now this one is actually

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.110 
to this one now this one is actually
really<00:00:48.440> simple<00:00:48.860> to<00:00:49.160> make<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.640> they<00:00:49.790> did<00:00:49.970> that

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
really simple to make and they did that

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.090 
really simple to make and they did that
way<00:00:50.300> on<00:00:50.600> purpose<00:00:50.630> because<00:00:51.380> I<00:00:51.500> imagine<00:00:51.950> the

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
way on purpose because I imagine the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.800 
way on purpose because I imagine the
lots<00:00:52.280> of<00:00:52.460> young<00:00:52.730> girls<00:00:52.970> wanting<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:53.510> meet<00:00:53.630> this

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
lots of young girls wanting to meet this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.080 
lots of young girls wanting to meet this
one<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:54.560> all<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:54.950> girls<00:00:55.250> like<00:00:55.460> me<00:00:55.700> I<00:00:55.730> thought

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
one and all the girls like me I thought

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.790 
one and all the girls like me I thought
this<00:00:56.270> one<00:00:56.510> was<00:00:56.630> really<00:00:56.870> good<00:00:57.020> one<00:00:57.440> when<00:00:57.620> I<00:00:57.680> was

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
this one was really good one when I was

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.729 
this one was really good one when I was
designing<00:00:58.010> it<00:00:58.870> what's<00:00:59.870> important<00:01:00.470> is<00:01:00.710> that

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
designing it what's important is that

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:01.300 
designing it what's important is that
you<00:01:00.950> leo

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
you leo

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.700 
you leo
all<00:01:01.579> of<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.000> parts<00:01:02.420> in<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.810> right<00:01:02.840> order<00:01:03.260> and

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
all of the parts in the right order and

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.109 
all of the parts in the right order and
the<00:01:03.800> right<00:01:03.829> way<00:01:04.189> up<00:01:04.369> because<00:01:04.759> that<00:01:04.939> will

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
the right way up because that will

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.719 
the right way up because that will
actually<00:01:05.149> help<00:01:05.689> you<00:01:05.979> think<00:01:06.979> big<00:01:07.189> was<00:01:07.430> maybe

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
actually help you think big was maybe

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.430 
actually help you think big was maybe
going<00:01:07.940> to<00:01:08.030> come<00:01:08.180> along<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:08.570> help<00:01:08.750> as<00:01:08.990> well<00:01:09.229> but

going to come along to help as well but
let's<00:01:09.680> hope<00:01:09.920> not<00:01:10.870> we<00:01:11.870> have<00:01:12.050> our<00:01:12.200> real<00:01:12.409> sections

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
let's hope not we have our real sections

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.860 
let's hope not we have our real sections
here<00:01:13.430> which<00:01:13.700> are<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:13.970> main<00:01:14.180> sides<00:01:14.540> of<00:01:14.780> the

carriage being quote bic well you can't

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.700 
carriage being quote bic well you can't
set<00:01:19.100> one<00:01:19.250> more<00:01:19.400> your<00:01:19.580> sections<00:01:20.320> see<00:01:21.320> if<00:01:21.409> i<00:01:21.530> can

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
set one more your sections see if i can

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.140 
set one more your sections see if i can
show<00:01:22.370> these<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.740> obviously<00:01:24.970> you<00:01:25.970> might

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
show these to you obviously you might

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.330 
show these to you obviously you might
not<00:01:26.330> want<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.600> cut<00:01:26.930> all<00:01:27.470> of<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.740> spokes<00:01:28.070> of<00:01:28.280> the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
not want to cut all of the spokes of the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.920 
not want to cut all of the spokes of the
wheels<00:01:28.580> i<00:01:28.820> don't<00:01:29.060> know<00:01:29.180> that<00:01:29.210> may<00:01:29.540> be<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.720> bit

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
wheels i don't know that may be a bit

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.230 
wheels i don't know that may be a bit
too<00:01:29.960> much<00:01:30.380> effort<00:01:30.710> what<00:01:31.310> I'm<00:01:31.460> Libby<00:01:31.700> do<00:01:31.850> is<00:01:32.000> cut

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
too much effort what I'm Libby do is cut

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.730 
too much effort what I'm Libby do is cut
the<00:01:32.360> full<00:01:32.570> circle<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.229> they<00:01:33.320> never<00:01:33.530> use<00:01:33.710> a

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
the full circle and they never use a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.789 
the full circle and they never use a
fancy<00:01:34.100> flower<00:01:34.580> stamp<00:01:35.060> erechtheum<00:01:35.479> punch<00:01:36.470> and

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
fancy flower stamp erechtheum punch and

fancy flower stamp erechtheum punch and
punch<00:01:37.340> something<00:01:37.790> out<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.060> center<00:01:38.479> here<00:01:38.810> just

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
punch something out the center here just

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.260 
punch something out the center here just
to<00:01:39.470> make<00:01:39.650> it<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.830> bit<00:01:40.040> more<00:01:40.190> energy<00:01:40.549> cap<00:01:40.760> but<00:01:41.150> the

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
to make it a bit more energy cap but the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.180 
to make it a bit more energy cap but the
rest<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.750> design<00:01:41.900> is<00:01:42.380> really<00:01:42.619> simple

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
rest of the design is really simple

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.100 
rest of the design is really simple
curves<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:43.850> really<00:01:44.150> simple<00:01:44.570> straight<00:01:44.840> lines

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
curves and really simple straight lines

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.770 
curves and really simple straight lines
you<00:01:45.650> have<00:01:46.310> lots<00:01:46.640> of<00:01:46.820> strengthening<00:01:47.330> bars<00:01:47.600> on

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
you have lots of strengthening bars on

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.780 
you have lots of strengthening bars on
this<00:01:47.930> one<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.260> hold<00:01:48.439> it<00:01:48.619> together<00:01:48.770> these<00:01:49.460> six

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
this one to hold it together these six

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.940 
this one to hold it together these six
that<00:01:50.090> identical<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.200> again<00:01:51.500> they're<00:01:51.770> just

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
that identical and again they're just

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.149 
that identical and again they're just
straight<00:01:52.189> lines<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:52.900> these<00:01:53.900> two<00:01:54.260> are<00:01:54.830> kinda

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
straight lines and these two are kinda

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.980 
straight lines and these two are kinda
strengthening<00:01:55.670> bars<00:01:55.880> but<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.119> bit<00:01:56.330> more<00:01:56.510> detail

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
strengthening bars but a bit more detail

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.219 
strengthening bars but a bit more detail
as<00:01:57.200> well<00:01:57.380> just<00:01:57.619> to<00:01:57.799> make<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:57.979> look<00:01:58.490> pretty<00:01:58.820> and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
as well just to make it look pretty and

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.510 
as well just to make it look pretty and
they're<00:02:00.229> just<00:02:00.439> simple<00:02:00.770> straight<00:02:01.040> lines<00:02:01.280> and

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
they're just simple straight lines and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.630 
they're just simple straight lines and
curves<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:03.350> then<00:02:03.500> have<00:02:03.680> these<00:02:03.860> parts<00:02:04.400> these

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
curves you then have these parts these

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.550 
curves you then have these parts these
four<00:02:04.939> parts<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:05.479> identical<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.320> this<00:02:06.380> is

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
four parts that identical and this is

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.840 
four parts that identical and this is
four

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
four

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.740 
four
the<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:08.410> carnage<00:02:08.800> section<00:02:09.479> again<00:02:10.479> really

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
the the carnage section again really

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.110 
the the carnage section again really
easy<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:11.290> cut<00:02:11.500> out<00:02:11.680> we<00:02:12.340> have<00:02:12.520> these<00:02:12.730> three

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
easy to cut out we have these three

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.330 
easy to cut out we have these three
sections<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:14.200> section<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:14.860> actually<00:02:14.980> the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
sections the section is actually the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.000 
sections the section is actually the
back<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.150> carriage<00:02:16.590> where<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.830> is

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
back of the carriage where this is

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.860 
back of the carriage where this is
actually<00:02:18.340> made<00:02:18.489> to<00:02:18.610> be<00:02:18.730> like<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:18.880> seat<00:02:19.239> section

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
actually made to be like a seat section

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.900 
actually made to be like a seat section
so<00:02:20.050> if<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.260> are<00:02:20.410> doing<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.830> total<00:02:21.160> acity<00:02:21.670> you

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
so if you are doing a total acity you

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.970 
so if you are doing a total acity you
could<00:02:22.120> actually<00:02:22.330> color<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:22.989> section<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.650> or

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
could actually color this section and or

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.710 
could actually color this section and or
you<00:02:24.130> could<00:02:24.280> add<00:02:24.459> some<00:02:24.730> little<00:02:24.850> people<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.360> sit

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
you could add some little people to sit

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.380 
you could add some little people to sit
on<00:02:25.750> here<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:27.220> then<00:02:27.400> have<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.760> middle<00:02:28.120> section

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
on here you then have the middle section

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.199 
on here you then have the middle section
top<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.709> carriage<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.970> front

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
top of the carriage and in the front

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.640 
top of the carriage and in the front
section<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.810> carriage<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.530> would

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
section of the carriage and I would

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.729 
section of the carriage and I would
leave<00:02:32.890> these<00:02:33.069> out<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.610> way<00:02:33.940> up<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.530> have

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
leave these out this way up so you have

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.830 
leave these out this way up so you have
them<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.220> exactly<00:02:36.550> this<00:02:36.880> all<00:02:37.120> rather<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.690> out

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
them and exactly this all rather to out

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.690 
them and exactly this all rather to out
of<00:02:38.080> sorts<00:02:38.410> at<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.620> bottom<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.340> two<00:02:39.550> outer

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
of sorts at the bottom the two outer

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.300 
of sorts at the bottom the two outer
slots<00:02:40.150> at<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.390> top<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:41.230> two<00:02:41.440> out<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:41.650> shots<00:02:42.069> at

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
slots at the top the two out of shots at

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.610 
slots at the top the two out of shots at
the<00:02:42.400> bottom<00:02:42.790> this<00:02:43.600> one's<00:02:43.840> actually<00:02:44.019> slightly

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
the bottom this one's actually slightly

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.680 
the bottom this one's actually slightly
better<00:02:44.769> than<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.250> one<00:02:45.489> so<00:02:46.150> I'll<00:02:46.269> lay<00:02:46.510> them

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
better than this one so I'll lay them

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.140 
better than this one so I'll lay them
out<00:02:46.780> in<00:02:46.989> exactly<00:02:47.110> this<00:02:47.739> order<00:02:48.220> we<00:02:48.819> then<00:02:48.970> have

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
out in exactly this order we then have

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.660 
out in exactly this order we then have
these<00:02:49.330> two<00:02:49.690> sections<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.860> got<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.190> sides<00:02:51.459> of

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
these two sections that got the sides of

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.370 
these two sections that got the sides of
the<00:02:51.760> carriage<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.360> oddly<00:02:52.840> they<00:02:53.170> mate<00:02:53.350> with

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
the carriage and oddly they mate with

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.400 
the carriage and oddly they mate with
the<00:02:53.590> slots<00:02:53.950> at<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.220> bottom<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:56.260> will

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
the slots at the bottom this will

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.900 
the slots at the bottom this will
actually<00:02:56.530> make<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:57.010> lot<00:02:57.250> easier<00:02:57.670> when<00:02:57.760> you're

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
actually make a lot easier when you're

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.190 
actually make a lot easier when you're
putting<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.239> together<00:02:58.390> if<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.810> leave<00:02:59.019> them

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
putting it together if you leave them

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.070 
putting it together if you leave them
Oaks<00:02:59.350> acrylate<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.420> we<00:03:01.420> then<00:03:01.600> have<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.900> main

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
Oaks acrylate this we then have the main

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.400 
Oaks acrylate this we then have the main
section<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.799> carriage<00:03:03.660> with<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.900> horse

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
section of the carriage with the horse

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.830 
section of the carriage with the horse
at<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.709> front<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:07.209> that's<00:03:07.360> what<00:03:07.569> we're<00:03:07.690> going

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
at the front and that's what we're going

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.630 
at the front and that's what we're going
to<00:03:07.900> start<00:03:08.140> working<00:03:08.380> with<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:09.250> I'm<00:03:09.430> going<00:03:09.580> to

middle here the you do have to totally
paint<00:03:25.359> your<00:03:25.600> piece<00:03:25.780> of<00:03:25.930> card<00:03:26.200> to<00:03:26.799> get<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.250> go

paint your piece of card to get it to go

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.539 
paint your piece of card to get it to go
in<00:03:27.549> so<00:03:28.359> either<00:03:28.720> use<00:03:29.200> flexible<00:03:29.859> card<00:03:30.280> or

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
in so either use flexible card or

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.490 
in so either use flexible card or

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
acetate works beautifully for this

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.039 
acetate works beautifully for this
design<00:03:33.030> we're<00:03:34.030> then<00:03:34.180> going<00:03:34.329> to<00:03:34.390> take<00:03:34.570> this<00:03:34.780> one

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
design we're then going to take this one

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.500 
design we're then going to take this one
here<00:03:35.440> which<00:03:36.070> goes<00:03:36.340> at<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.549> back<00:03:36.760> here<00:03:37.209> and

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
here which goes at the back here and

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.860 
here which goes at the back here and
side<00:03:38.410> here<00:03:38.799> because<00:03:39.280> that's<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.820> seat<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.660> the

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
side here because that's the seat of the

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.289 
side here because that's the seat of the
actual<00:03:41.200> carriage<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.920> again<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.790> slots<00:03:43.090> at

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
actual carriage and again the slots at

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.819 
actual carriage and again the slots at
the<00:03:43.329> middle<00:03:43.750> at<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.109> top<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.680> bottom

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
the middle at the top and the bottom

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:53.240 
the middle at the top and the bottom
here

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.449 

so<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:55.510> then<00:03:55.660> this<00:03:55.780> is<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.080> front<00:03:56.410> so<00:03:57.310> this

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
so and then this is the front so this

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.550 
so and then this is the front so this
goes<00:03:57.670> into<00:03:57.940> your<00:03:58.000> spokes<00:03:58.420> soak<00:03:58.959> them<00:03:59.140> both<00:03:59.319> of

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
goes into your spokes soak them both of

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.350 
goes into your spokes soak them both of
them<00:03:59.590> here<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:06.640> there<00:04:06.879> you<00:04:06.970> have<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.180> three

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
them here and there you have the three

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.589 
them here and there you have the three
in<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:07.989> donation<00:04:08.709> we<00:04:09.670> then<00:04:09.849> take<00:04:10.090> these<00:04:10.300> two

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
in that donation we then take these two

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.839 
in that donation we then take these two
extra<00:04:10.959> ones<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:12.010> they've<00:04:12.160> got<00:04:12.310> three<00:04:12.459> slots

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
extra ones and they've got three slots

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.970 
extra ones and they've got three slots
at<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.750> top<00:04:14.050> in<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.290> bottom<00:04:14.410> of<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.800> inner

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
at the top in the bottom of the inner

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.550 
at the top in the bottom of the inner
circle<00:04:15.280> there<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.299> they<00:04:16.450> go<00:04:16.600> over<00:04:16.930> these

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
circle there and they go over these

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.250 
circle there and they go over these
three<00:04:17.769> slots<00:04:18.220> here<00:04:18.639> and<00:04:19.090> under<00:04:19.570> these<00:04:19.959> these

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
three slots here and under these these

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.180 
three slots here and under these these
logs<00:04:20.590> here<00:04:21.270> so<00:04:22.270> again<00:04:22.450> you<00:04:23.440> will<00:04:23.620> need<00:04:23.800> card

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
logs here so again you will need card

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.580 
logs here so again you will need card
banging<00:04:24.790> to<00:04:24.940> put<00:04:25.120> these<00:04:25.270> in<00:04:25.419> place<00:04:25.720> I'm<00:04:26.440> gonna

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
banging to put these in place I'm gonna

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.090 
banging to put these in place I'm gonna
start<00:04:26.950> by<00:04:27.250> putting<00:04:27.280> them<00:04:27.669> into<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.770> little

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
start by putting them into the little

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.990 
start by putting them into the little
one<00:04:30.280> now<00:04:32.190> what<00:04:33.190> may<00:04:33.370> happen<00:04:33.610> when<00:04:33.880> you're

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
one now what may happen when you're

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.370 
one now what may happen when you're
doing<00:04:34.270> this<00:04:34.389> is<00:04:34.600> that<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.840> one<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.169> you're

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
doing this is that the one that you're

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.860 
doing this is that the one that you're
putting<00:04:35.620> it<00:04:35.770> in<00:04:35.889> to<00:04:36.190> me<00:04:36.460> actually<00:04:36.600> pop<00:04:37.600> out<00:04:37.810> of

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
putting it in to me actually pop out of

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.900 
putting it in to me actually pop out of
its<00:04:38.169> slot<00:04:38.530> but<00:04:38.860> you<00:04:38.919> just<00:04:39.100> tuck<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.490> back<00:04:39.669> in

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
its slot but you just tuck it back in

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:56.610 
its slot but you just tuck it back in
again

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.990 

right<00:04:57.190> so<00:04:57.880> we<00:04:58.060> have<00:04:59.100> them<00:05:00.100> included<00:05:00.550> on<00:05:00.790> that

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
right so we have them included on that

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.120 
right so we have them included on that
site<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:01.690> I'm<00:05:01.870> going<00:05:02.080> to<00:05:02.110> do<00:05:02.290> it<00:05:02.350> exactly<00:05:02.650> the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
site and I'm going to do it exactly the

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:23.460 
site and I'm going to do it exactly the
same<00:05:03.460> on<00:05:03.610> this<00:05:03.760> site

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.840 

that<00:05:24.100> is<00:05:24.510> 180<00:05:25.740> GSM<00:05:26.740> card<00:05:27.040> for<00:05:27.370> this<00:05:27.460> but<00:05:27.730> when

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
that is 180 GSM card for this but when

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.180 
that is 180 GSM card for this but when
you<00:05:27.970> needed<00:05:28.360> it<00:05:28.480> to<00:05:28.630> be<00:05:28.660> fairly<00:05:29.020> flexible<00:05:29.350> also

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
you needed it to be fairly flexible also

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.720 
you needed it to be fairly flexible also
I<00:05:30.250> wanted<00:05:30.520> it<00:05:30.670> fairly<00:05:30.970> late<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:32.200> be<00:05:32.320> able<00:05:32.440> to<00:05:32.740> to

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
I wanted it fairly late to be able to to

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.850 
I wanted it fairly late to be able to to
stand<00:05:34.060> up<00:05:34.300> although<00:05:34.870> I<00:05:34.900> did<00:05:35.170> the<00:05:35.290> horseshoe

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
stand up although I did the horseshoe

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.590 
stand up although I did the horseshoe
stole<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.370> card<00:05:36.670> and<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.120> wheels<00:05:37.300> were

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
stole the card and the wheels were

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:48.840 
stole the card and the wheels were
stronger<00:05:47.130> there<00:05:48.130> you<00:05:48.280> have<00:05:48.460> the<00:05:48.610> main<00:05:48.820> part

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
stronger there you have the main part

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.350 
stronger there you have the main part
already<00:05:49.750> done<00:05:50.050> we<00:05:50.410> just<00:05:50.440> need<00:05:50.680> to<00:05:50.920> add<00:05:51.070> these

this<00:07:13.639> is<00:07:13.820> a<00:07:13.910> really<00:07:14.270> simple<00:07:14.509> board<00:07:14.990> shape<00:07:15.289> to

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
this is a really simple board shape to

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.020 
this is a really simple board shape to
me<00:07:15.770> I<00:07:15.979> think<00:07:16.190> it's<00:07:16.340> probably<00:07:16.520> the<00:07:16.669> easiest

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.030 
me I think it's probably the easiest

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.020 
me I think it's probably the easiest
good<00:07:17.360> shape<00:07:17.720> I've<00:07:17.930> ever<00:07:18.110> done

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.030 
good shape I've ever done

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.219 
good shape I've ever done
again<00:07:20.030> just<00:07:20.270> because<00:07:20.419> I<00:07:20.509> was<00:07:20.630> full<00:07:20.840> crystal

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:21.229 
again just because I was full crystal

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:24.100 
again just because I was full crystal
and<00:07:21.880> young<00:07:22.880> children<00:07:23.150> might<00:07:23.570> want<00:07:23.780> to<00:07:23.840> make

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.110 
and young children might want to make

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.800 
and young children might want to make
this<00:07:24.380> one<00:07:25.060> so<00:07:26.060> there<00:07:26.210> we<00:07:26.360> have<00:07:26.509> the<00:07:26.630> main

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:26.810 
this one so there we have the main

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.300 
this one so there we have the main
section<00:07:27.289> but<00:07:27.380> obviously<00:07:27.620> that's<00:07:27.889> not<00:07:28.070> much

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.310 
section but obviously that's not much

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.040 
section but obviously that's not much
good<00:07:28.550> on<00:07:28.699> its<00:07:28.820> own<00:07:28.940> it<00:07:29.150> won't<00:07:29.330> stand<00:07:29.630> that<00:07:29.840> much

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.050 
good on its own it won't stand that much

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:38.700 
good on its own it won't stand that much
at<00:07:30.229> all

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.770 

you
