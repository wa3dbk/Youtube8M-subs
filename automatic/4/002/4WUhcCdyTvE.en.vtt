00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 in this room after purchase 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.179
 apartment owner has already been installed 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.670
 very wide window sill which 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.160
 significantly overlaps battery plus on 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.440
 battery still grilles decorative hang 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.710
 wide window sill violates the natural 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.060
 cadence air then drive blue 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.369
 glass fogging 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.619
 Naturally drops already on the windowsill and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.599
 two options for the repair process replace 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.460
 windowsill but if wide is required 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.250
 window sill as one of the options 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.090
 reduced fogging can be put here 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.129
 such here screw lattice that not all 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.809
 present 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.960
 ordinary vent vent which 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.120
 jumpers are at an angle and 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.030
 accordingly drill a mill and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:54.090
 hole sill and paste our 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.660
 grate and a small stream of warm 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.420
 air sent directly to 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.609
 window please pay attention to the sash 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.890
 which do not open because 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.990
 opening up 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.960
 part of the window opening sash always 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.970
 can be put on micro airing 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.750
 I want to note this is not a panacea for a hundred 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.180
 percent you don't win fogging but 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.830
 as a small issue with the position 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.990
 there is not only so small 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.520
 round lattice screw can still 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.189
 rectangular shape 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.259
 but no more bulky when can 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.939
 something fall there pencil so much more 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:37.020
 but this is a matter of your taste desires 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:39.689
 color form on remains choice is not yours 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.360
 such a small tip thanks for 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.640
 attention with you as always was Alexander

 smolin subscribe to my channel 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.310
 but 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.860
 she awards
