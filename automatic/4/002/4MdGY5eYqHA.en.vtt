00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:15.940
 we did not do very well after a fall 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.919
 like that we never go very well one night 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.609
 difficult in lorie has aches 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.970
 all over 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.439
 so I take the start 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.419
 I'll see how it's going, hoping 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.929
 that the pain fades over 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.849
 kilometers 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.870
 yes it's burning a little bit everywhere 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.700
 so 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:34.210
 it takes time too a little more 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.740
 of energy in the bandages so here 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.050
 I can spend the day it will be 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.400
 gained here so the approach must 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.820
 absolutely have but we will come there 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.830
 lockers 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.540
 I see a place eligible for 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.760
 take advantage of the aspiration to appear in 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.059
 the first 5,400 will raise a bad 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.280
 time the ten boxes and ride the 500 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.600
 first meters a little bit to end then 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.860
 happened to face sierre peace 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.920
 of allah of quebec without breathing 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.860
 will exist ours we teaser 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.760
 jean-christophe this is the management of 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.739
 the effort well in the middle 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.970
 I do not care you do not do 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.430
 do not you say that kind of service 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.020
 with a friend you take care of others 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.610
 acted so we see today 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.420
 alexis we recover well running saying 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.280
 that a possibility 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.440
 you are expert in this climb you 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.790
 has gone up several times we say good 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.560
 that he has possibility of doing two 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.970
 things and romaine and that she's eating 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.800
 to make a nice climb I then have 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.230
 the legs are there I have the ability 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.420
 we had to react after these two 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.830
 irin steps she starts angry strong the 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.540
 guy and it's going on too putting a 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.870
 time again sir in the head and the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.870
 mental ok go 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.230
 during all 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.230
 meet 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.460
 I have not I'm sick of banks a 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.850
 second goal scorer like that I had 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.369
 two years but I do not know what to say 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.680
 girl here I really saw myself 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.550
 to win after thibault returns to me 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.150
 and here I started a little bit in 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.200
 the hard so past one end the clinic is getting 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.370
 resumes and I do not know what does 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.069
 thibault in the bend and gas 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.690
 central here it is a shame that these 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.630
 we are friends we are 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.760
 have we both missed our turn 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.010
 for the moment full of good stop 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.730
 our fingers can win so that's 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.730
 extremely disappointing 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.270
 it's a lot and I are also arrives 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.650
 movement 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.330
 it remains an honor to be presented 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.209
 to the president the republic 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.260
 I was a brave person who was 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.060
 an example for France 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.190
 good I think it's a bit 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.390
 presumptuous anyway discourage one in 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.590
 saw others today there are others 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.480
 people who went ashore and who 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.269
 have finished the stage I think especially about 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.250
 jeremy roy like that so I'm not the 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.760
 only brave if it's if it's 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.709
 courage it remains a man like all 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.060
 others but it's also their 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.780
 representatives of all the French so 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.780
 an honor 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.629
 a hard balance to find what I have 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.550
 at the prevailing disappointment is good despite 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.440
 everything we did a nice step towards a 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.599
 third place I do not know the place 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.610
 of yann exactly here but after 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.230
 still frustration disappointment 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.400
 is still present on roma was 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.230
 surely the strongest of the group in 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.640
 this climb he did not miss big 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.290
 thing for Roman looks on arm 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.299
 this finishing line to fine 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.590
 So here's a mixed feeling 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.670
 america mans more frustration than 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.670
 few players
