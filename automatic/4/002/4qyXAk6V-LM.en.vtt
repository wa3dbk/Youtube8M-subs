00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.800 
good morning so a couple you guys on my
8th<00:00:04.589> gen<00:00:04.950> asked<00:00:05.400> me<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.670> show<00:00:06.270> how<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.509> do<00:00:06.660> the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
8th gen asked me to show how to do the

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.970 
8th gen asked me to show how to do the
coolant<00:00:07.410> bypass<00:00:07.560> on<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.519> i-4<00:00:09.349> so<00:00:10.349> if<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.710> take

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
coolant bypass on the i-4 so if you take

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.560 
coolant bypass on the i-4 so if you take
a<00:00:11.040> look<00:00:12.559> that<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:14.099> throttle<00:00:14.580> body<00:00:14.730> for

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
a look that is the throttle body for

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.660 
a look that is the throttle body for
those<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.870> didn't<00:00:16.170> know<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:17.250> drove<00:00:17.460> to

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
those that didn't know I just drove to

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.590 
those that didn't know I just drove to
work<00:00:17.850> this<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.990> cool<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.859> touch<00:00:20.600> like

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
work this is cool to the touch like

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.109 
work this is cool to the touch like
I<00:00:21.720> could<00:00:21.930> put<00:00:22.740> my<00:00:22.859> tongue<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.310> if<00:00:23.939> I

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
I could put my tongue on that if I

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.890 
I could put my tongue on that if I
wanted<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> not<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.470> I'm<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.900> drive

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
wanted to not that I'm going to drive

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.870 
wanted to not that I'm going to drive
around<00:00:28.019> touch<00:00:28.710> your<00:00:28.920> throttle<00:00:29.250> body<00:00:29.429> before

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
around touch your throttle body before

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.849 
around touch your throttle body before
you<00:00:30.150> do<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.359> bypass<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.990> guarantee<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.740> gonna

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
you do the bypass I guarantee it's gonna

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.870 
you do the bypass I guarantee it's gonna
be<00:00:32.009> hot<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.989> because<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.350> reason<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:35.010> if

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
be hot as because the reason is if

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.389 
be hot as because the reason is if
you<00:00:36.000> look<00:00:36.239> over<00:00:36.600> here<00:00:36.950> you're<00:00:37.950> gonna<00:00:38.100> have

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you look over here you're gonna have

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.299 
you look over here you're gonna have
this<00:00:38.760> little<00:00:39.120> pipe<00:00:39.540> right<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.219> filled<00:00:41.219> with

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
this little pipe right here filled with

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.360 
this little pipe right here filled with
coolant<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.300> hot<00:00:42.600> right<00:00:42.809> now<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:44.250> you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
coolant that is hot right now and if you

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.729 
coolant that is hot right now and if you
look<00:00:44.700> my<00:00:45.300> should<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.750> tucked<00:00:46.050> away<00:00:46.230> right

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
look my should just tucked away right

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.650 
look my should just tucked away right
there<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:49.170> sort<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.559> zip<00:00:49.800> tied<00:00:50.070> over<00:00:50.430> here<00:00:50.940> but

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
there and sort of zip tied over here but

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.619 
there and sort of zip tied over here but
you<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.110> yours<00:00:52.789> this<00:00:53.789> little<00:00:54.149> thing<00:00:54.420> right

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
you on yours this little thing right

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.819 
you on yours this little thing right
here<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:55.289> gonna<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.600> kinda<00:00:58.079> and

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.910 

basically<00:01:01.829> there's<00:01:02.129> gonna<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> tube<00:01:03.559> if<00:01:04.559> you

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
basically there's gonna be a tube if you

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.929 
basically there's gonna be a tube if you
look<00:01:05.220> there's<00:01:05.729> an<00:01:05.880> ending<00:01:06.240> there<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
look there's an ending there and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.410 
look there's an ending there and
we're<00:01:09.330> ending<00:01:09.840> there<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.430> those<00:01:11.670> two<00:01:11.939> endings

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
we're ending there so those two endings

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.120 
we're ending there so those two endings
you<00:01:13.729> still<00:01:14.729> one<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.180> them<00:01:15.530> if<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.920> get

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you still one of them if we can get

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.270 
you still one of them if we can get
under<00:01:17.549> there<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.470> those<00:01:19.619> rubber<00:01:19.950> caps

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
under there if you see those rubber caps

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.760 
under there if you see those rubber caps
right<00:01:20.520> there<00:01:20.960> those<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> holes<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
right there those are the holes on the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.210 
right there those are the holes on the
throttle<00:01:23.159> body<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.810> yours<00:01:25.619> there's

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
throttle body so on yours there's

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.539 
throttle body so on yours there's
coolant<00:01:26.850> running<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.780> one<00:01:28.350> way<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.860> out<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
coolant running in one way and out the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.850 
coolant running in one way and out the
other<00:01:29.579> way<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.430> basically<00:01:33.380> this<00:01:34.380> cost<00:01:34.680> me

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
other way so basically this cost me

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.980 
other way so basically this cost me
about<00:01:34.950> $6<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.900> Pep<00:01:36.900> Boys<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.350> off<00:01:38.509> get<00:01:39.509> little

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
about $6 a Pep Boys and off get little

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.700 
about $6 a Pep Boys and off get little
rubber<00:01:40.229> caps<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.460> cap<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:43.140> end<00:01:43.409> of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
rubber caps like that to cap the end of

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.660 
rubber caps like that to cap the end of
the<00:01:43.939> throttle<00:01:44.939> body<00:01:45.060> parts<00:01:46.009> I<00:01:47.009> heard<00:01:47.460> some

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the throttle body parts I heard some

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.550 
the throttle body parts I heard some
people<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:48.090> leave<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.420> cap<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.079> whatever

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
people just leave it on cap but whatever

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.719 
people just leave it on cap but whatever
cap<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.369> case<00:01:50.549> doesn't<00:01:51.540> cost<00:01:51.810> much<00:01:52.729> so

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
cap it just in case doesn't cost much so

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.210 
cap it just in case doesn't cost much so
then<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:56.130> last<00:01:56.430> thing<00:01:56.909> was

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.399 

these<00:02:01.150> two<00:02:01.600> wires<00:02:01.810> right<00:02:02.229> here

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.940 

we<00:02:05.409> had<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.710> connect<00:02:06.250> because<00:02:07.060> I<00:02:07.240> guess<00:02:07.450> or<00:02:08.259> not

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
we had to connect because I guess or not

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.260 
we had to connect because I guess or not
wires<00:02:09.220> but<00:02:09.580> you<00:02:09.700> know<00:02:09.789> what<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:09.970> mean

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
wires but you know what I mean

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.640 
wires but you know what I mean
we<00:02:10.630> had<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.810> connect<00:02:11.290> with<00:02:11.500> like<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.680> brass

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
we had to connect with like a brass

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.710 
we had to connect with like a brass
little<00:02:14.650> piping<00:02:15.220> thing<00:02:15.489> we<00:02:15.670> got<00:02:15.819> it<00:02:15.970> ah<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.600> was

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
little piping thing we got it ah it was

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.320 
little piping thing we got it ah it was
like<00:02:16.870> cone-shaped<00:02:17.620> on<00:02:17.830> one<00:02:18.100> end<00:02:18.330> then

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
like cone-shaped on one end then

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.610 
like cone-shaped on one end then
circular<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.140> middle<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.500> then

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
circular in the middle and then

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.570 
circular in the middle and then
cone-shaped<00:02:21.220> on<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.489> other<00:02:21.640> end<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:23.410> if<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:27.010> it

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
cone-shaped on the other end so if so it

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.190 
cone-shaped on the other end so if so it
was<00:02:27.790> like<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:29.260> was<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.900> then

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
was like it was like that that and then

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.660 
was like it was like that that and then
like<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.380> circle<00:02:32.920> in<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.010> middle<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.550> then

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
like a circle in the middle and then

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.199 
like a circle in the middle and then
like<00:02:34.320> triangular<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.620> other<00:02:35.769> way<00:02:35.950> again<00:02:36.209> so

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
like triangular the other way again so

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.550 
like triangular the other way again so
you<00:02:37.269> stick<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:37.930> one<00:02:38.170> side<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.739> tube<00:02:40.560> I'm

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
you stick it in one side of the tube I'm

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.660 
you stick it in one side of the tube I'm
gonna<00:02:41.680> stick<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:41.950> on<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.100> other<00:02:42.250> side<00:02:42.489> of<00:02:42.610> the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
gonna stick it on the other side of the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.440 
gonna stick it on the other side of the
tube<00:02:42.910> we<00:02:43.209> clamped<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:45.550> then<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.940> goes<00:02:46.120> in

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
tube we clamped it so then it goes in

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.150 
tube we clamped it so then it goes in
here<00:02:47.790> through<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.970> metal<00:02:49.239> thing<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.160> then

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
here through the metal thing and then

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.930 
here through the metal thing and then
back<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.550> there

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
back in there

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.770 
back in there
so<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.540> coolant<00:02:53.230> never<00:02:53.650> enters<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:55.390> throttle

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
so the coolant never enters the throttle

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.160 
so the coolant never enters the throttle
body<00:02:56.459> drive<00:02:57.459> around<00:02:57.790> touch<00:02:58.660> your<00:02:58.840> throttle

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
body drive around touch your throttle

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.670 
body drive around touch your throttle
body<00:03:00.670> will<00:03:00.819> be<00:03:00.850> cold<00:03:01.350> it's<00:03:02.350> pretty<00:03:02.560> easy

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
body will be cold it's pretty easy

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.539 
body will be cold it's pretty easy
to<00:03:02.830> figure<00:03:03.040> out<00:03:03.220> just<00:03:03.870> take<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.900> look<00:03:05.110> at<00:03:05.549> what

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
to figure out just take a look at what

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.289 
to figure out just take a look at what
mine<00:03:06.760> does<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.530> do<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.650> same<00:03:09.299> basically

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
mine does and do the same basically

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.490 
mine does and do the same basically
the<00:03:10.690> goal<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.579> have<00:03:12.579> no<00:03:12.850> coolant<00:03:13.269> coming<00:03:14.079> into

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
the goal is have no coolant coming into

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.120 
the goal is have no coolant coming into
that<00:03:14.650> throttle<00:03:15.190> body<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.829> can<00:03:17.860> figure

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
that throttle body and you can figure

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.370 
that throttle body and you can figure
that<00:03:18.220> out<00:03:18.370> by<00:03:18.549> looking<00:03:18.880> at<00:03:19.090> those<00:03:19.269> two<00:03:19.380> little

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
that out by looking at those two little

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.560 
that out by looking at those two little
ports<00:03:20.709> I<00:03:20.950> think<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.370> top<00:03:21.610> one<00:03:21.820> goes<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.180> bottom

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
ports I think the top one goes in bottom

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.800 
ports I think the top one goes in bottom
one<00:03:22.690> comes<00:03:22.900> out<00:03:23.730> alright<00:03:24.730> good<00:03:25.570> luck

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
one comes out alright good luck

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.650 
one comes out alright good luck
later
