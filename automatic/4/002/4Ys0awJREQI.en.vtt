then how to use it now has its perks as

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.540 
then how to use it now has its perks as
you<00:00:32.050> can<00:00:32.110> see<00:00:32.230> we<00:00:32.410> load<00:00:32.649> up<00:00:32.680> cydia<00:00:32.980> it<00:00:33.280> has<00:00:33.399> to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
you can see we load up cydia it has to

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.330 
you can see we load up cydia it has to
reload<00:00:33.850> and<00:00:34.030> all<00:00:34.090> that<00:00:34.270> stuff<00:00:34.450> but<00:00:34.980> with<00:00:35.980> I<00:00:36.010> see

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
reload and all that stuff but with I see

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.040 
reload and all that stuff but with I see
it<00:00:36.520> doesn't<00:00:36.790> do<00:00:36.880> that<00:00:37.030> it's<00:00:37.270> way<00:00:37.420> faster<00:00:37.660> and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
it doesn't do that it's way faster and

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.870 
it doesn't do that it's way faster and
more<00:00:38.140> efficient<00:00:38.590> and<00:00:39.280> it<00:00:39.489> could<00:00:39.610> even<00:00:39.760> be

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
more efficient and it could even be

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.420
