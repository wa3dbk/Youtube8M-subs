00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
minutes to use it but that is the price

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.640 
minutes to use it but that is the price
is<00:01:05.939> negligible<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.930> main<00:01:07.110> thing<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.439> just

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
is negligible the main thing is just

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.620 
is negligible the main thing is just
looks<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.040> little<00:01:08.070> bit<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.520> an<00:01:08.610> annoyance<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.390> do

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
looks a little bit of an annoyance to do

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.200 
looks a little bit of an annoyance to do
that<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.740> keep<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.100> mind<00:01:11.250> other

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
that so just keep that in mind other

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.690 
that so just keep that in mind other
things<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.659> would<00:01:12.720> highly<00:01:13.049> suggest<00:01:13.080> are<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:14.159> coal

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
things I would highly suggest are a coal

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.460 
things I would highly suggest are a coal
bag<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.479> number<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:15.990> thing<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.290> suggest

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
bag that is number one thing I suggest

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.070 
bag that is number one thing I suggest
that<00:01:16.799> speeds<00:01:17.070> up<00:01:17.299> everything<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.570> much<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
that speeds up everything so much and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.270 
that speeds up everything so much and
really<00:01:19.320> makes<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.650> lot<00:01:19.770> more<00:01:19.830> profitable

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
really makes it a lot more profitable

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.850 
really makes it a lot more profitable
other<00:01:20.970> things<00:01:21.299> are<00:01:21.570> weight<00:01:22.229> reduce<00:01:22.470> clothing

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
other things are weight reduce clothing

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.770 
other things are weight reduce clothing
and<00:01:23.040> ferry<00:01:23.460> rings<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.880> pretty<00:01:24.299> basic<00:01:24.509> stuff

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and ferry rings so pretty basic stuff

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.780 
and ferry rings so pretty basic stuff
there<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.409> coal<00:01:25.590> bag<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.950> fairly

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
there but the coal bag is fairly

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.850 
there but the coal bag is fairly
essential<00:01:27.090> into<00:01:27.479> making<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.080> most<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.619> can't

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
essential into making the most you can't

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.249 
essential into making the most you can't
out<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> blast<00:01:29.520> furnace<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.600> now<00:01:30.780> let's

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
out of the blast furnace so now let's

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.740 
out of the blast furnace so now let's
move<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.130> position<00:01:32.579> where<00:01:32.750> blast

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
move on to the position where blast

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.170 
move on to the position where blast
furnace<00:01:34.140> actually<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.430> blast<00:01:35.759> furnace<00:01:36.090> is

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
furnace actually is so blast furnace is

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.899 
furnace actually is so blast furnace is

a<00:01:41.670> few<00:01:42.090> different<00:01:42.360> ways<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.780> I'm<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
a few different ways and I'm going to

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.350 
a few different ways and I'm going to
explain<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.009> more<00:01:44.189> obvious<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.790> easy<00:01:45.030> ones

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
explain the more obvious and easy ones

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.810 
explain the more obvious and easy ones
to<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.409> first<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.950> probably<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.549> best

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
to you the first and probably the best

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.600 
to you the first and probably the best
way<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.329> there<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:49.170> use<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.920> fairy

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
way to get there is to use the fairy

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.960 
way to get there is to use the fairy
ring<00:01:50.880> code<00:01:51.439> dks<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:53.220> brings<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.579> right

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
ring code dks and this brings you right

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.639 
ring code dks and this brings you right
outside<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.540> entrance<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> cave<00:01:55.380> that

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
outside the entrance to the cave that

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.100 
outside the entrance to the cave that
leads<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.729> underground<00:01:57.180> city<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:58.079> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
leads to the underground city so that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.719 
leads to the underground city so that
one<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.469> probably<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.920> fastest<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
one is probably the fastest and the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.440 
one is probably the fastest and the
easiest<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.689> other<00:02:01.820> probably<00:02:02.820> common<00:02:03.240> ways

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
easiest to do other probably common ways

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.230 
easiest to do other probably common ways
to<00:02:03.990> get<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:04.409> are<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:05.280> use<00:02:05.399> an<00:02:05.549> enchanted<00:02:06.060> lyre

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
to get here are to use an enchanted lyre

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.839 
to get here are to use an enchanted lyre
to<00:02:06.840> teleport<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.619> near<00:02:07.890> ellika<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.550> then

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
to teleport you near ellika and then

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.369 
to teleport you near ellika and then
just<00:02:09.090> run<00:02:09.239> east<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> little<00:02:10.050> bit<00:02:10.140> north

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
just run east and a little bit north

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.380 
just run east and a little bit north
towards<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.770> mountains<00:02:11.129> or<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.030> need<00:02:12.239> to

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
towards the mountains or if you need to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.699 
towards the mountains or if you need to
teleport<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.200> Camelot

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
teleport to Camelot

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.830 
teleport to Camelot
and<00:02:13.829> then<00:02:14.189> run<00:02:14.430> north<00:02:14.730> along<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.390> road<00:02:15.599> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
and then run north along the road and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.270 
and then run north along the road and
then<00:02:16.230> when<00:02:16.409> you<00:02:16.500> reach<00:02:16.680> relic<00:02:17.010> I'll<00:02:17.129> go<00:02:17.250> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
then when you reach relic I'll go a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.220 
then when you reach relic I'll go a
little<00:02:17.459> bit<00:02:17.640> east<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:18.120> north<00:02:18.599> there<00:02:19.049> should

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
little bit east and north there should

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.539 
little bit east and north there should
be<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.349> map<00:02:19.560> on<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.739> screen<00:02:19.829> now<00:02:20.189> kind<00:02:20.459> of

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
be a map on the screen now kind of

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.399 
be a map on the screen now kind of
showing<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.849> exactly<00:02:21.299> where<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.629> go<00:02:21.840> but

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
showing you exactly where to go but

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.959 
showing you exactly where to go but
overall<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:22.920> really<00:02:23.010> not<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.459> hard<00:02:23.790> to

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
overall it's really not that hard to

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.420 
overall it's really not that hard to
find<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.930> once<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.319> are<00:02:25.349> in<00:02:25.709> Kaldur<00:02:26.250> Grimm

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
find so once you are in Kaldur Grimm

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.089 
find so once you are in Kaldur Grimm
once<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:27.209> have<00:02:27.390> taken<00:02:27.689> the<00:02:27.780> boat<00:02:27.930> across<00:02:28.230> all

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
once you have taken the boat across all

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.770 
once you have taken the boat across all
you<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.519> do<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.790> run<00:02:29.969> east<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.540> little

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
you have to do is run east and a little

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.589 
you have to do is run east and a little
bit<00:02:30.900> south<00:02:31.139> and<00:02:31.439> you'll<00:02:31.620> see<00:02:31.799> a<00:02:31.829> room<00:02:32.599> with

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
bit south and you'll see a room with

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.240 
bit south and you'll see a room with
some<00:02:33.719> stairs<00:02:33.989> going<00:02:34.170> down<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.680> then<00:02:35.040> down

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
some stairs going down and then down

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.309 
some stairs going down and then down
those<00:02:35.519> stairs<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:36.209> will<00:02:36.239> be<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.629> blaster<00:02:37.139> ins

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
those stairs you will be in blaster ins

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.259 
those stairs you will be in blaster ins
so<00:02:37.560> very<00:02:38.129> simple<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.609> get<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.939> and<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.239> really

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
so very simple to get to and it really

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.149 
so very simple to get to and it really
doesn't<00:02:39.629> take<00:02:39.870> too<00:02:39.989> long<00:02:40.019> it<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.769> little<00:02:41.010> bit

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
doesn't take too long it is a little bit

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.890 
doesn't take too long it is a little bit
out<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.400> way<00:02:41.609> but<00:02:41.879> it's<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.150> too<00:02:42.420> terribly

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
out of the way but it's not too terribly

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.860 
out of the way but it's not too terribly
annoying<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.530> get<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.889> now<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.969> process<00:02:45.599> of

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
annoying to get to now the process of

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.440 
annoying to get to now the process of
what<00:02:46.439> we'll<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.590> doing<00:02:46.859> for<00:02:47.220> blast-furnace<00:02:48.150> is

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
what we'll be doing for blast-furnace is

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.789 
what we'll be doing for blast-furnace is
probably<00:02:48.689> the<00:02:48.810> main<00:02:48.959> part<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.349> video<00:02:49.530> so

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
probably the main part of this video so

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.259 
probably the main part of this video so
I'm<00:02:49.859> gonna<00:02:49.950> try<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.250> spend<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.730> little<00:02:51.060> bit<00:02:51.180> of

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
I'm gonna try to spend a little bit of

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.420 
I'm gonna try to spend a little bit of
time<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.689> this<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.049> kind<00:02:52.409> of<00:02:52.530> clearly<00:02:53.010> explain

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
time on this to kind of clearly explain

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.599 
time on this to kind of clearly explain
it<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.879> now<00:02:54.629> the<00:02:55.560> idea<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.250> very<00:02:56.340> simple

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
it to you now the idea is very simple

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.610 
it to you now the idea is very simple
you<00:02:57.180> take<00:02:57.389> your<00:02:57.569> or<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:58.200> put<00:02:58.379> it<00:02:58.439> on<00:02:58.530> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
you take your or you put it on the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.259 
you take your or you put it on the
conveyor<00:02:58.889> belts<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.639> pick<00:02:59.790> up<00:02:59.939> your<00:03:00.030> bars

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
conveyor belts and you pick up your bars

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.599 
conveyor belts and you pick up your bars
now<00:03:01.019> one<00:03:01.379> thing<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.650> should<00:03:01.709> note<00:03:01.859> is<00:03:02.219> that<00:03:02.280> you

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
now one thing I should note is that you

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.690 
now one thing I should note is that you
do<00:03:02.819> only<00:03:03.180> need<00:03:03.480> half<00:03:03.719> the<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.439> normal<00:03:05.189> amount

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
do only need half the the normal amount

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.330 
do only need half the the normal amount
of<00:03:05.790> coal<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.389> make<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.569> bar<00:03:06.810> for<00:03:07.409> example<00:03:07.530> we'll

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
of coal to make a bar for example we'll

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.220 
of coal to make a bar for example we'll
be<00:03:08.370> using<00:03:08.489> mithril<00:03:09.299> in<00:03:09.359> this<00:03:09.450> video<00:03:09.719> you<00:03:10.200> only

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
be using mithril in this video you only

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.250 
be using mithril in this video you only
need<00:03:10.650> two<00:03:11.010> pieces<00:03:11.849> of<00:03:12.000> coal<00:03:12.329> for<00:03:12.659> every<00:03:12.930> bar<00:03:13.139> of

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
need two pieces of coal for every bar of

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.190 
need two pieces of coal for every bar of
mithril<00:03:13.650> instead<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.400> four<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.019> does

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
mithril instead of four so it does

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.599 
mithril instead of four so it does
reduce<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.799> cost<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.129> lot<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.489> really

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
reduce the cost a lot and really

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.729 
reduce the cost a lot and really
increases<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.180> profit<00:03:18.599> per<00:03:18.720> hour<00:03:18.900> opposed<00:03:19.590> to

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
increases the profit per hour opposed to

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.000 
increases the profit per hour opposed to
just<00:03:19.949> making<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.400> bars<00:03:20.639> now<00:03:21.530> things<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.919> you

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
just making the bars now things that you

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.250 
just making the bars now things that you
should<00:03:23.729> know<00:03:24.180> or<00:03:24.419> have<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.569> general<00:03:24.900> idea<00:03:24.989> of

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
should know or have a general idea of

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.740 
should know or have a general idea of
there<00:03:25.590> are<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.769> few<00:03:26.099> different<00:03:26.609> jobs<00:03:26.669> in<00:03:27.359> blast

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
there are a few different jobs in blast

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.719 
there are a few different jobs in blast
furnace<00:03:27.870> however<00:03:28.769> I'm<00:03:29.010> not<00:03:29.220> gonna<00:03:29.400> cover

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
furnace however I'm not gonna cover

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.729 
furnace however I'm not gonna cover
those<00:03:30.000> right<00:03:30.299> now<00:03:30.329> in<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:31.109> video<00:03:31.409> just

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
those right now in this video just

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:32.750 
those right now in this video just
because<00:03:31.949> I<00:03:32.010> want<00:03:32.159> to<00:03:32.189> keep<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.430> video<00:03:32.609> a

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
because I want to keep this video a

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.879 
because I want to keep this video a
little<00:03:33.030> bit<00:03:33.120> shorter<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.689> mainly<00:03:34.470> focus<00:03:34.769> on

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
little bit shorter and mainly focus on

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.490 
little bit shorter and mainly focus on
the<00:03:34.949> money<00:03:35.250> making<00:03:35.489> portion<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.500> you

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
the money making portion of it so you

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.920 
the money making portion of it so you
should<00:03:37.560> just<00:03:37.709> go<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:37.979> world<00:03:38.250> 358<00:03:39.239> if<00:03:39.599> you<00:03:39.720> want

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
should just go to world 358 if you want

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.479 
should just go to world 358 if you want
to<00:03:40.019> do<00:03:40.139> it<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.319> a<00:03:40.409> group<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.859> is<00:03:40.979> the<00:03:41.129> official

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
to do it in a group that is the official

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.369 
to do it in a group that is the official
blast<00:03:41.669> furnace<00:03:41.970> world<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.449> there<00:03:42.780> is<00:03:42.810> always

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
blast furnace world and there is always

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.020 
blast furnace world and there is always
a<00:03:43.590> large<00:03:43.859> group<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.400> people<00:03:44.549> doing<00:03:44.819> it<00:03:45.000> and

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
a large group of people doing it and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.479 
a large group of people doing it and
it's<00:03:45.180> fairly<00:03:45.419> easy<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.040> basically<00:03:47.040> what<00:03:47.370> you

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
it's fairly easy so basically what you

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.089 
it's fairly easy so basically what you
need<00:03:47.609> to<00:03:47.729> do<00:03:47.849> is<00:03:48.030> just<00:03:48.479> take<00:03:48.659> coal<00:03:48.989> out<00:03:49.349> of<00:03:49.709> your

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
need to do is just take coal out of your

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.890 
need to do is just take coal out of your
bank<00:03:50.280> put<00:03:50.729> it<00:03:50.819> in<00:03:50.909> your<00:03:51.000> coal<00:03:51.180> bag<00:03:51.359> get<00:03:51.720> another

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
bank put it in your coal bag get another

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.780 
bank put it in your coal bag get another
inventory<00:03:52.319> of<00:03:52.409> coal<00:03:52.620> go<00:03:53.159> to<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.430> conveyor

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
inventory of coal go to the conveyor

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.059 
inventory of coal go to the conveyor
belt<00:03:53.909> put<00:03:54.750> both<00:03:54.959> those<00:03:55.199> inventories<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.919> the

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
belt put both those inventories on the

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.099 
belt put both those inventories on the
conveyor<00:03:56.370> belts<00:03:56.729> go<00:03:57.060> back<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.449> bank<00:03:57.659> get

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
conveyor belts go back to the bank get

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.809 
conveyor belts go back to the bank get
your<00:03:58.319> myth<00:03:58.470> put<00:03:58.859> on<00:03:58.979> the<00:03:59.099> conveyor<00:03:59.340> belts<00:03:59.669> and

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
your myth put on the conveyor belts and

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.360 
your myth put on the conveyor belts and
basically<00:04:00.659> wait<00:04:00.930> for<00:04:00.959> your<00:04:01.259> bars<00:04:01.590> so<00:04:02.220> it's

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
basically wait for your bars so it's

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.369 
basically wait for your bars so it's
very<00:04:02.519> simple<00:04:03.090> very<00:04:03.449> straightforward<00:04:03.870> on<00:04:04.259> what

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
very simple very straightforward on what

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.409 
very simple very straightforward on what
you<00:04:04.500> actually<00:04:04.650> have<00:04:04.889> to<00:04:05.159> do<00:04:05.310> now<00:04:06.120> if<00:04:06.329> you

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
you actually have to do now if you

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.629 
you actually have to do now if you
notice<00:04:06.750> when<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.859> bars<00:04:08.099> come<00:04:08.310> out<00:04:08.430> they

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
notice when the the bars come out they

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.759 
notice when the the bars come out they
are<00:04:08.669> red<00:04:09.359> or<00:04:09.599> yellow<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:10.109> little<00:04:10.229> bit<00:04:10.409> of<00:04:10.500> orange

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
are red or yellow a little bit of orange

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.890 
are red or yellow a little bit of orange
I<00:04:10.859> guess<00:04:11.040> they<00:04:11.879> are<00:04:11.909> molten<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:12.689> you<00:04:12.780> do<00:04:12.870> have

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
I guess they are molten so you do have

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.869 
I guess they are molten so you do have
to<00:04:13.079> pour<00:04:13.259> water<00:04:13.530> on<00:04:13.769> them<00:04:13.949> however<00:04:14.280> if<00:04:14.639> someone

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
to pour water on them however if someone

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.849 
to pour water on them however if someone
else<00:04:15.150> does<00:04:15.419> it<00:04:15.569> first<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:16.320> works<00:04:16.680> for

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
else does it first it works for

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.249 
else does it first it works for
everybody<00:04:17.159> so<00:04:17.759> if<00:04:17.970> if<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:18.750> notice<00:04:19.109> that<00:04:19.139> it's

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
everybody so if if you notice that it's

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.349 
everybody so if if you notice that it's
there<00:04:19.500> for<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.739> while<00:04:19.949> it's<00:04:20.549> just<00:04:20.849> molten<00:04:21.180> for<00:04:21.299> a

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
there for a while it's just molten for a

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.940 
there for a while it's just molten for a
while<00:04:21.539> just<00:04:21.959> throw<00:04:22.139> a<00:04:22.169> bucket<00:04:22.409> of<00:04:22.500> water<00:04:22.650> on<00:04:22.740> it

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
while just throw a bucket of water on it

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.890 
while just throw a bucket of water on it
and<00:04:23.039> you'll<00:04:23.130> be<00:04:23.159> fine<00:04:23.279> now<00:04:24.240> since<00:04:24.599> I<00:04:24.779> don't

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
and you'll be fine now since I don't

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
and you'll be fine now since I don't
want<00:04:25.229> this<00:04:25.320> video<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.650> go<00:04:25.830> too<00:04:25.889> long<00:04:26.310> we're<00:04:26.669> not

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
want this video to go too long we're not

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.910 
want this video to go too long we're not
go<00:04:27.130> into<00:04:27.550> very<00:04:28.240> specific<00:04:28.450> super<00:04:29.260> efficient

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
go into very specific super efficient

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.830 
go into very specific super efficient
blast<00:04:30.490> furnace<00:04:30.850> methods<00:04:31.210> so<00:04:31.480> I'm<00:04:31.600> just<00:04:31.750> gonna

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
blast furnace methods so I'm just gonna

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.550 
blast furnace methods so I'm just gonna
leave<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.230> at<00:04:32.320> that

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
leave it at that

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.950 
leave it at that
and<00:04:32.770> if<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.340> are<00:04:33.460> you're<00:04:34.300> still<00:04:34.450> confused

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
and if you are you're still confused

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.480 
and if you are you're still confused
about<00:04:35.080> what<00:04:35.290> to<00:04:35.320> do<00:04:35.530> there<00:04:35.950> should<00:04:36.100> be<00:04:36.190> a<00:04:36.220> video

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
about what to do there should be a video

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.800 
about what to do there should be a video
playing<00:04:36.730> in<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.880> background<00:04:36.970> that<00:04:37.480> kind<00:04:37.690> of

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
playing in the background that kind of

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.770 
playing in the background that kind of
shows<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.290> exactly<00:04:38.950> how<00:04:39.220> I<00:04:39.250> do<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.790> and<00:04:39.880> what

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
shows you exactly how I do it and what

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.080 
shows you exactly how I do it and what
you<00:04:40.810> really<00:04:41.260> need<00:04:41.380> to<00:04:41.560> do<00:04:41.860> so<00:04:42.460> now<00:04:42.730> let's<00:04:42.970> move

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
you really need to do so now let's move

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.640 
you really need to do so now let's move
on<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.540> last<00:04:43.690> part<00:04:43.870> of<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.260> guide<00:04:44.410> which

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
on to the last part of the guide which

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.530 
on to the last part of the guide which
is<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:45.040> profit<00:04:45.460> which<00:04:45.700> is<00:04:45.850> probably<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.300> main

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
is the profit which is probably the main

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.140 
is the profit which is probably the main
factor<00:04:47.470> on<00:04:47.620> whether<00:04:48.370> or<00:04:48.670> not<00:04:48.760> you<00:04:48.940> actually

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
factor on whether or not you actually

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.510 
factor on whether or not you actually
use<00:04:49.450> this<00:04:49.660> method<00:04:50.050> now<00:04:50.680> I've<00:04:50.920> done<00:04:51.160> blast

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
use this method now I've done blast

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.460 
use this method now I've done blast
furnace<00:04:51.850> for<00:04:52.000> a<00:04:52.060> few<00:04:52.270> hours<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.780> I<00:04:53.230> was

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
furnace for a few hours and I was

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.380 
furnace for a few hours and I was
unfortunately<00:04:53.950> having<00:04:54.430> to<00:04:54.520> do<00:04:54.700> it<00:04:54.820> when<00:04:55.240> the

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
unfortunately having to do it when the

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.330 
unfortunately having to do it when the
servers<00:04:55.690> were<00:04:55.840> getting<00:04:56.130> disconnected<00:04:57.130> on<00:04:57.310> a

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
servers were getting disconnected on a

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.910 
servers were getting disconnected on a
fairly<00:04:57.640> regular<00:04:57.880> basis<00:04:58.480> so<00:04:59.050> these<00:04:59.320> numbers<00:04:59.560> I

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
fairly regular basis so these numbers I

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.530 
fairly regular basis so these numbers I
would<00:05:00.130> say<00:05:00.310> are<00:05:00.520> a<00:05:00.550> little<00:05:00.910> bit<00:05:01.060> on<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.330> low

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
would say are a little bit on the low

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.020 
would say are a little bit on the low
side<00:05:01.570> but<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:02.440> was<00:05:02.710> I<00:05:02.890> did<00:05:03.100> get<00:05:03.370> about<00:05:03.640> an<00:05:03.790> hour

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
side but I was I did get about an hour

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.090 
side but I was I did get about an hour
where<00:05:04.480> I<00:05:04.510> did<00:05:04.780> have<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:05.140> very<00:05:05.350> nice<00:05:05.620> kind<00:05:06.010> of

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
where I did have a very nice kind of

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.120 
where I did have a very nice kind of
clear<00:05:06.490> patch<00:05:06.790> of<00:05:07.170> just<00:05:08.170> server<00:05:08.350> stability<00:05:08.890> so

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
clear patch of just server stability so

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.160 
clear patch of just server stability so
I<00:05:09.190> was<00:05:09.370> able<00:05:09.520> to<00:05:09.670> get<00:05:09.820> a<00:05:09.880> nice<00:05:10.060> hour<00:05:10.330> in<00:05:10.600> and<00:05:10.930> I

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
I was able to get a nice hour in and I

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.930 
I was able to get a nice hour in and I
have<00:05:11.320> factored<00:05:11.740> that<00:05:11.770> into<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:12.160> rates<00:05:12.370> so

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
have factored that into the rates so

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.060 
have factored that into the rates so
what<00:05:13.120> we're<00:05:13.270> looking<00:05:13.300> at<00:05:13.750> is<00:05:14.080> an<00:05:14.350> average<00:05:14.680> of

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
what we're looking at is an average of

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.040 
what we're looking at is an average of
between<00:05:16.470> 136<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:17.650> 200<00:05:18.520> bars<00:05:18.730> per<00:05:19.300> 10<00:05:19.660> minutes

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
between 136 and 200 bars per 10 minutes

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.410 
between 136 and 200 bars per 10 minutes
now<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.920> reason<00:05:21.190> I<00:05:21.340> did<00:05:21.520> 10<00:05:21.760> minute<00:05:22.030> intervals

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
now the reason I did 10 minute intervals

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.080 
now the reason I did 10 minute intervals
for<00:05:22.720> the<00:05:23.020> sample<00:05:23.440> size<00:05:23.590> tests<00:05:24.070> is<00:05:24.190> because<00:05:24.820> I

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
for the sample size tests is because I

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.660 
for the sample size tests is because I
was<00:05:25.330> below<00:05:25.630> 60<00:05:26.050> smithing<00:05:26.440> so<00:05:26.950> I<00:05:27.250> had<00:05:27.400> to<00:05:27.520> pay

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
was below 60 smithing so I had to pay

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.880 
was below 60 smithing so I had to pay
2.5<00:05:28.270> k<00:05:28.510> each<00:05:28.720> time<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.380> it<00:05:29.530> seemed<00:05:29.740> like<00:05:29.860> a

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
2.5 k each time and it seemed like a

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.100 
2.5 k each time and it seemed like a
good<00:05:30.130> marker<00:05:30.430> to<00:05:30.550> go<00:05:30.670> off<00:05:30.820> of<00:05:30.850> so<00:05:31.660> if<00:05:31.930> you

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
good marker to go off of so if you

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.990 
good marker to go off of so if you
multiply<00:05:32.350> that<00:05:32.800> out<00:05:33.010> you're<00:05:33.580> looking<00:05:33.880> at

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
multiply that out you're looking at

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.830 
multiply that out you're looking at
about<00:05:34.380> 816<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.800> 1,200<00:05:36.550> bars<00:05:36.730> per<00:05:37.000> hour<00:05:37.180> now<00:05:37.810> I

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
about 816 to 1,200 bars per hour now I

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.110 
about 816 to 1,200 bars per hour now I
did<00:05:38.230> mention<00:05:38.260> that<00:05:38.560> I<00:05:38.680> was<00:05:38.950> the<00:05:39.700> servers

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
did mention that I was the servers

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.450 
did mention that I was the servers
weren't<00:05:40.450> extremely<00:05:40.990> stable<00:05:41.290> at<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:41.710> time<00:05:41.890> so

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
weren't extremely stable at the time so

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.160 
weren't extremely stable at the time so
I<00:05:42.760> am<00:05:42.850> fully<00:05:43.030> confident<00:05:43.600> that<00:05:43.750> I<00:05:43.810> could<00:05:44.050> have

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
I am fully confident that I could have

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.110 
I am fully confident that I could have
gotten<00:05:44.500> in<00:05:44.860> at<00:05:45.190> least<00:05:45.310> one<00:05:45.640> more<00:05:45.760> inventory

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
gotten in at least one more inventory

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.380 
gotten in at least one more inventory
per<00:05:46.540> those<00:05:46.780> 10<00:05:47.050> minutes<00:05:47.460> very<00:05:48.460> if<00:05:48.730> I<00:05:48.850> had<00:05:49.000> if<00:05:49.270> I

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
per those 10 minutes very if I had if I

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.940 
per those 10 minutes very if I had if I
was<00:05:49.570> playing<00:05:49.900> extremely<00:05:50.230> efficiently<00:05:50.860> and

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
was playing extremely efficiently and

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.890 
was playing extremely efficiently and
the<00:05:51.040> servers<00:05:51.400> were<00:05:51.550> fine<00:05:51.760> so<00:05:52.330> I'm<00:05:52.540> going<00:05:52.780> to

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
the servers were fine so I'm going to

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.040 
the servers were fine so I'm going to
increase<00:05:53.170> that<00:05:53.530> to<00:05:54.160> about<00:05:54.490> 1350<00:05:55.420> which<00:05:55.870> would

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
increase that to about 1350 which would

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.050 
increase that to about 1350 which would
give<00:05:56.140> us<00:05:56.170> one<00:05:56.500> full<00:05:56.770> inventory<00:05:57.100> per<00:05:57.850> 10

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
give us one full inventory per 10

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.670 
give us one full inventory per 10
minutes<00:05:58.330> more<00:05:58.480> so<00:05:58.690> a<00:05:58.930> total<00:05:59.110> of<00:05:59.260> six<00:05:59.320> more

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
minutes more so a total of six more

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.950 
minutes more so a total of six more
inventories<00:06:00.190> per<00:06:00.370> hour<00:06:00.550> so<00:06:01.270> we're<00:06:01.540> looking<00:06:01.840> at

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
inventories per hour so we're looking at

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.900 
inventories per hour so we're looking at
between<00:06:02.700> 816<00:06:03.700> and<00:06:03.910> 1350<00:06:04.840> bars<00:06:05.680> per<00:06:06.190> hour<00:06:06.430> which

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
between 816 and 1350 bars per hour which

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.120 
between 816 and 1350 bars per hour which
is<00:06:07.060> actually<00:06:07.480> a<00:06:07.510> very<00:06:07.630> good<00:06:08.110> profit<00:06:08.560> at<00:06:08.950> the

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
is actually a very good profit at the

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.930 
is actually a very good profit at the
current<00:06:09.460> prices

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
current prices

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.090 
current prices
that's<00:06:10.540> between<00:06:11.100> 322<00:06:12.100> K<00:06:12.340> and<00:06:12.960> 533<00:06:13.960> K<00:06:14.260> so<00:06:14.920> if

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
that's between 322 K and 533 K so if

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.440 
that's between 322 K and 533 K so if
we're<00:06:15.250> just<00:06:15.400> gonna<00:06:15.490> round<00:06:15.760> some<00:06:16.060> stuff<00:06:16.270> off

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
we're just gonna round some stuff off

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.540 
we're just gonna round some stuff off
just<00:06:16.750> make<00:06:16.870> it<00:06:16.990> even<00:06:17.290> five<00:06:17.650> numbers<00:06:18.100> numbers

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
just make it even five numbers numbers

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.130 
just make it even five numbers numbers
ending<00:06:18.730> in<00:06:18.820> five<00:06:19.030> to<00:06:19.240> make<00:06:19.360> it<00:06:19.480> simple<00:06:19.780> we're

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
ending in five to make it simple we're

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.600 
ending in five to make it simple we're
looking<00:06:20.320> at<00:06:20.410> 325<00:06:21.010> -<00:06:21.250> 535<00:06:21.700> K<00:06:22.270> cash<00:06:23.070> profit<00:06:24.070> per

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
require a lot of attention so it's very

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.580 
require a lot of attention so it's very
very<00:06:33.430> easy<00:06:33.520> and<00:06:34.060> it's<00:06:34.300> very<00:06:34.420> simple<00:06:35.410> to<00:06:35.560> just

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
very easy and it's very simple to just

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.140 
very easy and it's very simple to just
mindlessly<00:06:36.280> do<00:06:36.490> it<00:06:36.640> while<00:06:36.790> you're<00:06:36.880> doing

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
mindlessly do it while you're doing

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.550 
mindlessly do it while you're doing
something<00:06:37.360> else<00:06:37.540> say<00:06:37.780> watching<00:06:38.170> a<00:06:38.230> TV<00:06:38.410> show

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
something else say watching a TV show

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.350 
something else say watching a TV show
because<00:06:39.160> it

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
because it

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.300 
because it
does<00:06:39.449> not<00:06:39.599> require<00:06:40.020> a<00:06:40.050> lot<00:06:40.199> of<00:06:40.349> attention<00:06:40.620> so

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
does not require a lot of attention so

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.920 
does not require a lot of attention so
