00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.040 
look at that we're back in the workshop

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.900 
look at that we're back in the workshop
just<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.160> other<00:00:05.250> day<00:00:05.339> I<00:00:06.290> picked<00:00:07.290> up<00:00:07.410> this

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
just the other day I picked up this

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.330 
just the other day I picked up this
camera<00:00:08.910> it's<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.389> Nikon<00:00:09.650> d70<00:00:11.030> from<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:13.340> local

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
camera it's a Nikon d70 from a local

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.390 
camera it's a Nikon d70 from a local
photography<00:00:15.059> sale<00:00:16.190> it<00:00:17.190> was<00:00:17.400> extremely<00:00:18.390> cheap

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
photography sale it was extremely cheap

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.650 
photography sale it was extremely cheap
and<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.520> had<00:00:20.730> no<00:00:20.850> idea<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.240> worked<00:00:21.449> or<00:00:21.600> not

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
and I had no idea if it worked or not

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.939 
and I had no idea if it worked or not
and<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:23.900> had<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> couple<00:00:25.410> days<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.740> finally

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
and I had for a couple days and finally

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.790 
and I had for a couple days and finally
got<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.460> test<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.060> with<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> battery<00:00:27.800> and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
got to test it out with the battery and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.950 
got to test it out with the battery and
it<00:00:29.010> seemed<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.220> work<00:00:29.340> fine<00:00:29.939> except<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.840> would

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
it seemed to work fine except it would

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.530 
it seemed to work fine except it would
not<00:00:31.140> take<00:00:31.470> pictures<00:00:33.230> reliably<00:00:34.969> if<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.239> would

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
not take pictures reliably if you would

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.920 
not take pictures reliably if you would
sit<00:00:36.780> here<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.200> like<00:00:37.410> hit<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.770> shutter<00:00:38.610> button

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
sit here and like hit the shutter button

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.690 
sit here and like hit the shutter button
like<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.230> out<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.410> every<00:00:40.620> 50<00:00:40.920> times<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.610> would

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
like one out of every 50 times you would

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.700 
like one out of every 50 times you would
finally<00:00:42.180> get<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.510> shoot<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.379> then<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
finally get it to shoot and then you

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
finally get it to shoot and then you
could<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.180> pressed<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
could if you like pressed it on the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.930 
could if you like pressed it on the
corner<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:46.920> sometimes<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.820> would

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
corner just right sometimes it would

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.790 
corner just right sometimes it would
shoot<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.390> if<00:00:48.480> you'd<00:00:48.600> like<00:00:48.719> replicated<00:00:49.680> that

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
shoot and if you'd like replicated that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.380 
shoot and if you'd like replicated that
it<00:00:50.039> would<00:00:50.129> shoot<00:00:50.309> again<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.820> again<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.149> again

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
it would shoot again and again and again

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.930 
it would shoot again and again and again
and<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:52.170> you'd<00:00:52.320> lose<00:00:52.530> your<00:00:52.590> spot<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
and then you'd lose your spot and it

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.299 
and then you'd lose your spot and it
would<00:00:54.059> stop<00:00:54.270> shooting<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.260> while<00:00:55.440> it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
would stop shooting in for a while it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.970 
would stop shooting in for a while it
was<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:56.610> impossible<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.809> use<00:00:57.960> obviously<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
was just impossible to use obviously and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.590 
was just impossible to use obviously and
I<00:00:59.070> figured<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.579> was<00:00:59.699> literally<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.480> that

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
I figured it was literally just that

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.119 
I figured it was literally just that
switch<00:01:01.020> because<00:01:01.350> there's<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.620> little<00:01:01.829> bit<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
switch because there's a little bit of a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.810 
switch because there's a little bit of a
dent<00:01:02.309> here<00:01:02.870> on<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> button<00:01:04.559> seems<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
dent here on the button seems like it

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.600 
dent here on the button seems like it
might<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.060> gotten<00:01:06.840> dropped<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:08.100> also<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
might have gotten dropped and also the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.090 
might have gotten dropped and also the
actual<00:01:08.970> power<00:01:09.270> switch<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.229> little<00:01:10.950> bit

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
actual power switch is a little bit

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.340 
actual power switch is a little bit
stiff<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.510> some<00:01:12.689> reason<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:14.159> anyway<00:01:14.400> I

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
stiff for some reason so but anyway I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.320 
stiff for some reason so but anyway I
was<00:01:16.350> going<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.710> replace<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.400> switch<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
was going to replace the switch the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.539 
was going to replace the switch the
little<00:01:18.509> micro<00:01:18.780> switch<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.229> there<00:01:19.549> which

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
little micro switch in there which

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.990 
little micro switch in there which
involved<00:01:21.299> taking<00:01:21.570> out<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.740> lot<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.700> screws

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
involved taking out a lot of screws

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.969 
involved taking out a lot of screws
basically<00:01:24.570> every<00:01:24.960> single<00:01:24.990> side<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.770> this

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
basically every single side of this

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.200 
basically every single side of this
comes<00:01:26.970> off<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> bottom<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.400> then

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
comes off and then the bottom and then

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.120 
comes off and then the bottom and then
finally<00:01:30.780> after<00:01:31.049> unsoldering

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
finally after unsoldering

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.200 
finally after unsoldering
some<00:01:32.850> wires<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> flash<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.259> some<00:01:35.210> some

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
some wires to the flash and some some

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.640 
some wires to the flash and some some
other<00:01:36.299> ground<00:01:36.630> wires<00:01:36.960> over<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.500> could

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
other ground wires over here you could

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.920 
other ground wires over here you could
take<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.040> top<00:01:38.340> part<00:01:38.610> off<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.090> get<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.780> that

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
take this top part off and get to that

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.510 
take this top part off and get to that
switch<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:42.799> unfortunately<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.979> did<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.250> make<00:01:44.460> a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
switch so unfortunately I did not make a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.840 
switch so unfortunately I did not make a
video<00:01:45.259> about<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.990> stay<00:01:48.990> tuned<00:01:49.290> I

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
video about that so if you stay tuned I

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.690 
video about that so if you stay tuned I
will<00:01:50.850> show<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.299> exactly<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.079> did<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.700> this

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
will show you exactly what I did on this

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.420 
will show you exactly what I did on this
thing<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.899> an<00:01:55.110> old<00:01:55.259> Olympus<00:01:55.590> piece<00:01:56.280> of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
thing this is an old Olympus piece of

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.120 
thing this is an old Olympus piece of
crap<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.380> happens<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:58.950> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
crap and it just so happens to have a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.840 
crap and it just so happens to have a
very<00:01:59.460> similar<00:01:59.850> switch<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.530> will<00:02:01.829> be<00:02:02.009> showing

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
very similar switch so I will be showing

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.740 
very similar switch so I will be showing
you<00:02:02.969> what<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> did<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.439> one<00:02:05.450> on<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.869> one

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
you what I did on this one on this one

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.130 
you what I did on this one on this one
okay<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.259> is

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
okay here it is

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.320 
okay here it is
this<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.340> switch<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.670> I'm<00:02:12.970> talking

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
this is the switch that I'm talking

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.660 
this is the switch that I'm talking
about<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:16.920> assume<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.100> one's<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.400> same

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
about and I assume this one's the same

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.559 
about and I assume this one's the same

a second click so and which takes the
picture<00:02:39.760> obviously<00:02:43.200> make<00:02:44.200> sure<00:02:44.230> there's<00:02:44.650> no

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
picture obviously make sure there's no

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.160 
picture obviously make sure there's no
crazy<00:02:46.470> capacitor<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:48.480> want<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.540> shock<00:02:49.720> my<00:02:49.900> cell

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
crazy capacitor I want to shock my cell

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.229 
crazy capacitor I want to shock my cell
phone<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.620> would<00:02:51.160> assume<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:51.550> cameras<00:02:52.030> deep

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
phone I would assume this cameras deep

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.240 
phone I would assume this cameras deep
discharge<00:02:52.690> by<00:02:53.260> now<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:53.590> yeah

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
discharge by now but yeah

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:06.080 
discharge by now but yeah
so<00:02:54.940> looking<00:02:55.750> at<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.959> switch<00:02:56.230> sorry<00:02:58.380> over<00:02:59.380> here

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.449 

you<00:03:07.090> will<00:03:07.360> see<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:08.500> has<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.709> little<00:03:09.130> bit<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.280> a

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
you will see it has a little bit of a

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.880 
you will see it has a little bit of a
tab<00:03:09.730> on<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:10.180> side<00:03:10.480> as<00:03:11.320> well<00:03:11.530> as<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.769> other

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
tab on this side as well as the other

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.240 
tab on this side as well as the other
side<00:03:12.130> but<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.400> can't<00:03:12.580> see<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.880> quite<00:03:13.150> as<00:03:13.330> well

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
side but you can't see it quite as well

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.420 
side but you can't see it quite as well
and<00:03:15.250> what<00:03:15.400> we<00:03:15.430> can<00:03:15.610> do<00:03:15.760> is<00:03:16.150> literally<00:03:17.430> peel

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
and what we can do is literally peel

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.330 
and what we can do is literally peel
this<00:03:18.760> switch<00:03:19.120> open<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:20.799> reason<00:03:21.160> why<00:03:21.280> you

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
this switch open the reason why you

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.340 
this switch open the reason why you
would<00:03:21.820> want<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.030> do<00:03:22.209> this<00:03:22.360> is<00:03:22.690> if<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.320> think

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
would want to do this is if you think

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.390 
would want to do this is if you think
the<00:03:23.620> switch<00:03:23.890> is<00:03:24.070> damaged<00:03:24.549> or<00:03:24.850> dirty<00:03:26.400> or

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
the switch is damaged or dirty or

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.810 
the switch is damaged or dirty or
something<00:03:27.730> like<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.860> there<00:03:30.010> I've<00:03:30.160> popped

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
something like that so there I've popped

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.000 
something like that so there I've popped
it<00:03:31.000> open<00:03:31.680> I'm<00:03:32.680> gonna<00:03:32.890> let<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:34.019> fall<00:03:35.019> open<00:03:35.500> very

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
it open I'm gonna let it fall open very

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.430 
it open I'm gonna let it fall open very
carefully<00:03:37.290> okay<00:03:39.660> obviously<00:03:40.660> if<00:03:41.079> you<00:03:41.200> lose<00:03:41.410> any

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
carefully okay obviously if you lose any

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.680 
carefully okay obviously if you lose any
of<00:03:41.769> these<00:03:41.920> parts<00:03:42.340> you're<00:03:43.120> screwed<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:44.560> switch

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.630 

so<00:03:49.690> here<00:03:52.470> put<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.530> there<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.070> I'll<00:03:54.190> put<00:03:54.370> this

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
so here put that there and I'll put this

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.690 
so here put that there and I'll put this
on<00:03:54.880> my<00:03:55.150> finger<00:03:55.600> we've<00:03:56.380> got<00:03:56.590> this<00:03:56.829> is<00:03:57.040> one<00:03:57.220> one

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
on my finger we've got this is one one

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.350 
on my finger we've got this is one one
of<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.850> plates<00:03:58.120> on<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:58.420> inside<00:03:59.579> which<00:04:02.280> sits

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
of the plates on the inside which sits

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.229 
of the plates on the inside which sits
like<00:04:04.360> this<00:04:05.160> one<00:04:06.160> sits<00:04:06.459> like<00:04:06.610> this<00:04:06.640> and<00:04:07.060> once

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
like this one sits like this and once

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.520 
like this one sits like this and once
it's<00:04:07.510> like<00:04:07.720> this<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:11.019> when<00:04:11.170> you<00:04:11.260> press<00:04:11.470> down

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
it's like this so when you press down

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.190 
it's like this so when you press down
the<00:04:12.130> halfway<00:04:13.200> one<00:04:14.200> switch<00:04:14.530> this<00:04:15.280> little<00:04:15.820> plate

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
the halfway one switch this little plate

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.930 
the halfway one switch this little plate
makes<00:04:17.200> contact<00:04:17.680> with<00:04:17.799> that<00:04:17.919> little<00:04:18.370> plate<00:04:18.609> and

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
makes contact with that little plate and

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.159 
makes contact with that little plate and
then<00:04:19.120> when<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.269> push<00:04:19.419> down<00:04:19.450> all<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.840> way<00:04:19.930> that

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
then when you push down all the way that

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.830 
then when you push down all the way that
little<00:04:20.440> plate<00:04:21.099> makes<00:04:21.700> contact<00:04:22.210> at<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:22.510> bottom

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
little plate makes contact at the bottom

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.490 
little plate makes contact at the bottom
of<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.050> switch

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
of the switch

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.630 
of the switch
this<00:04:24.500> other<00:04:24.650> little<00:04:25.010> place<00:04:25.220> is<00:04:25.310> gonna<00:04:25.430> come

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
this other little place is gonna come

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.500 
this other little place is gonna come
out<00:04:25.670> too<00:04:27.010> but<00:04:28.010> basically<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.060> moral<00:04:29.270> of<00:04:29.450> the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
out too but basically the moral of the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.550 
out too but basically the moral of the
story<00:04:29.570> here<00:04:29.900> is<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.740> can<00:04:31.010> there's<00:04:31.880> that<00:04:32.560> and

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
story here is you can there's that and

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.770 
story here is you can there's that and
there's<00:04:33.740> also<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:34.070> little<00:04:34.310> uh<00:04:34.430> I'll<00:04:35.390> just<00:04:35.540> leave

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
there's also a little uh I'll just leave

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.280 
there's also a little uh I'll just leave
that<00:04:35.930> part<00:04:36.140> in<00:04:36.230> their<00:04:36.850> little<00:04:37.850> disk<00:04:38.090> you<00:04:39.080> can't

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
that part in their little disk you can't

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.760 
that part in their little disk you can't
actually<00:04:39.470> dismantle<00:04:40.400> these<00:04:40.520> switches<00:04:41.060> and

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
actually dismantle these switches and

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.590 
actually dismantle these switches and
sit<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:42.860> clean<00:04:43.520> them<00:04:43.640> up<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:44.090> best<00:04:44.240> you<00:04:44.360> can

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
sit and clean them up the best you can

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.020 
sit and clean them up the best you can
scrape<00:04:45.020> scrape<00:04:45.710> away<00:04:45.860> any<00:04:45.980> oxidation<00:04:46.580> and

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
scrape scrape away any oxidation and

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.970 
scrape scrape away any oxidation and
sometimes<00:04:48.020> you<00:04:48.170> can<00:04:48.260> get<00:04:48.350> them<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:48.560> work<00:04:48.590> again

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
sometimes you can get them to work again

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.790 
sometimes you can get them to work again
without<00:04:49.250> having<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.960> not<00:04:50.960> only<00:04:51.110> find<00:04:51.500> a

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
without having to not only find a

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.550 
without having to not only find a
replacement<00:04:52.220> switch<00:04:52.960> which<00:04:53.960> is<00:04:54.080> relatively

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
replacement switch which is relatively

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.120 
replacement switch which is relatively
easy<00:04:54.800> but<00:04:55.900> if<00:04:56.900> you<00:04:56.960> get<00:04:57.320> an<00:04:57.710> actual

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
easy but if you get an actual

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.620 
easy but if you get an actual
replacement<00:04:58.850> part<00:04:59.090> they're<00:04:59.300> probably<00:04:59.450> gonna

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
replacement part they're probably gonna

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.060 
replacement part they're probably gonna
charge<00:04:59.930> a<00:05:00.050> lot<00:05:00.320> of<00:05:00.440> money<00:05:00.560> for<00:05:00.800> it

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
charge a lot of money for it

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.130 
charge a lot of money for it
I<00:05:01.100> think<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.790> replacements<00:05:02.450> which<00:05:02.600> is<00:05:02.810> just

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
I think the replacements which is just

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.220 
I think the replacements which is just
this<00:05:03.290> little<00:05:03.500> switch<00:05:03.650> here<00:05:04.240> for<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.300> d70<00:05:05.960> on

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
this little switch here for the d70 on

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
this little switch here for the d70 on
ebay<00:05:07.010> was<00:05:07.550> over<00:05:08.420> five<00:05:08.720> bucks<00:05:09.080> just<00:05:09.350> for<00:05:10.040> that

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
ebay was over five bucks just for that

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.600 
ebay was over five bucks just for that
tiny<00:05:10.550> little<00:05:10.700> thing<00:05:11.060> and<00:05:11.660> I<00:05:11.780> didn't<00:05:11.960> want<00:05:12.080> to

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
tiny little thing and I didn't want to

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.530 
tiny little thing and I didn't want to
didn't<00:05:13.610> want<00:05:13.640> to<00:05:13.790> put<00:05:13.910> too<00:05:14.060> much<00:05:14.090> money<00:05:14.420> into

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
didn't want to put too much money into

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.020 
didn't want to put too much money into
the<00:05:14.750> camera<00:05:15.140> especially<00:05:15.710> since<00:05:16.430> I<00:05:16.550> wasn't

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
the camera especially since I wasn't

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.350 
the camera especially since I wasn't
positive<00:05:17.300> if<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:18.200> was<00:05:18.380> the<00:05:18.500> problem<00:05:18.620> yet<00:05:19.360> but

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
positive if that was the problem yet but

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.770 
positive if that was the problem yet but
anyway<00:05:20.710> so<00:05:21.710> what<00:05:22.160> I<00:05:22.190> did<00:05:22.280> on<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.820> d70<00:05:23.630> over

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
anyway so what I did on the d70 over

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.720 
anyway so what I did on the d70 over
there<00:05:23.960> is<00:05:24.170> took<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:24.950> switch<00:05:25.130> part<00:05:25.370> just<00:05:25.580> like

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
there is took the switch part just like

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.230 
there is took the switch part just like
this<00:05:25.910> and<00:05:26.660> then<00:05:26.780> I<00:05:26.810> kind<00:05:27.290> of<00:05:27.350> cleaned<00:05:27.620> away

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
this and then I kind of cleaned away

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.870 
this and then I kind of cleaned away
this<00:05:29.240> this<00:05:29.930> film<00:05:30.290> that<00:05:30.560> was<00:05:30.710> on<00:05:30.860> one<00:05:31.730> of<00:05:31.820> the

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
this this film that was on one of the

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.250 
this this film that was on one of the
switches<00:05:32.090> I<00:05:32.330> think<00:05:32.540> it<00:05:32.630> had<00:05:32.750> gotten<00:05:32.990> some

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
switches I think it had gotten some

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.430 
switches I think it had gotten some
moisture<00:05:33.650> damage<00:05:33.860> on<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.970> bottom<00:05:35.390> the<00:05:36.230> bottom

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
moisture damage on the bottom the bottom

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.540 
moisture damage on the bottom the bottom
plate<00:05:36.920> thing<00:05:38.530> and<00:05:39.530> then<00:05:40.630> which<00:05:41.630> I<00:05:41.750> had<00:05:41.960> to

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
plate thing and then which I had to

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.430 
plate thing and then which I had to
slowly<00:05:43.550> scrape<00:05:44.000> away<00:05:44.180> all<00:05:44.660> that<00:05:44.900> little<00:05:45.230> crap
