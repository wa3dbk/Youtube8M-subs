00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
a printing process called lithography so

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.720 
a printing process called lithography so
we<00:00:21.539> call<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> plating<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:23.340> very<00:00:23.490> easy

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
we call it with a plating it's very easy

here<00:00:44.760> we've<00:00:44.940> got<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.090> couple<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.420> panels<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
here we've got a couple of panels you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.389 
here we've got a couple of panels you
can<00:00:46.320> actually<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.739> some<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
can actually see some of the the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.760 
can actually see some of the the
fastener<00:00:47.910> detail<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.960> panel<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.350> actually<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
fastener detail this panel is actually a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.889 
fastener detail this panel is actually a
hinged<00:00:50.070> opening<00:00:51.059> panel<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> full<00:00:51.660> scale

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
hinged opening panel on the full scale

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.240 
hinged opening panel on the full scale
and<00:00:52.430> it<00:00:53.430> actually<00:00:53.610> has<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:54.420> call<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:55.250> cow

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and it actually has what they call a cow

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.670 
and it actually has what they call a cow
fax<00:00:56.610> fastener<00:00:57.210> which<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.480> kind<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.260> screw

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
fax fastener which is kind of a screw

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.860 
fax fastener which is kind of a screw
but<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.609> actually<00:00:59.879> an<00:00:59.969> Allen<00:01:00.300> headed<00:01:00.600> screw

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
but it's actually an Allen headed screw

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.709 
but it's actually an Allen headed screw
instead<00:01:01.640> so<00:01:02.640> they<00:01:02.670> pretty<00:01:03.210> much<00:01:03.300> use<00:01:03.510> those

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
instead so they pretty much use those

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.170 
instead so they pretty much use those
exclusively<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.430> entire<00:01:05.729> front<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> the

exclusively on the entire front of the
airplane<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.810> because<00:01:07.500> they<00:01:07.680> were<00:01:08.180> not<00:01:09.180> very

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
airplane just because they were not very

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.120 
airplane just because they were not very
prone<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.720> vibrating<00:01:10.380> out<00:01:10.530> or<00:01:10.740> breaking

prone to vibrating out or breaking

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.440 
prone to vibrating out or breaking
pretty<00:01:11.970> expensive

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450

coal stuffer an airplane that was

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.840 
coal stuffer an airplane that was
designed<00:01:14.400> back<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.049> 60s<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.140> 70s<00:01:16.670> you<00:01:17.670> see

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
designed back in the 60s and 70s you see

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.100 
designed back in the 60s and 70s you see
there's<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> lot<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.299> panels<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.750> haven't

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
there's a lot of panels that haven't

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.260 
there's a lot of panels that haven't
been<00:01:19.170> done<00:01:19.610> notably<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> ones<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.150> are

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
been done notably the ones that are

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.310 
been done notably the ones that are
around<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:22.049> gun<00:01:22.229> blister<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:23.090> conducts

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
around the gun blister that conducts

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.570 
around the gun blister that conducts
places<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.470> waiting<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> save<00:01:26.430> those

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
places like that waiting to save those

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.850 
places like that waiting to save those
for<00:01:26.640> last<00:01:27.000> just<00:01:27.240> because<00:01:27.330> they're<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.900> are

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
for last just because they're the are

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.490 
for last just because they're the are
the<00:01:28.979> most<00:01:29.100> difficult<00:01:29.909> ones<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.500> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the most difficult ones to do the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.630 
the most difficult ones to do the
airplane<00:01:31.740> does<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> lot<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.220> compound

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
airplane does have a lot of compound

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.249 
airplane does have a lot of compound
curves<00:01:32.880> which<00:01:33.090> makes<00:01:33.390> detailing<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
curves which makes detailing it

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.649 
curves which makes detailing it
extremely<00:01:35.070> difficult<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.299> actually<00:01:36.390> have

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
extremely difficult so we actually have

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.819 
extremely difficult so we actually have
to<00:01:37.490> make<00:01:38.490> molds<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.689> plug<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.470> order<00:01:40.710> to

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
to make molds of the plug in order to

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.030 
to make molds of the plug in order to
make<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.430> aluminum<00:01:41.790> detail<00:01:42.180> sheet<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:43.110> fit<00:01:43.320> so

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
make the aluminum detail sheet to fit so

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.969 
make the aluminum detail sheet to fit so
we're<00:01:44.220> actually<00:01:44.369> doing<00:01:44.549> molds<00:01:45.680> two<00:01:46.680> or<00:01:46.829> three

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
we're actually doing molds two or three

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.289 
we're actually doing molds two or three
different<00:01:47.159> times<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.790> get<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> airplane

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
different times just to get the airplane

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.960 
different times just to get the airplane

more<00:01:53.790> detail<00:01:54.270> showing<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> airplane

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
more detail showing up on the airplane

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.889 
more detail showing up on the airplane
and<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.820> where<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.090> got<00:01:57.270> some<00:01:57.509> places

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and you see where we got some places

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.749 
and you see where we got some places
drawing<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.619> where<00:01:58.770> we<00:01:58.860> need<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.040> add<00:01:59.490> some

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
drawing on where we need to add some

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.450 
drawing on where we need to add some
stuff<00:02:00.140> but<00:02:01.140> there's<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> lot<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.530> little<00:02:02.070> detail

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
stuff but there's a lot of little detail

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.249 
stuff but there's a lot of little detail
that<00:02:02.820> will<00:02:03.149> hopefully<00:02:03.329> show<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> plugs

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
that will hopefully show up in the plugs

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.020 
that will hopefully show up in the plugs
and<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.920> molds<00:02:05.189> themselves<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
have to replicate it on each and

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.000 
have to replicate it on each and
go<00:02:13.520> airplane<00:02:13.700> they<00:02:14.030> buy<00:02:14.680> at<00:02:15.680> least<00:02:15.830> that's<00:02:15.980> the

I won't wait till we get that point
we've<00:02:50.330> got<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.450> wing<00:02:50.600> panel<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.739> they're<00:02:51.860> about

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
we've got a wing panel and they're about

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.009 
we've got a wing panel and they're about
50<00:02:52.310> inches<00:02:52.459> long<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:53.720> piece<00:02:55.690> plus<00:02:56.690> or<00:02:56.810> minus

50 inches long a piece plus or minus
about<00:02:57.170> 10<00:02:57.350> inches<00:02:57.500> probably<00:02:58.400> mark<00:02:58.730> 40<00:02:59.090> inches

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
about 10 inches probably mark 40 inches

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.960 
about 10 inches probably mark 40 inches
in<00:02:59.480> wingspan<00:03:00.050> per<00:03:00.500> panel<00:03:00.739> it's<00:03:01.430> about<00:03:01.550> 110

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
in wingspan per panel it's about 110

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.330 
in wingspan per panel it's about 110
inch<00:03:02.120> wingspan<00:03:02.269> for<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:02.989> airplane<00:03:03.350> you'll

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
inch wingspan for the airplane you'll

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.949 
inch wingspan for the airplane you'll
notice<00:03:04.550> we<00:03:04.640> actually<00:03:04.670> have<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.030> little<00:03:05.209> a<00:03:05.480> notch

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
notice we actually have a little a notch

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.250 
notice we actually have a little a notch
out<00:03:06.170> there<00:03:06.470> but<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.340> route<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:09.050> tip

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
out there but the route and the tip

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.840 
out there but the route and the tip
that's<00:03:09.769> actually<00:03:10.100> for<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.250> leading<00:03:10.519> edge<00:03:10.640> so

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
that's actually for a leading edge so

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.240 
that's actually for a leading edge so
that's<00:03:10.970> which<00:03:11.180> will<00:03:11.410> be<00:03:12.410> molded<00:03:12.650> separately

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
that's which will be molded separately

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.130 
that's which will be molded separately
from<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.519> airplane<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.600> then<00:03:14.780> actually<00:03:15.050> be

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
from the airplane and then actually be

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.740 
from the airplane and then actually be
an<00:03:15.230> option<00:03:15.590> on<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:16.100> kits<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:16.519> if<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:17.510> owner

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
an option on the kits on if the owner

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.500 
an option on the kits on if the owner
wants<00:03:18.049> that<00:03:18.170> option<00:03:18.560> or<00:03:18.650> not<00:03:19.239> it<00:03:20.239> we've<00:03:20.360> also

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
wants that option or not it we've also

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.310 
wants that option or not it we've also
got<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.989> recesses<00:03:21.680> for<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:22.070> spoilers<00:03:23.320> chose

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
got the recesses for the spoilers chose

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.500 
got the recesses for the spoilers chose
a<00:03:24.350> different<00:03:24.590> route<00:03:25.370> of<00:03:25.670> doing<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:26.030> from

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
a different route of doing this from

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.539 
a different route of doing this from
Bob's<00:03:26.720> stead<00:03:27.500> of<00:03:27.530> doing<00:03:27.739> it<00:03:27.829> all<00:03:27.920> in<00:03:28.070> one<00:03:28.220> we

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
Bob's stead of doing it all in one we

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.610 
Bob's stead of doing it all in one we
thought<00:03:28.700> just<00:03:29.030> doing<00:03:29.360> it<00:03:29.450> individually<00:03:29.660> or

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
thought just doing it individually or

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.110 
thought just doing it individually or
work<00:03:30.980> out<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.130> little<00:03:31.190> bit<00:03:31.370> better<00:03:31.519> but<00:03:31.940> we'll

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
work out a little bit better but we'll

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.699 
work out a little bit better but we'll
see<00:03:32.299> everybody<00:03:33.110> has<00:03:33.200> their<00:03:33.350> own<00:03:33.380> ways<00:03:33.590> of

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
see everybody has their own ways of

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.750 
see everybody has their own ways of
doing<00:03:33.799> things<00:03:35.079> as<00:03:36.079> we<00:03:36.200> come<00:03:36.410> down<00:03:36.650> here<00:03:37.160> we've

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
doing things as we come down here we've

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.610 
doing things as we come down here we've
got<00:03:37.880> one<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.329> wood<00:03:38.450> strong<00:03:39.140> edge<00:03:39.350> flaps

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620

got one of the wood strong edge flaps
which<00:03:40.280> is<00:03:40.400> already<00:03:40.579> detailed<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:42.290> pretty

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
which is already detailed and pretty

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.340 
which is already detailed and pretty
much<00:03:42.769> about<00:03:43.130> 90%<00:03:43.640> done<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.959> full-scale

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
much about 90% done the full-scale

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.050 
much about 90% done the full-scale
airplane<00:03:45.709> didn't<00:03:45.980> have<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.100> lot<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.400> visible

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
airplane didn't have a lot of visible

airplane didn't have a lot of visible
fastener<00:03:47.510> detail<00:03:47.870> throughout<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.739> entire

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
fastener detail throughout the entire

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.190 
fastener detail throughout the entire
airframe<00:03:49.280> just<00:03:50.180> mostly<00:03:50.420> in<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.720> high<00:03:50.989> stress

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
airframe just mostly in the high stress

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.199 
airframe just mostly in the high stress
areas<00:03:51.440> and<00:03:51.829> then<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.430> excess<00:03:52.730> pounds<00:03:52.970> for

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
areas and then the excess pounds for

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.240 
areas and then the excess pounds for
maintenance<00:03:53.390> joy<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.380> only<00:03:54.560> places<00:03:54.769> you<00:03:54.920> saw

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
maintenance joy the only places you saw

maintenance joy the only places you saw
dito<00:03:55.690> so<00:03:56.690> here<00:03:56.900> we<00:03:56.989> have<00:03:57.109> pretty<00:03:57.769> much<00:03:57.829> a

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
dito so here we have pretty much a

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.440 
dito so here we have pretty much a
smooth<00:03:58.430> surface<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:59.000> entire<00:03:59.269> way

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
smooth surface the entire way

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.470 
smooth surface the entire way
just<00:04:02.450> like<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.660> full<00:04:02.810> scale<00:04:04.180> down<00:04:05.180> here<00:04:05.359> we've

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
just like the full scale down here we've

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.289 
just like the full scale down here we've
also<00:04:05.630> got<00:04:05.900> one<00:04:05.930> of<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:07.459> solid<00:04:07.880> wood

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
also got one of the the solid wood

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.810 
also got one of the the solid wood
leading<00:04:09.079> edge<00:04:09.200> slats<00:04:09.470> which<00:04:10.459> we'll<00:04:10.579> be<00:04:10.670> using

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
leading edge slats which we'll be using

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.360 
leading edge slats which we'll be using
to<00:04:10.970> make<00:04:11.000> our<00:04:11.299> mold<00:04:11.690> out<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:12.079> this<00:04:12.829> is<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.310> have

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
to make our mold out of this is you have

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.770 
to make our mold out of this is you have
to<00:04:13.519> be<00:04:13.640> fiberglass<00:04:14.120> will<00:04:14.390> probably<00:04:14.630> put<00:04:14.720> a

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
to be fiberglass will probably put a

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.650 
to be fiberglass will probably put a
layer<00:04:15.620> of<00:04:15.829> carbon<00:04:16.070> cloth<00:04:16.370> on<00:04:16.579> it<00:04:16.729> just<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.060> help

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
layer of carbon cloth on it just to help

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.840 
layer of carbon cloth on it just to help
it<00:04:17.750> hold<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.079> straight<00:04:18.519> through<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.609> entire

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
it hold it straight through the entire

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.600 
it hold it straight through the entire
molding<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.390> detailing<00:04:21.049> process<00:04:21.560> because<00:04:21.859> we

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
molding and detailing process because we

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
molding and detailing process because we
really<00:04:22.820> don't<00:04:22.909> want<00:04:23.120> these<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.419> warp

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
really don't want these of the warp

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.420 
really don't want these of the warp
since<00:04:24.050> they're<00:04:24.260> an<00:04:24.409> integral<00:04:24.979> part<00:04:25.280> of<00:04:25.340> the

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
since they're an integral part of the

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.600 
since they're an integral part of the
airplane

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
airplane

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.450

and<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:26.819> leading<00:04:27.060> edge<00:04:27.150> of<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.360> wing<00:04:28.460> so

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
and the leading edge of the wing so

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.600 
and the leading edge of the wing so
that's<00:04:30.120> about<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.330> for<00:04:30.479> the<00:04:30.629> first<00:04:30.810> video<00:04:31.610> so

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
that's about it for the first video so

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.490 
that's about it for the first video so
if<00:04:32.699> anyone<00:04:32.939> has<00:04:32.969> any<00:04:33.120> specific<00:04:33.870> things<00:04:34.349> they'd

videos<00:04:46.110> won't<00:04:46.710> be<00:04:46.860> as<00:04:46.949> quick<00:04:47.159> as<00:04:47.310> Bob's<00:04:47.520> we've

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
videos won't be as quick as Bob's we've

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.510 
videos won't be as quick as Bob's we've
actually<00:04:48.719> got<00:04:49.530> a<00:04:49.560> lot<00:04:49.740> of<00:04:49.889> detailing<00:04:50.219> to<00:04:50.400> do

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
actually got a lot of detailing to do

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.749 
actually got a lot of detailing to do
and<00:04:50.729> there's<00:04:51.629> not<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:51.840> lot<00:04:52.219> to<00:04:53.219> show<00:04:53.400> you<00:04:53.430> really

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
and there's not a lot to show you really

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.209 
and there's not a lot to show you really
and<00:04:54.090> kind<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:54.840> go<00:04:54.960> into<00:04:55.139> depth<00:04:55.319> on<00:04:55.469> how<00:04:55.949> we<00:04:56.009> go

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
and kind of go into depth on how we go

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:57.980 
and kind of go into depth on how we go
to<00:04:56.280> about<00:04:56.400> inform<00:04:57.240> with<00:04:57.360> some<00:04:57.479> of<00:04:57.569> the<00:04:57.629> panel's

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
to about inform with some of the panel's

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.589 
to about inform with some of the panel's
it's<00:04:58.349> pretty<00:04:58.620> simple<00:04:59.009> for<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.400> most<00:04:59.430> part<00:04:59.849> and

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
it's pretty simple for the most part and

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:01.610 
it's pretty simple for the most part and
we'll<00:05:00.689> get<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:00.900> some<00:05:00.990> of<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.169> panels<00:05:01.439> with<00:05:01.560> the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
we'll get to some of the panels with the

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.619 
we'll get to some of the panels with the
ducks<00:05:01.889> and<00:05:02.159> the<00:05:02.219> grills<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:03.029> everything<00:05:03.479> it

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
ducks and the grills and everything it

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.019 
ducks and the grills and everything it
gets<00:05:03.719> a<00:05:03.810> little<00:05:03.900> more<00:05:04.789> detail-oriented<00:05:05.789> and

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:06.029 
gets a little more detail-oriented and

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.760 
gets a little more detail-oriented and
time-consuming<00:05:06.300> which<00:05:06.900> I<00:05:07.199> still<00:05:07.590> haven't

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
time-consuming which I still haven't

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.899 
time-consuming which I still haven't
figured<00:05:07.949> out<00:05:08.129> how<00:05:08.250> I'm<00:05:08.310> gonna<00:05:08.430> do<00:05:08.610> most<00:05:08.789> of

figured out how I'm gonna do most of

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.409 
figured out how I'm gonna do most of
those<00:05:09.090> to<00:05:09.870> be<00:05:09.990> a<00:05:10.020> learning<00:05:10.319> process<00:05:10.529> for<00:05:10.770> all
