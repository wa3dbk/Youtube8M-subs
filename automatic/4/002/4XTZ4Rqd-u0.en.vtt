00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.552
Different types of forehand flick

00:00:07.068 --> 00:00:17.734
Now, forehand lift, forehand flick, How many different types of forehand flick are there?

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:22.903
number 1 for beginners, they do that

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:25.485
back swing

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:35.820
that's good when some body is learning, for pure beginners

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:48.662
this is good to learn, the right movement, but when you get better, this is too big and takes too much time

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:53.779
and you must try to hold and flick

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:54.612
like this

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:55.905
net flick

00:00:57.503 --> 00:00:58.572
net flick

00:00:59.887 --> 00:01:00.920
net flick

00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:03.439
net flick

00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:10.443
for that deceptive flick, you saw opponent net play

00:01:10.443 --> 00:01:17.629
and last minute flick, you must use your fingers

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:29.001
but I will demonstrate technique of these different kinds of flicks

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:35.571
now next one is same, when you are late

00:01:43.204 --> 00:01:43.802
ok

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.519
hold lift

00:01:47.453 --> 00:01:55.405
now, more deceptive, hold and drop and then flick

00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:08.521
so, because you drop it, your opponent will come forward and then flick

00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:11.090
this one can be done in both ways

00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:14.088
hold lift

00:02:15.205 --> 00:02:17.206
hold drop cross

00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:19.388
hold drop cross

00:02:20.224 --> 00:02:21.879
hold drop flick

00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:35.433
so you can develop, you can add more deceptions if you make the basic technique right

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:38.534
which is, what is basic?

00:02:38.534 --> 00:02:40.384
what ever you do hold

00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:42.199
hold

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.201
its basic

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:45.880
hold net

00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:48.184
hold flick

00:02:49.483 --> 00:02:51.049
hold drop flick

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:53.382
hold drop cross

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:58.749
so hold is the key basic

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.701
but don't worry I will go through one by one
