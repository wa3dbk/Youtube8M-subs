00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.880
 Which is 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:23.910
 a Today is a little , I will try to talk about a compact camera a little 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.630
 Canon's recently launched powershot sx 280 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.600
 There is an interesting camera 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.840
 Cat 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.780
 But it's not in the original doing this 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.469
 A photo for a moment here 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.469
 Make a ride to 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:43.989
 What is this 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:45.300
 If you wanted to talk about powershot sx 200 first week , you would say 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.670
 camera 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.300
 I'm such since I began to a little this hobby I mean Tazusa Hata monkey 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.680
 It is in the Kahonto initial the c series to go Canon 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.440
 And liked because Les logic engine 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.809
 your 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:09.980
 Is in a nutshell that is in takes in the Raiko from the lens if there turtle 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:13.820
 It's such not be processed the clean of Toka many things of the image in the video engine 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.080
 It is scanning the Tteyuu logic in the imaging engine to the Dejikku engine image processing 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.120
 It's really excellent 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.320
 Doing color control Toka kind of the focus of the response Curse It is beautiful for a long time 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.550
 I guess it will 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.820
 It 's great and I like it all the time with Canon cameras 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:32.600
 And it went the more and more high-version up to Tteyuu logic Te 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.230
 It is an executable file because it is now mainstream and now 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.090
 Jar that 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:42.180
 There is also an image ng called 5 that even the existing single-lens reflex camera is in action . 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.780
 There Is that now recently not a whole 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.850
 Together 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:53.020
 So the wintering Digic engine latest version Digic 6 is this 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.760
 It was mounted while hitting the powershot sx 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.770
 This time the person still image 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:07.159
 So we have some hard warp Well, I do not even so much of that function 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:10.979
 But such a thing has been the performance of the moving image recording anymore Sashioi becomes another was really good 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:16.080
 I would like to give it a bit 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:22.120
 For example, due to the chic nature of the Digic engine, the movie performance of the compact camera 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:27.790
 Really I'd be surprised has been enhanced camera shake correction has put 5 Jikute shake correction 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:32.080
 8 to say Do and its 5 Jikute shake correction of the camera what kind of things the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:35.590
 I think that it is this camera that I think that 5 patterns ne chan and display 5 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.760
 One eye opened when candidate tax 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.920
 This 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.780
 Rotor student 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.890
 The second 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.890
 Horizontal high school 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.270
 The third 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.270
 Vertical rotation child cadet 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.830
 4th 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.940
 Vertical correction 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.560
 Fifth 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.680
 Right and left correction 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:08.180
 So it's not inside now 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:14.500
 Hang out five and this will be a representative of the typo candidate 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:19.810
 This star was first mounted with a compact camera for the first time 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:24.640
 It's always that video but I 'm also waiting for my work today 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:30.280
 It does not contain say Crayola is performed on the video there be Sony's mirrorless camera 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.490
 I think it will be sold a lot when I say from Ashikaga's Orihime Shrine etc. The image is decided 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.490
 is 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:43.460
 The bottom of the camera shake correction is also that to the other is better wow 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:46.490
 By the guy Tteyuu resolution low brain pain noise of compatibility with high-dimensional 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.170
 For example, a little before the Dejikku behind mounting 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.319
 Since this Pact 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:57.450
 I 'm taking a testicle, that 's what the camera 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:01.560
 I think the noise is quite strong if it is 1600 or 3,200 yen 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:05.870
 If it becomes Digic 6, even if it raises to transfer sensitivity 1600 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.230
 And so is the noise of the chic 5 ç£¯ card 400 class 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:13.720
 It is also now more strongly in the night view that say 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:17.280
 It is a noise that often occurs in night scene indoor shooting 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:22.140
 By way of the cold one-step level of Koreocha 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.830
 Even with dark scenes , bright photos can be taken without noise , even with dark scenes. 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.340
 I will 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:33.919
 It is when that is reduced by it does not mean at all that there is no noise 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:37.200
 I would like to use this with powershot sx 280 this time or not 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:41.200
 There are things that I think are good features 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:45.730
 I do not know unless I try to use It is an absolute station when I try to use this 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:51.340
 Take 8 photos and it ends with a still image 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:53.500
 Go on a trip or something trip, take a photo and see what a beautifully taken photo 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.150
 I do I think the pick while 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:01.190
 The camera for men and women this time is a little in front of the photo 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.070
 You can record the video for 4 seconds before the video 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.410
 Hmm 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:11.820
 There was this what it say whether and photos, for example, a way to say landscape 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:15.540
 Take a picture so that is a beautiful picture 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:21.270
 Will remain in the memories just that the true front of the scene 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.060
 Because it remains in the animation, it can be recorded in the record what kind of atmosphere it took 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.300
 I 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.389
 I will 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:33.759
 I got it back home and took a shot of it in the day 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:36.230
 Is why remain in the auto video that Tteyuu atmosphere of the Nagae field 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:39.920
 I think this is great fun 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:43.820
 My head has recently made a video hobby 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:47.639
 I think it's really interesting to look back at that video 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:53.430
 I think there was such a thing to this teacher and room to Troubleshooting 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:59.999
 those of a, for example, a boy Toka women with Mr. curry grandfather she's 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:04.979
 And that it was Yokoi so Then when Ensei nice smile Toka good photo display photos of the remaining 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:07.630
 It will be remembered what it feels like the atmosphere before that 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:10.100
 Nyo 6 b 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.110
 It's convenient and say take you of the movie of the day 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:17.210
 I think it's a very good idea 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:23.660
 I also want this function to one eye power protection 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:28.910
 Powershot sx 280 of Canon and power today to a such a thing 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:30.230
 Is not it to say compact of the spine of the to be directly below it is really the size of introduction 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.520
 but 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:37.420
 The shooting performance is really great in a compact camera, and it is recommended to be able to cope with various things 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.420
 I think 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.460
 me 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.460
 Hm 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.860
 n
