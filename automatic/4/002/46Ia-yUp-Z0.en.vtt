00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.890 

you

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.960 

so<00:00:20.900> I<00:00:21.110> make<00:00:21.500> my<00:00:21.530> copper<00:00:22.250> barrels<00:00:22.640> out<00:00:22.850> of

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
so I make my copper barrels out of

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.220 
so I make my copper barrels out of
pieces<00:00:23.330> of<00:00:24.130> 3/4<00:00:25.130> inch<00:00:25.250> thick<00:00:25.849> wall<00:00:26.570> copper

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
pieces of 3/4 inch thick wall copper

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.589 
pieces of 3/4 inch thick wall copper
pipe<00:00:27.590> and<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:28.730> just<00:00:28.910> buy<00:00:29.029> it<00:00:29.060> at<00:00:29.240> the<00:00:29.330> local

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
pipe and I just buy it at the local

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.120 
pipe and I just buy it at the local
hardware<00:00:29.960> store<00:00:30.200> the<00:00:30.410> first<00:00:30.619> step<00:00:30.830> is<00:00:30.980> to

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
hardware store the first step is to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.460 
hardware store the first step is to
anneal<00:00:31.400> it<00:00:31.430> so<00:00:32.029> I'm<00:00:32.119> heating<00:00:32.360> this<00:00:32.630> cherry<00:00:33.140> red

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
anneal it so I'm heating this cherry red

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.820 
anneal it so I'm heating this cherry red
and<00:00:34.420> I'll<00:00:35.420> move<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:35.809> pliers<00:00:36.140> to<00:00:36.440> make<00:00:36.590> sure

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
and I'll move the pliers to make sure

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.500 
and I'll move the pliers to make sure
that<00:00:37.040> I<00:00:37.070> don't<00:00:37.250> have<00:00:37.340> any<00:00:37.489> cold<00:00:37.730> spots<00:00:37.850> and

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
that I don't have any cold spots and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.720 
that I don't have any cold spots and
then<00:00:39.410> I'm<00:00:39.530> going<00:00:39.650> to<00:00:39.710> quench<00:00:40.010> this<00:00:40.250> in<00:00:40.460> water

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
then I'm going to quench this in water

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.390 
then I'm going to quench this in water
so<00:00:41.360> this<00:00:41.600> has<00:00:41.809> the<00:00:42.020> opposite<00:00:42.770> effect<00:00:42.890> on

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
so this has the opposite effect on

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.970 
so this has the opposite effect on
copper<00:00:43.940> but<00:00:44.720> it<00:00:44.870> has<00:00:45.019> on<00:00:45.170> steel<00:00:45.530> instead<00:00:45.860> of

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
copper but it has on steel instead of

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.299 
copper but it has on steel instead of
hard<00:00:46.370> named<00:00:46.670> by<00:00:46.910> quenching<00:00:47.420> it<00:00:47.570> softens<00:00:48.050> it

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
hard named by quenching it softens it

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.640 
hard named by quenching it softens it
next<00:00:49.309> I<00:00:49.400> put<00:00:49.580> it<00:00:49.670> into<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:49.970> vise<00:00:50.269> and<00:00:50.659> just

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
next I put it into a vise and just

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.189 
next I put it into a vise and just
squeeze<00:00:52.070> it<00:00:52.400> and<00:00:52.610> because<00:00:53.239> it's<00:00:53.420> soft<00:00:53.750> I<00:00:54.019> don't

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
squeeze it and because it's soft I don't

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.170 
squeeze it and because it's soft I don't
get<00:00:54.350> any<00:00:54.500> kind<00:00:54.680> of<00:00:54.800> creases<00:00:55.400> it<00:00:55.610> bends<00:00:55.850> real

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
get any kind of creases it bends real

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.299 
get any kind of creases it bends real
nice<00:00:56.420> I<00:00:56.780> get<00:00:56.930> it<00:00:57.019> about<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.650> size<00:00:57.890> that<00:00:57.920> I

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
nice I get it about to the size that I

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.600 
nice I get it about to the size that I
want<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:58.790> and<00:00:58.909> there<00:00:59.870> you<00:00:59.900> have<00:01:00.199> it<00:01:00.379> that's<00:01:01.309> the

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
want it and there you have it that's the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.869 
want it and there you have it that's the
beginning<00:01:02.000> of<00:01:02.150> my<00:01:02.629> ferrule<00:01:03.460> so<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:04.549> can<00:01:04.699> see

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
beginning of my ferrule so you can see

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.789 
beginning of my ferrule so you can see
now<00:01:05.089> it's<00:01:05.299> kind<00:01:05.540> of<00:01:05.570> elliptical<00:01:06.110> it'll<00:01:06.590> fit

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
now it's kind of elliptical it'll fit

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:14.680 
now it's kind of elliptical it'll fit
right<00:01:06.830> on<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.370> handle<00:01:13.270> give<00:01:14.270> you<00:01:14.390> kind<00:01:14.600> of

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
right on to the handle give you kind of

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.950 
right on to the handle give you kind of
an<00:01:14.810> idea<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.530> size<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:16.490> want<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:17.420> squeeze

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
an idea of the size you want I squeeze

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.500 
an idea of the size you want I squeeze
this<00:01:18.200> until<00:01:18.619> it<00:01:18.740> just<00:01:19.190> fits<00:01:19.670> on<00:01:19.940> to<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.210> tang

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
this until it just fits on to the tang

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.249 
this until it just fits on to the tang
of<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:20.720> knife<00:01:20.990> like<00:01:21.320> this<00:01:22.270> next<00:01:23.270> I<00:01:23.450> take<00:01:24.200> a

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
of the knife like this next I take a

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.289 
of the knife like this next I take a
piece<00:01:24.439> paper<00:01:24.649> draw<00:01:25.399> out<00:01:25.520> my<00:01:25.670> handle<00:01:26.030> shape

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
piece paper draw out my handle shape

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.580 
piece paper draw out my handle shape
with<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.630> tang<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.700> get<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:28.820> ready<00:01:29.000> for

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
with the tang and get it ready for

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.560 
with the tang and get it ready for
making<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.710> ferrule<00:01:31.039> I<00:01:31.130> mark<00:01:31.399> that<00:01:31.700> where

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
making the ferrule I mark that where

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.469 
making the ferrule I mark that where
it's<00:01:32.689> gonna<00:01:32.840> be<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.469> then<00:01:34.310> what<00:01:34.759> I<00:01:34.789> do<00:01:34.909> is<00:01:35.090> just

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
it's gonna be and then what I do is just

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.149 
it's gonna be and then what I do is just
take<00:01:35.689> this<00:01:35.810> on<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.020> table<00:01:36.380> saw<00:01:36.590> while<00:01:37.009> it's

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
take this on a table saw while it's

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.910 
take this on a table saw while it's
still<00:01:37.369> square<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.049> cut<00:01:39.049> some<00:01:39.200> notches<00:01:39.439> like

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
still square and cut some notches like

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.550 
still square and cut some notches like
this<00:01:40.219> so<00:01:40.969> that<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.119> have<00:01:41.329> nice<00:01:41.600> even<00:01:41.869> shoulders

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
this so that I have nice even shoulders

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.459 
this so that I have nice even shoulders
for<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:42.920> ferrule<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.369> work<00:01:43.520> on<00:01:44.259> so<00:01:45.259> you<00:01:45.350> can

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
for the ferrule to work on so you can

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.289 
for the ferrule to work on so you can
see<00:01:45.619> I<00:01:45.649> can<00:01:45.859> do<00:01:45.950> three<00:01:46.219> sides<00:01:46.520> with<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.060> side

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
see I can do three sides with this side

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.910 
see I can do three sides with this side
because<00:01:47.659> it's<00:01:47.840> curved<00:01:48.140> I'll<00:01:48.350> have<00:01:48.499> to<00:01:48.619> do<00:01:48.770> by

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
because it's curved I'll have to do by

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.969 
because it's curved I'll have to do by
hand<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.609> I<00:01:49.820> just<00:01:50.179> put<00:01:50.479> in<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.689> vise<00:01:50.869> use<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.619> saw

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
hand so I just put in the vise use a saw

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.679 
hand so I just put in the vise use a saw
get<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:52.999> by<00:01:53.119> hand

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
get it by hand

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.080 
get it by hand
next<00:01:54.530> I<00:01:54.649> mark<00:01:54.920> around<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.369> outside<00:01:55.850> of<00:01:55.880> the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
next I mark around the outside of the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.999 
next I mark around the outside of the
ferrule<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.570> get<00:01:56.719> the<00:01:56.869> shape<00:01:57.140> onto<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.799> wood

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
ferrule to get the shape onto the wood

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.139 
ferrule to get the shape onto the wood
and<00:01:58.630> take<00:01:59.630> it<00:01:59.749> over<00:01:59.869> to<00:02:00.049> my<00:02:00.289> grinder<00:02:00.939> now<00:02:01.939> I'm

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
and take it over to my grinder now I'm

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.649 
and take it over to my grinder now I'm
simply<00:02:02.420> gonna<00:02:02.749> grind<00:02:03.109> and<00:02:03.499> watch<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.789> outline

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
simply gonna grind and watch the outline

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.919 
simply gonna grind and watch the outline
carefully<00:02:06.549> until<00:02:07.549> I<00:02:07.880> have<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.240> shape<00:02:08.479> just

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
carefully until I have the shape just

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.210 
carefully until I have the shape just
right<00:02:09.229> for<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.770> fit<00:02:09.979> on<00:02:10.930> after<00:02:12.220> carefully

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
right for it to fit on after carefully

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.850 
right for it to fit on after carefully
grinding<00:02:13.670> so<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.880> don't<00:02:14.060> get<00:02:14.210> too<00:02:14.450> much<00:02:14.660> off<00:02:15.410> I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
grinding so I don't get too much off I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.670 
grinding so I don't get too much off I
keep<00:02:16.460> trying<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.030> ferrule<00:02:17.420> until<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.440> fits

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
keep trying the ferrule until it fits

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.960 
keep trying the ferrule until it fits
perfectly

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
perfectly

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.370 
perfectly
like<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.150> do<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.480> make<00:02:22.690> sure<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.900> there's<00:02:23.290> a

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
like to do is make sure that there's a

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.350 
like to do is make sure that there's a
tight<00:02:23.680> fit<00:02:24.010> on<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.280> ferrule<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.850> where<00:02:25.330> I

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
tight fit on the ferrule and where I

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.180 
tight fit on the ferrule and where I
have<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.660> actually<00:02:25.840> kind<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.380> hammer<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.890> down

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
have to actually kind of hammer it down

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.449 
have to actually kind of hammer it down
onto<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.880> wood<00:02:28.120> tightly<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.980> as<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.130> can<00:02:30.280> see

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
onto the wood tightly and as you can see

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.100 
onto the wood tightly and as you can see
I<00:02:30.490> got<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.730> couple<00:02:30.790> little<00:02:31.060> gaps<00:02:31.450> here<00:02:31.870> but

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
I got a couple little gaps here but

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.630 
I got a couple little gaps here but
that's<00:02:32.200> no<00:02:32.410> problem<00:02:32.440> at<00:02:32.890> poxy<00:02:33.310> we'll<00:02:33.430> fill

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
that's no problem at poxy we'll fill

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.000 
that's no problem at poxy we'll fill
that<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.090> here<00:02:34.990> I've<00:02:35.140> just<00:02:35.350> pinned<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:35.920> a

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
that and here I've just pinned it a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.199 
that and here I've just pinned it a
little<00:02:36.190> bit<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:37.390> get<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.990> fit<00:02:38.260> more<00:02:38.470> closely

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
little bit to get it to fit more closely

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.690 
little bit to get it to fit more closely
next<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.570> take<00:02:40.780> mix<00:02:41.140> up<00:02:41.320> some<00:02:41.500> epoxy<00:02:41.830> epoxy<00:02:42.610> it

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
next I take mix up some epoxy epoxy it

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.600 
next I take mix up some epoxy epoxy it
on<00:02:42.820> stick<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.870> blade<00:02:44.110> in<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.620> allow<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.430> to

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
on stick the blade in and allow that to

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.699 
on stick the blade in and allow that to
dry<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.910> after<00:02:49.480> it's<00:02:49.600> fully<00:02:49.750> dried<00:02:50.080> I<00:02:50.350> take<00:02:50.590> it

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
dry so after it's fully dried I take it

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.550 
dry so after it's fully dried I take it
over<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:51.130> my<00:02:51.489> belt<00:02:51.910> sander<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.450> I'm<00:02:53.410> just

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
over to my belt sander and I'm just

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.190 
over to my belt sander and I'm just
going<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.739> carefully<00:02:54.660> grind<00:02:55.660> away<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.870> wood

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
going to carefully grind away the wood

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.310 
going to carefully grind away the wood
even<00:02:56.530> with<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.130> ferrule<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:58.750> way<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:58.959> use

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
even with the ferrule and this way I use

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.720 
even with the ferrule and this way I use
a<00:02:59.769> thick-walled

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
a thick-walled

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.580 
a thick-walled
copper<00:03:01.180> pipe<00:03:01.390> as<00:03:01.600> well<00:03:01.810> because<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:02.260> will<00:03:02.410> hit

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
copper pipe as well because I will hit

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.170 
copper pipe as well because I will hit
the<00:03:02.769> ferrule<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.130> little<00:03:03.400> bit<00:03:03.519> as<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.790> can<00:03:03.820> see

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
the ferrule a little bit as you can see

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.930 
the ferrule a little bit as you can see
but<00:03:04.959> I<00:03:04.989> just<00:03:05.230> want<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.470> get<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.940> completely

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
as you can see it immediately begins to

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.640 
as you can see it immediately begins to
patina<00:03:48.070> and<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:49.540> kind<00:03:49.720> of<00:03:49.810> DAB<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:49.989> at<00:03:50.170> first<00:03:50.350> to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
patina and I kind of DAB it at first to

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.390 
patina and I kind of DAB it at first to
get<00:03:50.769> it<00:03:50.920> sort<00:03:51.910> of<00:03:51.970> an<00:03:52.269> uneven<00:03:52.959> finish<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:53.709> then

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
get it sort of an uneven finish and then

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.920 
get it sort of an uneven finish and then
just<00:03:54.940> go<00:03:55.030> ahead<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.299> wipe<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:55.510> on<00:03:55.630> there<00:03:55.840> and

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
just go ahead and wipe it on there and

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.690 
just go ahead and wipe it on there and
you<00:03:55.989> can<00:03:56.140> see<00:03:56.350> it<00:03:56.470> immediately<00:03:56.829> becomes<00:03:57.280> kind

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
you can see it immediately becomes kind

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.170 
you can see it immediately becomes kind
of<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.820> dark<00:03:58.000> blue-black<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:59.220> after<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:00.340> dries

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
of a dark blue-black and after it dries

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.880 
of a dark blue-black and after it dries
I'm<00:04:01.540> going<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.720> just<00:04:01.930> hit<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:02.290> lightly<00:04:02.590> with

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
I'm going to just hit it lightly with

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.949 
I'm going to just hit it lightly with
steel<00:04:03.160> wool<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.459> bring<00:04:03.820> back<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.060> little<00:04:04.540> bit<00:04:04.810> of

steel wool to bring back a little bit of

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.350 
steel wool to bring back a little bit of
the<00:04:05.049> copper<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:05.500> give<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:05.769> worn<00:04:06.040> look<00:04:06.370> so

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
the copper and give it a worn look so
