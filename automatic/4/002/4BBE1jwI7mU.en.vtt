00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.029
 but in the street 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.509
 there are many dangers 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.769
 pedestrians must learn the rules of caution to protect themselves 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:28.669

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.560
 Well, I see her like that 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.860

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.350
 barriers 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 whenever he walks there are new dangers 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.250

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.340
 vehicles approaching me 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.930
 you see these things 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.930
 Well, I see it like that

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.410
 mans cars trucks where sprinters

 she does not have the sound that alert her of the dangers that happens 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.160
 she also has to be vigilant and become an expert to avoid 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.980
 dangers of the road 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.219

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.260
 cautious 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.109
 in the street 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.359

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.290
 sitting on his chair year of the same size as you 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.000
 for him as for all children 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.150
 it's harder to see cars 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.680
 it's also a lot harder to be seen it's really dangerous and 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.329
 you have to be even more careful to protect yourself 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.199
 we will give you some simple rules of delphine al-attiyah helps me to 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.479
 pic every day 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.479
 you will have to remember it to stay safe 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.619
 with the pedestrian license you will learn that you should not be 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.619
 at the edge of the sidewalk is very dangerous for all pedestrians 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.539
 it happens that drivers lose control of their vehicle it rolls on 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.649
 the sidewalk 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.759
 market 3 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.309
 next to the houses 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.449
 have you ever noticed that in front of the pedestrian crossings there is very 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:53.109
 often ground strips with little balls you feel the ball under 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:53.620
 foot 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.800
 even if you wear big sneakers it's a band of watchful vigilance 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.340
 these bands are always 50 centimeters before the edge of the sidewalk 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.979
 in front of pedestrian crossings 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:07.379
 after this band we enter the area at risk cause all with pau fc 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.609
 at the place of residence this gave to his request 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.189
 the seven people kidnapped in this locality 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.359
 here are the kids you have to use the greeting tape 2011 as a benchmark 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.379
 fe 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.110
 always stop behind this band before crossing 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.949
 like that you are sure to be outside the risk zone 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.049
 with the pedestrian license you will learn the method to cross in 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.099
 security 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.149
 so listen to your mistress your master and remember her 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:37.149
 concerts 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:46.069
 aladji told you about something very important do not approach the edge 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.039
 sidewalk 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.889
 which is a risk area 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:49.979
 he is right 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.599
 it's very important especially for you and me 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.079
 because we are smaller 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.399
 and it's harder 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:57.239
 to see and to be seen 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.699
 it's extremely dangerous to be on the sidewalk it's still 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.139
 more dangerous to be on the pedestrian crossing 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.049
 a very great danger are the cars that maneuver to park 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.189
 to get out of a class 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.469
 the receding driver does not see you 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:13.519
 look at his point of view 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.469
 annette is not visible and for you it's the same 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:19.659
 in the street you have to be very focused henri gillot 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.559
 stay away from vehicles that maneuver always think that the 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:24.620
 driver does not see you 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.360
 here in your opinion am I visible to the cars that arrive 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.439
 in the street 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.439
 put yourself in the driver's seat 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.020
 so the driver maze well no he saw to jihad they 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.069
 come but not me 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.360
 for you it's the same the driver can not see you 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.650
 it's a trap and it's better to avoid it than having a 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.650
 accident 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.340
 our advice is better to do a few meters more to find a passage 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.780
 with a fire a better visibility 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.060
 but be careful not to get lost you have to prepare ways to 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.379
 spare with their parents 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.520
 remember when you cross the goal of always checking that you see 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.980
 well 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.999
 and that you are visible to the drivers 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:12.999
 but I believe that scroll something to tell you 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.569
 to spot the dangers and traps of the street 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.249
 you have to use here are the first voices 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.889
 your head to be well focused 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.339
 but also present 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:31.909
 I do not hear 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:34.759
 I had to learn to be even more vigilant 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.499
 but to watch carefully mans around me to see the arrival 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:39.759
 dams 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.409
 allow me 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.809
 a clear example 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:48.509
 this marking on the ground is a bike lane reserved for bicycles 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.199
 it is on the sidewalk and you must avoid stepping on it 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.800
 you have to be very careful about the bike because you can not hear them 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.780
 not while teaser diango heaven look well around you left 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:00.930
 and on the right 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.990
 when approaching a bike path be very vigilant 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.729
 it's a trap 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.430
 to our example of the traps m 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.969
 never leave the player on the ears in the army 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.139
 do not stop you from hearing the boom of vehicles approaching her 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.620
 in addition with music on the ears you will be less attentive and 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.789
 especially less concentrated 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.180
 be careful 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.159
 we're celebrating children but something we did not tell you 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:31.469
 but also like 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:34.930
 we love to run and do sports 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.249
 the same is true of the great sportsmen 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:41.249
 this is forbidden 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.960
 it is done 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:22.620
 lewis they are great athletes 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.550
 but you will never see them running and playing in the street because they know 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.719
 that the street is not a playground 

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:31.169
 it is imperative to stay they prefer to focus on his safety 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:33.849
 good luck for the pedestrian license 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:36.860
 and remember his advice 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.119
 overwhelmed sidewalks 

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:40.149
 and stay behind bars 

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:44.179
 attention the culinary cultures as you are smaller the driver does not 

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:45.039
 not see 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:46.750
 no player on the ears 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.189
 but be careful when you do not hear 

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:50.300
 and do not forget 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.419
 it remained 

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:54.210
 I busy convalescent father
