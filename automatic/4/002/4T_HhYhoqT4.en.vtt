00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.630
 as expected the grid of the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.220
 2013 season of stock car has 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.630
 some of the main names of the 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.120
 national motoring 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.900
 among them the three form rubens 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.269
 barrichello 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.339
 ricardo zonta luciano burti o penta 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.960
 champion of the stock car cacÃ¡ bueno and the 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.599
 also stock champions 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.249
 ricardo mauricio davi muffato e max 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.679
 wilson if on the one hand the experience 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:31.409
 Track hours help life a lot 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.420
 of these riders in the 2013 season arrives 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:36.570
 also with the novelty of three pilots 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.430
 newcomers vitor genz felipe lapenna and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.650
 Beto, I talked to them. 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.690
 today here in interlagos after the first 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.890
 extra and clear workout you check now 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.160
 what they talked 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.410
 so it's getting out of the box or believing 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.450
 that surfaced even the main category 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.040
 It's a big emotion for me. 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.560
 I was three years ago still thought not 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.410
 But I'll be able to get back to the good attitude. 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.970
 this opportunity is very cool if 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.030
 also wind itself as stock 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.309
 wonderful 34 cars so so 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.260
 Dude, I was really happy with the car. 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.880
 I really liked the car, now it's 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.040
 Of course you do not have to be calm, it's going to take a while. 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.510
 two things to start picking up 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.700
 rhythm again because the car totally 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.530
 different from what had already guided so 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.970
 I have calm but I liked the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.670
 first training of the first contact with 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.520
 The car, I think it's going to work well. 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.250
 so it's an incredible experience, huh? 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.680
 it is then that he was the head 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.110
 car really requires more 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 It's a car that we do not believe in. 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.820
 but it's a car that 's race day 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.130
 from the beginning to the end of the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.159
 training had a big evolution for me 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.159
 It's from my beginning of my training end to 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.250
 people were testing all the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.810
 of the car in relation to the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.220
 exchange is not thinking about time 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.369
 back and yes, where does the brake do? 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.470
 understand the car and change the people we adopted 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.610
 Touching the brake foot begins to dream about 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.229
 mirror 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.790
 this adaptation is a bit slower 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.530
 but it will be better 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.330
 will help make one after attack 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.069
 so I liked it so much it was very good 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.140
 there is one 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.719
 Pride is very good, you are participating in a 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.209
 category like this even more with 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:18.980
 sponsors that they have been supporting since 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.400
 When I was little I started running. 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.499
 in the kart and now they're here with me 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.519
 in the main category of motorsport 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.829
 Brazilian 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.580
 this shows that motoring as well as 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.530
 close 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.540
 can bring a lot of return to the 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.720
 company and the car is very good to walk 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.390
 there's a lot of power and we're still 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.670
 adapting by making some more adjustments 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.120
 It's very cool this year is safer. 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.250
 still 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.739
 staff has been very concerned about 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.220
 This has a new seat just like Nascar. 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.980
 so all this makes the car very good 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.010
 trips in tiradentes very well and 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.709
 Now it's working for fear in my 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.200
 first contact not work for us 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.409
 keep growing there a little on the grid 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.500
 Since then the next races 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.840
 This is it, this Saturday, do not forget you. 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.810
 gives live qualifying training 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.000
 at 4 pm on the channel sportv 2 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.099
 and of course here on tv if you touch you check 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.340
 then with an interview with the pole until 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.340
 over there
