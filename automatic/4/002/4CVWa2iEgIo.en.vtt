00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.540
 [Music] 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.730
 very good welcome to we are good 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.559
 ep once again I said I was going to do this 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.690
 good video and I'll do will 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.490
 talk about what I want for the 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.880
 next game of the series is life I 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.859
 and the thermidor and the 15 and well the 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.169
 I will leave the comments and here is what 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.849
 what do you want for the game but 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.039
 first I'll explain it myself so 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.579
 gloves nothing I will say that the previous 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:33.070
 game we go on the 14 was made from 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.750
 what I already had th so they could not 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.520
 do much more improved what 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.530
 they could what they could and in fact that 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.350
 they did it better than 13 but good 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.949
 15 will be done totally good 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.649
 totally from the basics of the 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.629
 game but improving it and all 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.890
 surely one obviously the engine 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.410
 graphic because it's going to come out for 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.109
 playstation 4 and xbox one what I do not know if 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.359
 it is and it will go out for pc but good I go to day 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.579
 what to the point to start I'll say 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.850
 I would fly I had an attitude though 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.440
 already there was already in 13 but that 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.530
 infers to the oscar that surely it 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.930
 I would do better with the new engine 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.520
 a new game mode and others as 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.229
 it's going to change quite a bit like 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.150
 I said but if there is not that humor I would 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.340
 that there was a story for several 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.369
 several superstar for example dialnet 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.259
 and that there was no longer a story in the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.899
 current time but it will count its 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.780
 beginnings and others with the entry with 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.640
 albert and others with the coffin was not 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.619
 inside the box I will be mixing the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.600
 points because I have not done computer what 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.490
 I've done with this notebook so they're leaving 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.530
 to roll a little but surely I 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.570
 you will understand I would like more variety in 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.429
 the creation mode of the character I return to 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.860
 say that how will it come out for good if 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.679
 are four and xbox one is going to be able 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.020
 do more variety of things so why 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.479
 say that it is not left and apart from that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.340
 would have more realistic hair not so crazy 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.979
 that you could find for example a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.580
 hair to make yourself that you do not 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.140
 there is 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.409
 next this is a pretty point 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.400
 important to me because it's a detail 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.530
 what 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.730
 Leave enough new cutter in the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.070
 previous games in all 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.720
 previous and it's the subject of the hair I 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.280
 I wish he had more physical 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.560
 hung to the roll tom raider but yes that 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.460
 I was more worked because it gives a lot 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.470
 worth seeing when they get to walk it 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.810
 a hair stands behind 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.460
 very weird way and that I would not like that 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.830
 had physical in the clothes also 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.290
 have to fix yes or yes the issue of 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.880
 target approach in fighting in 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.540
 those who have many in the urine to the 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.850
 once because it's automatic on 14th 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.290
 example and at other times I think that 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.730
 also although I think it could be changed 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.920
 the previous ones in some of the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.020
 before and it is very confusing because 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.270
 you better throw yourself from the stick and go to 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.120
 jump on a bike I fell into the ring 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.640
 or falls on top of one in which you are 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.680
 doing the grass whatever it is yesterday is 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.980
 very difficult and in fact yesterday I was 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.890
 doing a fight trying to make a 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.470
 auction of james harding on top of one is 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.100
 the table outside the ring and you do not want that 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.500
 Do not fall on top of it falling off 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.050
 stick on the table or even inside the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.850
 kingdom jumps out so it's a thing 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.019
 that they had to fix but if or if 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.910
 now we go with the most important point 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.280
 everything is one thing that would give you a lot 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.320
 life to the game and is the theme of the 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.570
 story for the created character that I 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.350
 I wish he had the story as a 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.970
 little role in the topic of conversations 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.850
 even if everything is more random than according to 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.010
 the actions you have in the game as well 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.220
 go forward the story I would like 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.489
 a lot also that it was a bit of a 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.310
 nba 2k 14 would take that you could start 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.840
 from scratch in the future is free by 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.330
 example starting in a gym or in 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.030
 a generation of wrestling is 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.269
 quite small and that behind it 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.220
 you'll take until Christmas and you'll get 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.590
 the titles and others we return to the mode 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.110
 create a thing that has said my 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.610
 brother that I mentioned how he has the game 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.700
 of good boxing or wii games 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.680
 sports molaría that you could include the 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.650
 picture your picture and 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.840
 not from there to mold it and so on 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.730
 so that it looked as much as possible 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.440
 the character to you this is also very 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.829
 story in the character created molaría 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.850
 pretty that it was kind senior mouse in 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.949
 the one you could give pass through the stadium 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.479
 and talk to superstars and others and one of 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.669
 the conversations I could choose what 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.009
 that I decided that that will obviously affect 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.419
 the story we go to the molaría combates 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.830
 that you could get between the public and 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:40.289
 other type the old gray help that 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.970
 you got in the audience to hit or to 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.919
 get on top of something and even 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.900
 put tables out there in half like 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.270
 they did the extreme fighting before this 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.610
 I already said it in the story mode that 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.009
 you can talk to superstars and others and 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.900
 even in the story itself is inside 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.900
 of the ring that maybe almost to a 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.820
 combat and between someone tell you a couple 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.639
 things that you can choose what 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.960
 say or what to do and that changes the 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.100
 history we see in history 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.650
 it would be good that 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.330
 and so interact the training of 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.750
 character that could follow a 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.060
 stadium gym or something like that 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.010
 to give the game more realism 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.960
 we also have stories that could 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.260
 interfere in combats or that you 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.870
 interfere with you and choose the moment in 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.870
 the one that interfere in the combat that 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.910
 that you decide to enter the ring and stay 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.440
 outside the ring watching and when they go to 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.020
 tell the best that you do not care that 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.850
 acquire that for the account whatever 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.580
 and well I will say a point now that 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.160
 it's very difficult to do it because there 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.220
 to start almost from scratch I think either 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.970
 I am a programmer and others but I would like 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.810
 much that the keys and others were more 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.270
 dynamic 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.970
 whether in the execution of the movement 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.400
 that is never equal to what is the 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.560
 impact that would never fall equally for 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.090
 give more variety to combat and that 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.280
 it would be pretty good one thing that I have 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.080
 in the head and that I would like me 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.930
 I would like you to put the subject of physics 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.540
 in the fighting in the attacks and that one 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.130
 very important thing is that I do not know if it is 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.440
 I have dominated and I play whatever 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.270
 but the finul mode is at maximum 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.670
 it's pretty easy moving away that 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.080
 I have to meet goals and have been 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.880
 very difficult because I do the auction and 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.930
 I already end up telling whatever it is but 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.080
 would be that they put in a better 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.419
 artificial to the cpu sees that not only 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.160
 based on dodging more and more 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.090
 was simply harder more 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.680
 unpredictable 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.660
 the last two points that we have put 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.000
 those that we think are more important than there 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.610
 in two commentator tables that before 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.100
 before I think they had estimated it and sure 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.139
 I think there has always been a time already 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.820
 to correct 'aces' but molaría 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.800
 they had two tables of commentators and 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.389
 that he could therefore choose between 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.280
 English comments on Spanish 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.660
 that would be fine already to dig 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.240
 it would be pretty good that you could use 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.800
 a little imagination in the fighting 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.750
 extremes for example that discovered if 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.030
 there would be a pretty high place and put 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.220
 a table below is going to jump over type and 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.590
 the garden or put a table on top of 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.900
 another or put a table on the table 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.550
 commentator or crazy things like that would be 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.139
 quite well these are all 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.759
 points and some more important ones that 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:16.680
 others as you have seen that one already 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:19.490
 It only remains that you had what you think 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.349
 about these points and that you say what 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.300
 We value what you do or what you take away if not 

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:25.249
 it seems very important to you but above all 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.519
 what 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:31.099
 what point would we like that nobody wins the 

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:33.319
 saga of the series of dávila de ory nada 

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:34.699
 of parties seems I think that I have 

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:37.779
 liked the video and see you in the 

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:37.779
 next goodbye
