00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.099
 Hello friends, I'm Carlos Lima and I opted for 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.059
 to test the usb port operation of the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.770
 smartphone motorcycle regarding the resource 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:23.420
 tg for the test I chose this pen drive 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.420
 16giga sandisk formatted in fat32 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:35.880
 I liked this device, did you? 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:42.320
 compact and dust protection 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.320
 Both sides usb and micro usb 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:55.890
 the use of the hst is quite simple 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.000
 simply insert the pen drive into the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.120
 appliance 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.519
 In this position he already identifies 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.390
 recognized the device really 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.659
 recognition is too fast not to connect 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.659
 on here 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.170
 but there is and in the file manager 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.190
 I use ex parent ex pro came here in the folder 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:37.730
 local 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:42.530
 I think you can see from that sd card that is the 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:48.170
 memory of the device and select the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:53.380
 that usb 1 that is just the pen 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.380
 drive is stuck in the machine 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.040
 this one 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.250
 then touch to display the folders and 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:16.100
 files like I already did was previously 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:19.300
 a jpg image a flec song and a 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.300
 video mp4 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:33.950
 all are inserted 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:36.950
 here on an otg pendrive to display the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.570
 files just touch them chose to 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:46.190
 each one to the image 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:49.790
 I'll choose the photo application already 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:58.700
 displayed reminding that these files 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:03:04.910
 are on the thumb drive for music, I use the 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:11.060
 pre proof is he 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:25.280
 can see that it is accessing the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:31.970
 pretty cool usb device 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:36.700
 Now I'm going to take a break here and for the 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:46.300
 video I finally like to use this m 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:46.300
 x pre pro it will run 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:25.770
 for who does not know that I am there 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.770
 malibu pt 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:49.949
 nÃ³is is cool that's not even 

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:53.849
 updating the version of android and 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:58.020
 we should lose the native tg but the 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:00.029
 application nex usb tg returns the 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.509
 use of our bike g 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:05.610
 so I do not need to fool you, it's okay 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:09.409
 I hope this is useful. 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.409
