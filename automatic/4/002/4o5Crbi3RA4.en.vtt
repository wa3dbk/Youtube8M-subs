00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 everyone today we will you 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.810
 learn how to make quick pasta 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.300
 home and to merge it's gone for 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.210
 this recipe you will need to discuss 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.639
 salt water pepper and butter and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.680
 a bowl so you'll see we go 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.039
 immediately to the preparation that we 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.939
 to start with m tap that you put in 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.130
 really wade according to your appetite for 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.920
 go up to debate we're going pretty well 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.560
 fill in this is a real order to a 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.500
 large crowd we will add water so 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.399
 about half of a glass that 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.500
 depends on the size of your glass 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.660
 we're just one 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.610
 here you can still do that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.230
 you see a little water on the pole 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.090
 no chance to be we add the greens 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.450
 so a teaspoon but not that we 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.300
 cost 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.699
 So here are two little hazel nuts 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.379
 that in a small suite you put in 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.780
 microwave but it in the microwave 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.399
 for 5 minutes depending on the thickness of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.500
 your dough if you beat we have like 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.869
 we pretty much put you five minutes 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.780
 and if they are a little smaller you 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.880
 put three minutes have while the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.380
 bowl cooks time during cooking 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.000
 pasta 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.070
 you are going to have a slice of ham 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.799
 you're going to put like that you were going 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.549
 cut a little bit like that in you have 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:27.030
 sliced thin enough 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:30.210
 here are little tips like that 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.119
 quickly shut up a minute and a half you 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.140
 to stop there is a minute and a half more 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.299
 early you took out your ball and you 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.400
 you mix with a fork 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.460
 for not just other pasta 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.020
 issues either too hard too hard to 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.250
 not that they are overcooked in fact 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.719
 so it's always a little hard you 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.520
 go tell me oh oh I missed 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.159
 still no no we recommend adding 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.640
 a little water like that 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.450
 put it back in the microwave and you 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.130
 go back to restart the microwave 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.780
 so when the mission is over you 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.369
 go out with a child because it's 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.730
 very hot it's pretty hot so you 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.050
 go see and you add the ham 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.610
 in your flight 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.069
 you can make smaller pieces 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.569
 or I do not know where you wear a little there 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.769
 have mixed 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.000
 we will add the cream 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.299
 so that's why you put half 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.730
 announced taxes of the cream standards 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.430
 inputs that you 're going to add a little bit of 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.410
 noise yesterday like that then we go in 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.090
 throw salt a little salt 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.000
 you can take two meters like 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.569
 you want it here I think ruth a little 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.519
 pepper 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.739
 we will mix 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:51.239
 we understand some spices so there 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.920
 it's red pepper we add a little 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.380
 garlic craft as you want according to 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.920
 we have to mix well you put back 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.390
 that in the microwave in 45 seconds 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.000
 once the cooking to finish the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.700
 finished preparation we have this formula a 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.170
 so a very appetizing trick of compass 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.170
 immediately to tasting 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:19.829
 hu is really great the real one 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:22.609
 really great texture in the mouth the 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.450
 bat are really albin been very good 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.459
 I advise you to check anyway 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.810
 in the microwave if they are overcooked 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.770
 or not we have the consistency of the ham we have 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.710
 the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.720
 cheese that comes out of the sauce and 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.570
 all the spices 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.790
 it's really great me I you 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.380
 advise to put red pepper 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.720
 pepper just not everything we have 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.030
 put what come it's great we see there 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.860
 no it's all for this little video 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.300
 I hope it will have pleased you 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.300
 everyone and see you soon hi
