00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
lot Deepak Chopra and I think what I do

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.790 
lot Deepak Chopra and I think what I do
is<00:02:06.400> it's<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.510> analogy<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.170> throwing<00:02:08.619> a<00:02:08.649> bunch

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
is it's the analogy of throwing a bunch

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.070 
is it's the analogy of throwing a bunch
of<00:02:08.950> spaghetti<00:02:09.340> at<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.179> wall<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.840> kind<00:02:11.049> of

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
of spaghetti at the wall and I kind of

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.530 
of spaghetti at the wall and I kind of
just<00:02:11.260> see<00:02:11.440> what<00:02:11.590> sticks<00:02:11.799> and<00:02:12.159> I<00:02:12.909> take<00:02:13.299> those

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
just see what sticks and I take those

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.320 
just see what sticks and I take those
pieces<00:02:14.019> that<00:02:14.200> resonate<00:02:15.040> with<00:02:15.190> me<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.060> picked

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
pieces that resonate with me so I picked

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.670 
pieces that resonate with me so I picked
a<00:02:16.390> little<00:02:16.629> from<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.959> little<00:02:17.260> from<00:02:17.500> that

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
a little from this a little from that
