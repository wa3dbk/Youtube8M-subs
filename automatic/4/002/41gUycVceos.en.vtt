premier culture the Vedic way we're

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.249 
premier culture the Vedic way we're
going<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.580> learn<00:00:11.730> how<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.570> grow<00:00:12.929> your<00:00:13.019> own

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
going to learn how to grow your own

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.890 
going to learn how to grow your own
sugarcane<00:00:14.160> for<00:00:14.820> all<00:00:15.059> your<00:00:15.240> sweetening<00:00:15.660> needs

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
sugarcane for all your sweetening needs

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.950 
sugarcane for all your sweetening needs
so<00:00:16.830> here<00:00:17.039> we're<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.720> our<00:00:18.720> first

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
so here we're going to have a our first

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.090 
so here we're going to have a our first
little<00:00:19.140> chunk<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.539> sugarcane<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.980> if<00:00:22.980> you'll

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
little chunk of sugarcane and if you'll

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.050 
little chunk of sugarcane and if you'll
notice<00:00:23.189> closely<00:00:23.580> at<00:00:24.000> every<00:00:24.600> single<00:00:24.810> internode

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
notice closely at every single internode

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.730 
notice closely at every single internode
there's<00:00:27.060> already<00:00:27.210> roots<00:00:27.599> coming<00:00:28.380> out<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.650> them

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
there's already roots coming out of them

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.060 
there's already roots coming out of them
so<00:00:29.330> you<00:00:30.330> can<00:00:30.449> potentially<00:00:30.900> get<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> whole

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
so you can potentially get a whole

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.160 
so you can potentially get a whole
sugarcane<00:00:32.669> plant<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.450> every<00:00:33.780> single<00:00:34.079> one

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
sugarcane plant out of every single one

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.660 
sugarcane plant out of every single one
of<00:00:34.230> these<00:00:34.350> nodes<00:00:34.670> so<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.440> you<00:00:37.440> cut

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
of these nodes so what you do is you cut

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.430 
of these nodes so what you do is you cut
every<00:00:38.670> one<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.850> these<00:00:39.000> sections<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.200> between

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
every one of these sections in between

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.389 
every one of these sections in between
the<00:00:40.500> nodes<00:00:43.129> and<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:45.020> grow<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.440> this

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
the nodes and you grow this and this

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.990 
the nodes and you grow this and this
will<00:00:47.610> eventually<00:00:48.590> flourish<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.879> give<00:00:50.879> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
will eventually flourish and give you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.080 
will eventually flourish and give you
more<00:00:51.210> sugarcane<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.160> something<00:00:53.160> about<00:00:53.370> 12

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
more sugarcane and something about 12

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.970 
more sugarcane and something about 12
months

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.490 

so<00:00:58.980> once<00:00:59.220> you<00:00:59.310> have<00:00:59.400> your<00:00:59.460> cutting<00:01:00.350> of<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
so once you have your cutting of the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.000 
so once you have your cutting of the
internode<00:01:01.950> then<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.880> bury<00:01:03.150> it<00:01:03.270> nicely<00:01:04.010> not

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
internode then you bury it nicely not

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.590 
internode then you bury it nicely not
too<00:01:05.160> deeply<00:01:05.550> maybe<00:01:06.120> half<00:01:06.330> an<00:01:06.480> inch

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
too deeply maybe half an inch

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.180 
too deeply maybe half an inch
underground<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.440> doesn't<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.800> to<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.010> very

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
underground it doesn't have to be very

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.810 
underground it doesn't have to be very
deep<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.990> after<00:01:09.990> two<00:01:10.380> or<00:01:10.530> three<00:01:10.740> weeks<00:01:10.980> you

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
deep and after two or three weeks you

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.840 
deep and after two or three weeks you
can<00:01:12.000> see<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.300> right<00:01:12.390> beside<00:01:12.570> me<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.920> it'll

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
can see it right beside me that it'll

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.070 
can see it right beside me that it'll
start<00:01:15.000> sprouting<00:01:15.510> and<00:01:15.660> from<00:01:16.500> there<00:01:17.870> you<00:01:18.870> could

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
start sprouting and from there you could

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.240 
start sprouting and from there you could
sprout<00:01:19.320> up<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.650> 15<00:01:20.160> different<00:01:20.750> canes<00:01:22.250> every

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
sprout up to 15 different canes every

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.740 
sprout up to 15 different canes every
single<00:01:23.550> plant

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.420 

so<00:01:28.750> as<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:28.930> can<00:01:29.020> see<00:01:29.080> behind<00:01:29.350> me<00:01:29.620> after<00:01:30.400> a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
so as you can see behind me after a

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.940 
so as you can see behind me after a
month<00:01:30.700> or<00:01:30.790> so<00:01:31.000> if<00:01:31.720> he<00:01:31.930> continues<00:01:32.500> growing

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
month or so if he continues growing

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.060 
month or so if he continues growing
taller<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.460> taller<00:01:34.290> sugarcane<00:01:35.290> is<00:01:35.440> a<00:01:35.650> grass

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
taller and taller sugarcane is a grass

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.730 
taller and taller sugarcane is a grass
and<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:37.660> grows<00:01:37.840> very<00:01:37.930> quickly

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.910 

you<00:01:42.979> see<00:01:43.189> now<00:01:43.369> after<00:01:43.750> five<00:01:44.750> six<00:01:45.170> seven<00:01:45.829> months

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
you see now after five six seven months

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.950 
you see now after five six seven months
later<00:01:46.070> that's<00:01:47.030> growing<00:01:47.329> taller<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:47.840> taller

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
later that's growing taller and taller

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.740 
later that's growing taller and taller
to<00:01:48.350> about<00:01:48.500> my<00:01:48.649> height<00:01:48.890> or<00:01:49.729> higher<00:01:49.790> six<00:01:50.659> or

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
to about my height or higher six or

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.780 
to about my height or higher six or
seven<00:01:50.990> feet<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.979> leaves<00:01:52.220> start<00:01:52.580> getting

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
seven feet and the leaves start getting

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:00.880 
seven feet and the leaves start getting
broader<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.330> longer<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:55.360> continued<00:01:56.360> growth

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.000 

and<00:02:01.450> after<00:02:02.450> approximately<00:02:03.200> twelve<00:02:03.680> to

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
and after approximately twelve to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.190 
and after approximately twelve to
fourteen<00:02:04.400> months<00:02:04.700> later<00:02:04.910> you<00:02:05.780> have<00:02:05.870> a<00:02:05.930> fully

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
fourteen months later you have a fully

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.130 
fourteen months later you have a fully
grown<00:02:06.620> sugar<00:02:07.280> cane<00:02:07.840> ready<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:09.020> harvest<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.850> to

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
grown sugar cane ready to harvest and to

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.230 
grown sugar cane ready to harvest and to
impress<00:02:12.140> crush<00:02:12.590> for<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.550> sugar<00:02:13.790> cane<00:02:14.000> juice

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
impress crush for the sugar cane juice

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.690 
impress crush for the sugar cane juice
or<00:02:15.070> combination<00:02:16.070> thereof

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
or combination thereof

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.020 
or combination thereof
for<00:02:17.180> saving<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.570> internodes<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:19.030> replanting

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
for saving the internodes and replanting

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.800 
for saving the internodes and replanting
in<00:02:20.150> various<00:02:20.600> areas<00:02:22.180> it's<00:02:23.180> also<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.450> perennial

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
in various areas it's also a perennial

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.600 
in various areas it's also a perennial
plant<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.100> don't<00:02:25.340> need<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.490> continue

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
plant so you don't need to continue

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.290 
plant so you don't need to continue
growing<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.210> every<00:02:26.360> year<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:27.320> cut<00:02:27.560> down<00:02:27.770> to

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
growing it every year and cut down to

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.540 
growing it every year and cut down to
near<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.330> end<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:30.350> root<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:30.920> will

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
near the end the root and it will

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.790 
near the end the root and it will
continue<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.360> spring<00:02:32.660> up<00:02:32.780> just<00:02:33.530> like<00:02:33.620> any

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
continue to spring up just like any

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.320 
continue to spring up just like any
regular<00:02:34.220> grass

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.000 

so<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.900> got<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.170> keep<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.410> mind<00:02:40.560> how<00:02:40.860> much

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
so you got to keep in mind how much

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.250 
so you got to keep in mind how much
sugar<00:02:41.640> or<00:02:42.090> sweetener<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.540> want<00:02:42.780> into<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
sugar or sweetener you want into the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.290 
sugar or sweetener you want into the
future<00:02:43.560> because<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.550> sugarcane<00:02:44.790> takes<00:02:45.180> about
