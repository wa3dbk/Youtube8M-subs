a<00:00:01.979> laser<00:00:02.220> i<00:00:02.370> want<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.580> show<00:00:02.730> you<00:00:02.760> this<00:00:03.090> one's

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
a laser i want to show you this one's

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.869 
a laser i want to show you this one's
called<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.780> micro<00:00:04.319> star<00:00:04.589> from<00:00:04.799> american<00:00:05.279> DJ<00:00:05.430> and

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
called a micro star from american DJ and

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.270 
called a micro star from american DJ and
interestingly<00:00:06.509> enough<00:00:06.990> if<00:00:07.649> i<00:00:07.770> put<00:00:07.919> my<00:00:08.040> coffee

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
interestingly enough if i put my coffee

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.299 
interestingly enough if i put my coffee
down<00:00:08.690> chauvet<00:00:09.690> lighting<00:00:10.110> had<00:00:10.320> exactly<00:00:10.860> mall

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
down chauvet lighting had exactly mall

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.919 
down chauvet lighting had exactly mall
most<00:00:11.519> exactly<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> same<00:00:12.420> type<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.599> laser<00:00:12.840> a

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
most exactly the same type of laser a

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.690 
most exactly the same type of laser a
couple<00:00:13.139> years<00:00:13.320> ago<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.769> guess<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.460> sales

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
couple years ago I guess the sales

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.609 
couple years ago I guess the sales
didn't<00:00:15.120> kick<00:00:15.299> off<00:00:15.509> as<00:00:15.780> fast<00:00:15.990> as<00:00:16.170> they<00:00:16.260> expected

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
didn't kick off as fast as they expected

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.680 
didn't kick off as fast as they expected
so<00:00:16.859> they<00:00:17.100> discontinued<00:00:17.789> imma<00:00:18.060> that's<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.449> guess

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
so they discontinued imma that's a guess

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.109 
so they discontinued imma that's a guess
I'm<00:00:18.990> not<00:00:19.140> sure<00:00:19.199> about<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.830> anyway<00:00:20.220> America

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
I'm not sure about that anyway America

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.080 
I'm not sure about that anyway America
DJ<00:00:21.720> came<00:00:22.500> out<00:00:22.740> with<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.160> micro<00:00:23.490> star<00:00:23.820> laser

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090

the radio control remote anyway you can

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.229 
the radio control remote anyway you can
have<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.070> later<00:01:02.309> over<00:01:02.579> here<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.149> head

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
have this later over here you can head

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.520 
have this later over here you can head
over<00:01:03.420> there<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.019> behind<00:01:04.199> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
wherever you want you can still use a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.080 
wherever you want you can still use a
remote<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.770> has<00:01:07.950> an<00:01:08.070> antenna<00:01:08.369> very
