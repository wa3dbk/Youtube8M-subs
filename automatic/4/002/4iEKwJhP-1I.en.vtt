 channel of your world lol 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.490

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.920
 you can still notice me a little in the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.590
 voice 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.279
 I've had a pretty bad flu 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.220
 been with a lot of fever and good not 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.080
 I could record I could not record and well 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.910
 we're worth it and we come back with a video of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.420
 news quite loaded and tomorrow 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.119
 extract or forgiveness we will bring you the top and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.260
 well let's start as I'm already 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.410
 seeing on the screen sure that I already 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.300
 you have read puts clearly in English 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.040
 your game has been sued because a 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.020
 player has failed in the selection of 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.180
 champion you have been automatically 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.700
 Redirected to the warehouse making the tail 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.129
 well what is this many many of 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.850
 you are looking forward to this thing 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:59.149
 good when a player who is here 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.269
 choose a random champion valley is so 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.119
 close choose good champion then it is 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.830
 it is automatically disbanded or is it 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.259
 automatically thrown out of the game 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.970
 so that well he does not have to be 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.530
 playing from the beginning with someone 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.869
 here or with someone who has chosen a 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.039
 champion that is not yours is worth I think 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.380
 which is a positive point which 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.500
 we were waiting for many of us 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.869
 at boot time of course to the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.960
 start time is key and good more 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.119
 news and the week comes loaded 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.360
 loaded with skins here we have the 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.149
 first you say who you want 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.700
 then it's a nest box corner and it's worth 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.939
 has not yet come out what has been 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.369
 his last one becomes a tiger or 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.759
 Something is worth it has not left yet but if 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.819
 you look at the right side next to 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.909
 the face of vidal and there is a kind 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:56.990
 monster is worth a couple of 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:00.320
 bright eyes very big fangs 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.299
 I think he's going to have something out there but 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.759
 it seems that up has horns I am 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.909
 I know, I do not know, it's very strange, but 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.270
 corner is quite pretty enough 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.880
 chula is something futuristic very very 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.800
 futuristic but good and we will see 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.290
 as more things go by alone 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.489
 has come out when explaining that it is usually 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.040
 the last thing was out but good has 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.970
 been the first thing and let's see more skins 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.330
 and here we have the world driver skin 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.660
 tour and here we have it 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.600
 trevÃ­n gladiator is a skin that has already 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.610
 come out so much good to move that is this 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.100
 as much as the images of the game as 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.140
 What is the 3d model worth? 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.940
 next good and I will go putting it 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.920
 so that you are seeing and the truth is a 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.080
 skin that is quite pretty enough 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.270
 chula is a change 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.250
 total in what has been the raven 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.710
 in in the axes in skills all 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.010
 ok and then going to the end of the video is 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.680
 teach the famous rework of karma vale 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.110
 that has already come out and good things that 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.570
 comment on this corner 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.260
 most remarkable are the axes and the 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.650
 effect that fire they do now 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.140
 is the most remarkable thing that I see and the face 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.690
 of driver in that image is a bit a 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.340
 little peculiar and 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.320
 and well let's see the other images 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.670
 so that to beat her if the 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.510
 you have 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:36.140
 good to say here you see the model you see 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.459
 that both axes have changed a 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.459
 it is totally different from other 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.390
 and in the in game image that you see good 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.610
 well there you see the band position is 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.070
 more or less the same but good is what 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.860
 we have commented on the axes that do 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.860
 an effect of how to say it 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.410
 of fire or something like that and good you'll have a 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.360
 video in the description that you see all 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.120
 the skills and so on so nothing 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.020
 guys let's see more skins because there 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.000
 more yes yes and here we have the good the 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.860
 last is 15 you can tell if the last 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.280
 skin we have new skin also in 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.190
 reelecto as you see is what comes 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:23.380
 being a 100% alligator for and we see 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:25.840
 like his weapon his weird ax or I do not know how 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.310
 call it has changed completely worth 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.200
 now let's see an image in game no 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.200
 The spla and artest skin has still come out 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.729
 which we will see soon does not know no 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.320
 I know when it will come out exactly but good 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.169
 here we have the in game image of how 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.660
 is the truth is very cool in game 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.150
 it is so very futuristic has also given 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.180
 for futurism except for driver and 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.610
 true as to the style of the of 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.160
 dry vending and redeemers pretty 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.569
 similar in terms of the weapon I mean no 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.940
 I mean 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:05:00.700
 in the style of driver if not in the weapon 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.460
 more or less similar and good let's see 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.370
 and the last thing is worth it is the river 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.979
 work the karma 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.980
 and if you guys that it says on screen is 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.560
 the new karma is 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.270
 how to say total total total 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.070
 totally different has changed up 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.700
 the suit I think is the biggest they have 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.240
 done so far 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.220
 here the time of images ingame and good 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.340
 has changed a lot very much 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:32.060
 very much or everything has been changed 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.960
 everything all everything and now good have said 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.570
 whoever has currently bought 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.750
 karma will automatically give them a 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.710
 skin that is if I 'm not mistaken is the 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.810
 Kimono but well I'm not sure it's worth 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.030
 that currently has that karma and when 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.220
 when they make the king the word you 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.260
 they will give away a free skin 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.740
 I do not know, it's because nobody buys karma 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.170
 or I do not know the truth and good guys with 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.910
