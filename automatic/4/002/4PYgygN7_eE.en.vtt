00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.060 
residential area like this it's just to

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.910

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
it's really about appropriate speed now

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.859

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
the left-hand side for as long as I can

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.740 
the left-hand side for as long as I can
I've<00:00:32.540> got<00:00:32.720> a<00:00:32.750> sign<00:00:32.989> there<00:00:33.199> for<00:00:33.379> a<00:00:33.410> school<00:00:34.750> I'll

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
I've got a sign there for a school I'll

I've got a sign there for a school I'll
be<00:00:35.899> turning<00:00:36.050> left<00:00:36.350> at<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.710> end<00:00:36.829> so<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:37.250> road

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
be turning left at the end so the road

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.160 
be turning left at the end so the road
flows<00:00:37.760> around<00:00:38.120> but<00:00:38.390> I<00:00:38.420> need<00:00:38.660> to<00:00:38.780> be<00:00:38.929> careful

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
flows around but I need to be careful

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.169 
flows around but I need to be careful
that<00:00:39.710> there's<00:00:40.429> no<00:00:40.519> one<00:00:40.640> coming<00:00:40.850> up<00:00:40.940> on<00:00:41.090> the

that there's no one coming up on the
right-hand<00:00:41.359> side<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.079> I'm<00:00:42.769> just<00:00:42.890> going<00:00:43.010> to

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
right-hand side so I'm just going to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.490 
right-hand side so I'm just going to
treat<00:00:43.250> that<00:00:43.429> like<00:00:43.579> a<00:00:43.609> bit<00:00:43.820> of<00:00:43.910> an<00:00:44.030> emerge

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
treat that like a bit of an emerge

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.790 
treat that like a bit of an emerge
there's<00:00:45.500> no<00:00:45.620> one<00:00:45.769> there<00:00:45.980> so<00:00:46.010> I'm<00:00:46.280> free<00:00:46.519> to<00:00:46.670> go

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
the road now just looking at the road

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.819 
the road now just looking at the road
markings<00:00:52.879> this<00:00:53.600> actual<00:00:54.019> Road<00:00:54.199> flows<00:00:54.620> around

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829

to<00:00:55.249> the<00:00:55.339> right-hand<00:00:55.730> side<00:00:55.969> if<00:00:56.870> I<00:00:57.019> drove

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
to the right-hand side if I drove

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.979 
to the right-hand side if I drove
straight<00:00:57.559> on<00:00:57.829> into<00:00:57.980> that<00:00:58.190> new<00:00:58.339> road<00:00:58.989> I'd

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
straight on into that new road I'd

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.419 
straight on into that new road I'd
actually<00:01:00.289> be<00:01:00.409> leaving<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:00.829> road<00:01:01.010> upwards<00:01:01.309> on

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
actually be leaving the road upwards on

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.229 
actually be leaving the road upwards on
and<00:01:02.329> taking<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.780> new<00:01:02.929> road<00:01:03.489> so<00:01:04.489> I'm<00:01:04.880> gonna<00:01:05.060> give

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
and taking a new road so I'm gonna give

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.940 
and taking a new road so I'm gonna give
these<00:01:05.420> park<00:01:05.780> as<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:05.990> meters<00:01:06.410> clearance<00:01:06.770> as<00:01:06.890> I

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
these park as a meters clearance as I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.590 
these park as a meters clearance as I
come<00:01:07.130> through<00:01:07.160> nice<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.700> slowly<00:01:07.970> takes<00:01:08.480> I

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
come through nice and slowly takes I

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.390 
come through nice and slowly takes I
have<00:01:08.720> an<00:01:08.840> oncoming<00:01:09.080> vehicle<00:01:09.230> turning<00:01:09.980> in

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
have an oncoming vehicle turning in

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.580 
have an oncoming vehicle turning in
I<00:01:10.430> think<00:01:11.180> quickly<00:01:11.600> coming<00:01:11.780> back<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.170> my<00:01:12.320> side

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
I think quickly coming back to my side

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.340 
I think quickly coming back to my side
of<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.860> road<00:01:13.040> for<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:13.910> emerge<00:01:14.230> so<00:01:15.230> it's

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
of the road for the emerge so it's

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.390 
of the road for the emerge so it's
looking<00:01:15.650> clear<00:01:15.830> both<00:01:16.100> ways<00:01:17.650> kind<00:01:18.650> of<00:01:18.770> off<00:01:18.890> so

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
looking clear both ways kind of off so

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.070 
looking clear both ways kind of off so
just<00:01:19.430> be<00:01:19.670> careful<00:01:20.060> in<00:01:20.120> the<00:01:20.210> residential<00:01:20.690> areas

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
just be careful in the residential areas

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.200 
just be careful in the residential areas
sure<00:01:21.890> they<00:01:22.190> might<00:01:22.340> all<00:01:22.460> be<00:01:22.490> 30<00:01:22.820> mile<00:01:23.060> an<00:01:23.150> hour

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
sure they might all be 30 mile an hour

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.810 
sure they might all be 30 mile an hour
limits<00:01:23.600> some<00:01:23.990> of<00:01:24.110> them<00:01:24.200> might<00:01:24.320> be<00:01:24.350> 20<00:01:24.820> but

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
limits some of them might be 20 but

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.740 
limits some of them might be 20 but
they're<00:01:25.940> looking<00:01:26.180> for<00:01:26.330> your<00:01:26.420> appropriate
