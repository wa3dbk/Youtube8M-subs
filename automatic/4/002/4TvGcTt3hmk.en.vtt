actually don't like because that's how a
lot<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.860> accidents<00:00:56.190> happen<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> fixed

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
lot of accidents happen with the fixed

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.080

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
blades and shades a lot of cuts so I

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.840 
blades and shades a lot of cuts so I
always<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> way<00:01:01.559> how<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.859> push

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
always like to have a way how you push

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.670 
always like to have a way how you push
the<00:01:02.879> shit<00:01:03.210> away<00:01:03.329> from<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.899> knife<00:01:04.080> instead<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
the shit away from the knife instead of

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.920 
the shit away from the knife instead of
ripping<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> knife<00:01:05.909> out<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.510> shit<00:01:06.720> I

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
ripping the knife out of the shit I

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.810 
ripping the knife out of the shit I
think<00:01:07.260> that's<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> wrong<00:01:07.710> way<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.729> know
