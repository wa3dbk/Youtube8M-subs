level<00:04:41.000> I'm<00:04:41.450> not<00:04:41.600> you<00:04:41.750> should<00:04:41.810> slip<00:04:42.740> there<00:04:42.980> I

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
level I'm not you should slip there I

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.650 
level I'm not you should slip there I
suppose<00:04:45.160> so<00:04:46.160> that's<00:04:46.430> down<00:04:49.120> until<00:04:50.120> almost<00:04:50.300> at

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
suppose so that's down until almost at

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.530 
suppose so that's down until almost at
the<00:04:50.780> end<00:04:50.900> of<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.110> servants<00:04:51.680> which<00:04:51.830> is<00:04:52.540> sad

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
the end of the servants which is sad

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.960 
the end of the servants which is sad
halfway<00:04:53.960> through<00:04:54.140> I<00:04:54.440> suppose<00:04:55.100> swap<00:04:55.610> with<00:04:55.790> read

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
halfway through I suppose swap with read

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.550 
halfway through I suppose swap with read
it<00:04:56.060> that's<00:04:56.270> all

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.310 

so<00:04:59.160> this<00:04:59.490> is<00:04:59.520> highest<00:05:00.360> level<00:05:00.600> pokémon<00:05:00.930> I'm<00:05:01.050> not

and he nasty plots for some strange

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.649 
and he nasty plots for some strange
reason<00:05:51.409> it's<00:05:51.979> not<00:05:52.099> like<00:05:52.429> you<00:05:52.669> can<00:05:52.849> just<00:05:53.089> sweep

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
reason it's not like you can just sweep

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.789 
reason it's not like you can just sweep
my<00:05:53.959> multi<00:05:54.439> now<00:05:55.809> sweet<00:05:56.809> Marcela<00:05:57.259> be<00:05:57.439> but<00:05:57.649> that's

not<00:05:58.009> really<00:05:58.159> sweep<00:05:58.639> is<00:05:58.909> it

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:08.050 

so<00:06:04.340> yeah<00:06:05.340> Blizzard<00:06:05.879> kills<00:06:06.240> it

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
so yeah Blizzard kills it

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.460
