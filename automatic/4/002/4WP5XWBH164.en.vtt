try a color it's likely to be a block
color<00:03:56.989> this<00:03:57.799> one<00:03:58.040> may<00:03:58.280> be<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.489> little<00:03:58.640> bit<00:03:58.850> far

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
color this one may be a little bit far

color this one may be a little bit far
for<00:03:59.330> you<00:03:59.450> because<00:03:59.870> it's<00:04:00.170> a<00:04:00.290> ship<00:04:00.530> on<00:04:00.680> e

material<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.640> it's<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.360> new<00:04:02.540> color<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.080> that

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
material and it's a new color so that

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.009 
material and it's a new color so that
may<00:04:03.709> have<00:04:04.070> you<00:04:04.250> running<00:04:05.030> back<00:04:05.570> into<00:04:05.810> your

here<00:04:09.620> this<00:04:09.799> might<00:04:10.040> be<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.250> good<00:04:10.579> one<00:04:10.790> because

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
here this might be a good one because

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.300 
here this might be a good one because
it's<00:04:11.269> a<00:04:11.329> pattern<00:04:11.600> but<00:04:12.410> if<00:04:12.650> you're<00:04:12.860> worried

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
it's a pattern but if you're worried

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.069 
it's a pattern but if you're worried
about<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.579> pattern<00:04:14.060> instead<00:04:14.390> of<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.630> floral

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
about a pattern instead of a floral

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.560 
about a pattern instead of a floral
pattern<00:04:15.470> why<00:04:15.739> don't<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:15.980> go<00:04:16.130> for<00:04:16.340> something

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
pattern why don't you go for something

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.259 
pattern why don't you go for something
symmetrical<00:04:17.570> like<00:04:18.229> stripes<00:04:18.950> or<00:04:19.370> diamonds<00:04:19.940> or

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
symmetrical like stripes or diamonds or

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.750 
symmetrical like stripes or diamonds or
dots<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:20.959> that's<00:04:21.229> likely<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:22.250> be<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.430> better

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
dots and that's likely to be a better

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.210 
dots and that's likely to be a better
