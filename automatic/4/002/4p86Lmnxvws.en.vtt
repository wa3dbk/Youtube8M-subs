00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello people today there are times of me 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.000
 again a nice hall 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.370
 but I thought I was doing that 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.960
 a little different this time and try 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.900
 you with my limited possibilities 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.889
 something like a hall show to shoot and 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.990
 the things are also yours 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.460
 show 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.869
 I do not have anyone to shoot that is 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.340
 I have to do it all with tripod 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.119
 Focus yourself and my room is 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.769
 not such a beautiful background 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.539
 but we'll try it anyway if you guys 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.130
 I like then I'm 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.320
 maybe more often if not then 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.110
 I leave it because then it's worth it 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.280
 I was not a bit shopping and 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.700
