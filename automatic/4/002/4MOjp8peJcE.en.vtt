00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.170 
see chemical that will start flowing
through<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.530> hoses<00:01:17.880> before<00:01:18.880> we<00:01:19.000> do<00:01:19.150> that

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
through the hoses before we do that

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.520 
through the hoses before we do that
though<00:01:19.570> we<00:01:19.600> would<00:01:19.840> want<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.110> make<00:01:20.229> sure<00:01:20.350> we

to go once the hoses are filled with
chemical<00:02:06.369> all<00:02:06.970> you<00:02:07.119> have<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.450> do<00:02:07.600> is<00:02:07.869> pull<00:02:08.590> back

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
chemical all you have to do is pull back

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.649 
chemical all you have to do is pull back
on<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.159> safety<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.819> then<00:02:10.119> on<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.360> trigger

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
on the safety and then on the trigger

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.630 
on the safety and then on the trigger
and<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:10.989> will<00:02:11.739> cause<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.310> spraying

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
and that will cause the spraying

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.250 
and that will cause the spraying
material<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.239> come<00:02:13.420> out<00:02:13.599> and<00:02:13.810> you're<00:02:14.230> making

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
material to come out and you're making

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.940 
material to come out and you're making
foam<00:02:15.659> when<00:02:16.659> you're<00:02:16.779> done<00:02:16.959> your<00:02:17.260> stop

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
foam when you're done your stop

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.760 
foam when you're done your stop
you<00:02:18.790> should<00:02:18.999> eject<00:02:19.359> the<00:02:19.480> nozzle<00:02:19.930> either<00:02:20.109> right

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
you should eject the nozzle either right

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.190 
you should eject the nozzle either right
way<00:02:20.860> or<00:02:21.160> before<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:22.120> are<00:02:22.390> reapply<00:02:23.140> the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
way or before you are reapply the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.650 
way or before you are reapply the
material<00:02:23.770> if<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.580> stop<00:02:24.850> for<00:02:25.060> more<00:02:25.270> than<00:02:25.390> 30

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
material if you stop for more than 30

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.870 
material if you stop for more than 30
seconds<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:26.440> nozzle<00:02:26.740> will<00:02:27.160> get<00:02:27.310> clogged<00:02:27.580> up

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
seconds this nozzle will get clogged up

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.210 
seconds this nozzle will get clogged up
and<00:02:28.150> all<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.840> have<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.170> do<00:02:29.320> is<00:02:29.530> press<00:02:29.800> down<00:02:30.040> on

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
and all you have to do is press down on

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.220 
and all you have to do is press down on
the<00:02:30.310> back<00:02:30.490> end<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.330> now<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.720> will<00:02:31.810> come<00:02:31.870> out

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
the back end and now it will come out

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.680 
the back end and now it will come out
and<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:33.070> can<00:02:33.220> insert<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.850> new<00:02:34.150> nozzle<00:02:34.360> over

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
and you can insert a new nozzle over

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.230 
and you can insert a new nozzle over
again<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:38.560> all<00:02:39.190> you<00:02:39.310> have<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.580> do<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.880> pull<00:02:40.120> the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
again and all you have to do is pull the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.410 
again and all you have to do is pull the
trigger<00:02:40.270> your<00:02:41.080> back<00:02:41.290> spray<00:02:41.650> material<00:02:42.160> again

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
trigger your back spray material again

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.040 
trigger your back spray material again
it's<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.690> easy<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.420> guess<00:02:46.660> at<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:46.930> point

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
it's that easy so I guess at this point

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.320 
it's that easy so I guess at this point
we<00:02:48.040> can<00:02:48.190> get<00:02:48.340> our<00:02:48.430> personal<00:02:48.880> protective

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
we can get our personal protective

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330 
we can get our personal protective
equipment<00:02:49.420> on<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.140> go<00:02:50.590> back<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:51.010> spraying

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
equipment on and go back to spraying

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:00.059 
equipment on and go back to spraying
foam

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.129
