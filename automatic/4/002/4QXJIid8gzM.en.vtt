00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:46.969 
is a probe a and probe B connectors here
they're<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:45.899> exactly<00:01:46.439> where<00:01:46.679> you<00:01:46.770> might

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
they're not exactly where you might

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.440 
they're not exactly where you might
expect<00:01:47.399> them<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.049> follow<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
expect them to be if you just follow the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.090 
expect them to be if you just follow the
labels<00:01:51.450> back<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.079> very<00:01:52.140> easy<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.950> my

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
labels back here it's very easy so my

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.600 
labels back here it's very easy so my
