so<00:00:05.810> now<00:00:05.960> I'm<00:00:06.080> gonna<00:00:06.200> go<00:00:06.410> over<00:00:06.740> just<00:00:06.920> the<00:00:07.430> basics

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
so now I'm gonna go over just the basics

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.879 
so now I'm gonna go over just the basics
of<00:00:08.740> aiding<00:00:09.740> and<00:00:09.980> moving<00:00:10.549> up<00:00:10.670> the<00:00:10.879> piece<00:00:11.889> once

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
of aiding and moving up the piece once

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.490 
of aiding and moving up the piece once
you<00:00:13.040> stand<00:00:13.400> in<00:00:13.580> a<00:00:13.670> piece<00:00:13.910> the<00:00:14.540> most<00:00:14.750> important

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
you stand in a piece the most important

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.359 
you stand in a piece the most important
thing<00:00:15.769> to<00:00:15.920> do

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
thing to do

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.200 
thing to do
one<00:00:17.210> is<00:00:17.599> to<00:00:17.810> only<00:00:17.960> have<00:00:18.259> one<00:00:18.830> aider<00:00:19.160> or<00:00:19.430> two

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
one is to only have one aider or two

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.429 
one is to only have one aider or two
aiders<00:00:20.540> total<00:00:21.520> having<00:00:22.520> one<00:00:22.759> aider<00:00:23.000> is<00:00:23.599> vastly

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
aiders total having one aider is vastly

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.700 
aiders total having one aider is vastly
more<00:00:24.559> simple<00:00:25.279> that<00:00:25.759> leads<00:00:26.029> to<00:00:26.360> less<00:00:26.710> clusters

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
more simple that leads to less clusters

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.700 
more simple that leads to less clusters
and<00:00:28.070> really<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:29.059> only<00:00:29.180> reason<00:00:29.360> to<00:00:29.630> have<00:00:29.710> more

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
and really the only reason to have more

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.370 
and really the only reason to have more
than<00:00:30.890> 1/8<00:00:31.369> or<00:00:31.399> attached<00:00:32.300> to<00:00:32.329> a<00:00:32.630> piece<00:00:32.899> is<00:00:33.170> if

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
than 1/8 or attached to a piece is if

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.780 
than 1/8 or attached to a piece is if
you're<00:00:33.530> gonna<00:00:33.620> hang<00:00:33.950> around<00:00:34.130> on<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:34.520> piece

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
you're gonna hang around on the piece

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.569 
you're gonna hang around on the piece
forever<00:00:35.090> which<00:00:36.020> you<00:00:36.710> shouldn't<00:00:36.980> be<00:00:37.100> doing<00:00:37.219> you

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
forever which you shouldn't be doing you

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.889 
forever which you shouldn't be doing you
should<00:00:37.730> be<00:00:37.789> moving<00:00:37.940> kind<00:00:38.449> of<00:00:38.480> quickly<00:00:38.750> and

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
should be moving kind of quickly and

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.819 
should be moving kind of quickly and
efficiently<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:40.190> in<00:00:40.940> rare<00:00:41.359> cases<00:00:41.690> it<00:00:42.410> makes

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
efficiently and in rare cases it makes

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.610 
efficiently and in rare cases it makes
it<00:00:43.070> a<00:00:43.100> little<00:00:43.399> more<00:00:43.519> convenient<00:00:44.179> to<00:00:45.019> reach<00:00:45.410> the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
it a little more convenient to reach the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.189 
it a little more convenient to reach the
next<00:00:45.890> piece<00:00:46.100> but<00:00:46.609> for<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.089> most<00:00:47.300> part<00:00:47.449> just

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
climbing and still clip into a piece and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.700 
climbing and still clip into a piece and
they'll<00:01:18.920> kind<00:01:19.580> of<00:01:19.670> step<00:01:20.570> onto<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.380> they'll

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
they'll kind of step onto it and they'll

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.070 
they'll kind of step onto it and they'll
kind<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:22.010> look<00:01:22.250> at<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.210> then<00:01:23.360> they'll<00:01:23.570> move

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
kind of look at it and then they'll move

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.460 
kind of look at it and then they'll move
up<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.530> step<00:01:24.860> kind<00:01:25.460> of<00:01:25.580> look<00:01:25.760> at<00:01:25.940> it<00:01:26.260> look<00:01:27.260> at<00:01:27.350> the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
up a step kind of look at it look at the

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.870 
up a step kind of look at it look at the
crack<00:01:27.740> look<00:01:28.640> around<00:01:28.970> then<00:01:29.720> move<00:01:29.960> up<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.230> little

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
crack look around then move up a little

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.030 
crack look around then move up a little
flip<00:01:31.880> around<00:01:32.000> check<00:01:32.660> things<00:01:32.840> out<00:01:33.110> that's

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
flip around check things out that's

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.800 
flip around check things out that's
where<00:01:34.400> you're<00:01:34.550> losing<00:01:34.700> all<00:01:35.150> your<00:01:35.180> time<00:01:35.600> and

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
where you're losing all your time and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.170 
where you're losing all your time and
all<00:01:35.900> your<00:01:36.110> efficiencies<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.370> second<00:01:37.850> you

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
all your efficiencies so the second you

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.230 
all your efficiencies so the second you
clip<00:01:38.450> into<00:01:38.720> a<00:01:38.750> piece<00:01:39.050> just<00:01:39.350> go<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:40.970> walk

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
clip into a piece just go and you walk

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.360 
clip into a piece just go and you walk
and<00:01:41.600> tell<00:01:41.780> your<00:01:41.930> waist<00:01:42.140> is<00:01:42.380> at<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:42.830> then

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
and tell your waist is at it and then

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.400 
and tell your waist is at it and then
you<00:01:43.580> look<00:01:43.760> at<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.970> crack<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.570> look<00:01:45.170> for<00:01:45.350> your

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
you look at the crack and look for your

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.860 
you look at the crack and look for your
next<00:01:45.590> placement<00:01:48.010> if<00:01:49.010> you<00:01:49.220> can<00:01:49.520> in<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:49.880> situation

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
next placement if you can in a situation

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.310 
next placement if you can in a situation
like<00:01:50.900> this<00:01:51.610> I'm<00:01:52.610> gonna<00:01:52.940> 8th<00:01:53.630> I'm<00:01:53.960> gonna<00:01:54.140> a

like this I'm gonna 8th I'm gonna a

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.170 
like this I'm gonna 8th I'm gonna a
climb<00:01:54.740> almost<00:01:55.130> like<00:01:55.280> I'm<00:01:55.400> free<00:01:55.640> climbing<00:01:55.910> I've

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
climb almost like I'm free climbing I've

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.930 
climb almost like I'm free climbing I've
got<00:01:56.330> all<00:01:56.510> these<00:01:57.760> jams<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:59.120> holds<00:01:59.900> and<00:02:00.410> so<00:02:00.940> I'm

got all these jams and holds and so I'm

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.940 
got all these jams and holds and so I'm
not<00:02:02.180> going<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.450> stop<00:02:02.720> at<00:02:02.990> my<00:02:03.050> waist<00:02:03.440> I'm<00:02:03.770> gonna

not going to stop at my waist I'm gonna

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.330 
not going to stop at my waist I'm gonna
keep<00:02:04.190> going<00:02:04.610> I'm<00:02:04.760> gonna<00:02:04.850> keep<00:02:05.120> stepping<00:02:05.900> up

keep going I'm gonna keep stepping up

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.749 
keep going I'm gonna keep stepping up
until<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.700> get<00:02:08.509> kind<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.899> in<00:02:09.050> as<00:02:09.200> comfortable

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759
