00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 a pilot died today during training 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.859
 500 miles from london the direction 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.910
 decided to keep the race for this 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.630
 Saturday 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.809
 the prototype was completely 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.750
 destroyed 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.640
 36 year old robson luiz colle died 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.869
 during a training session at the ayrton racetrack 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.670
 The body was still attached to the hardware. 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.189
 relatives were desperate 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.109
 the accident happened on this curve at the end 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.019
 of a line so likely that the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.329
 People tried to analyze and see but they do not have 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.969
 as we stand affirms nothing is that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.550
 by the brands to write here it has already come 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.969
 half closed too much in the curve here right? 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.860
 he came straight into the curve here right it 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.469
 it seems that gave a lost rather it 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.379
 passed by here he did not do the agency 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.870
 and it took off that in this 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.460
 our zebra here and fell in the front 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.949
 in which he fell there and promise to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.710
 lost right and has no brake mark 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.960
 in which he fell and continued straight and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.030
 we hit her tire there 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.680
 this happened the organizers of the race 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.280
 He says the pilot was about 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.080
 180 kilometers per hour an impact was 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.520
 so strong that pieces of the car were 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.619
 scattered on all sides 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.170
 even before the vehicle crashes into a 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.640
 there are two possibilities for 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.830
 this accident happened 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.600
 The first is that it would have been missing 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.310
 car since there is no 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.979
 braking mark 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.740
 the second would be a sudden crash the car 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.270
 had an internal camera and the images already 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.270
 were taken to the police 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.420
 the image of the camera onboard the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.100
 What you can tell is that he tries 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.439
 hold the car on the brake at least 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.110
 interpretive mind is not conclusive 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.720
 he tries to hold the brake on maybe he 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.610
 Do not think the brake is for the car. 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.259
 the grass and the car takes off and leaves 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.210
 straight and hit the wall is discarded a 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.710
 sudden illness is also positive and the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.430
 all the time with your hand on the steering wheel trying 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.909
 defend yourself 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.770
 robinson would participate in the 22nd edition of 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.600
 500 miles from londrina 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.060
 soon after the accident the direction of the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.670
 meeting with the representatives of the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.140
 all teams and decided to keep the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.810
 race even teams interest 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.100
 lose interest in logistics 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.550
 People come a lot of people out here. 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.920
 is 90% or more is outside so have a 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.920
 some sponsorship decision, this is a 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.750
 sport is and the fatality did not happen 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.090
 You can stop because of this fatality. 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.520
 with all our dismay is 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.460
 really did not give the team 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.310
 mc shark of the rio grande do sul will not 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.310
 to participate is that Robinson Korn was very 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.530
 friend of everyone from the gaucho team who will 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.850
 attending the wake is because it is a question 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.150
 sentimental 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.070
 I understand the decision made by all 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.980
 those who are participating here this 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:52.480
 We honor this but we for being so 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.740
 close to their staff walking well 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.210
 say the weekend all together to 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.970
 head is not not legal during the 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.500
 meeting of the representatives of the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.770
 raised the question of the safety of 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.770
 racetrack 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.780
 the pilots stated that the racetrack 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.790
 needs repairs to ensure the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.320
 safety who runs here 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.000
 example there are claims of 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.180
 other categories including already done 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.200
 a wall a little further away and is 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.360
 waiting for the removal of that zebras 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.470
 some points it has a lump 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.510
 then the zebra that is a little 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.470
 exaggerated I think it has to move 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.050
 we should also claim this, right? 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.540
 together with the staff who administers autumn 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.190
 and some improvements that some tires 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.050
 certain borers 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.990
 we try to avoid this 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.880
 kind of thing in 21 years of existence 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.310
 This is the second death that happens in the 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.250
 race track of london the first in 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.760
 official event on the 30th of November the 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.160
 motorcyclist the allied latif ali of 37 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.520
 years he died after he lost his 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.910
 control of the bike on the curb and reached 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.980
 protection grid for the 500 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.680
 miles from londrina the race directors 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.510
 they will do special training before 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.740
 same schedule tomorrow does not change anything 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.520
 for me this one thing that will change 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.310
 here instead of closet is time consuming 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.340
 and training will be resumed today 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.020
 at 8 o'clock at night a very fatality 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.139
 but everyone expected the proof 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.280
 was advanced 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:31.249
 it is difficult to discuss the cause of 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.999
 accident what really took because 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:37.129
 there the possibility is that 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:39.259
 working there for the technicians is really 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.659
 the brake is not a brake problem because 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.999
 has a mark that appeared in the image the 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:47.300
 viewer must have observed that it is 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:48.050
 an asphalt scraping of the floor of the 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.060
 car 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.669
 and as some people have said that 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.620
 car took off then it should have that 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.139
 and there it gained speed when 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.539
 plays in the grass and goes with a maybe 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.430
 even harder on the tire barrier 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.669
 then hit back on the part of the barrier 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.189
 of tires before reaching a wall and there 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.189
 the fatal accident 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:13.610
 Look at all the accidents since we 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:15.319
 with the motorcycle and now the 500 miles 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.210
 this one will be more emblematic for 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.620
 to be a traditional race of the 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.599
 city and even the state governor 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:27.169
 participates but every time stands up is 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.300
 re-discusses the safety of the 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:33.020
 London race track is not 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.710
 not precisely because of this case that 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.360
 there may have been a mechanical failure but 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.779
 by others and others and other issues 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.149
 which have been discussed since other 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:46.370
 events since other races in the 

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:49.849
 Ayrton Senna racetrack is regrettable in 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:54.409
 tarobÃ¡ tv is supporting the 500 miles 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:57.860
 but that mourning stays from now on 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:06:00.979
 It sure draws a lot of the brightness of this 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.279
 beautiful race this beautiful proof that like me 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.279
 said
