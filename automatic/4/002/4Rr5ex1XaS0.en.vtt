for<00:00:25.270> it<00:00:25.599> but<00:00:26.790> something<00:00:27.790> went<00:00:27.880> wrong<00:00:28.090> with<00:00:28.270> it

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
for it but something went wrong with it

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.749 
for it but something went wrong with it
so<00:00:28.750> I<00:00:28.779> guess<00:00:29.680> when<00:00:29.860> you<00:00:29.950> full<00:00:30.130> screen<00:00:30.399> it<00:00:30.520> it

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
so I guess when you full screen it it

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.630 
so I guess when you full screen it it
only<00:00:30.910> showed<00:00:31.180> up<00:00:31.329> 14<00:00:32.200> foot<00:00:32.349> to<00:00:32.469> screen<00:00:32.710> so<00:00:33.040> yeah

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
only showed up 14 foot to screen so yeah

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.110 
only showed up 14 foot to screen so yeah
so<00:00:34.360> i<00:00:34.390> thought<00:00:34.540> i'd<00:00:34.809> make<00:00:34.930> a<00:00:35.079> remake<00:00:35.800> of<00:00:35.829> this

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.490 
so i thought i'd make a remake of this
video<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.510> i<00:00:37.540> hope<00:00:37.750> you<00:00:38.079> guys<00:00:38.230> enjoy<00:00:38.469> it
