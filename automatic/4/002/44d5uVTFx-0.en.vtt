that not only could we won that game we
should<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.710> won<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:25.980> game<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.640> that's

should have won that game and that's

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.929 
should have won that game and that's
that's<00:00:27.599> quite<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> statement<00:00:28.580> to<00:00:29.580> come<00:00:29.789> from

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
that's quite a statement to come from

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.160 
that's quite a statement to come from
where<00:00:30.150> we've<00:00:30.330> been<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.840> look<00:00:30.960> at<00:00:31.080> our

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
where we've been and to look at our

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.229 
where we've been and to look at our
record<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.070> think<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.399> we<00:00:32.820> can<00:00:32.969> go<00:00:33.149> up

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
record and to think that we can go up

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.900 
record and to think that we can go up
against<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> team<00:00:34.460> possibly<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> second

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
against the team possibly the second

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
best team in the west and I think we

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.580 
best team in the west and I think we
should<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.780> got<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:41.870> I'm<00:00:42.870> disappointed
