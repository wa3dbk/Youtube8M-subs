00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.460
 in summer the danger of fires is like this and like this summer the next 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.390
 book is done like this so you have to be careful so keep it that way 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.539
 making a barbecue in the country can be a dare 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.390
 but this is a year of drought 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.539
 so because not everything is a model 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.539
 thanks leisure 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.449
 If you are going out to the countryside, remember that this is a year of drought, now 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.949
 fire risk is greater than ever 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.230
 remember 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.440
 obviously this annual appointment 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.470
 nobody is important because you do not have to throw yourself and 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.470
 nothing good that has 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.570
 against fires we lose natural resources wealth 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.380
 and the livelihood of many people with each fire you also want 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.750
 when you burned mountain you do not lose it talks about gestation 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.110
 you see the animals the water and the ecological balance of the area 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.810
 and that we lose all 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.640
 If I get on the mountain, I warned you as soon as possible, do not wait for the fire. 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.680
 ingenuity though you can avoid 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.680
 but to the sector 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.619
 put out a fire that has already started is work of specialists 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.330
 avoid a fire before it starts can anyone do it too 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.619
 for the field the worst enemy is fire 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.580
 I remember when I had to burn stubble 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.580
 by the fires we all lost 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.710
 a paper 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.610
 thrown in the bush did not cause a fire 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.980
 only the country to extend it 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.970
 remember it 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.020
 do not cost 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.620
 na 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.690
 If you live in the field and you need to burn stubble 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.230
 Be careful, respect the rules 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.230
 fire is your worst enemy remember 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.140
 if you care about the palace of the amazons with antarctica 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.250
 why do not you worry more about our country said a hand against the fire 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:16.640
 I went out to the country, it's always a good excuse to play sports but remember 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.019
 stay here is summer when you go to the mountain that only more calories 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.680
 the things that get in your house 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.329
 they were also in the field 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.329
 remember the field belongs to everyone 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.619
 they create a burning butt from a car you can cause a fire 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.399
 remember it 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.079
 turn off everything you feel
