00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.600
 it's the friends of 24 11 in the company of 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.070
 color 71 a brand new video 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.410
 so today we are going to 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:21.020
 present the mode tardy then you see 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.950
 the tardiness of a famous doctor who 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:28.039
 so first how to create it 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.770
 so it's very simple proposes a blog 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.450
 Besides, we block Dahir north 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.620
 taiwan 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.750
 a lapis lazuli block is a word 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.430
 so you see me I already have it 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.220
 mine but that's how we create 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.430
 it gives you this to get in 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.010
 we take a stick so to go back to 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.970
 inside a stick is needed and we 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.850
 click on 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.370
 this is his inner flights so this brother 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.820
 without our faults, we did not say we could 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:04.939
 to find out it's pretty pretty it's 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:08.509
 rather well limited then it serves to the 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:13.159
 teleport anywhere else in 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:17.149
 random destinations so we have 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:21.609
 been actually I just live from displaced 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:24.709
 Egypt has changed to stirrup repeater 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:26.220
 here is activated 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:30.810
 the chameleon circuit 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:38.160
 we press the destination button so 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:50.130
 there we were deported to high school slopes 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:53.730
 oslo had fun in germany so there 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:02:04.700
 you see the mishima for the little 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:13.880
 double cab boxing it's funny to 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:18.140
 I want as a deaf to expectations 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.140
 rectifies mobile knowledge 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.590
 so here we go inside and 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.170
 we will go back to where we are 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.790
 so was the definition to back up 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:50.430
 you put the repeaters back to them 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:55.260
 position between euros we did not deliver 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.879
 last is that this is my 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:03.420
 nice but we follow the road and the 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:06.389
 trucks that deliver their money 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:11.669
 done it's a tisseyre stop without 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:14.129
 circuit that repeats itself after 2.3 after 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:17.580
 coast handed the stuff you leave them 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:21.870
 in the normal position like that 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.750
 3 but our normal here is my bone can 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.270
 still turn as a destination know 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.600
 maybe that's the destination 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.600
 you back 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.550
 here 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.550
 we were the doors and we were 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.489
 it's me it's not so bad how after 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.560
 we do not know all the commands 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.500
 fall and most sincere to his part 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.069
 6 per year here I hope this video you 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.340
 will be pleased and see you soon in a new 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.340
 video 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.769
 we
