00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.820
 ola and welcome to 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.860
 very first consequence electric basses i am 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.259
 the vasco and today there is again 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.049
 new format in which I video you for 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.910
 video level for level 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.250
 to learn to draw that no one under 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.590
 Everyone can learn to love it 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.480
 simply to you and as that definitely 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.130
 feasible but of course a few need 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.789
 things to start at all 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.460
 can and start making here a 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.050
 I really use that pencil very much 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.089
 i like to be from the pencil someday 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.159
 because you changed with the ship 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.559
 just has a constant line 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.699
 it always stays the same and thick 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.920
 does not change while you are 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.569
 draws eraser should of course 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.699
 everyone at home, too 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:50.329
 actually you have all the materials 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.409
 At home you need it at the beginning 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.960
 Of course, mining pencils need mine 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.920
 just did not use it that way 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.019
 principle the mean strength 07 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.329
 there you can not go wrong bs 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.739
 soft and hard 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.870
 this pen now in principle with 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.990
 donate and quite thick with her 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.150
 shadow so what can do and that 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.050
 in combination with the wipers you 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.630
 will see soon 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.370
 The fabric is very soft so if 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.610
 her finger with it are on the line 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.900
 do you have the lead directly the pencil 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.140
 in hands 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.640
 here is the wiper and with that you can 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.160
 really cool things do and indeed 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.270
 such lines here blur so that 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.930
 his smoother gray transition arises 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.570
 to the white of the paper that in one 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.770
 Sketchbook in it fell down 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.990
 sketchbook or simply printer paper 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.300
 to draw up, of course, that logical 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.560
 he needed that that was basically everything 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.420
 what you need now comes 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.280
 You do not have to have extra things 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.710
 especially not at the beginning but around 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.930
 nice picture to get 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.140
 you should have colored pencils and here 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.440
 just such multi layers are in the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.400
 principle fineliner only 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.520
 yes in different sizes and very 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.660
 High quality, I can only recommend 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.550
 that was just a brush-like multi 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.820
 layer is it really all in the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.990
 description what exactly what is this 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:26.840
 is so 0,03 mm multi layer it is something 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.510
 from small intestines really take care that the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.360
 mine does not break off or something like that 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.810
 the well-known comic are the peacemakers 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.190
 overpriced topic stifter comic look 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.770
 are that here they are really extreme 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.570
 expensive but also extremely cool so with 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.170
 you can do that very quickly and easily 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.810
 pictures are colored here with two tips 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.980
 once such a brush-like thing and 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.800
 what else is he anyway a marker and yes 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.700
 it also behaves like a brush 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.700
 really cool 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.780
 You can also draw several strokes 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.400
 to pull one over the other 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.530
 there you see it changes as well 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.130
 The color gets darker when you 're over 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.080
 some other time 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.550
 Here you see the transition will be 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.340
 then darker and with that you can too 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.730
 shade with just one 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.890
 colored pencil there you have several then 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.930
 shades the same money for this the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.420
 aquarell donator there is already there 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.530
 a bit like my watercolor paints 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.390
 it's a bit like that 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.700
 in the artistic I was the find 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.580
 Pictures look pretty cool 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.160
 Did you discover it for me recently? 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.080
 in principle these watercolor paints in 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.360
 art lessons and this kind of 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.590
 really cool so honestly watercolor is 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.820
 really cool 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.440
 you win no matter what you do with it 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.450
 Here are brushes set clear brush 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.560
 Of course, I also need water 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.760
 hope sewage home there is synonymous 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.890
 you just have to change the sizes 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.989
 find the one that is right for you 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.110
 Here are a few examples that you have it for 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.959
 example of the division of the world 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.550
 then clancy game 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:08.360
 that was with pencil and fineliner 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.940
 then drawn here pencil in 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.170
 combination with colored pencil there you can 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.569
 really green fuck 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.230
 that a bit freaky cap me 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.540
 think once met but very funny and too 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.810
 good last really really cool 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.220
 watercolor drawings watercolor pictures that 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.530
 looks really artistic too 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.330
 located and yes it was already 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.100
 everything is a description in case you 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.480
 need something else looks easy 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.330
 in and I say goodbye to you 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.560
 Here the case is still a hope and 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.560
