00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
fan so that it actually fit just what I

fan so that it actually fit just what I
meant<00:01:00.930> about<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> case<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:01.890> should<00:01:02.730> be

meant about the case it's not should be
actually<00:01:03.239> moved<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.570> little<00:01:03.690> bit<00:01:03.809> down<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
actually moved a little bit down and

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.080 
actually moved a little bit down and
then<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.890> would<00:01:05.010> work<00:01:05.189> I'll<00:01:05.489> hell<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> lot

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.380 
then it would work I'll hell of a lot

overclocked<00:03:43.739> 1150<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.820> know<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.150> not<00:03:45.510> really

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
overclocked 1150 you know is not really

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.849 
overclocked 1150 you know is not really
there<00:03:46.170> in<00:03:46.410> my<00:03:46.500> opinion<00:03:47.780> sure<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:49.170> does<00:03:49.470> but<00:03:49.739> you

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
there in my opinion sure it does but you

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.550 
there in my opinion sure it does but you
know<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.130> thing<00:03:50.370> ran<00:03:50.609> about<00:03:51.170> well<00:03:52.170> with<00:03:52.380> the

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
know this thing ran about well with the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.470 
know this thing ran about well with the

of<00:04:02.100> course<00:04:03.109> you<00:04:04.109> know<00:04:04.200> where<00:04:04.350> did<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.530> get<00:04:04.620> my

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
of course you know where did I get my

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.160 
of course you know where did I get my
parts<00:04:05.070> Canada<00:04:05.609> computing<00:04:06.150> for<00:04:06.420> most<00:04:06.930> of<00:04:07.079> the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
parts Canada computing for most of the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.840 
parts Canada computing for most of the
pieces<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:08.340> then<00:04:08.519> demos<00:04:09.060> for<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:11.640> water

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
pieces and then demos for the water

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.780 
pieces and then demos for the water
cooling<00:04:12.180> components<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.010> Canada<00:04:14.010> computers

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
cooling components and Canada computers

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.120 
cooling components and Canada computers
doesn't<00:04:15.540> really<00:04:15.630> support<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.139> water<00:04:16.769> cooling

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
doesn't really support the water cooling

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.569 
doesn't really support the water cooling
so<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.280> really<00:04:17.519> have<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.820> know

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
so you really have to know

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.179 
so you really have to know
what<00:04:18.729> you're<00:04:18.879> doing<00:04:19.150> in<00:04:19.269> order<00:04:19.560> pieces<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.859> to

00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:21.189 
what you're doing in order pieces to to

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:23.550 
what you're doing in order pieces to to
make<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.519> fit<00:04:21.759> and<00:04:22.569> really<00:04:22.900> understand<00:04:23.379> you

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
make it fit and really understand you

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.770 
make it fit and really understand you
know<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:24.430> measure<00:04:24.699> out<00:04:24.849> what<00:04:25.300> you<00:04:25.449> need

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
know and measure out what you need

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.649 
know and measure out what you need
because<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:26.740> is<00:04:27.129> a<00:04:27.400> lot<00:04:27.909> to<00:04:28.150> get<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:28.389> from<00:04:28.539> the

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
because it is a lot to get it from the

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.240 
because it is a lot to get it from the
internet<00:04:29.020> sites<00:04:29.469> and<00:04:29.680> there's<00:04:29.830> not<00:04:29.949> a<00:04:29.979> lot

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
internet sites and there's not a lot

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.830 
internet sites and there's not a lot
actually<00:04:30.490> of<00:04:30.759> internet<00:04:31.090> sites<00:04:31.120> for<00:04:31.509> cooling

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
actually of internet sites for cooling

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.670 
actually of internet sites for cooling
in<00:04:31.960> Canada<00:04:32.379> so<00:04:32.949> gain<00:04:33.159> damos<00:04:33.969> is<00:04:34.210> what<00:04:34.389> it<00:04:34.479> is

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
in Canada so gain damos is what it is

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.439 
in Canada so gain damos is what it is
for<00:04:35.680> it<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:35.830> so<00:04:36.009> here's<00:04:36.189> a<00:04:36.250> quick<00:04:36.490> shot<00:04:36.759> of<00:04:36.819> some

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
for it is so here's a quick shot of some

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.390 
for it is so here's a quick shot of some
of<00:04:37.569> the<00:04:37.689> information<00:04:38.229> about<00:04:38.710> the<00:04:38.770> machines<00:04:39.219> so

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
of the information about the machines so

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.959 
of the information about the machines so
that<00:04:39.460> if<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.180> want<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.419> look<00:04:40.509> it<00:04:40.659> up<00:04:40.689> you<00:04:40.930> can

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969 
that if you want to look it up you can

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:45.149 
that if you want to look it up you can
and<00:04:42.969> i'll<00:04:43.569> just<00:04:43.840> zoom<00:04:44.169> in<00:04:44.349> on<00:04:44.500> this<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.009> that

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 
and i'll just zoom in on this so that

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.890 
and i'll just zoom in on this so that
you<00:04:45.189> guys<00:04:45.430> can<00:04:45.699> see<00:04:45.759> what<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.330> actual<00:04:46.629> pieces

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
you guys can see what the actual pieces

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.850 
you guys can see what the actual pieces
are<00:04:47.400> full<00:04:48.400> tower<00:04:48.639> case<00:04:49.030> there's<00:04:49.930> links<00:04:50.349> for<00:04:50.710> it

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
are full tower case there's links for it

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.980 
are full tower case there's links for it
and<00:04:51.550> then<00:04:51.940> of<00:04:52.060> course<00:04:52.360> we<00:04:52.659> have<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.169> cpu<00:04:54.990> the

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
and then of course we have the cpu the

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.110 
and then of course we have the cpu the
drives<00:04:57.810> water<00:04:58.810> cooling<00:04:59.580> where's<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.789> radeon

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
drives water cooling where's the radeon

drives water cooling where's the radeon
card<00:05:01.479> and<00:05:02.440> as<00:05:02.650> i<00:05:02.770> mentioned<00:05:02.800> i<00:05:03.159> started<00:05:03.520> with

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
card and as i mentioned i started with

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.339 
card and as i mentioned i started with
the<00:05:03.789> thermal<00:05:04.120> lake<00:05:04.270> chaser<00:05:04.690> i<00:05:04.870> thought<00:05:05.199> it<00:05:05.289> was

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
the thermal lake chaser i thought it was

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:06.749 
the thermal lake chaser i thought it was
a<00:05:05.409> good<00:05:05.560> jump<00:05:05.770> start<00:05:06.039> for<00:05:06.219> my<00:05:06.310> first<00:05:06.490> water

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
a good jump start for my first water

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.580 
a good jump start for my first water
