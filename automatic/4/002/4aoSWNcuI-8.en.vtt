with<00:01:26.369> my<00:01:26.610> craft<00:01:26.970> pocketed<00:01:27.509> turn<00:01:27.659> now<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.080> think

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
with my craft pocketed turn now I think

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.200 
with my craft pocketed turn now I think
instant<00:01:29.009> network<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.460> doing<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> little<00:01:29.909> bit<00:01:30.180> of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
instant network is doing a little bit of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.410 
instant network is doing a little bit of
doing<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> little<00:01:31.140> bit<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> updates<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.040> may<00:01:32.970> may

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
doing a little bit of updates so may may

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.060 
doing a little bit of updates so may may
be<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.780> bit<00:01:33.990> by<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.170> sometimes<00:01:34.530> but

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
be a little bit by you sometimes but

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.660 
be a little bit by you sometimes but
yeah<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.759> for<00:01:35.939> both<00:01:36.090> ports<00:01:37.070> both<00:01:38.070> ports<00:01:38.520> for

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
yeah so for both ports both ports for

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.490 
yeah so for both ports both ports for
the<00:01:38.759> server<00:01:39.030> are<00:01:39.360> 1913<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:41.040> always<00:01:41.759> and

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
the server are 1913 to as always and

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.620 
the server are 1913 to as always and
yeah<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.860> these<00:01:44.100> are<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.369> two<00:01:44.820> most<00:01:45.119> popular
