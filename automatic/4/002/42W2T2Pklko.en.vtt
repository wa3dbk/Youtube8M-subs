00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.330
 welcome to the spectacle of pure soccer to a night plagued not of 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.550
 goals but goals of spectacular plays of talents of a man 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.230
 exceptional on the field as a ronaldo Christian of a landslide 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.880
 forceful 6 marked the real madrid and only two the villarreal 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.289
 much can be expected from a match that starts this way 17th minute and so 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.330
 Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoreboard 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.310
 goal that presaged already what would be a great game to this a goal with which 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.310
 you have to enjoy it again and again 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.580
 three minutes later when higuaín was preparing to score was knocked down on 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.159
 the area 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:40.960
 and there was kaka to beat diego lopez from the point of punishment for 

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:43.300
 Re-dial and look at the sky 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.820
 the Villarreal nevertheless got back into the game and did it with another 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.150
 work of art like this responded frames the alcoraz or of free throw of Christian 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.750
 ronaldo 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.810
 boxes he could do nothing 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.799
 but the Christian show had barely begun 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.529
 and if in the first half he left us his magic in the second half he flooded us with his 

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:04.159
 all the other Real Madrid players did the same thing 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.280
 attention to the patient fused from arbeloa eye to the fast and forceful center of 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.010
 ronaldo 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.010
 and be very careful with the accurate definition of gonzalo higuaín 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.690
 played on the 8th of the second that ended as best it could be in the 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.390
 network background 3 to 1 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.040
 and the good plays were always followed with ronaldo as axis in the 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.130
 center of the field in some was associated with kaka 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.680
 in others with higuaín in others with marcelo and in most with almost all 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.500
 his teammates maybe that's why the goal of Nilmar was just a small stone in 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.439
 the road we say small because in the 25 ronaldo appeared again the 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.630
 saw marcelo este a higuaín and the ball went back to sleep at the bottom of the net 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.040
 4 2 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.620
 and two were missing because the second was in the kaka party 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.560
 came after another great play of Real Madrid another great play of Christian who 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.110
 it is left to the Brazilian so that he sentenced 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.390
 5 to 2 ronaldo also scored two goals although the assistant believed he was in 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.259
 out of the game when it was not like that 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.600
 and deprived him of rounding a great match with another nation 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.780
 but he was knocked down in the area and he had the chance to debut as 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.220
 scorer to xabi alonso so it ended a wonderful and spectacular match and 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.979
 forceful in the bernabéu 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:21.189
 6 to 2 and three more points in the bernabéu Real Madrid does not know what it is to draw 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.059
 much less lose 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.619
 and is that the stadium of Chamartin is not only a fort is a fortress of 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:28.329
 good football and show
