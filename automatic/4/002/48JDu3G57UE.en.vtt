it and try it because it is a really
cool<00:03:35.700> product<00:03:36.060> because<00:03:36.630> it's<00:03:36.810> not

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
cool product because it's not

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.410 
cool product because it's not
necessarily<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.620> primer<00:03:38.010> but<00:03:38.730> it's<00:03:38.850> not<00:03:39.030> powder

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
necessarily a primer but it's not powder

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.229 
necessarily a primer but it's not powder
or<00:03:40.130> carrying<00:03:41.130> around<00:03:41.250> those<00:03:41.489> blotting<00:03:41.940> sheets

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239
