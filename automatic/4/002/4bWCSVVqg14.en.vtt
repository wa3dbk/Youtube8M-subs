for doing head shots that's really all

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.960 
for doing head shots that's really all
it's<00:01:06.630> good<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:06.960> because<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:08.070> doesn't<00:01:08.430> drop<00:01:08.700> at

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
it's good at because it doesn't drop at

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.830

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
all and it shoots straight forever it's

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.020 
all and it shoots straight forever it's
pretty<00:01:13.170> fast<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.950> kind<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.430> close<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
pretty fast it's kind of close to a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.539 
pretty fast it's kind of close to a
scout<00:01:15.390> elite<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.470> at<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> same<00:01:17.009> time<00:01:17.220> it's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
scout elite but at the same time it's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.660 
scout elite but at the same time it's
damage<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.330> ridiculously<00:01:19.110> low<00:01:19.409> especially<00:01:20.070> in

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
damage is ridiculously low especially in

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.270 
damage is ridiculously low especially in
normal<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.450> hardcore<00:01:22.259> once<00:01:22.979> you're<00:01:23.159> past

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
headshot people this pretty much why I

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.130 
headshot people this pretty much why I
started<00:01:36.030> playing<00:01:36.240> hardcore<00:01:36.540> first<00:01:36.960> place

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
started playing hardcore first place

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.600 
started playing hardcore first place
trying<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.439> get<00:01:37.560> these<00:01:37.680> headshots<00:01:37.920> forget

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
trying to get these headshots forget

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.710 
trying to get these headshots forget
this<00:01:38.729> gun<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.299> was<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.420> ridiculous

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
this gun because it was just ridiculous

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.000 
this gun because it was just ridiculous
and<00:01:40.409> I

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
and I

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.980 
and I
I<00:01:41.070> hated<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.120> home<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:43.260> it's<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.510> okay<00:01:45.510> but

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
I hated it home but it's it's okay but

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.010 
I hated it home but it's it's okay but
it<00:01:46.260> just<00:01:46.500> doesn't<00:01:46.850> have<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.880> damage<00:01:48.570> that

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
it just doesn't have that damage that

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.950 
it just doesn't have that damage that
say<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.620> m4<00:01:49.950> 285<00:01:50.400> has<00:01:50.730> even<00:01:51.300> though<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> m40a5

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
say the m4 285 has even though the m40a5

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.380 
say the m4 285 has even though the m40a5
fires<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:53.490> bullet<00:01:53.580> travels<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.060> lot<00:01:54.180> slower

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
fires the bullet travels a lot slower

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
fires the bullet travels a lot slower
than<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.900> rifle<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.350> still<00:01:55.650> like<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.040> m40a5

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
than this rifle I still like the m40a5

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.700 
than this rifle I still like the m40a5
much<00:01:57.090> better<00:01:57.360> simply<00:01:57.930> because<00:01:58.260> it<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.500> engage

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
much better simply because it can engage

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.950 
much better simply because it can engage
targets<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.460> about<00:02:00.330> double<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.780> distance

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
targets up to about double the distance

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.560 
targets up to about double the distance
of<00:02:01.260> this<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.430> rate<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.640> firearm<00:02:03.120> this<00:02:03.300> and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
of this and the rate of firearm this and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.600 
of this and the rate of firearm this and
all<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.960> other<00:02:04.080> close<00:02:04.350> combat<00:02:04.620> stabs<00:02:05.370> up

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
all the other close combat stabs up

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.910 
all the other close combat stabs up
pretty<00:02:05.880> much<00:02:06.000> better<00:02:06.900> which<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.560> flat-out

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
pretty much better which is flat-out

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.609 
pretty much better which is flat-out
better<00:02:08.220> than<00:02:08.430> this<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.850> this<00:02:09.630> one<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.110> honestly

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
better than this and this one I honestly

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.700
