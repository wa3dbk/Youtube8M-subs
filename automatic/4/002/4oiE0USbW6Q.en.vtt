00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.720
 hello very good today to cannes 89 and today you 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.510
 I'm going to show you the fifa news 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.940
 manager 13 the game came out about 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.500
 few days and the demo also for 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.450
 show what's new brings me 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.130
 downloaded the demo and I'll wait for a 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.750
 time to buy the game because the 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.790
 last year I got an exception very 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.379
 big to see that there was a huge bushing 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.720
 that the subsidiaries disappeared 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.430
 descending in the leagues and others and we 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.290
 they fixed until the update number 3 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.170
 which was several months later according to 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.550
 I remember and good first thing that you 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.170
 I want to comment is that the resolution of 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:53.580
 game has increased has become a 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.080
 1280 x 1024 is to say that it is now greater 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.300
 the main and most striking to simple 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.979
 view that has changed in the game is the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.170
 quick access bar 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.479
 This shows notifications with numbers 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.490
 and colors in red orange and green for 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.680
 let us know that there are problems or things 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.500
 that can improve in any area of 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.330
 our game from our club we can 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.340
 add any section of the 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.470
 game simply by dragging it from the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.140
 drop-down menu to the bar itself 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.670
 access is configurable lockable both 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.920
 for the club as for the selection 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.720
 team dynamics is a new 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.729
 tool that has several sections 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.170
 very innovative and important to have 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.479
 a team that understands and is well 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.189
 interpenetrated in the equipment analyzer 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.840
 we can filter the players of our 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.700
 first and second team and from the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.770
 analysis of the players we can see 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.119
 between which players there is complicity and 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.080
 who fight to play in the same 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.850
 position 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.830
 we can also see who are 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.720
 related who are enemy friends 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.159
 those who fight to play in the same 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.229
 position and so on 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.819
 in the analysis of a player we can see 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.780
 among other things the novelty of 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.520
 Personal objectives 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.319
 these are shown with a little circle 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.390
 green if they are fulfilled in yellow if 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.700
 are in process or are objective that 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.319
 they require permanence in some area and in 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.390
 red in which at the moment they are 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.709
 unfulfilled or failed this has a 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.840
 dynamics score system 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.310
 team that we can see reflected here and 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.900
 this is changing depending on the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.549
 individual goals the enmities 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.700
 friendships the affinity between 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.989
 players and many more things of all 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.790
 the points you have in favor against 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.860
 for the level of team dynamics you 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.019
 informs the assistant in this box 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.450
 here for example the one that enters my 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.549
 players there are no friends really help 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.310
 to subtract 10 points from the dynamics of 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.810
 team we can also filter the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.220
 players for those who have 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.110
 fulfilled his personal goal more 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.849
 important for those who do not have 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.459
 fulfilled and we can also filter 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.500
 depending on the real objective they have 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.760
 with it we can see which players 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.470
 they have the same personal goals 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.940
 as for example who wants to be the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.739
 team leader who want a 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.480
 long-term contract those that 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.620
 they want an experienced manager and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.629
 many more things 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.090
 from here we also have access to 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.040
 confidence of the players also to the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.840
 talks that these have been expanded is 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.819
 say there are new types of chats though 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.129
 also they kept the old well 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.690
 clearly shows us in the sandwich 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.310
 to make the talk the number of 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.190
 talks that we have left for the rest of 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.260
 the week as always from the tab 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.269
 promises we can also keep talking 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.030
 with the players that is to say give the 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.069
 talks but we have the same of 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.930
 last year in the menus to do 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.269
 you promise to tell the player what his 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.769
 function and so on the team hierarchy 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.060
 It is a pyramid where it shows us the 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.190
 structure with the most players 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.900
 important team where he puts us in 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.489
 first place to the leader after being the 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.620
 heavier players on the team is 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.239
 say the most important ones are these 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.799
 here and after these we have others 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.750
 a little less important but they are 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.640
 influential players for the team by 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.349
 they are also important and 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.480
 finally the young promises 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.780
 the history this here that we see with 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.370
 more is with less and so it is neither more nor 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.720
 less than a list with the changes that 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.480
 they have personal goals 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.519
 all the players really a 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.650
 history also here to the right we 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.310
 shows two graphs the objectives of 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.319
 Players 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.910
 and the development rate of the dynamics 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.650
 of equipment within the matrix of 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.720
 players we can select a player 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.520
 and see among other things the link with the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.110
 rest of classmates we can also see 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.000
 what skills are you training in these 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.349
 moments and the percentage of is the 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.030
 percentage of training that takes 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.280
 something else that we can see in the 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.139
 acceptance that you have on the team by 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.820
 example mesut özil does not have a 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.470
 total acceptance in the team as the 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.480
 has the other one that we have selected that 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.010
 I was a Christian if we talked about the relationship 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.510
 with the rest of our classmates we will see that 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.130
 sheen has a little arrow in green towards 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.500
 who will say why they are compatriots 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.180
 national team colleagues both 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.190
 they want intense workouts and they are 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.780
 concentrated in physical condition this 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.880
 has several tabs to see the 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.800
 relationships and for example we can see 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.570
 as between özil and kaká there is a 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.400
 red arrow because both fight 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.600
 by playing in the same position the menu 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.520
 of team training is 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.710
 basically the same although at the level of 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.510
 Design is quite attractive and I like it 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.070
 more than last year the improvement in 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.840
 this area this year is that the information 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.150
 of training and how the 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.410
 tactics becomes visible again and does not 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.540
 missing enter a thousand menus to 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.700
 find it one thing that really has me 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.720
 Pleased something weird that you noticed is that we 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.190
 they have removed the third team from 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.790
 juveniles does not appear here the third 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.710
 eyelash 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.630
 and I do not know if it will be to make the base of 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.880
 lighter data and that gives less 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.830
 problems when it comes to saying leagues or 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.030
 something like that I do not know in exchange for this have 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.250
 added another way to find 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.800
 juveniles and this is that the scouts are 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.110
 charge of it we can also send 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.170
 scouts to different events whether they're 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.080
 regional or national locals looking 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.430
 of some new soccer gem 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.370
 by clicking on these we can choose 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.260
 to send to the scout and it will show us 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.480
 Well, the time you need to do 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.070
 that work plus little things have changed the 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.780
 way to calculate the level of 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.340
 players now this one goes to the 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.100
 most important statistics for your 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.560
 position and therefore some players 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.510
 show a lower level than last year 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.190
 although this does not mean that they have 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.410
 worsened simply is that it has changed 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.030
 the way to calculate it another novelty is 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.860
 the player development tool 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.840
 something that I think is out of my 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.720
 reach because I 'm recording this 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.700
 with the demo of the game is supposed to be 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.560
 tool with it we can make a 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.360
 approximate calculation of how it will improve 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.010
 our player taking into account the 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.170
 frequency of injuries your level 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.150
 current your physical condition and your talent 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.430
 the template planner 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.450
 helps us get an idea of ​​how and which 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.700
 template will be next 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.990
 season will show us a list of 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.470
 players that we have in our 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.180
 youth teams portfolio etcetera and we 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.250
 will offer a comparison of the equipment 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.860
 current with the one planned for 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.200
 next season where we can see 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.570
 among other things the value the level of 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.120
 team average age average talent 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.550
 et cetera as far as the tactics have 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.200
 changed the way to manage the 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:46.060
 now we do not have concrete values like 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:48.280
 can be high medium short long short 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.680
 mixed in this edition allows us 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.270
 modify everything in percentages something that 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.640
 it helps us to have a much more practice 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.290
 adjusted to our tastes because it gives us 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.700
 higher level of personalization of this 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.800
 already talking about the changes that there are 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.900
 during the matches comment that they have 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.370
 added the talks at rest these 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.920
 they work in a similar way to 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.320
 talks before the start of the game and 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.090
 spend speech points if they arise 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.510
 effect will help raise the morale of 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.510
 our players 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.730
 they have changed the menu a bit 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.440
 the player talks now for 

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.060
 praise encourage or criticize the player 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.390
 we will have to do it from these 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.670
 friendly and with milestones 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:29.200
 and it will show us what effect it has on the 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:31.420
 player the option exercised on this 

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.040
 and also highlight the one 

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.450
 regardless of what we can do 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.610
 five interactions with players 

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.260
 we can give up to three massages that we 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.330
 They will help raise some energy to these 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.490
 and may be of help to those who are 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.990
 something sore or semi-injured like 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.060
 goodbye video I leave a piece 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.610
 of gameplay so you can appreciate that 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.880
 they have improved the melee in the 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.530
 3d mode you pass the centers and the 

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.180
 set pieces this has improved 

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.860
 a little bit everything seems a little better 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.500
 and the players look like something else 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.510
 smart have not improved the 3d engine 

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.670
 but in principle the temple seems 

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.940
 quite better than last year I 

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:08.680
 I played it with a gameplay edited by me 

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.210
 and here ends my video of news of 

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.400

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.650
