all that so here you're seeing the
picture<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.660> shiny<00:00:28.230> volcanium<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.789> actually

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
picture of shiny volcanium it actually

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.569 
picture of shiny volcanium it actually
has<00:00:30.420> two<00:00:30.810> new<00:00:30.990> moves<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.340> doesn't

has two new moves and it just it doesn't
say<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.820> your<00:00:33.000> signature<00:00:33.360> because<00:00:33.750> its

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
say that your signature because its

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.290 
say that your signature because its
signature<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.010> steamer<00:00:35.340> option<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.880> course<00:00:36.120> but

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
signature a steamer option of course but

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.110 
signature a steamer option of course but
thousand<00:00:36.930> wave<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.500> thousand<00:00:37.920> arrows

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
thousand wave and thousand arrows

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.959 
thousand wave and thousand arrows
thousand<00:00:39.120> arrows<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.600> hit<00:00:40.190> any<00:00:41.190> Pokemon<00:00:41.700> that

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
thousand arrows can hit any Pokemon that

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.090 
thousand arrows can hit any Pokemon that
is<00:00:42.180> up<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> air<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.590> pretty<00:00:43.920> much<00:00:43.980> is

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
is up in the air so it pretty much is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.500 
is up in the air so it pretty much is
like<00:00:44.370> gravity<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.210> with<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.450> know

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
like gravity but just with you know

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.110 
like gravity but just with you know
ground<00:00:45.840> move<00:00:45.989> thousand<00:00:46.469> waves<00:00:46.940> actually<00:00:47.940> is

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
ground move thousand waves actually is

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.560 
ground move thousand waves actually is
able<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.600> do<00:00:48.890> is<00:00:49.890> able<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> lock<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.030> opponents

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
able to do is able to lock in opponents

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.299 
able to do is able to lock in opponents
after<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.930> go<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> first<00:00:52.739> time<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.280> I

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
after you go for it the first time and I

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.790 
after you go for it the first time and I
think<00:00:53.370> that's<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:54.090> interesting<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:55.590> that

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
think that's really interesting and that

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.920 
think that's really interesting and that
leads<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.399> know<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> possibility<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.539> if

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
leads you know to the possibility of if

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.799 
leads you know to the possibility of if
there<00:00:58.170> will<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:59.090> different<00:01:00.090> forms<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
there will be a different forms with the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.049 
there will be a different forms with the
zygarde<00:01:01.320> when<00:01:01.559> pokemon<00:01:02.190> z<00:01:02.340> comes<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
zygarde when pokemon z comes out and

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.670 
zygarde when pokemon z comes out and
that's<00:01:03.149> what's<00:01:03.539> most<00:01:03.809> likely<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
that's what's most likely going to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.120 
that's what's most likely going to
happen<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.159> pokemon<00:01:05.610> z<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:06.950> that<00:01:07.950> looks

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
happen with pokemon z so that looks

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.789 
happen with pokemon z so that looks
really<00:01:08.430> cool<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:08.850> i<00:01:09.000> believe<00:01:09.689> both<00:01:10.049> moves

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
really cool because i believe both moves

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.219 
really cool because i believe both moves
are<00:01:11.159> both<00:01:11.490> 90<00:01:12.180> base<00:01:12.390> part<00:01:12.659> which<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.840> actually

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
are both 90 base part which is actually

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.050 
are both 90 base part which is actually
the<00:01:13.350> same<00:01:13.590> base<00:01:13.830> power<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.340> lens<00:01:14.610> ratha

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the same base power as lens ratha

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
the same base power as lens ratha
they're<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.330> physical<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.250> know

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
they're all physical so that you know

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
they're all physical so that you know
also<00:01:17.640> gives<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.119> pretty<00:01:18.570> good<00:01:18.750> connection<00:01:19.170> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
also gives a pretty good connection to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.200 
also gives a pretty good connection to
all<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.310> we'll<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> figure

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
all of this so we'll just have to figure

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
all of this so we'll just have to figure
out<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:21.509> happens<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:21.990> their<00:01:22.229> right<00:01:23.189> here

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
out what happens with their right here

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
out what happens with their right here
i'm<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> show<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.090> who<00:01:24.479> pisani<00:01:25.290> sprite

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
i'm going to show you who pisani sprite

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.010 
i'm going to show you who pisani sprite
not<00:01:26.549> much<00:01:26.790> else<00:01:27.000> knew<00:01:27.210> about<00:01:27.240> hubo<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:27.900> you

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
not much else knew about hubo but you

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.380 
not much else knew about hubo but you
can<00:01:28.170> see<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.770> gets<00:01:29.009> all<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.610> its<00:01:29.759> kind<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.090> parts

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
can see it gets all of its kind of parts

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.030 
can see it gets all of its kind of parts
you<00:01:30.509> know<00:01:30.630> special<00:01:30.930> moves<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.439> whatnot<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you know special moves and whatnot so it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.380 
you know special moves and whatnot so it
looks<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.369> they<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.579> link<00:01:32.790> together<00:01:32.939> with

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
looks like they all link together with

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.880 
looks like they all link together with
you<00:01:33.570> know<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.409> able<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:34.740> each

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you know then be able to get each

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.910 
you know then be able to get each
other's<00:01:35.189> moves<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:36.420> basically<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.799> all

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
other's moves so basically this was all

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
other's moves so basically this was all
put<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.189> serebii<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.759> let's<00:01:38.970> Nino<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.390> all<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
put on serebii so let's Nino get all the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.030 
put on serebii so let's Nino get all the
official<00:01:40.020> stats<00:01:40.259> all<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> official

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
abilities and stuff like that start off

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.350 
abilities and stuff like that start off
with<00:01:43.079> hooba<00:01:43.380> hooba<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:44.340> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.030> its

with hooba hooba is going to have its

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.230 
with hooba hooba is going to have its
signature<00:01:45.810> move<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.229> hyperspace<00:01:46.860> whole<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:48.090> is

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
signature move of hyperspace whole it is

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.300 
signature move of hyperspace whole it is

there<00:02:20.490> they<00:02:20.850> don't<00:02:20.970> really<00:02:21.270> mean<00:02:21.420> too<00:02:21.569> much

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
there they don't really mean too much

there they don't really mean too much
base<00:02:22.410> stats<00:02:23.150> speed<00:02:24.150> isn't<00:02:24.450> really<00:02:24.780> good

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
base stats speed isn't really good

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.040 
base stats speed isn't really good
honestly<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.180> guess<00:02:27.510> it's<00:02:27.660> really<00:02:27.900> only

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050

this is a little bit more book I think
or<00:03:14.459> maybe<00:03:14.489> it's<00:03:14.910> just<00:03:15.000> flip-flopped<00:03:15.569> I'm<00:03:15.750> not

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
or maybe it's just flip-flopped I'm not

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.100 
or maybe it's just flip-flopped I'm not
sure<00:03:16.260> but<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.519> has<00:03:18.390> pretty<00:03:18.480> good<00:03:18.720> special

about this little Neos i guard you know

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.930 
about this little Neos i guard you know
whole<00:03:30.870> thing<00:03:31.140> being<00:03:31.860> like<00:03:32.280> two<00:03:32.579> different

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
whole thing being like two different

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.970 
whole thing being like two different
forms<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:33.450> all<00:03:33.570> that<00:03:33.750> so<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.590> course<00:03:34.799> you're

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
forms and all that so of course you're

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.280 
forms and all that so of course you're
going<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.190> get<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.519> these<00:03:36.450> two<00:03:36.750> ish<00:03:36.840> removes

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
going to get to these two ish removes

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.660 
going to get to these two ish removes
that<00:03:37.620> are<00:03:38.040> just<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.489> course<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:38.940> volcanium<00:03:39.540> so

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
that are just of course on volcanium so

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.310 
that are just of course on volcanium so
and<00:03:41.670> i'm<00:03:41.910> just<00:03:42.120> going<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.810> assume<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
and i'm just going to assume that the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.780 
and i'm just going to assume that the
other<00:03:43.470> two<00:03:43.650> can<00:03:43.980> probably<00:03:44.370> learn<00:03:44.549> it

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
other two can probably learn it

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.590 
other two can probably learn it
especially<00:03:45.540> diancie<00:03:46.049> um<00:03:46.400> but<00:03:47.400> i<00:03:47.790> don't<00:03:48.299> know<00:03:48.359> i

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600
