the design of each of the astronauts was
actually<00:02:46.290> fairly<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.710> same<00:02:47.330> each<00:02:48.330> figure

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
actually fairly the same each figure

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.630 
actually fairly the same each figure
stands<00:02:48.960> about<00:02:49.170> five<00:02:49.440> inches<00:02:49.800> tall<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.310> is

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
stands about five inches tall and is

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.440 
stands about five inches tall and is
made<00:02:50.670> entirely<00:02:51.420> out<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.810> hard<00:02:52.230> rubber<00:02:52.500> as<00:02:53.450> you

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
made entirely out of hard rubber as you

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.090 
made entirely out of hard rubber as you
can<00:02:54.600> see<00:02:54.780> there<00:02:54.960> are<00:02:55.080> many<00:02:55.200> black<00:02:55.680> ridged

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
can see there are many black ridged

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.420 
can see there are many black ridged
areas<00:02:56.730> on<00:02:56.970> his<00:02:57.120> arms<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.690> legs<00:02:58.160> these<00:02:59.160> are

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
areas on his arms and legs these are

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.670 
areas on his arms and legs these are
basically<00:03:00.090> his<00:03:00.390> articulation<00:03:01.170> points<00:03:01.560> as

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
basically his articulation points as

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.560 
basically his articulation points as
these<00:03:02.250> areas<00:03:02.610> are<00:03:02.730> where<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:03.000> rubber<00:03:03.210> bends

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
these areas are where the rubber bends

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.200 
these areas are where the rubber bends
easier<00:03:04.020> allowing<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.220> pose<00:03:05.460> his<00:03:05.700> arms<00:03:06.000> and

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
easier allowing you to pose his arms and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.410 
easier allowing you to pose his arms and
legs<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.780> different<00:03:07.140> positions<00:03:08.209> think<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.300> it

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
legs in different positions think of it

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.600 
legs in different positions think of it
as<00:03:09.510> being<00:03:09.720> similar<00:03:10.020> to<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.350> modern<00:03:10.920> vendôme

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
as being similar to a modern vendôme

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.730 
as being similar to a modern vendôme
type<00:03:11.850> figure<00:03:12.240> but<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.720> little<00:03:13.230> sturdier<00:03:13.500> than

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
type figure but a little sturdier than

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.660 
type figure but a little sturdier than
that<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:19.110> figure<00:03:19.410> wears<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.800> plastic<00:03:20.400> helmet

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
that the figure wears a plastic helmet

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.390 
that the figure wears a plastic helmet
over<00:03:21.090> his<00:03:21.209> head<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:22.560> helmet<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:22.950> easily

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
over his head the helmet is easily

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.130 
over his head the helmet is easily
removable<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.180> head<00:03:24.450> underneath<00:03:24.750> even

removable and the head underneath even

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.650 
removable and the head underneath even
has<00:03:25.470> articulation<00:03:26.400> allowing<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.360> figure<00:03:27.570> to

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
has articulation allowing the figure to

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:36.680 
has articulation allowing the figure to
turn<00:03:27.840> his<00:03:27.930> head<00:03:28.110> from<00:03:28.350> side<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.680> side<00:03:35.690> for

turn his head from side to side for

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.240 
turn his head from side to side for

being just a bendable figure he's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.280 
being just a bendable figure he's
actually<00:03:38.550> very<00:03:39.150> well<00:03:39.390> made<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:39.660> even

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
actually very well made and even

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.580 
actually very well made and even
detailed<00:03:40.890> quite<00:03:41.190> nicely<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:43.200> front<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.530> his

a<00:04:13.010> few<00:04:13.250> of<00:04:13.310> those<00:04:13.550> here<00:04:13.610> that<00:04:14.000> we<00:04:14.120> can<00:04:14.270> take<00:04:14.420> a

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
a few of those here that we can take a

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.009 
a few of those here that we can take a
quick<00:04:14.660> look<00:04:14.930> at<00:04:15.220> so<00:04:16.220> first<00:04:16.549> up<00:04:16.790> is<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.690> space

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
quick look at so first up is the space

with two D batteries the crawler would

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.780 
with two D batteries the crawler would
roll<00:04:43.910> around<00:04:44.710> what<00:04:45.710> was<00:04:45.830> special<00:04:46.130> about<00:04:46.340> this

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
roll around what was special about this

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.270 
roll around what was special about this
is<00:04:46.970> even<00:04:47.480> if<00:04:47.600> it<00:04:47.720> was<00:04:47.840> flipped<00:04:48.230> over<00:04:48.470> the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
is even if it was flipped over the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.220 
is even if it was flipped over the
vehicle<00:04:49.700> would<00:04:49.820> still<00:04:50.240> continue<00:04:50.660> to<00:04:50.840> roll

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
vehicle would still continue to roll

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.700 
vehicle would still continue to roll
because<00:04:51.830> of<00:04:52.190> those<00:04:52.400> large<00:04:52.730> wheels<00:04:53.590> it's<00:04:54.590> a

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
because of those large wheels it's a

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.020 
because of those large wheels it's a
shame<00:04:54.950> that<00:04:54.980> this<00:04:55.400> one<00:04:55.640> here<00:04:55.850> is<00:04:56.000> in

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
shame that this one here is in

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.240 
shame that this one here is in
non-working<00:04:56.630> order<00:04:57.050> as<00:04:57.200> I'd<00:04:57.440> love<00:04:57.980> to<00:04:58.160> have

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
non-working order as I'd love to have

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.770 
non-working order as I'd love to have
been<00:04:58.310> able<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.580> try<00:04:58.850> that<00:04:59.060> out<00:04:59.090> and<00:04:59.419> show<00:04:59.600> it

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
been able to try that out and show it

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.680 
been able to try that out and show it
off<00:04:59.930> but<00:05:00.669> even<00:05:01.669> still<00:05:01.790> it's<00:05:02.090> a<00:05:02.180> very<00:05:02.450> cool

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690
