 now lobsters two seconds and we do 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.710
 this is the first as you see and is a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.350
 there are lobster lobsters of three types sumo 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.869
 these one European because blue 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.150
 practically then there is the American one 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.760
 of the good that is more red and then that 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.769
 Balkan that does not go so well yes 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.230
 will distinguish males and females for one 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.320
 bigger queue situation the thing 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.890
 because it has to accept the eggs is the thing 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.300
 important with regards to races that 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.780
 make for this purpose in the water 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.780
 boiling 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.379
 we take another one 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.039
 ok 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.020
 always on gv world and after 20 minutes 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.100
 approximately for a lobster of one kilo and 800 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.289
 grams 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.420
 let's see if they are cooked as they are 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.820
 families have made the bars is 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.649
 simple they turn red 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.170
 now let's resume and see 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.780
 actually if they have become well 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.729
 they are decidedly red, they are cooked 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.189
 to get out a little guilt then the case 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.710
 to take them out to cool and then 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.390
 we will see later how to cut them 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.820
 he also takes away the third part of the carapace 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.270
 always of givi world we have caught 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.460
 the lobster looks at the worthy see 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.369
 and now we cut it in all his 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.380
 extension is very cold must be 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.409
 Italian in practice 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.180
 particular up to the tail then 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.789
 then we work I want to make you 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.350
 see something important when 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.310
 cut the lobster do not throw anything 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.350
 we find the carapace 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.240
 the only thing you have to throw this away 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.890
 part here inside 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.320
 here is part of the brain that more 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.229
 green that must surely be removed there 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.909
 I'll show you this one this is it 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.850
 the part that needs to be cleaned up everything else 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.060
 eat everything do not take away absolutely 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.759
 the claws and do not pierce because the sauce there 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.569
 will serve to prepare then all his 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.120
 chest our hello last part gigi 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.250

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.799
 said that we are at the end because then 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.970

 ready on the ready we add later 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.459
 a little bit of white wine that much 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.079
 which is enough to get some 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.459
 soap 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.739
