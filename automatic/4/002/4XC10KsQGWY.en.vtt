00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.530
 Hi, people here remembering what I find 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.059
 I'll show you how to do this. 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:18.170
 paper ball is with batter here as 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.600
 this one here like the one that are flavors 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.240
 perfÃ¡cil to do you can make up 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.630
 with a notebook sheet for example I 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.540
 I made it with a normal colored A4 sheet of 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.520
 paper is you can use anything 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.760
 that you have at home to decorate 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.249
 I used these grampinhos elza is equal to 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.179
 sheik but can use for example that 

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:44.539
 It had a nice sticker to give a 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:47.390
 small gift for someone and also 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.260
 another idea is to use, for example, a party 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.280
 you can put in is 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.030
 At last, it 's something that 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.780
 It's super cheap, it's not for you. 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.190
 You'll only need it, it's actually cola. 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.560
 scissors and these little things to decorate and 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.100
 time to make it simple then 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.340
 Lagoa there to make ours the little bag 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.979
 paper we will need a 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.299
 sheet of paper is there can be any 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.189
 It's kind of me, I chose this race is more 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.509
 It is beautiful too with a sheet 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:29.689
 notebook with binder sheet is glued to 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.399
 scissors stick and things to decorate 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.640
 Your little bag after I got here. 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.820
 some stickers is one of the staples and Corn 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.719
 a great team 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.969
 good first but what are we going? 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.899
 pick up our sheet of paper and go 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.899
 fold half 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:22.800
 there he will cut 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:25.230
 I went there in the middle cut went beyond the middle 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.450
 We're going to book it, not because we 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.170
 will actually use a half 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.450
 It's there we'll pick it up on the side and 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.450
 Are you going to come here? 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:54.980
 and then we will pass glue here 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:04.100
 colleague down 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:07.190
 We open the pastry here, it's going to fold. 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:22.090
 this part of the paper until you find this 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:22.090
 link and close fold here from the side 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:30.770
 then we'll get down here will 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:35.630
 not strong bend not only to make a 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:41.450
 take it clean and here in the tip the people 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:48.020
 it will open like this 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:50.320
 on both sides do like this and there 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.320
 like this 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:10.890
 will stick to a formula so okay and there 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.890
 We 'll hang glue here and here. 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.970
 fold here 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:26.530
 and pass the glue here but first I go 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.530
 hang glue here 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:45.949
 in the bag here is just a little twist 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.949
 on here 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:13.340
 also at the tip and fold here until 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:19.430
 find this part I'll stick I'll stay 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:23.140
 with a hexagonal so that will be the 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.140
 background in the truth of our school 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:32.140
 I'll evaluate there 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:45.470
 and in fact our 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:48.440
 to give a sling with scissors ajeitada 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:52.820
 to do and I'll fill with a 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:55.280
 little bean so that it stays 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.010
 very full and heavy for you to see how 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.530
 she gets really something 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:12.770
 inside just a little bit 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:23.660
 simone and over here I'll play 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:25.010
 size that I think is cute and there 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:31.270
 It's true, it's just decorating. 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:31.270
 I'm going to cut this rope here 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.770
 I'll put a little piece of it I think it's fine. 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:07:04.460
 I'm going to put a little group here too. 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:06.620
 on top puts it there and you're ready to 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.130
