about<00:01:10.100> using<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.670> keyboard<00:01:10.880> which<00:01:11.390> could<00:01:11.660> be

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
about using the keyboard which could be

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.690 
about using the keyboard which could be
a<00:01:11.840> bit<00:01:11.960> of<00:01:12.050> a<00:01:12.110> PN<00:01:12.350> because<00:01:13.010> while<00:01:13.190> using<00:01:13.490> a

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
a bit of a PN because while using a

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.460 
a bit of a PN because while using a
keyboard<00:01:13.880> everything<00:01:14.780> in<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:14.930> game<00:01:15.110> still

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
keyboard everything in the game still

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.140 
keyboard everything in the game still
keeps<00:01:15.710> going<00:01:16.010> as<00:01:16.220> you<00:01:16.370> can<00:01:16.490> see<00:01:16.670> by<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.880> timer

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
keeps going as you can see by the timer

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.180 
keeps going as you can see by the timer
down<00:01:17.390> there<00:01:17.570> so<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:18.200> could<00:01:18.680> be<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.770> bit<00:01:18.980> hard

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
down there so that could be a bit hard

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.920 
down there so that could be a bit hard
to<00:01:19.310> cycle<00:01:19.790> through<00:01:19.820> your<00:01:20.030> weapons<00:01:20.390> whilst<00:01:20.659> as

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
to cycle through your weapons whilst as

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.270 
to cycle through your weapons whilst as
an<00:01:21.050> enemy<00:01:21.200> on<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.530> screen<00:01:21.740> trying<00:01:21.980> to<00:01:22.100> kick

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
an enemy on the screen trying to kick

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.490 
an enemy on the screen trying to kick
the<00:01:22.400> crap<00:01:22.550> out<00:01:22.700> of<00:01:22.760> you<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.930> game's<00:01:24.140> still<00:01:24.380> an

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
the crap out of you the game's still an

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.500 
the crap out of you the game's still an
isometric<00:01:25.070> style<00:01:25.340> game<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:25.970> things<00:01:26.180> can<00:01:26.360> be<00:01:26.480> a

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
isometric style game so things can be a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.420 
isometric style game so things can be a
bit<00:01:26.720> dodgy<00:01:26.930> to<00:01:27.200> control<00:01:27.650> especially<00:01:27.980> with<00:01:28.340> the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
bit dodgy to control especially with the

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.160 
bit dodgy to control especially with the
d-pad<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.120> you<00:01:29.300> can<00:01:29.480> have<00:01:29.570> a<00:01:29.630> bit<00:01:29.930> of<00:01:29.960> trouble

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
d-pad and you can have a bit of trouble

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.230 
d-pad and you can have a bit of trouble
picking<00:01:30.560> things<00:01:30.860> up<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:31.280> activate<00:01:31.700> names<00:01:31.970> and

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
picking things up and activate names and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.060 
picking things up and activate names and
the<00:01:32.300> likes<00:01:32.510> so<00:01:33.170> it's<00:01:33.290> a<00:01:33.350> type<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.560> thing<00:01:33.860> where

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
the likes so it's a type of thing where

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.340 
the likes so it's a type of thing where
I<00:01:34.100> definitely<00:01:34.580> recommend<00:01:34.850> an<00:01:35.540> analog<00:01:35.960> but

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
I definitely recommend an analog but

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.170 
I definitely recommend an analog but
unfortunately<00:01:37.040> even<00:01:37.490> though<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.790> classic

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
unfortunately even though the classic

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.240 
unfortunately even though the classic
controller<00:01:38.300> is<00:01:38.810> supported<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.590> analog<00:01:40.040> on

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
controller is supported the analog on

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.780 
controller is supported the analog on
the<00:01:40.340> clock

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
the clock

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.610 
the clock
taller<00:01:41.090> isn't<00:01:41.570> supported<00:01:42.020> so<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.290> have<00:01:42.470> to

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
taller isn't supported so you have to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.200 
taller isn't supported so you have to
use<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:42.770> gamecube<00:01:43.310> controller<00:01:43.670> if<00:01:43.910> you<00:01:44.030> want

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
use a gamecube controller if you want

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.270 
use a gamecube controller if you want
that<00:01:44.360> so<00:01:44.960> good<00:01:45.320> news<00:01:45.500> if<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:45.800> just<00:01:46.010> want<00:01:46.220> a

that<00:02:10.580> are<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.729> bit<00:02:10.759> dodgy<00:02:11.090> there<00:02:11.750> i<00:02:11.780> can<00:02:11.960> pick<00:02:12.230> a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
that are a bit dodgy there i can pick a

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.290 
that are a bit dodgy there i can pick a
nice<00:02:12.470> ICS<00:02:12.800> still<00:02:13.040> don't<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.310> pick<00:02:13.610> up<00:02:13.790> doing

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
nice ICS still don't you pick up doing

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.820 
nice ICS still don't you pick up doing
jumping<00:02:14.750> sections<00:02:15.200> can<00:02:15.380> still<00:02:15.650> be<00:02:15.800> a

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
jumping sections can still be a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.440 
jumping sections can still be a
nightmare<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.610> seems<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.000> be<00:02:17.120> more<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.330> a

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
nightmare and it seems to be more of a

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.360 
nightmare and it seems to be more of a
local<00:02:17.750> in<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.900> skill<00:02:18.140> system<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.890> if<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.250> is

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
local in a skill system and if it is

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.850 
local in a skill system and if it is
skill<00:02:19.700> then<00:02:19.910> maybe<00:02:20.120> i<00:02:20.209> just<00:02:20.270> suck<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:21.320> it's<00:02:21.800> a

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
skill then maybe i just suck but it's a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.050 
skill then maybe i just suck but it's a
type<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.070> thing<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.520> can<00:02:22.640> go<00:02:22.790> through

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
type of thing that you can go through

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.610 
type of thing that you can go through
all<00:02:23.240> of<00:02:23.270> your<00:02:23.570> lives<00:02:23.750> in<00:02:23.990> just<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.260> matter<00:02:24.440> of

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
all of your lives in just a matter of

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.290 
all of your lives in just a matter of
seconds<00:02:25.100> on<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.250> jumping<00:02:25.610> section<00:02:26.030> which<00:02:26.270> is

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
seconds on the jumping section which is

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.570 
seconds on the jumping section which is
a<00:02:26.420> bit<00:02:26.570> of<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.720> shame<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.920> game<00:02:28.190> actually<00:02:28.370> has

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
a bit of a shame this game actually has

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.280 
a bit of a shame this game actually has
seven<00:02:29.090> levels<00:02:29.270> where<00:02:29.570> was<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.780> last<00:02:29.810> one<00:02:30.170> on

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
seven levels where was the last one on

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.440 
seven levels where was the last one on
he<00:02:30.380> had<00:02:30.530> six<00:02:30.890> or<00:02:31.250> also<00:02:31.760> good<00:02:31.970> news<00:02:32.000> because
