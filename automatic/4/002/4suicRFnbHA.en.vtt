00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:10.830
 hello thank you for being in a new video 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.820
 of this channel this time we have 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.400
 tips and tricks of lenovo k 3 note that 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.990
 as you see I am in the other launcher 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.449
 rather not in the normal launcher 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.999
 now I show you the normal launcher 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.730
 let's go here to adjustments so you start 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.529
 see how the normal launcher is 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.409
 we just go to the settings of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.420
 screen and here we will find the 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.730
 home page let's select the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.980
 from lenovo and we go to him so that what 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.500
 you can appreciate and see why I change it 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.149
 as you see everything is like may is let's say 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.910
 all applications on the desktop 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.910
 and as it brings some repeated it looks 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.039
 too dirty on the screen but 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.960
 well let's start with capturing 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.730
 screen let's do it as always 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.620
 with the volume button down and the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.859
 button on and off we leave them 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.269
 pressed and ready the capture is made 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.070
 screen to enter the 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.589
 multitasking is by holding the button 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.870
 of home and as you see enter here from a 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.750
 way very similar to me is new 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.670
 to multitasking and to slide to 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.040
 discard rather an application it 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.080
 does it upwards as it happens in ios 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.290
 and let's see if you can two at the same 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.780
 not only one time at a time 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.460
 there it is if you saw also we had a 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.710
 button to clean all 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.990
 one-touch applications so 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.730
 it's pretty simple, let's go to the bar 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.260
 of notifications that you see in this 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.410
 case we have the notification of the 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.660
 capture we can discard it like this with a 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.970
 small slip to click or 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.640
 definitely put a slip 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.040
 total now and remove it but good 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.680
 here we have the quick adjustments as 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.720
 you see the dogos for wifi data and more 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.730
 things so it's also well designed 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.860
 this and it has a blur again 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.230
 how this layer is quite inspired 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.170
 in we have an ultra gold mode of 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.810
 energy and here it just says superpower 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.660
 as you see the pulse and automatically it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.060
 starts to activate and I only have access to 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.700
 these applications now but I can not 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.710
 add some others so only 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.150
 can access the phone contacts 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.829
 messages and more 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.450
 so it's quite restrictive 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.299
 also this ultra saving mode 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.670
 energy we are going to close it to leave us 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.099
 we go to the settings again to see 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.459
 How many options does it allow us to configure? 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.760
 for example we go here to screen and 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.519
 let's see what has a here 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.769
 light protection ie night 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.680
 so that you do not hurt your eyes so 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.230
 that is an option that could lower more 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.390
 the brightness still of the minimum so 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.250
 we go now to the screen and here as 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.930
 you see we have several themes for the 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.060
 lock screen and if we click here 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.099
 we can go to download some others 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.959
 so that the lock screen changes 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.700
 totally so it's not just the 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.010
 appearance but also the way of 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.599
 unlock changes so you have a 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.060
 variety of options as they usually 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.519
 be in these layers very inspired in 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.260
 china so you can change your screen 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.590
 of blockade we totally go again 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.489
 back and here where it says character 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.319
 settings 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.510
 this is where we have enough things 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.239
 for example quick snap is to activate 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.459
 a double click on any of 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.030
 these buttons to take a picture 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.819
 for example 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.340
 to put this ok let's turn off the 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.390
 screen and now I'm going to press twice 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.490
 a button 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.170
 vibrated enters the camera and 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.600
 automatically take the photo but what 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.819
 The truth is that it is quite fast 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.030
 very very very fast and I liked that 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.530
 let's go back to the book and look there 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.200
 it came out a bit moved I did it on purpose 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.390
 to know when I was taking it but 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.840
 it does not take too long to take it 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.800
 again there's going to come out what 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.810
 we turn off double pulsation vibrates and ready 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.489
 the photograph is already, so that 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.739
 liked quite now we can also 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.720
 calibrate the touch screen if it is not 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.030
 it works too well for you there 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.010
 enter to calibrate the let's also see 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.590
 that we have this option of live the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.959
 screen means that with double touch 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.760
 we can activate the screen as you see 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.220
 easy and that option if I like it 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.920
 we're going to pay it again a lot 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.590
 touches and the screen is activated and 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.650
 finally we have black screen a lock 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.479
 this will allow us to draw some 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.490
 element on the locked screen 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.600
 so that it activates because I only 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.090
 I have this option here 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.550
 the first one that allows me to slide like this 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.110
 so that it is unlocked directly not 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.970
 to turn on the screen but 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.860
 to be unlocked but also 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.970
 I can activate this to enter the 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.740
 camera being once so enters 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.660
 camera and it does not take that long so it's 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.760
 quite well and apart I can put you 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.470
 set to select a 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.510
 specific application if it is not 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.370
 I want it to be the camera so as 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.080
 you see it's pretty easy and finally 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.300
 smart scene are simply 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.310
 profiles that you can activate or that you 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.370
 activate at certain times for 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.930
 customize the sounds and more things like that 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.640
 which is also pretty good that 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.770
 practically here all the 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.510
 added software that brings this layer 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.700
 because everything else are adjustments 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.770
 normal let's say although we can also 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.010
 enter here to the power manager where we go 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.840
 to find also the saving mode 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.030
 of savings and here we can select what 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.400
 applications we do not want to affect this 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.290
 way of saving so that they are not 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.570
 decrease the performance so as 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.790
 you see it's pretty good in a matter of 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.660
 software what you need is a way 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.090
 in a single hand I can not find 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.830
 and some way to use it with just one 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.620
 hand to make it easier so 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.390
 I hope you liked this video 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.400
 so you can see everything you have 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.650
 this device as you see your layer is 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.450
 very inspired by joves but you can 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.670
 select another launcher so that 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.700
 less the launcher is a bit more 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:53.520
 friendly I have nova where you can already see 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.290
 everything more ordered and already in this way 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.360
 simply the rest is personalized 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.220
 but the rest looks pretty good just 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.230
 the launcher is the one that looks with a 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.150
 very very very ugly appearance heavy everything 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.370
 the rest is very good so I hope 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.820
 that you liked and we see the 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.820
 next 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.210
 t
