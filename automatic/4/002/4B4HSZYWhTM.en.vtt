hey guys and today I'm looking over the

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.450 
hey guys and today I'm looking over the
mock<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.759> built<00:00:06.690> lot<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:07.919> I've<00:00:08.040> been<00:00:08.250> building

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
mock I built lot that I've been building

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.879 
mock I built lot that I've been building
over<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:09.000> past<00:00:09.240> few<00:00:09.450> days<00:00:09.660> it's<00:00:10.200> just<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.710> mini

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
over the past few days it's just a mini

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.849 
over the past few days it's just a mini
bot<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.400> mini<00:00:11.940> mark<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:14.450> it<00:00:15.450> took<00:00:15.870> me<00:00:15.900> yeah<00:00:16.740> it

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
bot a mini mark and it took me yeah it

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.150 
bot a mini mark and it took me yeah it
cook<00:00:17.070> took<00:00:17.400> me<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> couple<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:18.060> days<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:19.160> produce

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
cook took me a couple of days to produce

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.480 
cook took me a couple of days to produce
and<00:00:20.760> originally<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.359> was<00:00:21.630> gonna<00:00:21.840> put<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:23.180> a

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
and originally I was gonna put it in a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.540 
and originally I was gonna put it in a
contest<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:27.180> i<00:00:27.740> never<00:00:28.740> got<00:00:28.920> chance<00:00:29.250> during

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
contest but i never got chance during

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.310 
contest but i never got chance during
the<00:00:29.730> end<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.210> i<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.689> thought<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:30.960> would<00:00:31.140> be<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the end so i just thought it would be a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.940 
the end so i just thought it would be a
waste<00:00:31.640> just<00:00:32.640> dismantling<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.750> without<00:00:33.989> doing

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
waste just dismantling it without doing

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.910 
waste just dismantling it without doing
a<00:00:35.040> video<00:00:35.219> showing<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.000> guys<00:00:36.469> so<00:00:37.469> i<00:00:37.590> just

wanted to show you some of the figures

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.229 
wanted to show you some of the figures
involved<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:41.579> making<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:42.290> the<00:00:43.290> mock<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
involved in the making of the mock and

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.970 
involved in the making of the mock and
obviously<00:00:45.239> i<00:00:45.539> want<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.020> know<00:00:46.140> your<00:00:46.379> opinions

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.229 
obviously i want to know your opinions
on<00:00:47.219> how<00:00:47.370> i<00:00:47.399> could<00:00:48.020> improve<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.789> ways<00:00:50.789> that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
on how i could improve it and ways that

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.910 
on how i could improve it and ways that
i<00:00:52.129> could<00:00:53.129> maybe<00:00:53.539> take<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:55.160> step<00:00:57.170> up<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
i could maybe take it one step up to the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.729 
i could maybe take it one step up to the
next<00:00:59.039> level<00:00:59.430> say<00:01:00.000> three<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:00.870> four<00:01:01.199> gray<00:01:01.500> base

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
next level say three or four gray base

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.119 
next level say three or four gray base
plates<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.570> was<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> mini<00:01:04.229> more<00:01:04.500> contests

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
plates as this was a mini more contests

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.160 
plates as this was a mini more contests
like<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.489> am<00:01:06.090> was<00:01:06.990> only<00:01:07.350> permitted<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.189> use

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
like I am was only permitted to use

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.950 
like I am was only permitted to use
green<00:01:10.170> base<00:01:10.890> plates<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.549> blue<00:01:11.820> base<00:01:12.180> plates<00:01:12.659> so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
green base plates or blue base plates so

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.920 
green base plates or blue base plates so
not<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.890> big<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> let's<00:01:16.409> get<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> mock<00:01:17.930> so

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
not that big so let's get to the mock so

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.200 
not that big so let's get to the mock so
you<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.560> general<00:01:20.009> idea<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.610> what<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.030> looks

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
you get a general idea of what it looks

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.330 
you get a general idea of what it looks
like<00:01:21.570> from<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.770> outside<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:25.170> at<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.040> end<00:01:26.070> of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
like from the outside and at the end of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.030 
like from the outside and at the end of
the<00:01:26.549> video<00:01:26.880> you'll<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.780> selection<00:01:28.650> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the video you'll see a selection of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.260 
the video you'll see a selection of
pictures<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.579> will<00:01:29.880> give<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.150> an

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
pictures that will give you an

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.190 
pictures that will give you an
indication<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.909> inside<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.630> bunker

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
indication of the inside of the bunker

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.090 
indication of the inside of the bunker
and<00:01:34.820> obviously<00:01:36.170> shops<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.409> detail<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
and obviously shops in detail all the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.569 
and obviously shops in detail all the
figures<00:01:38.549> involved<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.040> weapons<00:01:41.430> they

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
figures involved and the weapons they

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.420 
figures involved and the weapons they
use<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.619> on<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:44.820> side<00:01:45.149> here<00:01:45.570> we've<00:01:46.110> got<00:01:46.430> a

this figure he as a printed torso and

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.080 
this figure he as a printed torso and
yet<00:04:48.930> that<00:04:49.410> was<00:04:49.590> quite<00:04:49.800> good<00:04:49.830> idea<00:04:50.400> of<00:04:50.580> mine<00:04:50.790> to
