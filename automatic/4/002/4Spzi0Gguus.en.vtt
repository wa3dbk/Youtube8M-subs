start<00:00:28.710> playing<00:00:28.829> the<00:00:29.070> odds<00:00:29.659> and<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:33.660> truth<00:00:33.870> is

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
start playing the odds and the truth is

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.830 
start playing the odds and the truth is
there's<00:00:35.250> always<00:00:35.520> something<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.000> lose<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.420> guess

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
there's always something to lose I guess

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.770

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
but if that stands the reason then

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.060 
but if that stands the reason then
there's<00:00:40.440> always<00:00:40.649> something<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> gain<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.730> so

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
there's always something to gain and so

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
athletes because they have this small

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.839 
athletes because they have this small
window<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> opportunity<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.340> they<00:02:11.730> go

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
window of opportunity and they go

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.400 
window of opportunity and they go
through<00:02:12.060> all<00:02:12.209> these<00:02:12.420> stages<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:13.019> development

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
through all these stages of development

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.720 
through all these stages of development
and<00:02:13.590> then<00:02:13.890> they<00:02:14.010> are<00:02:14.040> on<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.489> new

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and then they are on to this new

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.380 
and then they are on to this new
life<00:02:14.940> but<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.959> truth<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.920> same<00:02:17.129> life

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
life but the truth is it's the same life

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.630 
life but the truth is it's the same life
they<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:18.599> get<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.840> use<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.140> same<00:02:19.409> tools<00:02:19.860> that

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
they just get to use the same tools that

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.820 
they just get to use the same tools that
have<00:02:20.760> been<00:02:20.970> sharpened<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.720> honed<00:02:21.989> in<00:02:22.260> to

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
have been sharpened and honed in to

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.059 
have been sharpened and honed in to
really<00:02:23.459> kill<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:24.140> whether<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.349> in<00:02:25.500> business
