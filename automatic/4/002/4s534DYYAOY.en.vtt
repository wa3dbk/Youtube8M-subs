00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
right he's got all this momentum but if

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.150 
right he's got all this momentum but if
ice<00:02:00.670> climbers<00:02:01.060> gets<00:02:01.240> one<00:02:01.450> grab<00:02:01.800> it<00:02:02.800> stops

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
ice climbers gets one grab it stops

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:11.910 
ice climbers gets one grab it stops
there<00:02:03.399> but<00:02:03.729> oh<00:02:03.940> my<00:02:06.509> yo<00:02:07.979> happening<00:02:09.720> oh<00:02:10.770> no<00:02:11.770> he's

tries to get the doubter that's a rough

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.740 
tries to get the doubter that's a rough
thing<00:02:23.739> is<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.040> uh-oh<00:02:24.850> ice<00:02:25.239> climbers<00:02:25.600> up

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
thing is that uh-oh ice climbers up

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.000 
thing is that uh-oh ice climbers up
they're<00:02:25.900> actually<00:02:26.230> out<00:02:26.320> range<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.709> that<00:02:26.860> down

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
they're actually out range is that down

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.430 
they're actually out range is that down
there<00:02:27.070> oh<00:02:27.430> yeah<00:02:27.700> yeah<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.330> think<00:02:28.600> yeah<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.200> don't

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
let's make back no man is dead but still

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.020 
let's make back no man is dead but still
got<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.170> Popo<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.560> deal<00:02:53.829> with<00:02:54.010> yeah<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.700> right

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
got a Popo to deal with yeah and right

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.610 
got a Popo to deal with yeah and right
here<00:02:55.329> nested<00:02:55.629> on<00:02:55.719> low<00:02:55.870> percent<00:02:56.230> this<00:02:56.439> is<00:02:56.500> a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
here nested on low percent this is a

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.709 
here nested on low percent this is a
momentum<00:02:57.219> killer<00:02:57.340> because<00:02:57.700> he's<00:02:57.879> yeah<00:02:58.450> I

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:58.719 
momentum killer because he's yeah I

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.539 
momentum killer because he's yeah I
think<00:02:58.870> that's<00:02:59.049> a<00:02:59.140> double<00:02:59.469> jump<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.859> so<00:03:00.099> bad

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
think that's a double jump is so bad

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.190 
think that's a double jump is so bad
that<00:03:00.579> even<00:03:01.269> if<00:03:01.450> he<00:03:01.510> doubles<00:03:01.840> home<00:03:01.959> two<00:03:02.079> out<00:03:02.170> of

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
that even if he doubles home two out of

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.660 
that even if he doubles home two out of
that<00:03:02.409> I<00:03:02.560> think<00:03:02.799> that<00:03:02.950> she<00:03:03.219> would<00:03:03.400> still<00:03:03.519> have

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
that I think that she would still have

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.160 
that I think that she would still have
his<00:03:03.849> issues<00:03:04.650> yes<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:06.040> just<00:03:06.099> sets<00:03:06.459> up<00:03:06.579> for<00:03:06.790> like

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
his issues yes it just sets up for like

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.030 
his issues yes it just sets up for like
