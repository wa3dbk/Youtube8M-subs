he<00:01:07.430> didn't<00:01:07.760> know<00:01:07.909> you'd<00:01:08.090> be<00:01:08.120> a<00:01:08.240> movie<00:01:08.600> star<00:01:08.630> by

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
he didn't know you'd be a movie star by

he didn't know you'd be a movie star by
taking<00:01:09.770> on<00:01:09.860> this<00:01:10.010> tub<00:01:11.140> well<00:01:12.140> probably<00:01:12.770> this

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
taking on this tub well probably this

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:22.070 
taking on this tub well probably this
footage<00:01:13.369> is<00:01:13.520> not<00:01:13.580> good<00:01:13.940> enough<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.330> do<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:15.460> no

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.550 

I<00:01:29.240> thought<00:01:30.240> about<00:01:30.360> bringing<00:01:30.510> a<00:01:30.840> tripod<00:01:31.320> just

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
I thought about bringing a tripod just

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:55.289 
I thought about bringing a tripod just
setting<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.920> up<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.670> didn't<00:01:33.300> have<00:01:33.510> to<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:33.900> it

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.480 

we<00:01:56.299> open<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.750> grove<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.409> that<00:01:57.590> our<00:01:57.770> farmer<00:01:58.250> can

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
we open the grove so that our farmer can

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.209 
we open the grove so that our farmer can
harvest<00:01:58.729> shoots<00:01:59.299> he<00:02:00.200> weighs<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.649> shoots<00:02:00.920> and

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
harvest shoots he weighs the shoots and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.840 
harvest shoots he weighs the shoots and
counts<00:02:01.850> them<00:02:02.000> for<00:02:02.210> each<00:02:02.359> of<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.810> 28<00:02:03.229> plots

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
counts them for each of the 28 plots

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.350 
counts them for each of the 28 plots
this<00:02:04.850> varietal<00:02:05.479> data<00:02:05.810> allows<00:02:06.679> WSU<00:02:07.610> scientists

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
this varietal data allows WSU scientists

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.740 
this varietal data allows WSU scientists
to<00:02:08.869> compare<00:02:09.289> shoot<00:02:09.619> time<00:02:09.950> of<00:02:10.099> emergence

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
to compare shoot time of emergence

okay<00:02:50.409> yeah<00:02:51.040> that's<00:02:51.280> great<00:02:53.400> bamboo<00:02:54.400> has<00:02:54.579> many

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
okay yeah that's great bamboo has many
