00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.539
 friends, I'm going to present you a 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.180
 new recipe good if I tell you cake of 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:17.450
 apple you will say this uncle has already done us 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.360
 500 apple pies, yes, but this one 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.570
 it's different this is going to be 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:27.390
 good so I'll explain 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.099
 I'm going to make an apple pie but in 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.710
 place to make a cream underneath with 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.960
 a creampie holster or the cake more 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.239
 action the world that I presented today the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.829
 I'm going to make with sponge cake but also with 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.629
 a cake that I hope I get 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.160
 same milestone because I'm going to double-check 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.860
 Greek yogurt serving 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.989
 I'm going to make eggs with flour 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.270
 baking powder or the villages of 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.280
 bake you know in america sugar 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.670
 butter and then apples that should 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.199
 put over and at the end you 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.830
 surely I will put a capita 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.720
 apricot jam good these are 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.450
 the ingredients as you can see the 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.940
 point the mold liked both 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.119
 base as lateral with butter now 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.910
 when it is without the beyond of done what 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.759
 cover with apple slices 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.560
 and well then to bake you know that the 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.050
 oven 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.259
 always felt the fire up below 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.450
 and 180 degrees from then on I hope 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.360
 that I get a thing rich rich power the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.070
 first nail and I'm playing good 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.080
 that I'm going to eat it in two ways 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.130
 another thing is that now teach or we 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.560
 show the cake then 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.600
 at the end of the video you can see in the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.430
 quarry the ingredients as I do not want 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.289
 nuance martyred with the noise that 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.220
 makes the shake I'm going to beat it 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.880
 fast camera but I will explain to you that 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.869
 I'm going to do it 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.929
 Well, the eggs are already in the bowl 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.429
 then with the sugar already directly ge and 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.020
 when they have it well beaten well 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.299
 I'm going to add the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.360
 butter the yogurt and finally the 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.670
 flour with it with yeast is worth 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.830
 once it is well beaten I put it in 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.070
 the mold and from there we will return 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.070
 to talk 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.960
 the preparation of the atlantean pie 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.020
 sponge cake is already prepared is ready 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.310
 the few in the mold and now I'm going to 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:41.160
 cut the apples 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:45.420
 to put the skewers well placed 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.420
 and distribute well 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.600
 to rest while I cut the apple 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.940
 it goes something be the minute hand I already have 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.110
 here the peeled apples cut them in 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:01.010
 rooms and from here on are girls 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.650
 fine if we start them very fat because they do not 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.360
 will be done if the fine faults because I 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.930
 I think so that is more than enough 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.930
 with what I'm doing 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.700
 but two apples to see with what I 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.430
 arrives 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.650
 because the same comedian is worth but in case 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.380
 perhaps not to have to go now put 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.870
 do 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.870
 weird things because I have everything here 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.990
 manzanita and carrick I've even been 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.990
 happened that I'm going to take a little 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.070
 sugar is for I'm going to give it over 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.900
 in the oven I think it's going to 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.140
 turning into candy is an experiment 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.700
 I'm going to do 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.700
 and I hope it works well 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.890
 wrong 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.330
 I'll start putting 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:58.800
 and then we'll see what I'm missing or not 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.610
 to see if you can see me the camera the 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.610
 camera has what it has 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.040
 I'm going to open the plane 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.980
 and I'm going to go down like that so you can see 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.130
 the cake and how they are going goes 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.739
 always covering 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.210
 on the flat side let's say the part of 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.550
 apple interior 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.650
 Well, this is simply and point 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.100
 it's like this talk about the whole door then 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.070
 we can have a little 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.510
 and I think not because you make a 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.510
 idea and there's no need to explain the most 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.419
 baked 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.310
 to wait for it to be done by putting a 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.840
 good button I'll take you as I said 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.740
 before 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.470
 colored sugars 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.320
 and the foundation of this 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.470
 this sugar supposedly has to 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.310
 do 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.740
 candy no liquid candy like 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.600
 you know in the plans but you have 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.150
 to get to caramelize the apple 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.360
 because the apple is going to drop a little 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.730
 liquid and I hope the effect that I 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.630
 do it's like it's a little bit of 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:20.300
 candy will stay more golden I guess 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:22.220
 and well - well, this is all the 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.180
 preparation from here I put it to 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.070
 oven and when baked 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.780
 according to salgado I will decide if I put it 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.190
 jam or not because imagine that 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.720
 they come out very pretty so we 're going to 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.720
 spoil 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.730
 then we will discover the secret of the 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.410
 caramelized apple pie 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.410
 to see if it goes out as the cook wants
