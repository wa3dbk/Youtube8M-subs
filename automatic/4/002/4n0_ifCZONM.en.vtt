00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
inside the fuselage ok the next step is

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.819 
inside the fuselage ok the next step is
to<00:02:38.269> map<00:02:38.480> out<00:02:38.720> where<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.170> plan<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.410> make<00:02:39.650> your

here I found that the best place to make
the<00:02:44.840> cut<00:02:45.049> was<00:02:45.470> right<00:02:45.709> in<00:02:45.829> front<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.310> intake

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
the cut was right in front of the intake

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.550 
the cut was right in front of the intake
on<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.060> bottom<00:02:47.329> of<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.480> airplane<00:02:47.870> I'm

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
on the bottom of the airplane I'm

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.800 
on the bottom of the airplane I'm
marking<00:02:49.010> out<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.340> 2<00:02:49.610> inch<00:02:49.850> by<00:02:49.940> 2<00:02:50.120> inch<00:02:50.299> square

great<00:04:01.300> time<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.780> make<00:04:01.810> that<00:04:02.170> connection<00:04:02.440> on

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
great time to make that connection on

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.980 
great time to make that connection on
the<00:04:03.250> right<00:04:03.430> hand<00:04:03.640> side<00:04:03.880> you<00:04:04.360> will<00:04:04.390> also<00:04:04.780> see

install a screen cover over the opening

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.949 
install a screen cover over the opening
I<00:04:13.690> traced<00:04:13.990> around<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.440> opening<00:04:14.830> with<00:04:15.280> CA

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.039 

and<00:04:18.729> then<00:04:19.729> I<00:04:19.759> applied<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.209> screen<00:04:20.630> covering

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
and then I applied the screen covering

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.379 
and then I applied the screen covering
over<00:04:21.199> the<00:04:21.440> opening<00:04:24.759> after<00:04:25.759> masking<00:04:26.150> off<00:04:26.240> the

over the opening after masking off the

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.420 
over the opening after masking off the
area<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:26.810> then<00:04:27.169> applied<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.500> very<00:04:27.919> light<00:04:28.130> coat<00:04:28.370> of

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
area I then applied a very light coat of

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:45.340 
area I then applied a very light coat of
metallic<00:04:29.060> silver<00:04:29.360> paint

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.890 

this<00:04:46.250> project<00:04:46.730> requires<00:04:47.090> a<00:04:47.240> lot<00:04:47.630> of<00:04:47.660> wire

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
this project requires a lot of wire

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.630 
this project requires a lot of wire
management<00:04:48.170> and<00:04:48.590> I'm<00:04:48.830> afraid<00:04:49.070> this<00:04:49.280> is<00:04:49.460> not<00:04:49.490> a

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
management and I'm afraid this is not a

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.430 
management and I'm afraid this is not a
pretty<00:04:49.970> picture<00:04:50.330> but<00:04:50.510> make<00:04:51.050> sure<00:04:51.260> in<00:04:51.410> your

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
pretty picture but make sure in your

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.470 
pretty picture but make sure in your
final<00:04:51.890> installation<00:04:52.160> that<00:04:52.790> you<00:04:52.850> route<00:04:53.150> all<00:04:53.360> of

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
final installation that you route all of

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.270 
final installation that you route all of
your<00:04:53.600> server<00:04:53.840> wires<00:04:54.140> away<00:04:54.380> from<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:54.950> unit

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
your server wires away from the unit

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.430 
your server wires away from the unit
which<00:04:55.610> can<00:04:55.880> make<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.090> lot<00:04:56.330> of<00:04:56.450> heat<00:04:56.630> and<00:04:56.810> could

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
which can make a lot of heat and could
