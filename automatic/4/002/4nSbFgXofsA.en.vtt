00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
like this one behind us on let's say an

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.540 
like this one behind us on let's say an
18<00:01:27.430> hole<00:01:27.730> par<00:01:28.300> 72<00:01:28.810> championship<00:01:29.680> course<00:01:29.980> how

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
18 hole par 72 championship course how

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.130 
18 hole par 72 championship course how
much<00:01:30.790> land<00:01:31.030> are<00:01:31.210> we<00:01:31.270> talking<00:01:31.630> about<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.960> build

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
much land are we talking about to build

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.230 
much land are we talking about to build
a<00:01:32.229> course<00:01:32.470> like<00:01:32.650> that<00:01:32.710> that<00:01:33.370> type<00:01:33.670> of<00:01:33.700> golf

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
a course like that that type of golf

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.460 
a course like that that type of golf
course<00:01:34.479> takes<00:01:35.229> 150<00:01:36.040> to<00:01:36.370> 185<00:01:37.180> acres<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.930> that's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
course takes 150 to 185 acres and that's

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.180 
course takes 150 to 185 acres and that's
because<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.159> men<00:01:39.550> pros<00:01:39.909> hit<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.330> ball<00:01:40.479> so<00:01:40.870> far

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
because the men pros hit the ball so far

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.649 
because the men pros hit the ball so far
so<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:43.210> is<00:01:43.510> about<00:01:44.140> 60<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:44.920> 75<00:01:45.460> hectares<00:01:45.940> okay

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
so that is about 60 to 75 hectares okay

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:47.969 
so that is about 60 to 75 hectares okay
and<00:01:46.840> what<00:01:46.960> if<00:01:47.080> a<00:01:47.170> group<00:01:47.350> doesn't<00:01:47.650> have<00:01:47.740> quite

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
and what if a group doesn't have quite

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.100 
and what if a group doesn't have quite
that<00:01:48.130> much<00:01:48.549> land<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.210> they<00:01:49.570> want<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:49.780> build<00:01:49.870> a

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
that much land and they want to build a

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.719 
that much land and they want to build a
slightly<00:01:50.440> shorter<00:01:50.590> course<00:01:51.280> or<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.520> slightly

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
slightly shorter course or a slightly

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.160 
slightly shorter course or a slightly
smaller<00:01:52.090> course<00:01:52.450> are<00:01:52.600> there<00:01:52.690> options<00:01:53.020> for

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
smaller course are there options for

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.440 
smaller course are there options for
them<00:01:53.290> as<00:01:53.440> well<00:01:53.590> certainly<00:01:54.150> nine<00:01:55.150> holes

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
them as well certainly nine holes

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.370 
them as well certainly nine holes
instead<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:56.020> 18<00:01:56.409> also<00:01:57.360> most<00:01:58.360> golfers<00:01:59.170> don't

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
instead of 18 also most golfers don't

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.950 
instead of 18 also most golfers don't
need<00:01:59.650> such<00:01:59.950> a<00:01:59.979> big<00:02:00.250> golf<00:02:00.520> course<00:02:00.790> so<00:02:01.060> about<00:02:01.630> ten

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
need such a big golf course so about ten

need such a big golf course so about ten

by<00:02:06.060> fitting<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.270> golf<00:02:07.450> course<00:02:07.690> exactly<00:02:08.110> to

by fitting the golf course exactly to

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.679 
by fitting the golf course exactly to
the<00:02:08.649> average<00:02:09.009> golfer<00:02:09.280> okay<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.359> what<00:02:10.509> about

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:10.689 
the average golfer okay and what about

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.750 
the average golfer okay and what about
if<00:02:10.959> a<00:02:11.200> group<00:02:11.349> has<00:02:11.409> even<00:02:11.829> less<00:02:12.069> land<00:02:12.370> than<00:02:12.579> that

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
if a group has even less land than that

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.519 
if a group has even less land than that
and<00:02:12.909> they<00:02:12.969> want<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.209> develop<00:02:13.420> say<00:02:14.409> an

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:14.529 
and they want to develop say an

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:15.270

how<00:02:15.819> much<00:02:16.000> land<00:02:16.180> are<00:02:16.300> we<00:02:16.360> talking<00:02:16.660> about<00:02:16.690> for

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
how much land are we talking about for

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.780 
how much land are we talking about for
that<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.319> think<00:02:17.620> second<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.010> golf<00:02:18.220> course<00:02:18.520> is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that I think second a golf course is

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.390 
that I think second a golf course is
mostly<00:02:19.180> par<00:02:19.510> threes<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.170> some<00:02:20.740> short<00:02:21.069> par

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
mostly par threes and some short par

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.970 
mostly par threes and some short par
fours<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.770> takes<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.850> little<00:02:25.950> over<00:02:26.950> a

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
fours and so that takes a little over a

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.650 
fours and so that takes a little over a
hundred<00:02:27.250> acres<00:02:27.760> are<00:02:27.910> about<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.180> hundred<00:02:28.360> acres

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
hundred acres are about a hundred acres

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.059 
hundred acres are about a hundred acres
which<00:02:29.170> is<00:02:29.200> 40<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.280> 45<00:02:30.730> hectares<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:32.069> that

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
which is 40 to 45 hectares and that

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.190 
which is 40 to 45 hectares and that
works<00:02:33.400> out<00:02:33.580> good<00:02:33.819> in<00:02:34.030> some<00:02:34.239> situations<00:02:34.870> okay

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
works out good in some situations okay

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.720 
works out good in some situations okay
and<00:02:35.530> what<00:02:35.620> about<00:02:35.800> even<00:02:36.100> less<00:02:36.310> land<00:02:36.580> on<00:02:36.700> that

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
and what about even less land on that

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.850 
and what about even less land on that
for<00:02:37.120> example<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.660> pitch<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.080> putt<00:02:38.230> layout<00:02:38.620> what

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
for example a pitch and putt layout what

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.890 
for example a pitch and putt layout what
are<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.040> options<00:02:39.400> for<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:39.700> yes<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.330> pitch<00:02:40.750> and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
are the options for that yes a pitch and

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.140 
are the options for that yes a pitch and
putt<00:02:41.080> or<00:02:41.410> par<00:02:41.920> 3<00:02:42.190> golf<00:02:42.220> course<00:02:42.670> takes<00:02:42.970> even

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
putt or par 3 golf course takes even

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.979 
putt or par 3 golf course takes even
less<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.870> for<00:02:44.590> nine<00:02:45.040> holes<00:02:45.459> holes<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:46.810> are<00:02:46.870> a

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
less and for nine holes holes that are a

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.300 
less and for nine holes holes that are a
hundred<00:02:47.440> yards<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.040> 90<00:02:48.940> meters<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:50.380> takes<00:02:50.709> 15

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
hundred yards to 90 meters that takes 15

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.720 
hundred yards to 90 meters that takes 15
to<00:02:51.700> 20<00:02:52.120> acres<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:53.140> which<00:02:53.739> is<00:02:53.920> six<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.430> eight

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
to 20 acres and which is six to eight

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.660 
to 20 acres and which is six to eight
hector's<00:02:55.420> but<00:02:55.930> again<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.739> length<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.519> the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
hector's but again the length of the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
hector's but again the length of the
holes<00:02:58.470> determines<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.850> how<00:03:00.850> much<00:03:01.030> land<00:03:01.360> it'll

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
holes determines and how much land it'll

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.100 
holes determines and how much land it'll
take<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:02.410> if<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:03.069> group<00:03:03.459> wants<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:04.360> par

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
take and so if a group wants the par

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.990 
take and so if a group wants the par
three<00:03:05.350> holes<00:03:05.590> like<00:03:05.920> on<00:03:06.130> a<00:03:06.160> championship<00:03:06.790> golf

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000
