00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.069
 O 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.540
 and then hit you guys 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.190
 Let's follow our lead. 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.700
 series on sinking 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.600
 Let's talk today about pump rain. 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.600
 bomb 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.710
 Only now they're coming back here talking. 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.140
 here continuing our series 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.730
 under rain let's talk a little bit 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.980
 I'm also basic today, I'll always say 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.649
 indicated is then 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.640
 people are going to talk about the call the model 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.329
 good 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.100
 Okay you can see that there are two is two 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.179
 called bombs explode from which they are 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.980
 identical 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:56.280
 the only difference is that there is a 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.260
 rod and this one does not then it is okay 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.339
 Of course I think it has some function 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.339
 let's go guys 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.090
 she is basically her 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.030
 is basically made by a pitch 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.130
 more accurate ok she ends up going a little bit 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.150
 a little more the thing further than 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.060
 This is the way the fred 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.850
 have to send far is ok then 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.310
 This one thinks that's what you can do. 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.280
 go further than you think it 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.410
 can 10 can make a flight more 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.780
 You must think that just giving a 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.720
 balance is something like this 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.270
 Here she goes there cool but she does not have is 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.000
 this one to give this balance and 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.070
 get more straight there in the distance 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.350
 this is something else 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.990
 always has its advantages in its 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.780
 disadvantage and an advantage formed 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.020
 a disadvantage that would be 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.300
 if you take a beach the zebu or near 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.250
 centers for example is this sinker 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.980
 with excellent fishing near stone 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.050
 It's jazz here, although it's good too. 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.750
 but it is not so good anymore because at the moment 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.720
 which you gather by stone in the middle of 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.220
 way she ends up hooking here 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.860
 on some stone 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.099
 Okay, this is not what she does here. 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.030
 will go over the stones of 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.180
 quietly already then this is a 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.460
 another point would already be a negative point 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.170
 seems a plus point france 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.730
 Contrary to what we said now there 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.340
 little about ii 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.659
 at the time of the pitch this one would be 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.599
 better than it is 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.319
 without the rod ok and kind so sums up 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.080
 quickly 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.670
 is the so-called bomb is the model that the most 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.040
 recommended for beach fishing 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.230
 all the models that exist are the most 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.299
 recommended for beach and go fishing 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.580
 say to days like kill calcutta 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.099
 When they count, it's calm. 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.140
 so people are to hit you have to 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.879
 Look for you have to buy is the 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.700
 sink pump 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.129
 Ok, and we 'll talk about the great 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.680
 several others that would send model 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.870
 better not have dozens of models 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.120
 He'll call them all a 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.640
 a little to put which would be better 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.030
 fishery and in a little bit of each 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.879
 Yeah but today you're talking about the bomb's coming. 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.940
 very fast basic always basic no 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.489
 so coming too deep is for 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.220
 you understand a little bit of each 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.260
 Call was not that there. 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.180
 about the so-called bomb and then if you 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.980
 were fishing on the beach could give 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.980
 priority will be first pump bomb 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.530
 place because she flies very well, right? 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.639
 is a series of aerodynamics is excellent 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.209
 especially this one with chi 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.480
 second place 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.730
 She does not have to drag her. 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.010
 grabs in the arena hours you gather 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.500
 she's with an account she comes quiet 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.139
 I have not been entering the sea â€‹â€‹and grabbing and 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.980
 now weighing new comes quiet 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:57.780
 and that's okay guys several advantages is 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.980
 The best really the best chance for the 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.849
 beach fishing 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.739
