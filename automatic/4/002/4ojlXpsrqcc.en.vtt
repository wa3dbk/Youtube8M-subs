00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
on this body put some pins in there this

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.690 
on this body put some pins in there this
extra<00:01:53.410> armor<00:01:53.770> piece<00:01:54.010> on<00:01:54.280> top

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.399 

and<00:01:58.150> we<00:01:58.240> start<00:01:58.540> working<00:01:58.750> on<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.170> shoulder

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
and we start working on the shoulder

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.359 
and we start working on the shoulder
pieces<00:02:01.020> make<00:02:02.020> one<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:02.439> looks<00:02:02.619> like<00:02:02.799> this<00:02:03.070> and

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
pieces make one that looks like this and

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.899 
pieces make one that looks like this and
the<00:02:04.240> mirror<00:02:04.509> image<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.930> it<00:02:05.399> stick<00:02:06.399> them<00:02:06.610> on<00:02:06.759> the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
the mirror image of it stick them on the

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.540 
the mirror image of it stick them on the
arm<00:02:07.090> sockets<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:08.349> now<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.679> put<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.160> legs<00:02:09.340> on

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
arm sockets and now you put the legs on

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.130 
arm sockets and now you put the legs on
here<00:02:11.430> stand<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.640> up<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.180> connect<00:02:14.110> two<00:02:14.410> bodies

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
here stand it up and connect two bodies

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.160 
here stand it up and connect two bodies
after<00:02:17.140> putting<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:17.860> these<00:02:18.900> shoulder<00:02:19.900> spikes

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
after putting in these shoulder spikes

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:29.970 
after putting in these shoulder spikes
into<00:02:20.770> those<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:22.030> are<00:02:22.239> done<00:02:28.980> transform

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
into those you are done transform

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.130 
into those you are done transform
strider<00:02:30.459> first<00:02:31.360> you're<00:02:31.540> going<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.720> take<00:02:31.840> out

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
strider first you're going to take out

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.160 
strider first you're going to take out
these<00:02:32.410> shoulder<00:02:32.980> parts<00:02:33.900> move<00:02:34.900> those<00:02:35.110> around

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
these shoulder parts move those around

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.200 
these shoulder parts move those around
and<00:02:37.620> transform<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.430> head<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:38.910> looks<00:02:39.120> like

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
and transform the head so it looks like

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.020 
and transform the head so it looks like
this<00:02:39.680> then<00:02:40.680> put<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.250> whole<00:02:41.280> thing<00:02:41.459> on<00:02:41.790> its

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
this then put the whole thing on its

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.680 
this then put the whole thing on its
stomach<00:02:43.670> next<00:02:44.670> you're<00:02:44.790> gonna<00:02:44.880> put<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.420> sword

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
stomach next you're gonna put the sword

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.030 
stomach next you're gonna put the sword
parts<00:02:46.250> into<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.370> back<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:48.030> shown<00:02:48.860> make<00:02:49.860> sure

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
parts into the back and shown make sure

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.010 
parts into the back and shown make sure
these<00:02:50.250> yellow<00:02:50.610> pieces<00:02:50.880> are<00:02:51.240> between<00:02:51.720> the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
these yellow pieces are between the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.330 
these yellow pieces are between the
swords<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.709> arms<00:02:54.890> it'd<00:02:55.890> be<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> little

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
swords and the arms it'd be a little

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.250 
swords and the arms it'd be a little
tricky<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:56.760> I'm<00:02:57.510> sure<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:57.959> figure<00:02:58.110> it

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
tricky but I'm sure you can figure it

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.180 
tricky but I'm sure you can figure it
out<00:02:58.430> after<00:02:59.430> closing<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.240> up<00:03:00.740> I'm<00:03:01.740> gonna<00:03:01.950> want

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
out after closing it up I'm gonna want

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.920 
out after closing it up I'm gonna want
to<00:03:02.340> fold<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.700> feet<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.090> like<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:05.690> pull<00:03:06.690> the
