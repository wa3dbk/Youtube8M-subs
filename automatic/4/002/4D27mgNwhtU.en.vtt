beat<00:01:52.619> us<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:53.520> lost<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.299> know<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.740> kind<00:01:55.770> of

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
beat us we lost you know and it kind of

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.249 
beat us we lost you know and it kind of
sounds<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.610> clearly<00:01:57.420> obama<00:01:57.840> won<00:01:58.110> in

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
sounds like that clearly obama won in

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.499 
sounds like that clearly obama won in
places<00:01:58.590> no<00:01:58.619> one<00:01:58.829> ever<00:01:59.100> thought<00:01:59.310> he<00:01:59.430> could<00:01:59.640> and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
places no one ever thought he could and

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.480 
places no one ever thought he could and
i<00:02:00.600> think<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.049> large<00:02:01.290> part<00:02:01.710> because<00:02:02.250> he

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
i think in large part because he

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.480 
i think in large part because he
connected<00:02:03.530> America<00:02:04.530> with<00:02:04.649> an<00:02:04.740> idea<00:02:05.159> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
connected America with an idea that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.010 
connected America with an idea that
things<00:02:05.880> will<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.210> different<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.810> think

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
things will be different and I think

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.830 
things will be different and I think
that<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.680> was<00:02:08.160> interesting<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.390> me<00:02:09.509> at<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
that what was interesting to me at the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.490 
that what was interesting to me at the

collapse of the economy Sarah Palin did

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.920 
collapse of the economy Sarah Palin did
not<00:03:55.040> caused<00:03:55.430> this<00:03:55.700> defeat<00:03:56.120> well<00:03:56.419> it<00:03:56.629> was<00:03:56.780> the

being<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.180> mathematician<00:04:11.900> d<00:04:12.019> I<00:04:12.049> can<00:04:12.349> tell<00:04:12.530> you

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
being a mathematician d I can tell you

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.080 
being a mathematician d I can tell you
you<00:04:12.739> can<00:04:12.889> make<00:04:13.040> these<00:04:13.219> things<00:04:13.489> read<00:04:13.699> any<00:04:13.879> which

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
you can make these things read any which

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.990 
you can make these things read any which
way<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.359> like<00:04:14.659> the<00:04:15.319> question<00:04:15.889> was<00:04:16.400> did<00:04:16.970> you

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
way you like the question was did you

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.879 
way you like the question was did you
like<00:04:17.269> Sarah<00:04:17.539> Palin<00:04:17.750> if<00:04:18.349> you<00:04:18.470> want<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.769> know

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
like Sarah Palin if you want to know

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.740 
like Sarah Palin if you want to know
whether<00:04:19.099> they<00:04:19.340> voted<00:04:19.820> because<00:04:20.239> of<00:04:20.449> Sarah

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
whether they voted because of Sarah

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.719 
whether they voted because of Sarah
Palin<00:04:20.930> that's<00:04:21.500> a<00:04:21.650> whole<00:04:21.889> different<00:04:22.130> question

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
Palin that's a whole different question

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.839 
Palin that's a whole different question
the<00:04:23.150> key<00:04:23.360> here<00:04:23.389> is<00:04:23.870> all<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.560> momentum<00:04:24.979> went<00:04:25.639> to

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
the key here is all the momentum went to

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.760 
the key here is all the momentum went to
Obama<00:04:26.180> because<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.199> people<00:04:27.560> in<00:04:27.650> this

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
Obama because the people in this

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.550 
Obama because the people in this
country's<00:04:28.250> had<00:04:28.460> hell<00:04:28.820> with<00:04:29.449> Republicans<00:04:30.199> I'm

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
country's had hell with Republicans I'm

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.620 
country's had hell with Republicans I'm
not<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.830> mathematician<00:04:31.099> but<00:04:31.699> I<00:04:31.759> can't<00:04:32.060> say<00:04:32.360> that

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
not a mathematician but I can't say that

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.080 
not a mathematician but I can't say that
I<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.409> he<00:04:33.699> gave<00:04:34.699> you<00:04:34.880> for<00:04:35.090> he<00:04:35.240> want<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:37.090> don't

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
I and he gave you for he want I don't

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.810 
I and he gave you for he want I don't
know<00:04:38.150> why<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:39.289> I<00:04:39.349> think<00:04:39.770> that<00:04:39.889> we<00:04:40.009> can<00:04:40.159> we<00:04:40.610> can

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
know why and I think that we can we can

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.879 
know why and I think that we can we can
we<00:04:41.000> can<00:04:41.240> pick<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.780> reason<00:04:42.080> why<00:04:42.229> but<00:04:42.860> I

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
we can pick the reason why but I

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.800 
we can pick the reason why but I
actually<00:04:43.370> do<00:04:43.669> think<00:04:43.699> that<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.240> Republicans

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
actually do think that the Republicans

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.390 
actually do think that the Republicans
looking<00:04:45.289> at<00:04:45.409> the<00:04:45.500> world<00:04:45.680> they<00:04:45.889> do<00:04:45.949> the<00:04:46.280> way

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
looking at the world they do the way

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.339 
looking at the world they do the way
they<00:04:46.520> do<00:04:46.580> and<00:04:46.849> not<00:04:47.270> being<00:04:47.570> a<00:04:47.810> willing<00:04:48.229> to

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
they do and not being a willing to

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:49.899 
they do and not being a willing to
change<00:04:48.590> is<00:04:48.919> going<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.400> keep<00:04:49.550> them<00:04:49.729> in<00:04:49.849> a

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 
change is going to keep them in a

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:51.520 
change is going to keep them in a
position<00:04:50.030> where<00:04:50.360> they<00:04:50.659> explaining<00:04:51.080> how<00:04:51.349> they

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
position where they explaining how they

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.520 
position where they explaining how they
lost<00:04:51.770> and<00:04:52.340> that<00:04:52.460> release<00:04:52.759> ya<00:04:53.270> know<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:54.289> key

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
lost and that release ya know the key

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.790 
lost and that release ya know the key
though<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:55.490> key<00:04:55.729> to<00:04:56.020> defeat<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.349> first<00:04:57.590> thing

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
though the key to defeat the first thing

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.710 
though the key to defeat the first thing
whether<00:04:58.070> it<00:04:58.250> is<00:04:58.370> sports<00:04:58.820> or<00:04:59.060> politics<00:04:59.539> or

whether it is sports or politics or
anything<00:05:00.020> else<00:05:00.199> is<00:05:00.409> to<00:05:00.770> analyze<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.520> defeat

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
anything else is to analyze the defeat

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.240 
anything else is to analyze the defeat
and<00:05:01.970> understand<00:05:02.509> what<00:05:02.780> happened<00:05:03.409> so<00:05:03.949> that<00:05:04.099> you

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
and understand what happened so that you

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.290 
and understand what happened so that you
can<00:05:04.430> then<00:05:04.810> revisit<00:05:05.810> your<00:05:06.710> own<00:05:07.060> strategy<00:05:08.060> and

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
can then revisit your own strategy and

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.659 
can then revisit your own strategy and
determine<00:05:09.229> maybe<00:05:09.770> there<00:05:10.039> should<00:05:10.310> be<00:05:10.430> some

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
determine maybe there should be some

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.629 
determine maybe there should be some
changes<00:05:11.120> I<00:05:11.509> agree<00:05:12.199> with<00:05:12.229> that<00:05:12.469> and<00:05:12.919> then<00:05:13.460> we

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
changes I agree with that and then we

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.480 
changes I agree with that and then we
have<00:05:13.909> to<00:05:14.090> have<00:05:14.659> the<00:05:14.900> loyal<00:05:15.169> opposition<00:05:15.490> ready

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
have to have the loyal opposition ready

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.200 
have to have the loyal opposition ready
to<00:05:16.909> take<00:05:17.150> charge<00:05:17.930> so<00:05:18.560> when<00:05:18.830> Barack<00:05:19.190> Obama<00:05:19.550> does

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
to take charge so when Barack Obama does

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.550 
to take charge so when Barack Obama does
come<00:05:20.419> up<00:05:20.539> with<00:05:20.659> a<00:05:20.690> policy<00:05:21.080> with<00:05:21.229> which<00:05:21.380> we

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
come up with a policy with which we

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.430 
come up with a policy with which we
agree<00:05:21.919> we<00:05:22.460> embrace<00:05:22.820> it<00:05:23.090> cut<00:05:23.449> taxes<00:05:24.020> were<00:05:24.199> there

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
agree we embrace it cut taxes were there

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.040 
agree we embrace it cut taxes were there
but<00:05:24.830> if<00:05:24.919> he<00:05:25.009> says<00:05:25.280> raise<00:05:25.820> taxes<00:05:26.360> loyal

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
but if he says raise taxes loyal

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.749 
but if he says raise taxes loyal
opposition<00:05:27.259> ready<00:05:27.919> to<00:05:28.130> send<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.490> message

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
opposition ready to send the message

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.120 
opposition ready to send the message
American<00:05:29.210> people<00:05:29.479> we<00:05:29.870> oppose<00:05:30.289> they<00:05:30.710> ok<00:05:30.949> well

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
American people we oppose they ok well

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.490 
American people we oppose they ok well
and<00:05:31.400> that<00:05:31.550> redefines<00:05:32.270> republican<00:05:32.990> party<00:05:33.380> and

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
and that redefines republican party and

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.709 
and that redefines republican party and
that's<00:05:34.039> the<00:05:34.190> beginning<00:05:34.340> of<00:05:34.610> us<00:05:35.270> moving

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:35.719 
that's the beginning of us moving

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.300 
that's the beginning of us moving
forward<00:05:35.750> again<00:05:36.169> well<00:05:36.590> I<00:05:36.650> hope<00:05:36.770> it<00:05:36.949> takes<00:05:37.099> eight

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
forward again well I hope it takes eight

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.350 
forward again well I hope it takes eight
years<00:05:37.550> to<00:05:37.669> figure<00:05:37.820> it<00:05:38.000> out

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360
