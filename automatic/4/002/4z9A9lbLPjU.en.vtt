00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.750 

so<00:02:25.940> now<00:02:26.350> most<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.680> waste<00:02:27.890> is<00:02:28.190> taken<00:02:28.370> out<00:02:28.730> of

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
so now most of the waste is taken out of

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.730 
so now most of the waste is taken out of
there<00:02:29.030> now<00:02:29.870> we're<00:02:30.050> done<00:02:30.170> with<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.470> drill

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
there now we're done with the drill

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.190 
there now we're done with the drill
press<00:02:30.920> we're<00:02:31.760> ready<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.120> route<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.870> rest<00:02:33.050> of

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
press we're ready to route the rest of

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.270 
press we're ready to route the rest of
the<00:02:33.290> waste<00:02:33.530> out<00:02:33.800> of<00:02:33.830> it

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
the waste out of it

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.300 
the waste out of it
add<00:02:35.090> an<00:02:35.300> extension<00:02:35.600> base<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.230> your<00:02:36.350> router<00:02:36.620> so

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
add an extension base to your router so

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.950 
add an extension base to your router so
the<00:02:37.400> base<00:02:37.580> can<00:02:37.820> completely<00:02:38.210> span<00:02:38.660> the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
the base can completely span the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:52.580 
the base can completely span the
recesses<00:02:39.410> in<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:40.070> bowl<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.460> tray<00:02:40.670> templates

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.160 

now<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.610> want<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.970> stop<00:02:54.209> here<00:02:54.510> just<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:54.930> can

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
now I want to stop here just so I can

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.570 
now I want to stop here just so I can
show<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.709> make<00:02:55.830> sure<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.099> understand

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
show you and make sure you understand

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.910 
show you and make sure you understand
how<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:56.940> whole<00:02:57.120> system<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.569> working<00:02:58.020> on<00:03:00.920> that

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
how this whole system is working on that

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.760 
how this whole system is working on that
first<00:03:02.250> pass<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:03.540> ball<00:03:03.780> bearing<00:03:04.260> traced<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
first pass the ball bearing traced the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.800 
first pass the ball bearing traced the
pattern<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:05.790> there's<00:03:05.970> just<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.239> little<00:03:06.599> bit<00:03:06.720> of

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
pattern so there's just a little bit of

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.500 
pattern so there's just a little bit of
a<00:03:06.900> cut<00:03:07.140> right<00:03:07.830> here<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.849> bit<00:03:09.030> started<00:03:09.450> to

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
a cut right here that the bit started to

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.690 
a cut right here that the bit started to
penetrate<00:03:10.019> down<00:03:10.230> into<00:03:10.290> my<00:03:10.739> bowl<00:03:10.950> blank<00:03:11.130> itself

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
penetrate down into my bowl blank itself

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.509 
penetrate down into my bowl blank itself
so<00:03:12.330> we've<00:03:12.480> traced<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.959> pattern<00:03:13.349> there<00:03:13.590> on<00:03:14.250> my

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
so we've traced the pattern there on my

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.190 
so we've traced the pattern there on my
next<00:03:14.819> pass<00:03:15.030> I'm<00:03:15.390> gonna<00:03:15.540> lower<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.019> bid<00:03:16.170> a

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
next pass I'm gonna lower the bid a

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.470 
next pass I'm gonna lower the bid a
little<00:03:16.319> bit<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:17.370> bearing<00:03:17.849> is<00:03:17.970> going<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.209> start

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
little bit the bearing is going to start

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.809 
little bit the bearing is going to start
to<00:03:18.630> ride<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.110> very<00:03:19.290> top<00:03:19.620> of<00:03:19.650> my<00:03:19.950> ball<00:03:20.190> I'll

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
to ride on the very top of my ball I'll

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.400 
to ride on the very top of my ball I'll
just<00:03:21.000> keep<00:03:21.150> going<00:03:21.330> down<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:21.959> down<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.170> down

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
just keep going down and down and down

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.410 
just keep going down and down and down
let's<00:03:23.160> keep<00:03:23.310> going<00:03:23.640> with<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.940> one<00:03:24.150> we'll<00:03:24.300> get

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
let's keep going with this one we'll get

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:45.010 
let's keep going with this one we'll get
this<00:03:24.569> whole<00:03:24.780> section<00:03:25.350> excavated<00:03:25.890> out

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.900 

now<00:03:46.020> you<00:03:46.080> can<00:03:46.410> really<00:03:46.770> see<00:03:47.070> what's<00:03:47.430> happening

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
now you can really see what's happening

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.750 
now you can really see what's happening
here<00:03:48.350> I've<00:03:49.350> got<00:03:49.560> all<00:03:49.770> the<00:03:49.920> waste<00:03:50.130> out<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.580> there

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
here I've got all the waste out of there

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.960 
here I've got all the waste out of there
that<00:03:51.330> last<00:03:51.660> pass<00:03:52.080> I<00:03:52.530> swept<00:03:53.280> back<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:53.730> forth

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
that last pass I swept back and forth

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.090 
that last pass I swept back and forth
across<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.540> bottom<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:55.410> get<00:03:55.500> all<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.770> ridges

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
across the bottom to get all the ridges

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.830 
across the bottom to get all the ridges
out<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.520> high<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:56.850> low<00:03:56.940> spots<00:03:57.240> left<00:03:57.570> by<00:03:57.780> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
out the high and low spots left by the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.110 
out the high and low spots left by the
Forstner<00:03:58.260> bit<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:59.430> now<00:03:59.580> I'll<00:03:59.730> come<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.060> I'll

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
Forstner bit so now I'll come and I'll

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.610 
Forstner bit so now I'll come and I'll
do<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.420> middle<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.870> course<00:04:01.050> we<00:04:01.200> only<00:04:01.350> have<00:04:01.500> to

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
do the middle of course we only have to

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.220 
do the middle of course we only have to
do<00:04:01.740> that<00:04:01.920> once<00:04:02.220> then<00:04:02.940> move<00:04:03.240> the<00:04:03.390> pattern<00:04:03.600> to

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
do that once then move the pattern to

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.380 
do that once then move the pattern to
each<00:04:04.410> quadrant<00:04:04.800> and<00:04:05.280> just<00:04:05.760> keep<00:04:05.940> taking<00:04:06.300> the

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
each quadrant and just keep taking the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.480 
each quadrant and just keep taking the
waste<00:04:06.600> out<00:04:06.870> take<00:04:07.530> away<00:04:07.770> everything<00:04:08.070> it

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
waste out take away everything it

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.130 
waste out take away everything it
doesn't<00:04:08.760> look<00:04:08.850> like<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:09.060> ball<00:04:09.270> let's<00:04:09.990> keep

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
doesn't look like a ball let's keep

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:43.659 
doesn't look like a ball let's keep
going

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.480 

here<00:04:44.669> we<00:04:44.759> go<00:04:45.199> got<00:04:46.199> that<00:04:46.409> last<00:04:46.649> section<00:04:47.039> done

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
here we go got that last section done

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.449 
here we go got that last section done
we're<00:04:48.209> all<00:04:48.270> excavated<00:04:48.959> out<00:04:49.139> here<00:04:49.499> the<00:04:50.099> next

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:50.459 
we're all excavated out here the next

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:52.070 
we're all excavated out here the next
step<00:04:50.669> is<00:04:50.849> going<00:04:50.969> to<00:04:51.029> be<00:04:51.089> to<00:04:51.479> define<00:04:51.899> the

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
step is going to be to define the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.260 
step is going to be to define the
outside<00:04:52.499> shape<00:04:52.830> of<00:04:53.069> this<00:04:53.219> I'll<00:04:53.729> show<00:04:53.789> you<00:04:54.059> how

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
outside shape of this I'll show you how

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.019 
outside shape of this I'll show you how
to<00:04:54.300> do<00:04:54.509> that<00:04:54.689> on<00:04:55.110> this<00:04:55.289> one<00:04:55.349> I'm<00:04:55.919> simply<00:04:56.909> going

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:57.029 
to do that on this one I'm simply going

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:58.519 
to do that on this one I'm simply going
to<00:04:57.089> end<00:04:57.270> up<00:04:57.360> with<00:04:57.509> a<00:04:57.569> half<00:04:57.779> inch<00:04:57.990> wall<00:04:58.259> around

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:58.529 
to end up with a half inch wall around

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:00.379 
to end up with a half inch wall around
the<00:04:58.679> outside<00:04:59.099> so<00:04:59.699> this<00:04:59.819> is<00:04:59.999> really<00:05:00.270> very

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
the outside so this is really very

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.600 
the outside so this is really very
simple<00:05:00.809> put<00:05:01.529> the<00:05:01.649> point<00:05:01.949> of<00:05:02.099> the<00:05:02.189> compass<00:05:02.580> the

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
simple put the point of the compass the

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.519 
simple put the point of the compass the
pivot<00:05:03.059> point<00:05:03.300> on<00:05:03.509> the<00:05:03.599> inside<00:05:04.050> of<00:05:04.259> the<00:05:04.349> wall

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:04.529 
pivot point on the inside of the wall

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:07.399 
pivot point on the inside of the wall
and<00:05:04.860> then<00:05:05.819> just<00:05:06.029> trace<00:05:06.360> with<00:05:06.659> the<00:05:06.689> pencil<00:05:07.199> on

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
and then just trace with the pencil on

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.399 
and then just trace with the pencil on

about<00:06:51.650> ready<00:06:51.890> for<00:06:51.980> finish<00:06:52.520> let's<00:06:53.090> look<00:06:53.240> at

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
about ready for finish let's look at

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.570 
about ready for finish let's look at
some<00:06:53.480> other<00:06:53.570> projects<00:06:54.200> here<00:06:54.470> this<00:06:55.280> is<00:06:55.460> the

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
some other projects here this is the

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.360 
some other projects here this is the
other<00:06:55.610> template<00:06:56.360> that<00:06:56.800> comes<00:06:57.800> with<00:06:58.040> the<00:06:58.160> kit

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
other template that comes with the kit

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.330 
other template that comes with the kit
and<00:06:58.700> it's<00:06:59.660> used<00:06:59.900> to<00:07:00.050> make<00:07:00.200> a<00:07:00.230> big<00:07:00.470> oval<00:07:00.860> like

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
and it's used to make a big oval like

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.520 
and it's used to make a big oval like
this<00:07:01.550> one<00:07:01.760> so<00:07:02.240> at<00:07:02.390> this<00:07:02.570> template<00:07:03.050> you're

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
this one so at this template you're

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.190 
this one so at this template you're
going<00:07:03.650> to<00:07:03.710> use<00:07:03.860> it<00:07:04.010> like<00:07:04.190> this<00:07:04.520> and<00:07:05.150> then<00:07:06.080> to

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.200 
going to use it like this and then to

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.650 
going to use it like this and then to
get<00:07:06.350> that<00:07:06.530> angle<00:07:06.890> in<00:07:07.010> there<00:07:07.160> simply<00:07:07.580> pivot<00:07:08.540> the

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
get that angle in there simply pivot the

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.540 
get that angle in there simply pivot the
template<00:07:09.140> that's<00:07:09.800> going<00:07:10.010> to<00:07:10.070> provide<00:07:10.340> the

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
template that's going to provide the

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.850 
template that's going to provide the
other<00:07:10.700> side<00:07:11.090> so<00:07:11.870> this<00:07:12.080> one's<00:07:12.320> pretty<00:07:12.560> far

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 
other side so this one's pretty far

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.440 
other side so this one's pretty far
along<00:07:12.980> it's<00:07:13.370> ready<00:07:13.580> for<00:07:13.820> this<00:07:13.910> side<00:07:14.180> to<00:07:14.330> get

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.450 
along it's ready for this side to get

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.930 
along it's ready for this side to get
routed<00:07:14.960> then<00:07:15.380> sanding<00:07:16.040> cut<00:07:16.340> the<00:07:16.460> outside

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 
routed then sanding cut the outside

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.120 
routed then sanding cut the outside
shape<00:07:17.240> now<00:07:17.810> remember<00:07:18.170> earlier<00:07:18.200> I<00:07:18.560> was<00:07:18.800> telling

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.130 
shape now remember earlier I was telling

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.150 
shape now remember earlier I was telling
you<00:07:19.250> how<00:07:19.330> some<00:07:20.330> of<00:07:20.360> these<00:07:20.510> patterns<00:07:20.930> can<00:07:21.500> be

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 
you how some of these patterns can be

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.700 
you how some of these patterns can be
used<00:07:22.550> in<00:07:22.820> a<00:07:22.910> variety<00:07:23.060> of<00:07:23.420> different<00:07:23.660> ways<00:07:23.990> so

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.710 
used in a variety of different ways so

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.140 
used in a variety of different ways so
for<00:07:24.950> instance<00:07:25.280> let's<00:07:25.490> have<00:07:25.670> a<00:07:25.730> look<00:07:25.910> at<00:07:26.030> what

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.150 
for instance let's have a look at what

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.450 
for instance let's have a look at what
we've<00:07:26.240> got<00:07:26.270> here<00:07:26.810> of<00:07:27.320> course<00:07:27.590> in<00:07:27.830> this<00:07:27.950> case<00:07:28.010> I

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460 
we've got here of course in this case I

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.640 
we've got here of course in this case I
made<00:07:28.610> four<00:07:28.940> quadrants<00:07:29.660> in<00:07:29.780> this<00:07:29.930> bowl<00:07:30.200> by

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:30.650 
made four quadrants in this bowl by

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.250 
made four quadrants in this bowl by
using<00:07:30.830> the<00:07:31.070> pattern<00:07:31.430> four<00:07:31.820> times<00:07:32.150> another<00:07:33.080> way

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.260 
using the pattern four times another way

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.250 
using the pattern four times another way
to<00:07:33.320> use<00:07:33.530> this<00:07:33.740> same<00:07:34.010> pattern<00:07:35.020> would<00:07:36.020> be<00:07:36.140> to

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:36.260 
to use this same pattern would be to

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.340 
to use this same pattern would be to
only<00:07:36.410> use<00:07:36.650> it<00:07:36.830> once<00:07:37.630> that<00:07:38.630> gives<00:07:38.930> me<00:07:39.080> a<00:07:39.110> little

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:39.350 
only use it once that gives me a little

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.010 
only use it once that gives me a little
chip<00:07:39.890> and<00:07:40.070> dip<00:07:40.520> Cup<00:07:40.820> kind<00:07:41.360> of<00:07:41.420> a<00:07:41.540> single

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:42.020 
chip and dip Cup kind of a single

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.440 
chip and dip Cup kind of a single
serving<00:07:42.440> size<00:07:42.710> so<00:07:43.490> that's<00:07:43.880> another<00:07:44.210> way<00:07:44.420> that

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:44.450 
serving size so that's another way that

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.870 
serving size so that's another way that
you<00:07:44.660> could<00:07:44.870> use<00:07:44.930> this<00:07:45.350> we<00:07:45.980> can<00:07:46.160> also<00:07:46.310> take<00:07:46.670> this

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:46.880 
you could use this we can also take this

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.750 
you could use this we can also take this
same<00:07:47.150> pattern<00:07:47.420> and<00:07:47.720> use<00:07:47.840> it<00:07:48.020> here<00:07:48.470> and<00:07:48.760> here

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:49.760 
same pattern and use it here and here

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.420 
same pattern and use it here and here
with<00:07:50.270> my<00:07:50.450> two<00:07:50.510> chip<00:07:51.230> traits<00:07:51.560> being<00:07:51.830> 180

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:52.430

with my two chip traits being 180
degrees<00:07:52.880> apart<00:07:53.210> so<00:07:53.870> don't<00:07:54.620> just<00:07:54.800> get<00:07:54.980> married

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.160
