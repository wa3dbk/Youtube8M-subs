00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.699
 Cool color as I think 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.060
 you have this burst effect that is 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.500
 dark light from the outside inwards 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.200
 This also shows the beautiful 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.910
 grains that we get through 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.720
 completely birch boiler installed 75 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:22.229

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:30.929
 sizes as follows to our 18 bassdrum 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:32.940
 theme 8 12 9 and 16 times 16 fleet to the 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.950
 songs here are also the best 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.890
 that means you have buildings and buildings 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:44.099
 which of course drums the system 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:46.649
 conducive to system at the 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:47.940
 fleet this is nothing new from pearl 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.229
 but you should perhaps mention it 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.500
 because I had not mentioned yet 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.590
 you can see here the great feet the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.709
 well in and out of the ground 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.869
 characterized one has a fairly long ton 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.880
 maybe flirting too 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.619

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.209
 home promotion has and says okay that 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.610
 everything is a bit too short for me 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.090
 this is how insolvency comes to life does not sound 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.470
 more great 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.569
 maybe screw those things on 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.520
 or stick to that really matters 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.520
 some of such a small tip from me 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:25.140
