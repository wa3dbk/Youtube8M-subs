00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
but sometimes it takes something to kick

you<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.010> butt<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.670> go<00:00:35.850> try<00:00:36.120> something<00:00:36.420> new

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
for me if I wanted to go shoot lightning

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
for me if I wanted to go shoot lightning
what<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> normally<00:01:44.610> would<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.360> try<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.570> wait

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
what I normally would do is try to wait

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.940 
what I normally would do is try to wait
for<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.079> Lightning<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.470> go<00:01:46.560> off<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.829> then

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
for the Lightning to go off and then

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.230 
for the Lightning to go off and then
press<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> shutter<00:01:47.460> button<00:01:47.610> really<00:01:47.970> quick

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
press the shutter button really quick

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.030 
press the shutter button really quick
but<00:01:48.390> there's<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> lag<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.290> camera<00:01:49.710> no

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
but there's a lag in the camera no

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.410 
but there's a lag in the camera no
matter<00:01:50.220> which<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.240> may

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
matter which one you have that you may

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.330 
matter which one you have that you may
not<00:01:51.630> capture<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.290> time<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.040> what<00:01:53.189> this

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
not capture it in time but what this

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.300 
not capture it in time but what this
does<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.880> detects<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.540> light<00:01:55.130> before<00:01:56.130> you

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
does is it detects the light before you

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.730 
does is it detects the light before you
detect<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.329> triggers<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.899> camera<00:01:58.380> so

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
detect it and it triggers the camera so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.260 
detect it and it triggers the camera so
it<00:01:58.860> triggers<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> camera<00:01:59.640> off<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.880> goes<00:02:00.000> BAM

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
it triggers the camera off it goes BAM

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.999 
it triggers the camera off it goes BAM
and<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.810> capture<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.290> lightning<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.890> is

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
and you capture the lightning that is

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.920 
and you capture the lightning that is
just<00:02:02.189> one<00:02:02.340> option<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.000> had<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.570> like

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
just one option that it had but I like

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.020 
just one option that it had but I like
is<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:04.590> iOS<00:02:05.070> compatible<00:02:05.280> there's<00:02:05.939> an

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
is that it's iOS compatible there's an

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.600 
is that it's iOS compatible there's an
app<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.810> your<00:02:06.899> iOS<00:02:07.320> devices<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.950> also

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
app for it for your iOS devices and also

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.550 
app for it for your iOS devices and also
for<00:02:08.970> Android<00:02:09.539> which<00:02:09.899> means<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> be

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
for Android which means it's going to be

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.080 
for Android which means it's going to be
upgradeable<00:02:11.280> because<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> firmware<00:02:11.940> is

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
upgradeable because the firmware is

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.550 
upgradeable because the firmware is
going<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.270> get<00:02:12.390> upgraded<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.020> my<00:02:13.200> ops<00:02:13.379> and

the
firm<00:02:14.010> words<00:02:14.190> gonna<00:02:14.280> get<00:02:14.430> upgraded<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.120> app

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
firm words gonna get upgraded in the app

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.880 
firm words gonna get upgraded in the app
so<00:02:15.690> it's<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:15.960> gonna<00:02:16.170> become<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.620> better

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
product so that's just one thing it did

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.410 
product so that's just one thing it did
but<00:02:19.200> lasers<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.280> have<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.580> ability<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.210> have<00:02:21.390> a

but lasers to have the ability to have a
laser<00:02:21.750> track<00:02:22.140> do<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.560> could<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.890> imagine<00:02:23.010> if

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
laser track do you could you imagine if

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.650 
laser track do you could you imagine if
I<00:02:23.310> was<00:02:23.430> running<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.820> race<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.240> there<00:02:24.540> was<00:02:24.630> a

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
I was running a race and there was a

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.450 
I was running a race and there was a
laser<00:02:24.900> going<00:02:25.260> across<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.650> finish<00:02:25.830> line<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.370> I

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
laser going across the finish line and I

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.810 
laser going across the finish line and I
was<00:02:26.580> like<00:02:27.350> at<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.500> perfect<00:02:28.740> time<00:02:29.130> well<00:02:29.640> that's

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
was like at the perfect time well that's

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.730 
was like at the perfect time well that's
how<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.120> that's<00:02:30.540> what<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.690> would<00:02:30.900> do<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.260> would<00:02:31.410> do

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
how I that's what I would do I would do

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.500 
how I that's what I would do I would do
that<00:02:31.950> or<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.250> would<00:02:32.400> have<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.550> cat<00:02:32.850> do<00:02:33.090> something

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
and when the cat triggered the laser

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.130 
and when the cat triggered the laser
then<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.820> picture<00:02:36.150> would<00:02:36.270> go<00:02:36.450> off<00:02:36.630> or<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> flash

water balloon and you want to throw a

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.140 
water balloon and you want to throw a
dart<00:03:26.070> at<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.519> you<00:03:26.580> want<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.730> capture<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
dart at it and you want to capture the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.970 
dart at it and you want to capture the
dart<00:03:27.420> going<00:03:27.720> through<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.989> water<00:03:28.170> balloon<00:03:28.530> you

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
dart going through the water balloon you

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.740 
dart going through the water balloon you
would<00:03:29.130> set<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.550> up<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:30.209> would<00:03:30.330> then<00:03:30.450> turn

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
would set this up you would then turn

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.780 
would set this up you would then turn
the<00:03:30.900> lights<00:03:31.110> off<00:03:31.290> put<00:03:31.680> your<00:03:31.709> camera<00:03:32.130> on<00:03:32.310> bulb

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
the lights off put your camera on bulb

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.640 
the lights off put your camera on bulb
mode<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.690> basically<00:03:34.019> you're<00:03:34.200> holding<00:03:34.560> the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
mode so basically you're holding the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.229 
mode so basically you're holding the
trigger<00:03:34.860> down<00:03:35.100> but<00:03:35.640> then<00:03:35.760> you'd<00:03:35.910> plug<00:03:36.090> the

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
trigger down but then you'd plug the

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.479 
trigger down but then you'd plug the
miops<00:03:36.570> into<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.840> flash<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:37.709> when<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.010> hears<00:03:38.400> the

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
miops into a flash so when it hears the

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.509 
miops into a flash so when it hears the
sound<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.500> water<00:03:40.739> exploding<00:03:41.370> from

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
sound of the of the water exploding from

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.460 
sound of the of the water exploding from
the<00:03:41.610> balloon<00:03:41.940> it's<00:03:42.330> gonna<00:03:42.600> trigger<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.019> flash

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
the balloon it's gonna trigger the flash

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.140 
the balloon it's gonna trigger the flash
and<00:03:43.860> your<00:03:44.190> camera<00:03:44.550> is<00:03:44.640> gonna<00:03:44.790> pick<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.090> up

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
and your camera is gonna pick that up

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.210 
and your camera is gonna pick that up
because<00:03:45.300> it's<00:03:45.540> already<00:03:45.660> in<00:03:45.780> bulb<00:03:46.080> BAM<00:03:46.739> you're

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
because it's already in bulb BAM you're

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.009 
because it's already in bulb BAM you're
capturing<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:47.790> image<00:03:48.060> what<00:03:48.390> would<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.750> try

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
capturing that image what would you try

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.240 
capturing that image what would you try
to<00:03:49.080> capture<00:03:49.320> with<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.650> sound

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
to capture with the sound

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.440 
to capture with the sound
what<00:03:50.459> would<00:03:50.550> you<00:03:50.670> try<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.940> capture<00:03:51.300> with<00:03:51.390> a

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
what would you try to capture with a

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.270 
what would you try to capture with a
laser<00:03:51.870> what<00:03:52.170> would<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.410> try<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.680> capture<00:03:52.980> with

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
laser what would you try to capture with

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.640 
laser what would you try to capture with
the<00:03:53.489> light<00:03:53.820> sensing<00:03:54.450> thing<00:03:54.690> there's<00:03:55.140> so<00:03:55.530> many

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
the light sensing thing there's so many

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.080 
the light sensing thing there's so many
different<00:03:56.040> things<00:03:56.160> that<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.489> personally<00:03:56.550> will

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
different things that I personally will

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.060 
different things that I personally will
try<00:03:57.269> with<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.930> know<00:03:57.989> Stephen<00:03:58.500> has<00:03:58.650> ideas

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
try with it and I know Stephen has ideas

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.620 
try with it and I know Stephen has ideas
and<00:03:59.280> that's<00:03:59.400> why<00:03:59.580> I<00:03:59.610> ended<00:04:00.000> up<00:04:00.090> funding<00:04:00.480> it

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
and that's why I ended up funding it

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.479 
and that's why I ended up funding it
because<00:04:01.200> of<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.470> multiple<00:04:01.830> reasons<00:04:02.220> they

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
because of the multiple reasons they

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.070 
because of the multiple reasons they
already<00:04:02.790> had<00:04:02.910> one<00:04:03.090> product<00:04:03.390> so<00:04:03.630> they're<00:04:03.780> an

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
already had one product so they're an

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.900 
already had one product so they're an
established<00:04:04.620> business<00:04:04.769> that's<00:04:05.370> what<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:05.610> liked

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
established business that's what I liked

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.940 
established business that's what I liked
about<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.209> I<00:04:06.480> like<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:06.989> it's<00:04:07.140> rechargeable<00:04:07.560> I

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
about it I like that it's rechargeable I

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.380 
about it I like that it's rechargeable I
like<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.610> has<00:04:08.760> all<00:04:09.030> these<00:04:09.330> different

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
like that it has all these different

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.150 
like that it has all these different
functions<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:10.440> many<00:04:10.650> functions<00:04:11.040> that<00:04:11.130> I

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
functions so many functions that I

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.310 
functions so many functions that I
probably<00:04:11.670> won't<00:04:11.910> use<00:04:12.120> all<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.570> them<00:04:12.690> but<00:04:12.900> the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
probably won't use all of them but the

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.110 
probably won't use all of them but the
fact<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.650> I<00:04:13.769> can<00:04:13.950> control<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.459> all<00:04:14.670> on<00:04:14.940> my

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
fact that I can control it all on my

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.000 
fact that I can control it all on my
phone<00:04:15.390> it<00:04:15.810> doesn't<00:04:16.290> get<00:04:16.410> better<00:04:16.560> than<00:04:16.890> that

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
phone it doesn't get better than that

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.680 
phone it doesn't get better than that
