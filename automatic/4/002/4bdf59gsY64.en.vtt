really force feedbacks been done you
know<00:00:39.530> for<00:00:39.710> over<00:00:39.860> 15<00:00:40.220> years<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:40.760> pretty<00:00:41.630> much

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
know for over 15 years and pretty much

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.780 
know for over 15 years and pretty much
the<00:00:41.840> same<00:00:41.990> way<00:00:42.050> across<00:00:42.380> the<00:00:42.680> industry<00:00:42.950> what

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
the same way across the industry what

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.220 
the same way across the industry what
we've<00:00:43.940> been<00:00:44.030> able<00:00:44.150> to<00:00:44.330> do<00:00:44.420> is<00:00:44.600> work<00:00:44.810> to<00:00:44.990> build

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
we've been able to do is work to build

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.200 
we've been able to do is work to build
an<00:00:45.380> entirely<00:00:45.710> new<00:00:45.860> way<00:00:46.010> previously<00:00:46.820> you<00:00:47.000> used

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
an entirely new way previously you used

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.810 
an entirely new way previously you used
to<00:00:47.390> have<00:00:47.810> some<00:00:48.110> canned<00:00:48.640> forces<00:00:49.640> that<00:00:49.790> a

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
to have some canned forces that a

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.340 
to have some canned forces that a
developer<00:00:50.090> could<00:00:50.450> push<00:00:50.660> down<00:00:50.900> to<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.140> device

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
developer could push down to the device

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.840 
developer could push down to the device
to<00:00:51.380> try<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:51.680> simulate<00:00:51.950> the<00:00:52.250> feeling<00:00:52.580> that<00:00:52.730> they

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
to try to simulate the feeling that they

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.640 
to try to simulate the feeling that they
wanted<00:00:53.120> what<00:00:53.750> we've<00:00:53.870> done<00:00:54.050> is<00:00:54.200> we've<00:00:54.350> develop

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
wanted what we've done is we've develop

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.530 
wanted what we've done is we've develop
a<00:00:54.740> new<00:00:54.980> way<00:00:55.190> of<00:00:55.220> doing<00:00:55.550> that<00:00:55.700> using<00:00:56.450> an

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
a new way of doing that using an

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.480 
a new way of doing that using an
equation<00:00:56.840> language<00:00:57.320> what<00:00:57.980> that<00:00:58.100> does<00:00:58.340> is<00:00:58.370> it

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
equation language what that does is it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.980 
equation language what that does is it
means<00:00:58.760> that<00:00:58.910> I<00:00:58.940> developer<00:00:59.390> can<00:00:59.510> push<00:00:59.780> down

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
means that I developer can push down

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.010 
means that I developer can push down
things<00:01:00.320> like<00:01:00.590> rpm<00:01:01.400> or<00:01:01.610> abs<00:01:01.970> and<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.510> equation

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
things like rpm or abs and the equation

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.179 
things like rpm or abs and the equation
language<00:01:03.320> will<00:01:03.440> do<00:01:03.560> the<00:01:03.680> right<00:01:03.800> thing<00:01:04.040> and

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
language will do the right thing and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.010 
language will do the right thing and
create<00:01:04.549> those<00:01:04.699> forces<00:01:05.059> for<00:01:05.360> them<00:01:05.509> it<00:01:05.900> also

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
create those forces for them it also

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.139 
create those forces for them it also
gives<00:01:06.350> them<00:01:06.560> flexibility<00:01:07.249> to<00:01:07.700> define<00:01:07.969> their

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
gives them flexibility to define their

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:09.730 
gives them flexibility to define their
own<00:01:08.179> building<00:01:08.719> blocks<00:01:08.960> it<00:01:09.109> really<00:01:09.350> delivers<00:01:09.710> a

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
own building blocks it really delivers a

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.840 
own building blocks it really delivers a
level<00:01:09.979> of<00:01:10.039> precision<00:01:10.369> but<00:01:10.609> we<00:01:10.700> just<00:01:10.759> haven't

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
level of precision but we just haven't

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.429 
level of precision but we just haven't
had<00:01:11.060> before<00:01:11.240> now<00:01:11.600> how<00:01:11.749> would<00:01:11.810> some<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.200> these

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
had before now how would some of these

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.289 
had before now how would some of these
new<00:01:12.710> features<00:01:12.950> enable<00:01:13.429> accessories<00:01:13.999> for

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
new features enable accessories for

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:15.669 
new features enable accessories for
different<00:01:14.630> experiences<00:01:15.079> other<00:01:15.259> kinds<00:01:15.590> of

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
different experiences other kinds of

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.849 
different experiences other kinds of
games<00:01:15.799> it<00:01:16.609> used<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:16.909> be<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:17.590> hardware<00:01:18.590> had<00:01:18.740> to

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
games it used to be that hardware had to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.739 
games it used to be that hardware had to
fit<00:01:19.039> into<00:01:19.159> predefined<00:01:19.909> categories<00:01:20.119> so<00:01:20.659> you

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:20.749 
fit into predefined categories so you

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:22.389 
fit into predefined categories so you
had<00:01:20.929> things<00:01:21.170> like<00:01:21.289> controllers<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.130> racing

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
had things like controllers and racing

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.160 
had things like controllers and racing
wheels<00:01:22.579> and<00:01:22.759> so<00:01:22.880> on<00:01:23.030> what<00:01:23.749> we've<00:01:23.869> done<00:01:23.899> is

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
wheels and so on what we've done is

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.899 
wheels and so on what we've done is
we've<00:01:24.289> created<00:01:24.319> a<00:01:24.829> new<00:01:24.859> level<00:01:25.219> of<00:01:25.399> modularity

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
we've created a new level of modularity

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.550 
we've created a new level of modularity
in<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.240> platform<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.049> think<00:01:27.200> about<00:01:27.289> things

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
in the platform so think about things

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.620 
in the platform so think about things
like<00:01:27.710> fight<00:01:27.950> sticks<00:01:28.249> a<00:01:28.819> lot<00:01:29.119> of<00:01:29.240> fights<00:01:29.420> tix

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
like fight sticks a lot of fights tix

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.760 
like fight sticks a lot of fights tix
these<00:01:29.780> days<00:01:29.929> are<00:01:30.079> customizable<00:01:30.679> you<00:01:30.710> can

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
these days are customizable you can

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.080 
these days are customizable you can
actually<00:01:31.100> move<00:01:31.249> where<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:31.729> buttons<00:01:31.969> are

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
actually move where the buttons are

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.760 
actually move where the buttons are
physically<00:01:32.509> located<00:01:32.539> we<00:01:33.409> can<00:01:33.590> now

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
physically located we can now

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.379 
physically located we can now
communicate<00:01:34.100> that<00:01:34.579> directly<00:01:35.030> up<00:01:35.179> to<00:01:35.299> the

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:35.389 
communicate that directly up to the

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:37.840 
communicate that directly up to the
platform<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.200> that<00:01:36.520> your<00:01:37.520> favorite

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
platform so that your favorite

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.190 
platform so that your favorite
configuration<00:01:38.450> is<00:01:38.569> communicated<00:01:39.079> to<00:01:39.139> the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
configuration is communicated to the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.660 
configuration is communicated to the
game<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:39.889> get<00:01:40.009> to<00:01:40.100> play<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.429> way<00:01:40.520> that

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
game and you get to play the way that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.700 
game and you get to play the way that
you<00:01:40.789> want<00:01:40.939> to<00:01:41.060> play<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:41.929> it's<00:01:42.079> not<00:01:42.170> just<00:01:42.229> button

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
you want to play so it's not just button

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.959 
you want to play so it's not just button
remapping<00:01:43.039> or<00:01:43.249> something<00:01:43.520> else<00:01:43.639> going<00:01:43.819> on

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
remapping or something else going on

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.779 
remapping or something else going on
there<00:01:44.179> so<00:01:44.479> yeah<00:01:44.630> in<00:01:44.810> addition<00:01:45.200> we<00:01:45.770> have<00:01:45.799> going

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
there so yeah in addition we have going

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.340 
there so yeah in addition we have going
back<00:01:46.939> to<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.060> modularity<00:01:47.600> point<00:01:47.959> there's

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
back to that modularity point there's

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.870 
back to that modularity point there's
additional<00:01:48.799> component<00:01:49.369> can<00:01:49.429> be<00:01:49.490> added<00:01:49.729> over

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
additional component can be added over

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.789 
additional component can be added over
time<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:50.600> think<00:01:50.869> about<00:01:50.959> on<00:01:51.170> your<00:01:51.289> racing<00:01:51.649> wheel

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
time so think about on your racing wheel

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.499 
time so think about on your racing wheel
you<00:01:51.979> can<00:01:52.100> add<00:01:52.249> things<00:01:52.520> like<00:01:52.639> different<00:01:53.329> shift

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
you can add things like different shift

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.819 
you can add things like different shift
or<00:01:53.630> configurations<00:01:54.259> you<00:01:54.469> can<00:01:54.499> add<00:01:54.679> different

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
or configurations you can add different

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.709 
or configurations you can add different
pedal<00:01:55.280> types<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:56.119> can<00:01:56.149> add<00:01:56.359> things<00:01:56.600> like

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
pedal types you can add things like

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.749 
pedal types you can add things like
gauges<00:01:57.289> so<00:01:57.439> think<00:01:57.649> about<00:01:57.709> your<00:01:57.829> rpm<00:01:58.249> gauge<00:01:58.279> or

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
gauges so think about your rpm gauge or

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.010 
gauges so think about your rpm gauge or
your<00:01:58.909> speedometer<00:01:59.479> or<00:01:59.600> things<00:01:59.840> like

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
your speedometer or things like

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.779 
your speedometer or things like
that<00:02:00.170> one<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.740> things<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.070> gamers<00:02:01.729> are

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
that one of the things that gamers are

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.130 
that one of the things that gamers are
concerned<00:02:02.090> with<00:02:02.210> is<00:02:02.299> about<00:02:02.479> control<00:02:02.990> or

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
concerned with is about control or

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.929 
concerned with is about control or
pairing<00:02:03.500> how<00:02:03.679> does<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:03.950> work<00:02:04.219> with<00:02:04.429> like<00:02:04.789> for

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
pairing how does that work with like for

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.639 
pairing how does that work with like for
instance<00:02:05.030> with<00:02:05.329> these<00:02:05.450> devices<00:02:05.750> if<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:06.500> don't

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
instance with these devices if you don't

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:07.539 
instance with these devices if you don't
know<00:02:06.710> what<00:02:06.770> controller<00:02:07.100> pairing<00:02:07.429> as

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
know what controller pairing as

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.119 
know what controller pairing as
controller<00:02:07.969> pairing<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.539> connect<00:02:09.009> being<00:02:10.009> able

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
controller pairing is connect being able

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.860 
controller pairing is connect being able
to<00:02:10.250> see<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.700> hardware<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.180> mapping<00:02:11.840> the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
to see the hardware and mapping the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.390 
to see the hardware and mapping the
right<00:02:12.140> hardware<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.769> right<00:02:12.920> player<00:02:13.160> so

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
right hardware to the right player so

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.040 
right hardware to the right player so
when<00:02:13.519> i'm<00:02:13.640> taking<00:02:13.940> my<00:02:14.090> turn<00:02:14.330> when<00:02:14.750> i'm<00:02:14.870> done<00:02:15.019> i

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
when i'm taking my turn when i'm done i

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.020 
when i'm taking my turn when i'm done i
slide<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.590> wheel<00:02:15.739> over<00:02:16.069> you<00:02:16.459> get<00:02:16.610> behind<00:02:16.910> it

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
slide the wheel over you get behind it

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.729 
slide the wheel over you get behind it
and<00:02:17.180> now<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.540> immediately<00:02:17.959> maps<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.560> right

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
and now it immediately maps the right

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.440 
and now it immediately maps the right
controller<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.400> right<00:02:19.640> person<00:02:20.000> seamless

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
controller to the right person seamless

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.000 
controller to the right person seamless
it<00:02:20.569> just<00:02:20.720> works<00:02:20.900> now<00:02:21.379> you<00:02:21.440> brought<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.709> couple

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
it just works now you brought a couple

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.410 
it just works now you brought a couple

have<00:02:24.920> in<00:02:25.010> front<00:02:25.069> of<00:02:25.190> us<00:02:25.310> yeah<00:02:25.940> let's<00:02:26.120> start

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
have in front of us yeah let's start

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.630 
have in front of us yeah let's start
with<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.450> thrush<00:02:26.780> master<00:02:27.110> 458<00:02:27.650> Italia<00:02:28.069> couple

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
with a thrush master 458 Italia couple

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.710 
with a thrush master 458 Italia couple
of<00:02:28.730> things<00:02:28.879> going<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.209> here<00:02:29.269> number<00:02:29.690> one

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
of things going on here number one

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.289 
of things going on here number one
clearly<00:02:30.379> it's<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.830> one-to-one<00:02:31.760> mapping<00:02:32.000> of

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
clearly it's a one-to-one mapping of

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.900 
clearly it's a one-to-one mapping of
that<00:02:32.480> classic<00:02:32.870> 458<00:02:33.530> Italia<00:02:33.890> wheel<00:02:34.069> which<00:02:34.670> fans

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
that classic 458 Italia wheel which fans

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.759 
that classic 458 Italia wheel which fans
just<00:02:35.150> love<00:02:35.329> it's<00:02:35.959> got<00:02:36.110> sequential<00:02:36.470> gear

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
just love it's got sequential gear

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.680 
just love it's got sequential gear
shifters<00:02:37.190> has<00:02:37.430> metal<00:02:37.760> pedals<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.660> a

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
shifters has metal pedals this is a

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.600 
shifters has metal pedals this is a
fantastic<00:02:38.900> wheel<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.769> also<00:02:39.920> has<00:02:40.190> brushless

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
fantastic wheel it also has brushless

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.210 
fantastic wheel it also has brushless
motors<00:02:41.180> which<00:02:41.930> one<00:02:42.230> means<00:02:42.530> it's<00:02:42.709> very<00:02:42.890> quiet

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
motors which one means it's very quiet

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.069 
motors which one means it's very quiet
so<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:43.489> really<00:02:44.030> feel<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.420> precision<00:02:44.870> of<00:02:44.959> the

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
so you really feel the precision of the

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.470 
so you really feel the precision of the
force<00:02:45.319> feedback<00:02:45.530> in<00:02:45.799> it<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.579> to<00:02:46.849> it<00:02:47.120> consumes

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
force feedback in it and to it consumes

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.600 
force feedback in it and to it consumes
a<00:02:47.599> lot<00:02:47.630> less<00:02:47.900> power<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.860> power<00:02:49.040> supply<00:02:49.430> is

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
a lot less power so the power supply is

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.339 
a lot less power so the power supply is
actually<00:02:50.030> embedded<00:02:50.420> inside<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.230> have<00:02:51.319> a

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
actually embedded inside so you have a

brandon<00:02:53.390> we<00:02:53.420> have<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:53.720> madcatz<00:02:54.049> wheel<00:02:54.290> yeah

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
brandon we have the madcatz wheel yeah

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.229 
brandon we have the madcatz wheel yeah
with<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.130> look<00:02:55.340> at<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.519> madcatz<00:02:55.910> wheel<00:02:56.150> a

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
with you look at the madcatz wheel a

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.400 
with you look at the madcatz wheel a
couple<00:02:56.510> things<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:56.810> can<00:02:56.959> see<00:02:57.110> right<00:02:57.140> away

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
couple things you can see right away

couple things you can see right away
number<00:02:57.950> one<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.280> very<00:02:58.430> small<00:02:58.790> size<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.329> can

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
number one the very small size you can

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.819 
number one the very small size you can
start<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.810> get<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.959> sense<00:03:00.019> of<00:03:00.230> that<00:03:00.319> modularity

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
start to get a sense of that modularity

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.680 
start to get a sense of that modularity
that<00:03:01.129> we<00:03:01.220> talked<00:03:01.430> about<00:03:01.579> this<00:03:02.120> wheel<00:03:02.329> you<00:03:02.540> can

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
that we talked about this wheel you can

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.369 
that we talked about this wheel you can
buy<00:03:02.810> in<00:03:02.959> a<00:03:03.019> bunch<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.319> different

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
buy in a bunch of different

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.229 
buy in a bunch of different
configurations<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:04.940> get<00:03:05.120> the

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
configurations so you get the

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.400 
configurations so you get the
configuration<00:03:05.780> that's<00:03:05.930> right<00:03:06.109> for<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:06.380> and

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
you can add on over time the wheel is

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.270 
you can add on over time the wheel is
swappable<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.380> when<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.620> want<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:09.859> do<00:03:09.920> f1
