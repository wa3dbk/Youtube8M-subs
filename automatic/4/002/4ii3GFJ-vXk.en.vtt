I'm<00:00:01.079> Jack<00:00:01.380> here<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:01.860> I'm<00:00:01.949> taking<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.399> look<00:00:02.580> at

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
I'm Jack here and I'm taking a look at

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.430 
I'm Jack here and I'm taking a look at
some<00:00:02.909> of<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.179> new<00:00:03.389> maps<00:00:03.629> that<00:00:03.929> were<00:00:04.080> put<00:00:04.259> into

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
some of the new maps that were put into

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.940 
some of the new maps that were put into
the<00:00:04.890> Living<00:00:05.190> Dead<00:00:05.220> playlist<00:00:06.440> these<00:00:07.440> maps<00:00:07.770> were

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
the Living Dead playlist these maps were

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.160 
the Living Dead playlist these maps were
added<00:00:08.280> as<00:00:08.400> part<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.059> January<00:00:09.630> matchmaking

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
added as part of the January matchmaking

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.330 
added as part of the January matchmaking
update<00:00:10.969> so<00:00:11.969> they're<00:00:12.179> pretty<00:00:12.389> recent<00:00:12.750> I

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
update so they're pretty recent I

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.060 
update so they're pretty recent I
believe<00:00:14.340> they<00:00:14.610> are<00:00:14.639> community<00:00:15.630> created<00:00:16.199> 343

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
believe they are community created 343

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.830 
believe they are community created 343
did<00:00:17.460> not<00:00:17.609> make<00:00:17.820> them<00:00:17.970> themselves<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:19.160> think<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
did not make them themselves I think and

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.870 
did not make them themselves I think and
I<00:00:21.840> really<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:23.310> what<00:00:23.519> they've<00:00:23.670> done<00:00:23.820> with

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
I really like what they've done with

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.730 
I really like what they've done with
them<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:25.699> if<00:00:26.699> you're<00:00:26.970> wondering<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:28.080> color<00:00:28.439> is

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
them I if you're wondering the color is

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.259 
them I if you're wondering the color is
not<00:00:28.949> messed<00:00:29.250> up<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> video<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.119> is

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
not messed up on the video this is

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.590 
not messed up on the video this is
actually<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:30.990> map<00:00:31.289> looks<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.600> this

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
actually how the map looks and this

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.410 
actually how the map looks and this
first<00:00:34.050> map<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.530> called<00:00:34.860> bedlam<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.850> based<00:00:36.239> on

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
first map is called bedlam it's based on

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.619 
first map is called bedlam it's based on
asylum<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.640> can<00:00:38.640> see<00:00:38.910> its<00:00:39.210> kind<00:00:39.600> of

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
asylum and you can see its kind of

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.479 
asylum and you can see its kind of
falling<00:00:40.469> apart<00:00:41.719> it<00:00:42.719> really<00:00:43.559> looks<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.190> it's

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
falling apart it really looks like it's

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.979 
falling apart it really looks like it's
an<00:00:44.940> old<00:00:45.440> abandoned<00:00:46.789> place<00:00:47.789> or<00:00:48.180> something

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
an old abandoned place or something

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.760 
an old abandoned place or something
either<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.680> or<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.039> tornado<00:00:50.579> came<00:00:51.059> through

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
either that or a tornado came through

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.549 
either that or a tornado came through
but<00:00:52.770> either<00:00:52.949> way<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:55.079> much<00:00:55.320> better

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
but either way it's it's so much better

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.450 
but either way it's it's so much better
than<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.100> default<00:00:56.309> maps<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.510> infection<00:00:58.079> I

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
than the default maps for infection I

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.400 
than the default maps for infection I
mean<00:00:59.460> when<00:00:59.670> they<00:00:59.789> design<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> regular<00:01:00.780> map<00:01:01.020> they

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
mean when they design a regular map they

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
mean when they design a regular map they
don't<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:02.039> infection<00:01:02.940> first<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.140> mind<00:01:04.439> right

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
don't have infection first in mind right

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.789 
don't have infection first in mind right
there<00:01:05.610> thinking<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.090> slayer<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.960> capture<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
there thinking of slayer and capture the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.950 
there thinking of slayer and capture the
flag<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.430> stuff<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.880> most<00:01:09.360> likely<00:01:10.790> so

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
flag and stuff like that most likely so

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.300 
flag and stuff like that most likely so
infection<00:01:12.960> being<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.320> kind<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.590> unique<00:01:13.950> game

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
infection being a kind of unique game

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.710 
infection being a kind of unique game
type<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:15.470> made<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.650> lot<00:01:16.950> better<00:01:17.130> by<00:01:17.580> having<00:01:17.720> maps

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
type is made a lot better by having maps

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.520 
type is made a lot better by having maps
specially<00:01:19.470> crafted<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.200> bedlam<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
specially crafted for it and bedlam is a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.640 
specially crafted for it and bedlam is a
great<00:01:22.830> example<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.670> think<00:01:24.470> I'm<00:01:25.470> going

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
great example of that I think I'm going

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.710 
great example of that I think I'm going
to<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.830> showing<00:01:26.070> two<00:01:26.640> more<00:01:26.880> maps<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.479> this

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
to be showing two more maps in this

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.800 
to be showing two more maps in this
video<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.250> took<00:01:29.400> one<00:01:29.939> round<00:01:30.240> from

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
video so I just took one round from

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.660 
video so I just took one round from
three<00:01:31.259> different<00:01:31.470> games<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.430> three

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
three different games to get three

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.690 
three different games to get three
different<00:01:32.790> maps<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.420> here<00:01:34.009> but<00:01:35.009> bedlam<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
different maps in here but bedlam is the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.170 
different maps in here but bedlam is the
only<00:01:35.909> forgeworld<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> video<00:01:38.180> so

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
only forgeworld one in the video so

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.060 
only forgeworld one in the video so
normally<00:01:39.600> you'd<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.170> more<00:01:40.560> forge<00:01:40.860> world

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
normally you'd think of more forge world

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.300 
normally you'd think of more forge world
maps<00:01:41.400> boring<00:01:41.990> but<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.439> actually<00:01:43.829> lets<00:01:44.040> them

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
maps boring but that actually lets them

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.130 
maps boring but that actually lets them
do<00:01:44.490> something<00:01:44.759> really<00:01:45.119> interesting<00:01:45.630> for

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
do something really interesting for

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.100 
do something really interesting for
infection<00:01:46.649> maps<00:01:46.860> which<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.000> move<00:01:48.630> all<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
infection maps which is move all the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.139 
infection maps which is move all the
pieces<00:01:49.320> around<00:01:49.619> exactly<00:01:50.430> how<00:01:50.549> they<00:01:50.700> want<00:01:50.729> them

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
pieces around exactly how they want them

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.039 
pieces around exactly how they want them
so<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.670> this<00:01:53.670> debris<00:01:53.939> at<00:01:54.390> weird

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
so you can have all this debris at weird

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.069 
so you can have all this debris at weird
angles<00:01:55.320> everywhere<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.869> because<00:01:57.869> you're

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
angles everywhere and because you're

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.980 
angles everywhere and because you're
used<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.829> normal<00:01:59.189> asylum<00:01:59.700> map<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.600> it

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
used to the normal asylum map now it

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.749 
used to the normal asylum map now it
looks<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.710> falling<00:02:02.159> apart<00:02:02.250> and

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
looks like it's all falling apart and

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.889 
looks like it's all falling apart and
old<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.479> stuff<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.759> which<00:02:05.759> creates<00:02:06.719> a

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
old and stuff like that which creates a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.770 
old and stuff like that which creates a
really<00:02:07.170> nice<00:02:07.439> effect<00:02:07.860> for<00:02:08.310> infection

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
really nice effect for infection

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.780 
really nice effect for infection
the<00:02:11.780> second<00:02:12.140> map<00:02:12.319> is<00:02:12.530> called<00:02:12.740> deep<00:02:13.040> scream<00:02:13.520> and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
the second map is called deep scream and

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.770 
the second map is called deep scream and
nine<00:02:14.030> it's<00:02:14.870> based<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.500> anchor<00:02:16.490> nine<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.480> it's

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
nine it's based on anchor nine and it's

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.480 
nine it's based on anchor nine and it's
black<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.170> white<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:18.709> it's<00:02:18.860> like<00:02:18.950> an<00:02:19.340> old

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
black and white so it's like an old

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.850 
black and white so it's like an old
movie<00:02:20.980> with<00:02:21.980> spaceships<00:02:22.310> though<00:02:22.819> I<00:02:23.860> actually

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
movie with spaceships though I actually

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.949 
movie with spaceships though I actually
have<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.780> good<00:02:26.780> spot<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.440> this<00:02:27.650> map<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.840> like<00:02:29.840> I

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
have a good spot on this map that like I

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.900 
have a good spot on this map that like I
don't<00:02:30.020> even<00:02:30.200> understand<00:02:30.890> why<00:02:31.160> they<00:02:31.370> included

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
don't even understand why they included

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.880 
don't even understand why they included
it<00:02:32.030> it's<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.720> good<00:02:32.959> there's<00:02:33.140> only<00:02:33.350> one<00:02:33.680> way<00:02:33.860> in

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
it it's so good there's only one way in

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.560 
it it's so good there's only one way in
and<00:02:35.560> probably<00:02:36.560> ninety<00:02:37.190> percent<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:38.150> last

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
and probably ninety percent of the last

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.780 
and probably ninety percent of the last
men<00:02:38.900> standing<00:02:38.930> will<00:02:39.680> be<00:02:39.830> in<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.040> room<00:02:40.489> on

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
men standing will be in that room on

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.620 
men standing will be in that room on
this<00:02:41.180> map<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.370> humans<00:02:43.700> spawn<00:02:44.030> on<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.420> one

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
this map so the humans spawn on the one

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.750 
this map so the humans spawn on the one
side<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:46.040> need<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.280> get<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.640> other

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
side and you need to get to the other

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.400 
side and you need to get to the other
side<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.300> map<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.690> find<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.989> entrance

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
side of the map to find the entrance

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.060 
side of the map to find the entrance
it's<00:02:49.370> right<00:02:49.790> over<00:02:49.850> here<00:02:50.150> under<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.200> middle

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
it's right over here under the middle

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.199 
it's right over here under the middle
room<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.670> map<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:55.040> did<00:02:55.430> cut<00:02:55.730> out<00:02:55.880> like<00:02:56.180> a

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
room in the map and I did cut out like a

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.780 
room in the map and I did cut out like a
minute<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.810> this<00:02:56.930> game<00:02:57.280> because<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.400> takes<00:02:58.640> the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
minute of this game because it takes the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.620 
minute of this game because it takes the
zombies<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.239> little<00:02:59.660> while<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.989> get<00:03:00.110> in<00:03:00.290> here<00:03:00.500> on

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
zombies a little while to get in here on

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.390 
zombies a little while to get in here on
the<00:03:02.630> normal<00:03:03.050> version<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.470> anchor<00:03:03.769> nine<00:03:03.950> there

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
the normal version of anchor nine there

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.460 
the normal version of anchor nine there
would<00:03:04.610> be<00:03:04.640> two<00:03:05.090> other<00:03:05.360> entrances<00:03:05.959> into<00:03:06.200> this

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
would be two other entrances into this

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.160 
would be two other entrances into this
area<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:07.760> have<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.000> stairs<00:03:08.330> to<00:03:08.450> my<00:03:08.630> right<00:03:08.959> and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
area you have the stairs to my right and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.400 
area you have the stairs to my right and
the<00:03:09.980> other<00:03:10.010> entrance<00:03:10.430> behind<00:03:10.790> me<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:12.260> those

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
the other entrance behind me but those

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.229 
the other entrance behind me but those
are<00:03:12.590> both<00:03:12.830> blocked<00:03:13.310> off<00:03:13.610> here<00:03:14.769> also<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.910> low

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
are both blocked off here also the low

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
that you can't go out there so now we're

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.720 
that you can't go out there so now we're
just<00:03:23.900> watching<00:03:24.230> this<00:03:24.530> one<00:03:24.920> entrance<00:03:25.430> and

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
just watching this one entrance and

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.150 
just watching this one entrance and
somehow<00:03:26.630> I<00:03:26.780> managed<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.380> get<00:03:27.500> none<00:03:27.829> of<00:03:27.980> those

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
somehow I managed to get none of those

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.530 
somehow I managed to get none of those
kills<00:03:29.920> after<00:03:30.920> this<00:03:31.100> guy<00:03:31.310> dies<00:03:31.579> then<00:03:32.060> I<00:03:32.090> start

kills after this guy dies then I start

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.880 
kills after this guy dies then I start
getting<00:03:32.780> a<00:03:32.840> few<00:03:33.049> kills<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:35.110> actually<00:03:36.110> run<00:03:36.739> out

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
getting a few kills I actually run out

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.729

of<00:03:36.920> ammo<00:03:37.400> this<00:03:37.610> round<00:03:37.910> because<00:03:38.900> most<00:03:39.440> of<00:03:39.560> my

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
of ammo this round because most of my

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.220

that's<00:03:42.620> pretty<00:03:42.890> good<00:03:48.579> but<00:03:49.579> yeah<00:03:49.760> this<00:03:49.910> is

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
that's pretty good but yeah this is

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.430 
that's pretty good but yeah this is
really<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.989> best<00:03:51.290> spot<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.660> survive<00:03:54.370> aka<00:03:55.370> camp

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440
