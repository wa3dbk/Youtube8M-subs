impossibility<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:54.510> got<00:00:54.660> several<00:00:54.899> things

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
impossibility we got several things

Kobe Bryant who's not playing defense

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.310 
Kobe Bryant who's not playing defense
he's<00:01:07.260> doing<00:01:07.740> some<00:01:07.890> kind<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.159> dance<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.170> we<00:01:10.170> got

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the the goal that has the shot clock

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.410 
the the goal that has the shot clock
showing<00:01:13.530> five<00:01:13.770> minutes<00:01:14.130> left<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.610> 24<00:01:14.970> seconds
