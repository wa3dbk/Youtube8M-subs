00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.380

 in the front of the area turns around 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.410
 careful and danger touches for gutierrez 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.720

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.670

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.440
 open the ball to the center is dominating 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.050

 friends, we've had a lot of luck in that 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.379
 played and we go to rest with the 0 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.559
 to 0 facing for the moment and with 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.750
 Possibilities the bandleaf mestril 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.640
 is dialing up looking for spaces 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.269
 skimming the offside in that center 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.220
 it's a good header, it goes wide 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.960

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.600
 coming very little for now 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.790
 the sake above the goalkeeper earn us in 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.500
 the careful headbutt that now we do 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.150
 they can make the newcastle at 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.640
 counterattack gets inside the area 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.930
 Care that trims the touch back to 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.330

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.520
 shot of sissokó sima outside have 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.210
 wasted there the counterattack friends 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.909
 and follows the 0 to 0 goalkeeper who takes it out 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.830

 recovery the center of the field and then 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.799
 joselu there being unstoppable for the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.369
 goalkeeper who handles both legs 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.140
 joselu and 0 to 1 goodbye now yes that there 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.869

 hold the result 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.019
 Anita that he opens up we are already in 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.390
 the friends discount this can be the 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.180
 last we recovered well the ball clears 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.819
 up to fight 'joselo in jump nothing 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.170
 retrieves newcastle can be one more 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.299
 Care we have to defend as 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.569
 puts the ball up clears well the 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.370
 defense and the match ends 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.380
 the friends party match off 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.569
 house against the newcastle we have given 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.220
 we have all endured in the end 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.569
 managed to score with a bit of luck 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.489
 and we went round 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.620
 good friends, we seem to be playing 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.420
 in the premier league but now it's our turn 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.670
 play the second leg match 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.069
 semifinals against the everton of the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.499
 capital one remember that we won 20 the 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.870
 age so we have to give everything 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:58.109
 friends to get through to the great 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.239
 end there you can see the friends table 20 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.510
 we won the first leg of the other semifinal 0-0 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.799
 Between leeds united and cardiff city 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.040
 founded by playing the everton on the front 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:12.329
 of the area or press pass and shot not 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.780
 forgive the everton goodbye minute 41 puts 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.609
 1 to 0 and cut out cut distances 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.620
 in the tie 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.169
 right now we line up passing 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.519
 us for the global but this is very 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.319
 dangerous now if you have we can not 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.280
 trust we have to go as 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.010
 get a goal 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.930
 1 - there you can see joselu who is in 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.500
 the band asking to enter has been injured 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.090
 in a previous move it seems that I can 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.290
 continue there you can see how it enters the 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.689
 field 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.329
 but we are elevated for the moment 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:44.159
 let's hope he recovers by pressing 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.959
 joselu who is still injured 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:50.040
 friends elevates us to the cross of injury 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.650
 so it looks like it's not going to 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.689
 recover at least in this game 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.340
 and good what I feared has been fulfilled 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.709
 you can read joselu is no longer in the 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.780
 field give me the option to simulate the 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.120
 rest of the game to see the rest of the 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.799
 match or play the rest of the game 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.420
 with the complete team and good to see the 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.430
 rest of the game would be a bit boring 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.870
 playing it with the team would be a bit 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.700
 false because it's a career mode of 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.009
 player so friends I'm going to play 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.289
 I'm going to give you to simulate that of ahmed and 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:21.750
 apart to be in the bad final 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.340
 luck of joselu's injury but we 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.669
 let's play everything in this simulation 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.380
 I think it 's the most realistic and there you can 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.389
 see that the global end of the 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.310
 eliminator with two to one we get 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.620
 move to the final friends the game ends 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.250
 so it's 1 to 0 with the goal you've seen 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.419
 of the everton in the other semifinal 0-0 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.240
 It seems that he has not played the 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:45.240
 back so we 're in the final and you 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.530
 we will see against quer iván touches us then 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.630
 well there you can see the message of the 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.550
 physiotherapist rest forced to 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.190
 by health has a sprain injury 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.560
 ankle and you're going to lose three weeks 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.569
 of friendly matches hopefully you're 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.309
 ready for the final 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:01.469
 and notice that the equipment that has happened to 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:04.139
 the final he will play against 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:07.199
 we the finals the leeds united a 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.089
 English second division team that 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.639
 well then go surprise friends that in 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:13.319
 the final we are we build 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.419
 against leeds united in the end of the 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:18.259
 capital one who would say opening 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:21.300
 teams like chelsea and manchester city- 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.949
 very strong teams because look that the 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.740
 final have been planted there are two teams 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.240
 children who have been passing phases and 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.099

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.930
