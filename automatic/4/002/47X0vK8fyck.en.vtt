00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
by tapping the button again not that you

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.250 
by tapping the button again not that you
need<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> gun<00:01:02.789> against<00:01:03.449> those<00:01:03.600> link<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.080> but

need a gun against those link is but
it's<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.530> situational<00:01:05.430> useful<00:01:06.140> this<00:01:07.140> level<00:01:07.470> has

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
it's a situational useful this level has

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.250 
it's a situational useful this level has
ice<00:01:07.799> physics<00:01:08.340> which<00:01:08.610> most<00:01:08.909> players<00:01:09.210> hate<00:01:09.540> I'm

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
ice physics which most players hate I'm

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.410 
ice physics which most players hate I'm
one<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.770> them<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.640> not<00:01:11.850> too<00:01:12.030> big<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.330> a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
one of them but it's not too big of a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.870 
one of them but it's not too big of a
deal<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.900> also<00:01:13.560> really<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.040> not<00:01:14.159> understand<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
deal I also really do not understand the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.700 
deal I also really do not understand the
snow<00:01:15.119> effect<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.840> slows<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:16.229> movement

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
snow effect here it slows your movement

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.740 
snow effect here it slows your movement
down<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.220> could<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.479> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
down as you could just see but it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.880 
down as you could just see but it
doesn't<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.200> matter<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.710> all<00:01:19.830> because

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
doesn't really matter at all because

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.130 
doesn't really matter at all because
there<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.520> no<00:01:20.640> enemies<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.210> those<00:01:21.450> up<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
there are no enemies but those up on the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.380 
there are no enemies but those up on the
platforms<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.759> only<00:01:24.030> screaming

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
platforms and it's the only screaming

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.090 
platforms and it's the only screaming
the<00:01:24.540> entire<00:01:24.570> game<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> snow<00:01:25.799> effect

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the entire game to have the snow effect

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.920 
the entire game to have the snow effect
like<00:01:26.310> this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.200 

drill<00:01:29.590> missile<00:01:29.950> is<00:01:30.040> not<00:01:30.220> good<00:01:30.430> against<00:01:30.790> all

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
drill missile is not good against all

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.440 
drill missile is not good against all
enemies<00:01:31.630> but<00:01:32.400> rain<00:01:33.400> flash<00:01:33.640> most<00:01:33.940> of<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.270> time

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
enemies but rain flash most of the time

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.450 
enemies but rain flash most of the time
is<00:01:34.690> especially<00:01:35.410> against<00:01:35.590> shielded<00:01:36.010> ones<00:01:36.190> this

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
is especially against shielded ones this

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.010 
is especially against shielded ones this
would<00:01:36.640> be<00:01:36.790> a<00:01:36.820> very<00:01:37.030> annoying<00:01:37.540> screen<00:01:37.870> without

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
would be a very annoying screen without

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.850 
would be a very annoying screen without
it<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.470> I'm<00:01:38.890> glad<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.340> have<00:01:39.490> it<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:41.740> like

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
it and I'm glad to have it I really like

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.500 
it and I'm glad to have it I really like
the<00:01:42.040> progression<00:01:42.490> of<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.700> sky<00:01:43.000> here<00:01:43.360> it's

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
the progression of the sky here it's

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.390 
the progression of the sky here it's
getting<00:01:43.780> darker<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:44.140> darker<00:01:44.380> as<00:01:44.590> we<00:01:44.710> advance

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
getting darker and darker as we advance

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.700 
getting darker and darker as we advance
up<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.729> castle<00:01:46.330> I<00:01:46.479> do<00:01:46.780> not<00:01:46.900> know<00:01:46.960> why<00:01:47.350> this<00:01:47.410> is

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
up the castle I do not know why this is

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.380 
up the castle I do not know why this is
because<00:01:48.190> this<00:01:48.430> car<00:01:48.640> certainly<00:01:49.090> does<00:01:49.240> not

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
because this car certainly does not

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.719 
because this car certainly does not
