00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.919
 hello everyone here is our ant on 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.900
 which is installed electronic 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.050
 ignition 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:16.870
 the switch then the eight coil native 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.920
 there is a hall sensor and we see a curtain 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.010
 carved new roller knead 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.720
 contacts installed all this 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.680
 the lid closes here everything fits 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.900
 neatly in general start up great 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.720
 now I don't know how cold 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.180
 will start up 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:40.210
 Rod reception in general ok Statement 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:43.690
 showed better behind the contact many times 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.690
 better from the fly 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.050
 now key 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.020
 at 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.450
 Muromskikh 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.859
 so here's what else was done 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:12.010
 We have the battery here from the car cooked such 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:19.120
 the frame is no longer visible 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:23.430
 new cylinder with a flap valve also 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.160
 this ant we get ant 2 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.010
 as there was a cylinder under the knee with 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.150
 nut had to take a new viburnum not 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:41.549
 can digested a little digested frame 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:43.390
 also did not fit here you can see well in general 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.650
 ant principle 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.640
 became behind this ignition and with petal 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.510
 the valve to work at idle 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:03:00.130
 turned out better not for the best in general 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.900
 became more powerful as if on bottoms then fuel 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.269
 flew all 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.540
 air I now tan better 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.540
 Well, in general, not bad for everyone yet
