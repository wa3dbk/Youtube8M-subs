00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello friends look this 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.679
 video to learn to identify 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.109
 when is it time to clean the laptop from dust 10 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.199
 the laptop is not the main computer 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.090
 and is not used for resource-intensive 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.760
 applications, it is usually not 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.430
 clean during the whole period of operation 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.119
 which usually does not exceed 23 years in 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.060
 hands alone 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.219
 but if the laptop is used intensively 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.590
 as the main computer then 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.239
 cleaning may already be required for 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.860
 first year of operation 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.079
 here is an example samsung r 480 laptop about 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.030
 Two years worked until 1 cleansing in 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.280
 not the main computer 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.469
 but after it was used in 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.129
 as a system unit and became 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.780
 work an average of 14 hours a day 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.570
 temperature based cleaning 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.079
 CPU needed after 6 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.059
 months half a year this is precisely that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.890
 the time interval through which 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.920
 it is desirable to clean and 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.830
 intensively exploited prevention 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.170
 computing at work 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.630
 laptop besides a set of cruciform 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.570
 Screwdrivers convenient to use thin 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.020
 tweezers and spatula thin tweezers can 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.759
 make all the staci tweezers 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.790
 excess on the emery wheel 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.970
 and the scapula is better cut from durable 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.430
 plastic and grind the edge with a file in 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.189
 the quality of the material for the blade is good 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.200
 recommended itself polypropylene from 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.009
 which in particular is made 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.869
 modern sewer pipes 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.500
 to get to the cooling system 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.479
 laptop notebook need to disassemble often 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.560
 this requires almost complete 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.560
 disassembly device 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.700
 if you have not found a service manual 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.659
 on your laptop model 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.000
 then you can search on YouTube video 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.920
 captured the disassembly process if 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.830
 disassembly information to find 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.420
 it was not possible to comply with the main thing 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.870
 two simple rules 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.959
 first and foremost rule not rush 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.450
 better spend extra hours on disassembling 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.690
 than to restore the broken 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.989
 detail second and equally important rule 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.620
 do not make much effort when disassembling 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.260
 Especially it concerns dismemberment 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:42.000
 connectors and loops as well as all kinds 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:44.980
 snaps while cleaning the laptop 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.920
 it is desirable to replace thermo conductive 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.849
 post between the cooler and the processor or 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.120
 processors 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.769
 if there is a separate video card for 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.329
 This is suitable domestic pasta CPT-8 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.000
 bearings should also be lubricated 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.220
 fan if you're lucky and in 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.739
 your laptop's fan will 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.810
 used bearings then 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.780
 periodic lubrication will make 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.730
 fan perpetual the thing is that in 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.310
 laptops unlike desktop 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.720
 non-standard fans are used 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.280
 replacing which can start a pretty penny about 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.489
 fan prevention can be read 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.489
 here 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.450
 I made a mistake at this stage of the disassembly 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.980
 skipping one of the screws holding 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.099
 laptop top panel 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.739
 but applying the above indicated rule 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.049
 disassembly avoided any 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.060
 breakdowns 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.549
 the video you are watching scrolls 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.370
 at an accelerated pace actually 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:11.360
 laptop disassembly took several times 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:16.299
 more time gently losing time 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.299
 connectors that can prevent disassembly 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:51.460
 and here we got maternal access 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:54.430
 We look at the laptop's board, what else hinders 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:58.050
 for its complete dismantling and eliminate 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.050
 interference one by one 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.260
 and here is the cooling system 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:45.150
 disconnect the fan from the power supply and 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:47.580
 CPU heat pipes for cleaning 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.980
 heatsink and fan to us 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.140
 need a brush piece 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.740
 single core wire and flap 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.670
 nylon stocking 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:01.560
 now free access to the radiator 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.980
 here the manufacturer used small 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.980
 self-tapping screws 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.340
 often cooler slots sealed self-adhesive 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.220
 cloth or paper if these stickers 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.970
 crumble don't use instead 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.820
 insulating tape 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:42.330
 under the influence of heat, it can come off 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:46.580
 and worsen the cooling is better to use 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.580
 plain paper rubber glue 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.069
 as we see were thoroughly scored all 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:11.219
 gaps between radiator fins 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:13.449
 thoroughly remove all dust 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:16.210
 final impeller cleaning 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:18.479
 the fan is convenient to produce wet 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.479
 tassel 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:29.420
 for removing dust and gaps between the ribs 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:32.090
 radiator use a loop of thin 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:34.840
 single core wire and flap ladies 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.840
 nylon stocking 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:57.379
 We mark the next match with a pointed match. 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:57.379
 cleaned slot 

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:07.039
 repeat the operation for each slit 

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:07.039
 radiator 

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:12.619
 Thanks for attention
