plus<00:01:56.829> 7<00:01:57.310> in<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.819> shop<00:01:58.119> I<00:01:58.299> was<00:01:58.450> going<00:01:58.600> up<00:01:58.689> to<00:01:58.899> 7<00:01:59.229> I

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
plus 7 in the shop I was going up to 7 I

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.130 
plus 7 in the shop I was going up to 7 I
think<00:01:59.560> which<00:02:00.459> is<00:02:00.789> quite<00:02:01.240> weird<00:02:01.450> since<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:01.990> he

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
think which is quite weird since it he

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.319 
think which is quite weird since it he
shot<00:02:02.409> only<00:02:02.530> went<00:02:02.740> up<00:02:02.799> to<00:02:03.069> his<00:02:03.640> headings<00:02:04.149> the

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
shot only went up to his headings the

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:05.969 
shot only went up to his headings the
big<00:02:04.479> difference<00:02:04.929> I<00:02:05.110> actually<00:02:05.319> only<00:02:05.649> scored

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
big difference I actually only scored

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.490 
big difference I actually only scored
one<00:02:06.250> header<00:02:06.490> with<00:02:06.729> him<00:02:06.909> but<00:02:07.689> I<00:02:07.869> was<00:02:08.170> trying<00:02:08.440> to

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
one header with him but I was trying to

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.130 
one header with him but I was trying to
use<00:02:08.679> his<00:02:08.860> foot<00:02:09.129> more<00:02:09.340> than<00:02:09.519> his<00:02:09.610> head<00:02:10.140> now

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
use his foot more than his head now

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.220 
use his foot more than his head now

Balotelli is he's kind of a position
quite<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.920> bit<00:02:18.220> breath<00:02:18.489> in<00:02:19.890> yeah<00:02:20.890> he's<00:02:21.010> kind<00:02:21.250> of

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
quite a bit breath in yeah he's kind of

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.300 
quite a bit breath in yeah he's kind of
exposition<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.480> he's<00:02:23.290> dribbling<00:02:23.860> he's
