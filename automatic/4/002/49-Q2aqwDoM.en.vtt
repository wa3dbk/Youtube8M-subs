00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.920
 cheat stuffing for little money thatâ€™s what attracts series devices 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.830
 blogging and drip and today we will meet with the mouse aphotic iron l7 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.119
 the mouse is not very small but grip palm keep it uncomfortable 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.020
 having to snap your fingers is very strange because she is only 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.760
 a few millimeters smaller than my males which I hold with my palm even if 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.920
 she is not small then she looks small because you put a wide hand on her 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.120
 grip fingers and they fall on the places reserved for them and so keep 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.579
 it is quite convenient to me one more oddity is that it is unexpected and easy personally 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.719
 I don't like it very much because I love heavy mice, but this is mine 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.780
 personal it is covered with soft-touch plastic which 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.430
 collects prints but for me this is a small problem a little incomprehensible to me 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.860
 another usually soft touch provides 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.760
 normal grip with the palm and here at me it slips out of my hands a little 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.680
 but on the buttons everything is fine they are with rubber pads and it is very cool 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.810
 Buttons are generally 9 but technically this is not a button but a switch so I would 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.930
 said that their families are under the two main switches 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.930
 omron that withstand 20 million clicks 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.700
 how many stand the rest of the buttons I could not figure out 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.869
 The main ones with a good stroke are pressed and clear and unpleasant to click up to the side 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.680
 it is convenient to reach with a thumb but they are slightly recessed into the body and there was 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.090
 It would be better if they protruded more forward the top buttons and switch 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.900
 They are not very conveniently located and you have to reach for them during the game. 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.549
 hid rubberized with an easy move and a little inexpressive clicking but in 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.970
 In principle, all wire is a good woven fabric 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.320
 lightweight and with good bend protection on the carpet does not rub at least 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.700
 the sensor is also difficult to find fault with this avago 9800 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.960
 as in many top mice that stand as two or even three such as this 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.210
 what to say it is just fine the tie-in sensor shows itself well in micro 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.580
 moments and in the game you can rely on it 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.850
 the legs here are not Teflon aluminum with them the mouse super quickly slides on the table 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.460
 but for me, accustomed to a very low sense it is too fast even at 400 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.020
 now this mouse behaves faster than a normal mouse with teflon legs and 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.370
 have to get used go to the most interesting software 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.850
 that's where all the salt 1 and 2 tabs are the most common key settings profile selection 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.970
 dipai gear scoop sensor calibration and separation height 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.170
 the profiles are 3rd and each of them is highlighted in its own color, true for now 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.440
 I found it took quite a long time to change the profile 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.790
 without a driver, you need to hold down the button 1 for three seconds and then press the side 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.959
 keys until you find the desired profile after that again press the button 1 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.610
 By the way, apart from the choice of the color of the profile, there is no more backlight setting 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.090
 will be a constant throb you can't knock at least i 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.790
 this is not found the most interesting tab core is the modes that allow your 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.980
 mice function in different ways core 1 is usually nothing interesting in 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.239
 the second buttons and n 3 and 4 are made from any weapon in any 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.340
 the game is a burton shot of two three rounds respectively 3 core already need 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.190
 unlock for money but I warn you right away this chip is even behind the violin in the bird nim 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.050
 in the second field you can be banned but what does 3 peels make then here you are 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.790
 adjust the return so that when you spray everything flew to one point it is of course long and 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.950
 time-consuming process but if you manage to set up you god of shooters no one can stand 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.879
 against shots well again this is cheat 4 feed for lpg 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.870
 strategies there you write macros on anything but again figure out 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.709
 this is difficult however you are given a trial version for 1000 shots so that you 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.390
 could try a mouse in general good interesting design 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.269
 An interesting solution with legs is an excellent center and a cheat salt, but it costs 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.010
 Yes, compared to any horned one, it is not worth anything at all and for that it can 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.209
 much to ask for it all with you was online glue photos store my name is 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.600
 Maxim subscribe to our youtube channel and you will be without any taffeta 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:32.980
 put the head from 1 to 3 to bye
