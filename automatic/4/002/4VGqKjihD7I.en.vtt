00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.080
 have had started in 2005 we also had 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.670
 a pretty strong start because 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.779
 we won the pop-rock which gave us 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.779
 very much high 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.440
 then we did what would be the recording 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.700
 of the first record and in 2009 we changed the 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.400
 group members 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.080
 we had a break for almost a year and then 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.400
 we started with a new formation that 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.400
 is with which we continue until today 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.410
 do not 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.590
 yes 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.330
 I compose myself with the acoustic guitar 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.520
 the song came very naked and the 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.050
 we take to the place but then the rest of 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.239
 the song is developing with all 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.860
 the group at a time and just 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.860
 end between all 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.830
 and we talk about love from different 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.840
 protagonists and points of view and then 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.750
 we talk a lot also in generic plan 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.360
 but we make some criticism as 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.760
 we found society not what the lack 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.700
 of time nowadays what is the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.140
 life the continuous stress that we dedicate 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.760
 very little time to what really 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.460
 makes us happy and that we are a 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.030
 little robotized 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.030
 do not 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.740
 are 2 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.300
 to me 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.000
 the main objective of the band would be 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.829
 touch touch and then touch good to 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.750
 play at conventions and play at ease 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.490
 we always try to get that 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.560
 someone to support us or get to touch on 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.509
 some outside festival or something that 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.250
 make it possible to feel people and power 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.380
 reach the largest audience possible then 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.670
 right now we are focused on that in 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.429
 try to get to play at festivals 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.640
 or in places a little more with greater 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.640
 influx 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.720
 we are working on a direct dvd 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.510
 because we understand that direct is what 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.040
 which is the maximum exponent of what 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.569
 makes a group no more than the disc the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.430
 Direct the end is is the purpose of 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.239
 a group play live we all want 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.239
 touch touch and touch 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.370
 two 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.810
 we would say that each one comes from a 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.060
 different part of the music but at 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.130
 end always sacrifice let's say the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.740
 songs each song takes you to choose 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.090
 a typeface a type of arrangement and I 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.190
 I think that is what you have to leave 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.600
 carry so you look for your style and 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.600
 every time you focus more feel 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.469
 yes 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.220
 my lord 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.780
 do not 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.780
 or not 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.400
 if you see 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.599
 for me music is the time to 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.189
 truth just one tone do not get on the 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.810
 you forget everything about the 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.900
 labels if you do what you get out of the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.670
 noses and you express yourself and then there are times 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.739
 what do you say they go as I said that 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.030
 how have I done this but it is important 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.260
 What is music to me? I think that 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.290
 for most of the musicians that is 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.480
 our exhaust valve we have or not 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.939
 a professional career one the music is 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.680
 a way of expression is an art and in 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.950
 many cases is a valve of that of 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.520
 escape and a need 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.520
 do not 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.770
 do not
