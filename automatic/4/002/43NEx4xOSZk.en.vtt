00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
as you guys can see the book and quill

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.660 
as you guys can see the book and quill
it<00:02:42.230> literally<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.650> book<00:02:42.860> with<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.460> quill

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
it literally is a book with the quill

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.890 
it literally is a book with the quill
which<00:02:43.820> is<00:02:43.940> kind<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.150> like<00:02:44.270> a<00:02:44.300> feather<00:02:44.540> which<00:02:44.780> is

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
which is kind of like a feather which is

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.690 
which is kind of like a feather which is
why<00:02:45.020> this<00:02:45.080> was<00:02:45.350> introduced<00:02:45.740> right<00:02:45.860> here<00:02:46.070> so<00:02:46.280> it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
why this was introduced right here so it

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.510 
why this was introduced right here so it
is<00:02:46.910> great<00:02:47.330> for<00:02:47.810> mainly<00:02:48.470> adventure<00:02:48.980> maps<00:02:49.160> but

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
is great for mainly adventure maps but

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.370 
is great for mainly adventure maps but
for<00:02:49.760> Minecraft<00:02:50.150> Console<00:02:50.600> it'd<00:02:50.720> be<00:02:50.840> good<00:02:51.080> for<00:02:51.140> a

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
for Minecraft Console it'd be good for a

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.560 
for Minecraft Console it'd be good for a
starter<00:02:51.800> pack<00:02:51.980> for<00:02:52.640> example<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.210> could<00:02:53.360> set<00:02:53.510> a

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
starter pack for example you could set a

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.630 
starter pack for example you could set a
spawn<00:02:53.900> point<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.290> your<00:02:54.410> survival<00:02:54.710> world<00:02:55.070> you

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
spawn point in your survival world you

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.920 
spawn point in your survival world you
could<00:02:55.760> have<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:55.910> chest<00:02:56.180> there<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.540> in<00:02:56.630> chests

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
could have a chest there and in chests

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.630 
could have a chest there and in chests
it<00:02:57.080> says<00:02:57.260> these<00:02:57.440> are<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.650> rules<00:02:57.950> now<00:02:58.490> this

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
it says these are the rules now this

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.980 
it says these are the rules now this
would<00:02:58.790> be<00:02:58.820> good<00:02:59.030> for<00:02:59.240> surveys<00:02:59.690> if<00:02:59.840> they<00:02:59.930> do

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
would be good for surveys if they do

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.750 
would be good for surveys if they do
introduce<00:03:00.380> servers<00:03:00.770> or<00:03:00.920> realms<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.520> would<00:03:01.640> be

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
introduce servers or realms it would be

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.980 
introduce servers or realms it would be
great<00:03:01.970> because<00:03:02.120> people<00:03:02.480> can<00:03:02.600> read<00:03:02.780> what<00:03:02.900> you

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
great because people can read what you

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.050 
great because people can read what you
got<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.200> do<00:03:03.380> don't<00:03:03.950> break<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:04.340> okay<00:03:04.820> how<00:03:05.000> do

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.580 
it in this one I'm going to do a brand
new<00:04:38.030> one<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:38.480> for<00:04:38.660> example<00:04:39.110> as<00:04:39.200> you<00:04:39.230> guys<00:04:39.440> can

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
new one so for example as you guys can

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.320
