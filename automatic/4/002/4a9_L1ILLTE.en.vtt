00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
see how it turned out so we start with

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.180 
see how it turned out so we start with
this<00:00:46.170> red<00:00:46.410> tree<00:00:46.710> over<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:52.100> looks<00:00:53.100> pretty

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
this red tree over here looks pretty

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.279 
this red tree over here looks pretty
good<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.730> did<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> pretty<00:00:54.210> poor<00:00:54.510> job<00:00:57.289> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
good and I did a pretty poor job this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.619 
good and I did a pretty poor job this
area<00:00:58.620> looks<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.100> guess<00:00:59.670> normal<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.539> my

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
area looks I guess normal this is my

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.410

backdoor glass now over here we have a
little<00:01:03.719> bit<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.989> dip<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.650> straight<00:01:05.070> but

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
little bit of a dip this is straight but

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.450 
little bit of a dip this is straight but
I<00:01:05.970> must<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:07.200> recorded<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.830> perfectly

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460

overall and there's this is the tree we
started<00:01:18.330> with<00:01:19.220> overall<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.490> turned<00:01:20.790> out

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
started with overall that turned out

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.010 
started with overall that turned out
pretty<00:01:21.299> good<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> does<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> full<00:01:22.700> 360-degree

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
pretty good it does a full 360-degree

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.679 
pretty good it does a full 360-degree
panorama<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:27.110> all<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.439> do<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:29.600> when<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
you're in panorama mode and then you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.460 
you're in panorama mode and then you
could<00:01:38.100> start<00:01:38.369> moving<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:38.850> way<00:01:38.880> or<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> other

could start moving one way or the other
and<00:01:40.470> when<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.159> start<00:01:41.520> moving<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.509> will<00:01:42.840> start

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and when you start moving it will start

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.800 
and when you start moving it will start
filling<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.210> got<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.479> keep<00:01:45.630> your

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
camera positioned up and down and then

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.510 
camera positioned up and down and then
just<00:01:48.780> keep<00:01:49.140> moving<00:01:49.500> slowly<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> full<00:01:50.280> circle

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
just keep moving slowly in a full circle

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.389 
just keep moving slowly in a full circle
so<00:01:51.299> that's<00:01:51.390> how<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.720> works<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.369> anyways<00:01:53.369> guys

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
