00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.660 
very gimmicky the reason for it is 3d is
for<00:02:59.350> you<00:02:59.500> know<00:02:59.620> looking<00:02:59.920> into<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.280> universe

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
for you know looking into the universe

eliminating turning awesome turning off

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.560 
eliminating turning awesome turning off
it<00:03:09.310> totally<00:03:09.610> ruins<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.000> experience<00:03:10.090> so

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
it totally ruins the experience so
