00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the movie doesn't follow the story is a

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.980 
the movie doesn't follow the story is a
separate<00:01:16.170> story<00:01:16.580> which<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:18.060> lot<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.600> people<00:01:18.689> do

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
separate story which a lot of people do

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.420 
separate story which a lot of people do
they<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.380> seem<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> only<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.189> now<00:01:20.400> because

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
they do seem to only do that now because

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.700 
they do seem to only do that now because
because<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.570> relief<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:21.990> much<00:01:22.170> earlier<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
because I relief so much earlier the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.039 
because I relief so much earlier the
terms<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.820> guess<00:01:24.360> they<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:24.659> want<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
terms so I guess they don't want to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.100 
terms so I guess they don't want to
