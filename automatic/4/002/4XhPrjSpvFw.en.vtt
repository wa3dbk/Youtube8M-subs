00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hi there, this video is a mini review 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.330
 logitech g27 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.340
 and came to me in such a box of 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.350
 online store 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:19.310
 steering for three months from the date of recording video 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:23.279
 I did not put it back in the box 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:31.289
 because what said i came to 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:37.020
 pedal box grew here box here 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:40.379
 it means from paperwork discs paper first 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.469
 information about the company logitech 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.070
 that the instructions are no further 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.070

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:59.359
 setup instructions from to the link 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:05.430
 central driver disk for steering 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:12.470
 dice game factor is the demo version so 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:16.470
 what especially do not rejoice brochure weave 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:21.259
 Calcutta stands for steering 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.180
 there are gaming chairs a cesspool it's a hat 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:28.650
 because if you click on the right yourself 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.229
 fly away though maybe i'm wrong so here 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.720
 such all with China chair will be able to complete 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:42.090
 topic yes it costs me dear also 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.810
 last again some information on 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.340
 Russian for some reason, all umishkom on

 left your review 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:09.349
 well and a bag of tones all end but it 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:12.870
 farther packs more revenue and back 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:25.790
 because the guarantee of labor is still 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:30.630
 indeed it so I think it is 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.040
 who will order the morning themselves or in 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.209
 online store or just where it 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.940
 would just be very happy to see 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.160

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.750
 steering wheel 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:48.590
 so the wheel itself means k 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.590
 indicators 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:58.410
 so check me buttons lapped 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.829
 paddle shifters 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.890
 so now where are they here the button then 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:09.359

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.459
 buttons it was all connected with 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.510
 petals directly so well buttons 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:22.829
 turns 900 degrees principle on this 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:27.930
 everyone today know now see what 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:37.290
 there with wires twisted by two 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:42.630
 such plastic screws mean here 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:46.650
 four wires go pedal powered 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.850
 gearbox itself steering wheel yusbi cable 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.910
 for now there are also mounts for 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:57.690
 bolts are not going to be strong nakinetsya 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.910
 knitting stand or back chair 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:05.630
 to put 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:07.460
 and pressing the rope buttons just like that 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:14.870
 on the gearbox 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:17.690
 so now at the moment passed from the holster 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:23.000
 now seem to be pressing will be together 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:28.700
 it's ok to rock with her mouth 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.890
 speed here and so depressed that 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.430
 enable reverse gear you need to press and 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.860
 In place of the 6th gear, the back is switched on 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.190
 broadcast 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.710
 I thought for a long time as a hold until I myself 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.960
 guessed that 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:50.090
 counter and store it is nothing 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:58.820
 further explained this pedal pedal 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:05.870
 metal mark on 1025 here is not like 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:08.420
 would be at a different distance means 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.950
 gas pedal plane is negotiable the most 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:17.680
 serious crime well, so mean that 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:23.330
 we are here, too, and mount 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:26.410
 cellulite in the eyes so crap what 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.770
 call in general which slows down 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:34.940
 pedal block on the carpet itself 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:37.669
