00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.160 

well<00:00:14.519> i<00:00:14.549> think<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:15.690> know<00:00:15.719> from<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.049> beginning

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
well i think you know from the beginning

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.439 
well i think you know from the beginning
of<00:00:16.529> spring<00:00:16.710> practice<00:00:17.340> until<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.300> know

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
of spring practice until the you know

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.540 
of spring practice until the you know
the<00:00:18.869> finale<00:00:19.619> where<00:00:19.920> we<00:00:20.010> had<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.160> spring<00:00:20.520> game

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
the finale where we had the spring game

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.570 
the finale where we had the spring game
on<00:00:20.910> our<00:00:20.939> 15th<00:00:21.420> practice<00:00:21.869> i<00:00:21.990> think<00:00:22.400> that<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
on our 15th practice i think that the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.689 
on our 15th practice i think that the
defense<00:00:23.939> progressed<00:00:24.750> along<00:00:25.019> about<00:00:25.859> normal

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
defense progressed along about normal

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.630 
defense progressed along about normal
about<00:00:26.939> how<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.830> progress<00:00:28.830> when<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.220> put<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.550> a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
about how you progress when you put in a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.179 
about how you progress when you put in a
new<00:00:29.760> defense<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.539> put<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.929> new<00:00:31.189> scheme

only do you have to to stop them or to
slow<00:01:16.890> them<00:01:17.009> down<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.460> also<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.970> to

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
slow them down but you also have to

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.749 
slow them down but you also have to
control<00:01:19.259> yourself<00:01:19.320> because<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.100> get

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
control yourself because you get

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.580 
control yourself because you get
exhausted<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:21.570> fatigued<00:01:21.960> which<00:01:22.259> which

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
exhausted you get fatigued which which

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.410 
exhausted you get fatigued which which
which<00:01:22.890> hurts<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.820> mentally<00:01:24.299> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
which hurts you you mentally and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.690 
which hurts you you mentally and
physically<00:01:24.840> when<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> play<00:01:25.320> defense<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
physically when you play defense so you

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.130 
physically when you play defense so you
have<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.090> realistic<00:01:27.479> when<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.900> set<00:01:28.110> goals

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
have to be realistic when you set goals

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.469 
have to be realistic when you set goals
I<00:01:28.590> don't<00:01:28.770> think<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.310> say<00:01:30.150> we're<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.420> to

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
I don't think you can say we're going to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.880 
I don't think you can say we're going to
shut<00:01:30.689> people<00:01:30.720> out<00:01:31.140> or<00:01:31.409> we're<00:01:31.530> going<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.680> hold

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
know that's a that's a generic answer

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.259

but but that's reality and if it like
like<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.569> said<00:04:15.750> before<00:04:15.840> if<00:04:16.139> it<00:04:16.260> means<00:04:16.500> it's<00:04:16.709> 17

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
like I said before if it means it's 17

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.190 
like I said before if it means it's 17
to<00:04:17.220> 16<00:04:17.519> that's<00:04:17.849> fine<00:04:18.030> if<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.389> means<00:04:18.599> it's<00:04:18.780> 31

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
to 16 that's fine if that means it's 31

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.690 
to 16 that's fine if that means it's 31
to<00:04:19.320> 30<00:04:19.530> that's<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.950> way<00:04:20.039> it<00:04:20.160> is<00:04:20.220> but<00:04:20.489> a

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
to 30 that's the way it is but a

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.610 
to 30 that's the way it is but a
successful<00:04:21.570> defense<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.109> one<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.500> gives

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
successful defense is one that gives

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.880 
successful defense is one that gives
