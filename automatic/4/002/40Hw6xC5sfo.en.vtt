00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.210
 fc emmen lost the top match against roda jc 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.849
 with two against three and a real winner 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.710
 it was the more than 6000 spectators could 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.390
 enjoy a wonderful game 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.850
 wherein fc emmen 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.170
 had earned a little more than an acid 2 3 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.369
 defeat 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.439
 confused referee 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.449
 wiedemeijer indicated a red and ramos 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.560
 from roda jc but fc emmen failed 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.060
 the final phase 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.890
 after a violation at Bergkamp one 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.850
 had to give a penalty but still had 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.309
 trainer joop gall 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.930
 enjoyed a wonderful topper I have 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.870
 enjoyed the day i enjoyed 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.770
 the sci emma game I enjoyed 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.230
 The fc emmen 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.210
 roda jc backs almost the entire game 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.300
 against the wall that puts a few 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.399
 moments was off 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.629
 yes those are the law of murphy 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.860
 they call it 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.870
 the goal just comes out of the air 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.430
 Falling to Koen Jansen impeccably 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.620
 inside shoots completely against the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.320
 ratio in one we were the only one 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.789
 team playing football and to make matters worse 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.110
 disaster even becomes 0 3 so whole 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.739
 hard to sell if people don't 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.720
 have seen 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.180
 but the second is accompanied by an and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.860
 a serious violation or a very serious one 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.580
 hints ball that is played by with the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.490
 arm 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.380
 for that too it is already a situation 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.740
 in which the referee whistles wiedemeijer 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.909
 for and violation on the you have to 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.990
 is not even hit at first and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.369
 he is already 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.900
 and I had wiedemeijer with his experience 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.570
 hoped he would notice all of that 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.020
 but the effort is good 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.930
 manipulated in this sense and that is his 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.640
 good right and it becomes 0 2 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.020
 in the second half everyone is at rest 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.189
 convinced that we are the one more 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.590
 to make a contest of it but that we 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.520
 don't lose and and then enjoy 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.770
 also from such a team that only with 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.290
 45 or on with six minutes extra time with 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.360
 put your back against the wall and yes then 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.460
 You get a carelessness there and there 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.710
 did i go to the 3 0 that 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.119
 bakkati on the movie is in pedo on that 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.310
 moment not 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.009
 and it made good use of it 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.750
 but of course he did too 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.350
 beautiful inside and out again 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.539
 fall 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.830
 so they have the second at frencken 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.720
 shot by aiming once 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.770
 target shot the 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.390
 if you evolve after wire then 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.520
 mean we had a very good one 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.440
 have played match in we are going it 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.540
 3rd we are going the two reed 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.820
 be remembered our penalty we have 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.800
 had a chance but also in the first 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.970
 half and forget where to name that 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.570
 become the two balls of the line 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.150
 achieved 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.440
 that we are the most threatening team in which 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.840
 they just left behind or have borrowed 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.150
 and responded to 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.920
 yes that's all that's beautiful 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.230
 competition and I still have that 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.180
 contain that say that have lost 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.850
 if you like you if you want to see the game 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.209
 you just play well we can create 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.800
 sania we did not finish mugsy and i said again 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.780
 new opportunities they have created 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.130
 but they make just three they 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.930
 have four sale pushed follow me 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.040
 do three that is also a quality 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.540
 also a quality and that is also the 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.459
 return of 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.020
 from a good team but like you 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.510
 creates as many opportunities as we do then 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.190
 I think we should win 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.540
 yes indeed it just isn't but 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.430
 mean it is it doesn't necessarily have one 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.630
 To be disappointment is to be like you 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.709
 also sees when playing football 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.570
 This we can just take with that 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.730
 next match school teacher clean 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.280
 for me the throne on positive 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.110
 I have known him for so long I also walk 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.090
 my whistle for a long time 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.489
 which I thick it compliments 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.650
 given as a semi-final play or that 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.840
 we lose through being in 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.950
 penalty and make but I also have the 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.440
 Give compliments before going well 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.540
 has closed in mono honest to it 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.920
 honestly half admit he didn't 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.330
 shovel forest today 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.070
 then you still miss something must be a game 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.510
 in the jupiler league fluid all the way 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.010
 to me is that it should but 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.209
 man must have enjoyed me or him 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.950
 ca n't keep up with a temple 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.330
 because he knows does a smooth link goes 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.100
 things go a little faster and there is premier league 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.930
 no no no i seemed like level 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.070
 for him was high 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.060
 we can't blame it on me 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.920
 mean we have to take good care of ourselves 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.970
 look like i think we got it right 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.260
 We just had to play football 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.330
 take 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.860
 yes i am now completely i state 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.670
 I slept on a couple is my now I feel 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.500
 nothing left 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.660
 and in the end it didn't matter if you did that 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.950
 I had seen cramps in both it looks 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.720
 is that was a joke and they don't let me 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.940
 such a match too 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.080
 308 no man left because he 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.630
 assignments from 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.070
 you produce everyone over from as 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.570

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.190
 minutes later actually because I had one 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.600
 hope see it as one or two minutes 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.900
 but it had just arrived 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.180
