00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.000
 practice it will allow you by 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.900
 example of making hems on 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.539
 childhood sweatshirts froze already done 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.110

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.260
 finish go 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.210
 or take your fabric so you fold down 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.210
 the part of the relay what do you want that 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.930
