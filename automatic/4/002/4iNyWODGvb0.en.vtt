you're like a championship being a
best-of<00:00:17.880> kind<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.390> thing<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.810> know<00:00:19.199> at<00:00:19.260> least

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
best-of kind of thing I know at least

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.260 
best-of kind of thing I know at least
that's<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> way<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.859> kind<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.279> digested<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.000> kind

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
that's the way I kind of digested I kind

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.970 
that's the way I kind of digested I kind
of<00:00:21.300> got<00:00:21.480> when<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.689> was<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.869> kid<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:22.800> only

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
of got when I was a kid but it's only

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.590 
of got when I was a kid but it's only
actually<00:00:23.279> one<00:00:23.460> level<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.029> know<00:00:24.150> very<00:00:24.330> similar

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
actually one level you know very similar

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.750 
actually one level you know very similar
to<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.930> Crash<00:00:25.140> Team<00:00:25.170> Racing<00:00:25.470> battles<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.550> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
to the Crash Team Racing battles and I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.290 
to the Crash Team Racing battles and I
guess<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.420> guy<00:00:27.599> chooses<00:00:28.019> his<00:00:28.849> his<00:00:29.849> location

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
guess the guy chooses his his location

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.690 
guess the guy chooses his his location
to<00:00:30.599> krunk's<00:00:31.019> homeland<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.949> suppose<00:00:32.340> would<00:00:32.640> be

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
to krunk's homeland I suppose would be

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.790 
to krunk's homeland I suppose would be
jungle<00:00:33.329> boogie<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.809> that's<00:00:34.500> an<00:00:34.649> interesting

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
jungle boogie and that's an interesting

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.209 
jungle boogie and that's an interesting
point<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.610> make<00:00:36.530> let's<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.770> get<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> boost

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
point to make let's just get the boost

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.770 
point to make let's just get the boost
word<00:00:39.710> yes<00:00:40.710> no<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.460> slight<00:00:41.910> boost

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
word yes no it's just a slight boost

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.299 
word yes no it's just a slight boost
yeah<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.170> guess<00:00:43.440> that's<00:00:43.620> an<00:00:43.710> interesting<00:00:44.070> point

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
yeah I guess that's an interesting point

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.889 
yeah I guess that's an interesting point
because<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.120> was<00:00:45.270> talking<00:00:45.600> about<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
because as I was talking about in the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.869 
because as I was talking about in the
last<00:00:46.110> part<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:46.950> didn't<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.399> finish<00:00:47.610> off

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
last part but didn't get to finish off

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.380 
last part but didn't get to finish off
you<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.260> seems<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:50.250> his<00:00:50.820> comments

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
you know it seems like his comments

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.040 
you know it seems like his comments
about<00:00:51.449> how<00:00:51.840> earth<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.410> actually<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.719> copy<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
about how earth is actually a copy of

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.020 
about how earth is actually a copy of
his<00:00:55.350> home<00:00:55.590> planet<00:00:55.770> would<00:00:56.520> suggest<00:00:56.730> that

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
his home planet would suggest that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.160 
his home planet would suggest that
everything<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.420> was<00:00:57.570> saying<00:00:57.690> before<00:00:57.930> about

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
everything I was saying before about

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.040 
everything I was saying before about
like<00:00:58.710> how<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.010> words<00:00:59.309> are<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> same<00:00:59.899> is<00:01:00.899> on

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
like how the words are the same is on

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.650 
like how the words are the same is on
purpose<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.680> guess<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:03.059> went<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
purpose so I guess if you went to the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.539 
purpose so I guess if you went to the
earth<00:01:03.870> version<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.070> would<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.400> like

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
earth version of this this would be like

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.399 
earth version of this this would be like
puppy<00:01:05.970> puppies<00:01:06.390> home<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> mean<00:01:07.229> like

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
puppy puppies home you know I mean like

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.880 
puppy puppies home you know I mean like
he<00:01:07.619> kind<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.920> mints<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.150> crash<00:01:09.890> one

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
he kind of mints as you see in crash one

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.679 
he kind of mints as you see in crash one
yeah<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.790> know<00:01:12.000> where<00:01:12.180> he<00:01:12.270> lives<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:12.659> that

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
yeah you know where he lives like that

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.359 
yeah you know where he lives like that
little<00:01:13.020> Hut<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.680> seems<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.159> little

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
little Hut it seems like this little

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.130 
little Hut it seems like this little
Hut's<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.330> they're<00:01:15.630> much<00:01:15.780> smaller

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
but I guess it's kind of similar

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.890 
but I guess it's kind of similar
obviously<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> Naumann<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.570> exact

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
obviously the Naumann to the exact

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.350 
obviously the Naumann to the exact
replicas<00:01:19.470> because<00:01:20.189> as<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.729> saw<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> tiny

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
replicas because as you saw a tiny

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.810 
replicas because as you saw a tiny
temple<00:01:22.020> reserve<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> was<00:01:23.130> different<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:23.729> it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
temple reserve that was different but it

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.429 
temple reserve that was different but it
kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.150> used<00:01:24.600> aspects<00:01:25.500> from<00:01:26.420> mystery

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
kind of used aspects from mystery

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.780

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
nitro making your second appearance I

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.330 
nitro making your second appearance I
wonder<00:02:14.690> it's<00:02:14.840> like<00:02:14.989> he<00:02:15.470> ever<00:02:15.709> hits<00:02:16.100> those

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
wonder it's like he ever hits those

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.890 
wonder it's like he ever hits those
things<00:02:16.640> like<00:02:16.850> when<00:02:17.090> you're<00:02:17.239> far<00:02:17.480> away<00:02:17.510> you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
things like when you're far away you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.720 
things like when you're far away you
know<00:02:18.049> like<00:02:18.140> when<00:02:18.470> you're<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:18.980> know<00:02:19.010> close<00:02:19.459> to

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
know like when you're you know close to

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.460 
know like when you're you know close to
him<00:02:19.850> here<00:02:20.090> he<00:02:20.209> is<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.450> much<00:02:20.720> higher<00:02:20.930> chance<00:02:21.080> of

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
him here he is a much higher chance of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.670 
him here he is a much higher chance of
you<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:22.280> hit<00:02:22.519> him<00:02:22.640> but<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:23.600> reckon<00:02:24.560> it's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
you you hit him but I reckon it's

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.590 
you you hit him but I reckon it's
possible<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.250> like<00:02:25.430> it's<00:02:25.760> been<00:02:25.910> like<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:26.360> far

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
possible that like it's been like so far

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.479 
possible that like it's been like so far
back<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.019> actually<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:27.590> hit<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:28.010> by

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
back that you actually just hit it by

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.370 
back that you actually just hit it by
accident<00:02:28.670> or<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.269> just<00:02:29.299> seems<00:02:29.959> like<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.230> would

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
accident or I just seems like that would

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.160 
accident or I just seems like that would
never<00:02:30.530> happen<00:02:30.799> but<00:02:31.180> let's<00:02:32.180> wrap<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.630> up<00:02:32.810> over
