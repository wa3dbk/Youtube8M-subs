talk about is keeping r end up on the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.979 
talk about is keeping r end up on the
target<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:00.739> my<00:01:01.040> opener<00:01:01.460> I<00:01:01.640> always<00:01:02.570> open<00:01:02.840> with

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
target and my opener I always open with

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.200 
target and my opener I always open with
a<00:01:03.170> rent<00:01:03.470> not<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:03.949> charge<00:01:04.280> just<00:01:04.699> rend<00:01:05.059> your

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
a rent not a charge just rend your

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.210 
a rent not a charge just rend your
target<00:01:05.630> it's<00:01:05.869> really<00:01:06.290> important<00:01:06.770> for<00:01:06.830> our<00:01:06.979> war

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
target it's really important for our war

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.390 
target it's really important for our war
as<00:01:07.369> a<00:01:07.400> gear<00:01:07.640> end<00:01:07.910> up<00:01:08.060> on<00:01:08.210> a<00:01:08.270> fresh<00:01:08.750> mage<00:01:09.400> because

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
as a gear end up on a fresh mage because

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.030 
as a gear end up on a fresh mage because
this<00:01:10.610> will<00:01:10.820> take<00:01:11.150> off<00:01:11.420> their<00:01:11.750> shield<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:12.890> when

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
this will take off their shield so when

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.859 
this will take off their shield so when
you<00:01:13.130> get<00:01:13.310> close<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:13.670> can<00:01:14.030> do<00:01:14.119> damage<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:14.540> learn

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
you get close you can do damage to learn

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.900 
you get close you can do damage to learn
i'm<00:01:15.080> going<00:01:15.290> to<00:01:15.350> show<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.890> video<00:01:16.040> that<00:01:16.220> shows<00:01:16.640> the

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
i'm going to show a video that shows the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.609 
i'm going to show a video that shows the
importance<00:01:17.479> of<00:01:17.630> keeping<00:01:17.869> wind<00:01:18.259> up<00:01:18.410> on<00:01:18.530> the

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
importance of keeping wind up on the

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:34.640 
importance of keeping wind up on the
target

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:02:28.880 

yes

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.930 

second<00:02:29.890> thing<00:02:30.040> that<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.310> wanted<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.700> is

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
second thing that you wanted to is

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.839 
second thing that you wanted to is
always<00:02:31.900> placed<00:02:32.319> on<00:02:32.590> when<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.489> majors<00:02:33.819> in

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
always placed on when the majors in

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.880 
always placed on when the majors in
melee<00:02:34.269> range<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.750> see<00:02:35.019> warriors<00:02:35.379> wasting

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
melee range I see warriors wasting

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.800 
melee range I see warriors wasting
bladestorm<00:02:36.400> on<00:02:36.730> nothing<00:02:37.090> just<00:02:37.330> breaking<00:02:37.780> the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
bladestorm on nothing just breaking the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.559 
bladestorm on nothing just breaking the
snares<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.640> that's<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.760> really<00:02:40.030> important

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
snares and that's a really important

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.750 
snares and that's a really important
cool<00:02:40.780> down<00:02:40.989> I<00:02:41.230> guess<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.190> first<00:02:42.370> meet<00:02:42.610> you

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
cool down I guess the first meet you

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.180 
cool down I guess the first meet you
however<00:02:43.299> if<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:44.080> mage<00:02:44.260> should<00:02:44.739> blink<00:02:44.980> away

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
however if the mage should blink away

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.330 
however if the mage should blink away
from<00:02:45.909> your<00:02:46.090> blade<00:02:46.269> storm<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:47.440> will<00:02:47.890> need<00:02:48.069> this

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
from your blade storm you will need this

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.229 
from your blade storm you will need this
macro<00:02:49.409> it's<00:02:50.409> in<00:02:50.620> order<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.099> stay<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.549> melee

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
macro it's in order to stay in melee

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.360 
macro it's in order to stay in melee
range<00:02:52.540> at<00:02:52.780> sea<00:02:53.079> whereas<00:02:53.590> make<00:02:53.799> is<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.010> hear<00:02:54.250> Oh

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
range at sea whereas make is to hear Oh

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.970 
range at sea whereas make is to hear Oh
bleep<00:02:54.700> mistake<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.239> call<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.780> even<00:02:56.379> do<00:02:56.860> it

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
bleep mistake I call it I even do it

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.649 
bleep mistake I call it I even do it
myself<00:02:57.129> some<00:02:57.579> time<00:02:57.760> because<00:02:57.819> that's<00:02:58.390> when<00:02:58.540> you

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
myself some time because that's when you

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.300 
myself some time because that's when you
get<00:02:58.810> too<00:02:58.989> cocky<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.560> just<00:02:59.769> use<00:03:00.280> a

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
get too cocky and you just use a

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.960 
get too cocky and you just use a
Berkeley<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:01.450> jump<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:02.379> them<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.709> if<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.819> do

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
Berkeley to jump to them and if you do

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.670 
Berkeley to jump to them and if you do
this<00:03:04.120> while<00:03:04.299> it's<00:03:04.510> moving<00:03:04.660> that's<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.379> ways<00:03:05.530> to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
this while it's moving that's a ways to

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.860 
this while it's moving that's a ways to
cool<00:03:05.859> them<00:03:06.040> because<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.519> will<00:03:06.670> get<00:03:06.870> either

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
cool them because you will get either

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.039 
cool them because you will get either
frozen<00:03:08.500> or<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.129> will<00:03:09.370> get<00:03:10.000> chill<00:03:10.359> effect<00:03:10.569> and

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
frozen or you will get chill effect and

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.599 
frozen or you will get chill effect and
then<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.410> will<00:03:11.530> be<00:03:11.709> slowed<00:03:11.980> against<00:03:12.370> is

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
then you will be slowed against is

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.119 
then you will be slowed against is
another<00:03:12.940> very<00:03:13.329> important<00:03:13.870> macro<00:03:14.409> against<00:03:14.980> me

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
another very important macro against me

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.910 
another very important macro against me
just<00:03:15.400> what<00:03:16.239> it<00:03:16.359> basically<00:03:16.480> does<00:03:16.750> in<00:03:17.170> one<00:03:17.650> click

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
just what it basically does in one click

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.920 
just what it basically does in one click
it<00:03:18.159> will<00:03:18.400> equip<00:03:18.700> my<00:03:18.879> shield<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.390> one<00:03:19.720> header

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
it will equip my shield and one header

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.740 
it will equip my shield and one header
and<00:03:20.170> then<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.920> second<00:03:21.400> click<00:03:21.700> expel<00:03:22.420> reflects

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
and then the second click expel reflects

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.740 
and then the second click expel reflects
so<00:03:23.109> we've<00:03:23.260> pressed<00:03:23.590> this<00:03:23.769> macro<00:03:24.209> twice<00:03:25.209> really

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
so we've pressed this macro twice really

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.050 
so we've pressed this macro twice really
quick<00:03:26.109> alright<00:03:26.980> guys<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:27.640> now<00:03:27.760> I'm<00:03:27.849> going<00:03:28.000> to
