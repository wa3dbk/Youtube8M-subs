what<00:02:56.549> you<00:02:56.730> want<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:57.209> think<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.629> British<00:02:58.019> system

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
what you want I think the British system

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.150 
what you want I think the British system
is<00:02:58.650> better<00:02:59.510> this<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.750> it's<00:03:01.470> still<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.799> choice

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
is better this is a it's still a choice

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.520 
is better this is a it's still a choice
it's<00:03:02.459> an<00:03:02.640> option<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.629> point<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.079> you<00:03:04.200> put<00:03:04.410> it

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
it's an option the point is you put it

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.690 
it's an option the point is you put it
after<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:05.010> hundred<00:03:05.579> after<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.970> say<00:03:06.150> hundreds

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
after the hundred after you say hundreds

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.940 
after the hundred after you say hundreds
henna<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.239> whole<00:03:09.420> point<00:03:09.780> here<00:03:09.989> okay

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
on the slide here you have to break down

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.490 
on the slide here you have to break down
numbers<00:03:14.790> okay<00:03:15.269> so<00:03:15.329> here<00:03:15.900> it's<00:03:16.019> breaking<00:03:16.470> down

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
numbers okay so here it's breaking down

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.910 
numbers okay so here it's breaking down
from<00:03:16.920> left<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.340> right<00:03:17.639> trillions<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:18.920> smaller

from left to right trillions to smaller
number<00:03:20.370> billions<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.329> millions<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.959> the

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
number billions to the millions to the

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.289 
number billions to the millions to the
thousands<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:23.069> ones<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.519> each<00:03:23.700> group<00:03:24.030> we

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
thousands to the ones in each group we

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.930 
thousands to the ones in each group we
have<00:03:24.480> hundreds<00:03:25.019> tens<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.709> ones<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.459> that's

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
have hundreds tens and ones and that's

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.199 
have hundreds tens and ones and that's
how<00:03:27.239> basically<00:03:27.989> you<00:03:28.139> read<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.500> number<00:03:28.950> and

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
how basically you read the number and

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.970 
how basically you read the number and
this<00:03:30.209> number<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.630> big<00:03:30.930> okay<00:03:31.380> but<00:03:31.680> we're<00:03:31.829> going

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
this number is big okay but we're going

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.339 
this number is big okay but we're going
to<00:03:32.069> read<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.459> much<00:03:32.849> easier<00:03:33.150> now<00:03:33.599> we're<00:03:34.230> going

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
to read it much easier now we're going

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.430 
to read it much easier now we're going
to<00:03:34.410> say<00:03:34.680> what<00:03:35.060> 700<00:03:36.060> because<00:03:36.450> we<00:03:37.109> have<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
to say what 700 because we have the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.370 
to say what 700 because we have the
hundreds<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:37.980> tenth<00:03:38.310> on<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.549> one<00:03:38.700> for

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
can see I didn't put the nests in any of

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.589 
can see I didn't put the nests in any of
these<00:03:58.560> numbers<00:03:58.889> that<00:03:58.919> I'm<00:03:59.160> saying<00:03:59.489> and<00:03:59.790> I<00:04:00.359> put

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
these numbers that I'm saying and I put

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.680 
these numbers that I'm saying and I put
the<00:04:00.720> end<00:04:01.160> right<00:04:02.160> after<00:04:02.519> I<00:04:02.549> say<00:04:02.910> anything<00:04:03.480> with

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
the end right after I say anything with

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.720 
the end right after I say anything with
a<00:04:03.720> hundred<00:04:04.139> but<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:04.799> is<00:04:04.980> basically<00:04:05.430> this

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
a hundred but this is basically this

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.539 
a hundred but this is basically this
chart<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.450> really<00:04:06.630> what<00:04:06.930> it's<00:04:07.109> all<00:04:07.260> about

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
chart is really what it's all about

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.839 
chart is really what it's all about
breaking<00:04:08.549> down<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.450> numbers<00:04:10.459> here<00:04:11.459> I'm<00:04:11.609> just

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
breaking down the numbers here I'm just

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.599 
breaking down the numbers here I'm just
continuing<00:04:12.239> just<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.340> increase<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.549> number

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
continuing just to increase that number

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.020 
continuing just to increase that number
that<00:04:15.060> we<00:04:15.269> began<00:04:16.200> with<00:04:16.530> I'm<00:04:17.130> in<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.430> thousands

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
that we began with I'm in the thousands

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.810 
that we began with I'm in the thousands
now<00:04:20.239> 2871<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:22.370> it's<00:04:23.370> increased<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:24.030> 52

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
now 2871 and it's increased to 52

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.880 
now 2871 and it's increased to 52
thousand<00:04:25.390> eight<00:04:25.570> hundred<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.290> seventy-one

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
thousand eight hundred and seventy-one

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.120 
thousand eight hundred and seventy-one
and<00:04:27.400> I'm<00:04:27.940> still<00:04:28.210> increasing<00:04:29.020> now<00:04:29.320> when<00:04:29.920> the

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
and I'm still increasing now when the

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.850 
and I'm still increasing now when the
hundred<00:04:30.520> thousands<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:31.750> four<00:04:32.200> hundred<00:04:32.710> and

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
hundred thousands so four hundred and

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.940 
hundred thousands so four hundred and
fifty<00:04:33.760> two<00:04:33.970> thousand<00:04:34.720> eight<00:04:34.990> hundred<00:04:35.590> and

fifty two thousand eight hundred and

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.700 
fifty two thousand eight hundred and
seventy-one<00:04:36.520> it's<00:04:37.480> just<00:04:37.750> an<00:04:37.930> increase<00:04:38.320> of<00:04:38.530> the

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
seventy-one it's just an increase of the

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.380 
seventy-one it's just an increase of the
original<00:04:39.460> number<00:04:41.190> which<00:04:42.190> was<00:04:42.370> 71<00:04:43.000> I<00:04:43.030> think

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
original number which was 71 I think

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.470 
original number which was 71 I think
yeah<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:44.430> again<00:04:45.430> here<00:04:45.700> I've<00:04:45.910> reached<00:04:46.240> the

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
yeah and again here I've reached the

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.200 
yeah and again here I've reached the
million<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.740> I'm<00:04:48.340> reminding<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:48.970> again

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
million and I'm reminding you again

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.420 
million and I'm reminding you again
don't<00:04:49.720> put<00:04:49.930> two<00:04:50.170> millions<00:04:50.620> or<00:04:50.800> three<00:04:51.010> millions

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
don't put two millions or three millions

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.720 
don't put two millions or three millions
and<00:04:51.640> just<00:04:51.790> keep<00:04:52.000> it<00:04:52.150> as<00:04:52.300> million<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.730> again

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
and just keep it as million and again

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.420 
and just keep it as million and again
it's<00:04:54.910> just<00:04:55.470> another<00:04:56.470> increase<00:04:57.010> of<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.400> number

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
it's just another increase of the number

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.820 
it's just another increase of the number
twenty<00:04:58.090> eight<00:04:58.120> million<00:04:58.720> four<00:04:59.170> hundred<00:04:59.200> and

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
twenty eight million four hundred and

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.130 
twenty eight million four hundred and
fifty<00:05:00.370> two<00:05:00.580> thousand<00:05:01.300> eight<00:05:01.540> hundred<00:05:01.840> and

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
fifty two thousand eight hundred and

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.550 
fifty two thousand eight hundred and
seventy<00:05:03.130> one<00:05:03.160> and<00:05:03.720> you<00:05:04.720> can<00:05:04.900> read<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.200> bottom

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
seventy one and you can read the bottom

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.490 
seventy one and you can read the bottom
one<00:05:05.710> on<00:05:05.740> your<00:05:06.070> own<00:05:06.310> if<00:05:06.640> you<00:05:06.820> like<00:05:06.850> and<00:05:07.500> then

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
one on your own if you like and then

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.590 
one on your own if you like and then
we're<00:05:08.740> going<00:05:08.950> to<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.670> one<00:05:10.150> of<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.390> last

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
we're going to the one of the last

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.010 
we're going to the one of the last
slides<00:05:10.780> and<00:05:11.520> that's<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.760> number<00:05:13.570> we've

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
slides and that's the number we've

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.210 
slides and that's the number we've
cheered<00:05:14.620> the<00:05:14.800> billions<00:05:15.630> okay<00:05:16.860> which<00:05:17.860> is<00:05:18.010> nine

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
cheered the billions okay which is nine

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.600 
cheered the billions okay which is nine
zeros<00:05:18.760> and<00:05:19.860> then<00:05:20.860> we've<00:05:21.190> reached<00:05:21.430> the

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
zeros and then we've reached the

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.510 
zeros and then we've reached the
trillion<00:05:22.210> which<00:05:22.510> is<00:05:22.720> twelve<00:05:23.110> zeros<00:05:23.740> and<00:05:24.010> thus

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
trillion which is twelve zeros and thus

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.510 
trillion which is twelve zeros and thus
the<00:05:24.730> original<00:05:24.820> number<00:05:25.630> I<00:05:25.660> began<00:05:26.230> with<00:05:26.560> okay

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
the original number I began with okay

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.120 
the original number I began with okay
fifty<00:05:28.180> three<00:05:28.510> trillion<00:05:30.180> 789<00:05:31.180> million<00:05:32.170> le<00:05:32.950> big

okay<00:05:45.580> now<00:05:45.790> you<00:05:45.850> know<00:05:46.120> my<00:05:47.110> salary<00:05:49.710> okay<00:05:50.710> and

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
okay now you know my salary okay and

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.680 
okay now you know my salary okay and
then<00:05:51.700> on<00:05:52.000> this<00:05:52.360> last<00:05:52.780> slide<00:05:53.050> here<00:05:53.770> is<00:05:54.690> that's

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
then on this last slide here is that's

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.350 
then on this last slide here is that's
the<00:05:55.840> number<00:05:56.170> that<00:05:56.200> we<00:05:56.520> began<00:05:57.520> with<00:05:57.580> that<00:05:58.180> we

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
the number that we began with that we

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.990 
the number that we began with that we
just<00:05:58.390> read<00:05:58.810> now<00:05:59.080> and<00:05:59.440> this<00:06:00.130> is<00:06:00.340> just<00:06:00.580> a<00:06:00.700> small

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
just read now and this is just a small

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.680 
just read now and this is just a small
thing<00:06:01.300> for<00:06:01.900> your<00:06:02.020> own<00:06:02.170> info<00:06:03.090> you<00:06:04.090> have<00:06:04.120> on<00:06:04.300> the

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
thing for your own info you have on the

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.460 
thing for your own info you have on the
left<00:06:05.110> side<00:06:05.950> how<00:06:06.310> many<00:06:06.490> zeros<00:06:07.170> the<00:06:08.170> middle

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
left side how many zeros the middle

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.130 
left side how many zeros the middle
column<00:06:08.920> is<00:06:09.100> how<00:06:09.370> the<00:06:09.430> Americans<00:06:10.240> say<00:06:10.600> it<00:06:10.810> and

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
column is how the Americans say it and

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.170 
column is how the Americans say it and
the<00:06:12.040> right<00:06:12.250> column<00:06:12.520> is<00:06:13.090> the<00:06:13.420> European<00:06:14.140> system

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
the right column is the European system

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.570 
the right column is the European system
which<00:06:16.180> might<00:06:16.540> be<00:06:17.290> a<00:06:17.320> bit<00:06:17.590> more<00:06:17.770> clear<00:06:18.100> I<00:06:18.280> think

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
which might be a bit more clear I think

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.230 
which might be a bit more clear I think
for<00:06:19.000> some<00:06:19.180> people<00:06:19.570> the<00:06:19.690> European<00:06:20.260> system

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
for some people the European system

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.760 
for some people the European system
that's<00:06:22.240> just<00:06:22.330> for<00:06:22.750> your<00:06:22.870> own<00:06:22.950> info<00:06:23.950> there<00:06:24.220> and

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
that's just for your own info there and

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.100 
that's just for your own info there and
of<00:06:26.770> course<00:06:27.070> it<00:06:27.730> goes<00:06:28.060> on<00:06:28.270> and<00:06:28.600> on<00:06:28.750> and<00:06:29.050> on

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
of course it goes on and on and on

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.180 
of course it goes on and on and on
because<00:06:29.380> numbers<00:06:29.980> are<00:06:30.750> until<00:06:31.750> infinity<00:06:32.190> but

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
because numbers are until infinity but

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.520 
because numbers are until infinity but
this<00:06:33.430> lesson<00:06:33.910> does<00:06:34.300> not<00:06:34.540> go<00:06:34.720> on<00:06:34.930> and<00:06:35.140> on<00:06:35.260> it's

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
this lesson does not go on and on it's

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.340 
this lesson does not go on and on it's
not<00:06:35.680> till<00:06:35.890> infinity<00:06:36.070> and<00:06:36.669> it's<00:06:36.850> actually<00:06:37.330> over

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
not till infinity and it's actually over

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.580 
not till infinity and it's actually over
and<00:06:38.440> I<00:06:39.100> just<00:06:39.520> also<00:06:39.700> made<00:06:40.630> things<00:06:41.200> a<00:06:41.350> bit<00:06:41.380> more

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
and I just also made things a bit more

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.760 
and I just also made things a bit more
clear<00:06:42.130> than<00:06:42.370> this<00:06:42.580> and<00:06:43.060> reading<00:06:43.990> numbers<00:06:44.440> or

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
clear than this and reading numbers or

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.580 
clear than this and reading numbers or
legacy<00:06:45.570> because<00:06:46.570> like<00:06:46.840> I<00:06:46.990> said<00:06:47.200> it's<00:06:47.380> a<00:06:47.440> bit

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
legacy because like I said it's a bit

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.130 
legacy because like I said it's a bit
confusing<00:06:47.740> for<00:06:48.220> some<00:06:48.580> people<00:06:48.610> just<00:06:49.600> break<00:06:49.930> it

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:50.140 
confusing for some people just break it

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.410 
confusing for some people just break it
down<00:06:50.170> okay<00:06:51.160> start<00:06:51.610> from<00:06:51.670> the<00:06:51.850> biggest<00:06:52.210> to<00:06:52.300> the

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.420 
down okay start from the biggest to the

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.220 
down okay start from the biggest to the
smallest<00:06:52.510> from<00:06:53.140> the<00:06:53.260> left<00:06:53.500> to<00:06:53.680> the<00:06:53.830> right<00:06:53.860> and

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
smallest from the left to the right and

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.590 
smallest from the left to the right and
don't<00:06:56.230> forget<00:06:56.500> the<00:06:56.680> few<00:06:57.030> two<00:06:58.030> points<00:06:58.420> that<00:06:58.570> I

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
don't forget the few two points that I

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.980 
don't forget the few two points that I
really<00:06:58.960> mentioned<00:06:59.440> in<00:06:59.590> this<00:06:59.800> which<00:07:00.070> is<00:07:00.250> that

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
really mentioned in this which is that

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.500 
really mentioned in this which is that
where<00:07:01.990> to<00:07:02.170> put<00:07:02.410> the<00:07:02.620> hand<00:07:02.860> and<00:07:03.370> not<00:07:04.120> to<00:07:04.300> say

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510 
where to put the hand and not to say
