was<00:01:16.330> that<00:01:16.630> truck<00:01:16.780> weighs<00:01:16.990> 3,500<00:01:17.770> 3,700<00:01:18.400> pounds

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
was that truck weighs 3,500 3,700 pounds

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.190 
was that truck weighs 3,500 3,700 pounds
and<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:18.909> flies<00:01:19.060> up<00:01:19.330> in<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.509> air<00:01:19.630> like<00:01:19.869> that<00:01:19.900> and

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
and it flies up in the air like that and

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.310 
and it flies up in the air like that and
catches<00:01:20.530> on<00:01:20.650> fire<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.130> yet<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.720> I<00:01:22.930> saw<00:01:23.140> how

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
catches on fire and yet and I saw how

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.690 
catches on fire and yet and I saw how
quickly<00:01:23.590> Miguel<00:01:23.950> polluter<00:01:24.280> had<00:01:24.430> put<00:01:24.580> the

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
quickly Miguel polluter had put the

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.160 
quickly Miguel polluter had put the
window<00:01:24.940> net<00:01:25.119> down<00:01:25.150> was<00:01:25.540> taking<00:01:25.869> his<00:01:25.960> helmet

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
window net down was taking his helmet

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.740 
window net down was taking his helmet
off<00:01:26.640> amazing<00:01:27.640> I<00:01:27.759> think<00:01:28.030> he<00:01:28.149> got<00:01:28.330> in<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.570> back

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
off amazing I think he got in the back

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.200 
off amazing I think he got in the back
of<00:01:28.780> Nelson<00:01:29.229> Piquet<00:01:29.380> Jr<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:30.130> when<00:01:30.550> it<00:01:30.670> did<00:01:30.940> when

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
of Nelson Piquet Jr and when it did when

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.300 
of Nelson Piquet Jr and when it did when
he<00:01:31.240> did<00:01:31.330> that<00:01:31.780> slowed<00:01:32.320> his<00:01:32.530> momentum<00:01:32.710> and

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
he did that slowed his momentum and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.160 
he did that slowed his momentum and
that's<00:01:33.460> I<00:01:33.580> think<00:01:33.789> James<00:01:34.060> butcher<00:01:34.479> got<00:01:34.869> into

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
that's I think James butcher got into

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.520 
that's I think James butcher got into
him

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
him

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.219 
him
watch<00:01:36.190> this<00:01:36.340> not<00:01:36.580> look<00:01:36.759> it's<00:01:37.270> hard<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.539> see<00:01:37.840> you

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
watch this not look it's hard to see you

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.380 
watch this not look it's hard to see you

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
see BK get a little bit sideways that's

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.090 
see BK get a little bit sideways that's
real<00:01:43.509> time<00:01:43.810> speed<00:01:44.200> right<00:01:44.470> there<00:01:44.500> but<00:01:44.979> I<00:01:45.039> don't
