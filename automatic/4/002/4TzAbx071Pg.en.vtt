00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
that make it much more difficult for him

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.789 
that make it much more difficult for him
to<00:01:45.000> find<00:01:45.329> monsters<00:01:45.840> willing<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.229> work<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:46.439> him

with<00:02:17.070> scaring<00:02:17.460> kids<00:02:17.640> even<00:02:18.360> if<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.630> for<00:02:18.870> a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
with scaring kids even if it is for a

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.430 
with scaring kids even if it is for a
good<00:02:19.050> reason

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
good reason

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.440 
good reason
even<00:02:19.860> if<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> kids<00:02:20.250> are<00:02:20.430> deadly<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:20.940> monsters

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
even if the kids are deadly to monsters

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.390 
even if the kids are deadly to monsters
that<00:02:21.810> may<00:02:21.990> not<00:02:22.110> necessarily<00:02:22.260> be<00:02:22.740> their<00:02:23.070> fault

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
that may not necessarily be their fault

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.120 
that may not necessarily be their fault
so<00:02:24.060> they<00:02:24.510> don't<00:02:24.690> really<00:02:25.050> deserve<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.650> this

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
so they don't really deserve this this

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.470 
so they don't really deserve this this
is<00:02:26.280> definitely<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.700> much<00:02:27.030> more<00:02:27.210> interesting

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
is definitely a much more interesting

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.390 
is definitely a much more interesting
relationship<00:02:28.200> than<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.710> one<00:02:28.890> between<00:02:29.100> Mike

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400

relationship than the one between Mike
and<00:02:29.430> Sulley<00:02:29.910> which<00:02:30.360> brings<00:02:30.630> me<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.080> one

being an undercover agent and the
factory<00:04:03.510> being<00:04:03.660> shut<00:04:03.870> down<00:04:03.900> it's<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:05.040> little

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
factory being shut down it's a little

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.760 
factory being shut down it's a little
unnecessarily<00:04:06.150> complicated<00:04:06.870> though<00:04:07.230> by<00:04:07.709> the

unnecessarily complicated though by the

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.680 
unnecessarily complicated though by the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
way maybe I'm missing something here but

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.390 
way maybe I'm missing something here but
why<00:04:09.870> do<00:04:09.930> they<00:04:10.200> shut<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.560> factory<00:04:10.680> down<00:04:11.010> right

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.080 
after the bad guys are taken away
I<00:04:13.080> gather<00:04:13.440> there<00:04:13.620> was<00:04:13.739> an<00:04:13.830> energy<00:04:14.220> crisis<00:04:14.640> but

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
I gather there was an energy crisis but

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.220 
I gather there was an energy crisis but
it<00:04:15.209> seems<00:04:15.420> almost<00:04:15.690> like<00:04:15.810> they're<00:04:15.989> shutting

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
it seems almost like they're shutting

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.990 
it seems almost like they're shutting
the<00:04:16.320> factory<00:04:16.560> down<00:04:16.680> because<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.459> evil<00:04:17.790> plan

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
the factory down because the evil plan

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.300 
the factory down because the evil plan
has<00:04:18.209> failed<00:04:18.419> was<00:04:19.169> Randall's<00:04:19.769> plan<00:04:20.040> with

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
has failed was Randall's plan with

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.860 
has failed was Randall's plan with
sucking<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.760> screams<00:04:21.030> out<00:04:21.209> of<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.359> kids<00:04:21.570> the

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
sucking the screams out of the kids the

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.719 
sucking the screams out of the kids the
only<00:04:22.200> thing<00:04:22.410> keeping<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.919> factory<00:04:23.310> alive<00:04:23.520> or

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
only thing keeping the factory alive or

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:24.170 
only thing keeping the factory alive or
something

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.640 
outtakes in a bug's life were really
creative<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.539> they<00:04:31.780> had<00:04:31.930> me<00:04:32.050> falling<00:04:32.440> down<00:04:32.470> on

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
creative and they had me falling down on

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.230 
creative and they had me falling down on
my<00:04:32.710> chair<00:04:32.949> with<00:04:33.099> laughter<00:04:33.340> in<00:04:33.580> Toy<00:04:33.759> Story<00:04:34.030> 2

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
my chair with laughter in Toy Story 2

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.150 
my chair with laughter in Toy Story 2
but<00:04:34.660> but<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.900> time<00:04:35.110> they<00:04:35.229> got<00:04:35.349> to<00:04:35.410> this<00:04:35.650> film<00:04:35.949> I

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
but but the time they got to this film I

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.950 
but but the time they got to this film I
kind<00:04:36.729> of<00:04:36.819> felt<00:04:37.030> like<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.270> novelty<00:04:37.660> had<00:04:37.750> worn

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
kind of felt like the novelty had worn

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.930 
kind of felt like the novelty had worn
off<00:04:38.110> I<00:04:38.319> also<00:04:38.530> didn't<00:04:38.919> like<00:04:38.949> the<00:04:39.160> musical<00:04:39.639> lated

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
off I also didn't like the musical lated

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.850 
off I also didn't like the musical lated
thankfully<00:04:40.599> though<00:04:40.720> this<00:04:40.960> was<00:04:41.199> the<00:04:41.440> last<00:04:41.620> of

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
thankfully though this was the last of

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.529 
thankfully though this was the last of
the<00:04:41.979> Pixar<00:04:42.340> films<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.729> have<00:04:42.910> outtakes

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
the Pixar films to have outtakes

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.809 
the Pixar films to have outtakes
so<00:04:44.020> overall<00:04:44.410> Monsters<00:04:44.889> Inc<00:04:45.099> had<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.460> lot<00:04:45.699> of

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
so overall Monsters Inc had a lot of

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.879 
so overall Monsters Inc had a lot of
potential<00:04:46.330> with<00:04:46.509> some<00:04:46.840> great<00:04:47.110> setups<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:47.770> a

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
potential with some great setups and a

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.040 
potential with some great setups and a
lot<00:04:48.039> of<00:04:48.190> creative<00:04:48.520> ideas<00:04:48.970> and<00:04:49.180> there<00:04:49.900> are<00:04:50.020> a

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
lot of creative ideas and there are a

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.689 
lot of creative ideas and there are a
lot<00:04:50.289> of<00:04:50.319> things<00:04:50.620> in<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:50.830> that<00:04:50.889> do<00:04:51.160> work

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
lot of things in it that do work

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.610 
lot of things in it that do work
I<00:04:51.729> like<00:04:52.090> Sully's<00:04:52.449> relationship<00:04:52.960> with<00:04:53.080> boo<00:04:53.259> the

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
I like Sully's relationship with boo the

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.350 
I like Sully's relationship with boo the
chase<00:04:53.919> scene<00:04:54.099> with<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.370> doors<00:04:54.610> is<00:04:54.789> great<00:04:55.120> and

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
chase scene with the doors is great and

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.659 
chase scene with the doors is great and
the<00:04:55.720> ending<00:04:55.990> was<00:04:56.110> very<00:04:56.139> satisfying<00:04:56.860> as<00:04:57.099> movies

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
the ending was very satisfying as movies

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.779 
the ending was very satisfying as movies
go<00:04:57.699> it<00:04:58.210> is<00:04:58.479> good<00:04:58.780> but<00:04:59.289> for<00:04:59.349> Pixar<00:04:59.889> I<00:05:00.159> just<00:05:00.580> don't

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
go it is good but for Pixar I just don't

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.309 
go it is good but for Pixar I just don't
feel<00:05:01.030> like<00:05:01.060> it<00:05:01.360> pushes<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.840> boundaries<00:05:02.199> of

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
feel like it pushes the boundaries of

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.620 
feel like it pushes the boundaries of
what<00:05:02.680> you<00:05:03.009> can<00:05:03.190> do<00:05:03.370> with<00:05:03.520> animation<00:05:04.030> in<00:05:04.180> the

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
what you can do with animation in the

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.180 
what you can do with animation in the
way<00:05:04.750> that<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:04.960> lot<00:05:05.020> of<00:05:05.199> their<00:05:05.440> films<00:05:05.710> do<00:05:05.919> it

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
way that a lot of their films do it

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.070 
way that a lot of their films do it
really<00:05:06.490> just<00:05:06.699> felt<00:05:06.970> like<00:05:07.120> a<00:05:07.180> standard<00:05:07.659> buddy

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
really just felt like a standard buddy

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.290 
really just felt like a standard buddy
comedy<00:05:08.560> slash<00:05:08.889> chase<00:05:09.310> flick<00:05:09.639> which<00:05:10.120> isn't

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
helped by the fact that I never really

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.379 
helped by the fact that I never really
feel<00:05:12.099> like<00:05:12.400> Mike<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:12.639> Sulley<00:05:13.030> were<00:05:13.210> best
