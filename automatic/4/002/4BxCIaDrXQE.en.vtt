are poking out in the back so long I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.810 
are poking out in the back so long I
don't<00:01:52.160> think<00:01:52.340> they're<00:01:52.430> supposed<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.670> be<00:01:52.790> that

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
don't think they're supposed to be that

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.290 
don't think they're supposed to be that
long<00:01:53.120> and<00:01:53.990> plus<00:01:54.229> my<00:01:54.260> god<00:01:54.910> there's<00:01:55.910> one<00:01:56.120> tooth

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
long and plus my god there's one tooth

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.090 
long and plus my god there's one tooth
that's<00:01:56.540> behind<00:01:56.870> all<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.140> other<00:01:57.170> teeth<00:01:57.500> back

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
that's behind all the other teeth back

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.640 
that's behind all the other teeth back
here<00:01:58.550> so<00:01:59.090> they<00:01:59.210> put<00:01:59.450> on<00:01:59.600> an<00:01:59.810> extra<00:02:00.229> they

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
here so they put on an extra they

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.570 
here so they put on an extra they
activated<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:02.320> what's<00:02:03.320> it<00:02:03.440> call<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:03.800> spring<00:02:04.190> I

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
activated a what's it call it a spring I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.830 
activated a what's it call it a spring I
think<00:02:04.970> that's<00:02:05.119> what<00:02:05.300> they<00:02:05.479> called<00:02:05.750> it

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
think that's what they called it

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.410 
think that's what they called it
activating<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:06.710> spring<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.580> basically<00:02:08.119> it's

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
activating a spring and basically it's

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.830 
activating a spring and basically it's
going<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.840> push<00:02:09.380> my<00:02:10.250> teeth<00:02:10.550> away<00:02:11.270> from<00:02:11.720> each

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
going to push my teeth away from each

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.930 
going to push my teeth away from each
other<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.620> they<00:02:12.770> have<00:02:12.980> room<00:02:13.220> for<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.550> teeth

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
other so they have room for this teeth

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.850 
other so they have room for this teeth
and<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.180> tooth<00:02:14.990> in<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.260> back<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.680> come

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
and the tooth in the back to come

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.030 
and the tooth in the back to come
forward<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:17.030> it's<00:02:17.570> gonna<00:02:17.690> hurt<00:02:18.020> really<00:02:18.470> or<00:02:18.950> no

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
forward and it's gonna hurt really or no

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.130 
forward and it's gonna hurt really or no
