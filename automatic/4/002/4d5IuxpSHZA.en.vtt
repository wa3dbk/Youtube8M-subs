this what I'm about to it has many
multiple<00:00:21.800> benefits<00:00:23.810> like<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.960> see<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
multiple benefits like you see in the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.300 
multiple benefits like you see in the
back<00:00:25.500> there<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.099> no<00:00:26.490> type<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:26.970> way<00:00:28.010> the<00:00:29.010> heat

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
back there is no type of way the heat

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.060 
back there is no type of way the heat
can<00:00:29.849> escape<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.480> engine<00:00:30.810> bay<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.800> when<00:00:32.040> I

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
can escape the engine bay so when I

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.170 
can escape the engine bay so when I
raise<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> back<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> hood<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.000> gonna

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
raise the back of the hood is gonna

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.930 
raise the back of the hood is gonna
allow<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.360> air<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.290> heat<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:35.460> escape<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
allow the air the heat to escape the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.790 
allow the air the heat to escape the
engine<00:00:36.239> bay<00:00:36.390> from<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> topics<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.649> just

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
engine bay from the topics that is just

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.290 
engine bay from the topics that is just

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
dealers and still latch on so the hood

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.800 
dealers and still latch on so the hood
