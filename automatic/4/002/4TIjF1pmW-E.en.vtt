00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
compression straps we they have two

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.390 
compression straps we they have two
functions<00:02:48.150> one<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.950> compress<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.190> bag<00:02:50.370> a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
functions one is to compress the bag a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.130 
functions one is to compress the bag a
little<00:02:50.610> bit<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.210> that<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.450> doesn't<00:02:51.780> take<00:02:51.930> up

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
little bit so that it doesn't take up

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.230 
little bit so that it doesn't take up
too<00:02:52.170> much<00:02:52.290> space<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:53.280> also<00:02:53.310> once<00:02:54.060> they're

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
too much space but also once they're

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.240 
too much space but also once they're
cinched<00:02:54.570> down<00:02:54.630> they'll<00:02:55.350> relieve<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.830> tension

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
cinched down they'll relieve the tension

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.490 
cinched down they'll relieve the tension
