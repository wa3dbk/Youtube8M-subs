one of our most popular ideas was make

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.749 
one of our most popular ideas was make
it<00:00:30.750> into<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> brewpub<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:32.460> started

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
it into a brewpub so we started

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.430 
it into a brewpub so we started
developing<00:00:32.880> concepts<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.780> see<00:00:33.989> what<00:00:34.290> this

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
developing concepts to see what this

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.110 
developing concepts to see what this
building<00:00:34.800> would<00:00:34.860> look<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.520> how<00:00:35.550> would

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
building would look like and how would

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.389 
building would look like and how would
fit<00:00:36.450> into<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.780> community<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:37.980> wanted<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
fit into the community we wanted the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.450 
fit into the community we wanted the
building<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.910> maintain<00:00:39.629> its<00:00:39.870> historic<00:00:40.590> nature

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
building to maintain its historic nature

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.090 
building to maintain its historic nature
but<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:41.969> also<00:00:42.120> wanted<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.600> be<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:43.110> lively<00:00:43.860> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
but we also wanted to be a lively and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.549 
but we also wanted to be a lively and
fun<00:00:44.129> place<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.640> come<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
fun place to come and to be a really a

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.670 
fun place to come and to be a really a
center<00:00:46.920> point<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.910> stapleton<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:49.530> we

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
center point and of stapleton so we

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.750 
center point and of stapleton so we
started<00:00:49.950> thinking<00:00:50.160> about<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.370> building<00:00:50.670> as

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
started thinking about this building as

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.470 
started thinking about this building as
two<00:00:51.030> chunks<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:52.199> was<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> tower<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
two chunks one was a tower and the

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.360 
two chunks one was a tower and the
observation<00:00:54.480> deck<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.289> other<00:00:55.469> chunk<00:00:56.070> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
observation deck and the other chunk of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.130 
observation deck and the other chunk of
the<00:00:56.460> building<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.629> base<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the building was the base of the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.830 
the building was the base of the
structure<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.800> three<00:00:59.280> stories<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.359> are<00:01:00.629> all

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
structure the three stories that are all

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.630 
structure the three stories that are all
measured<00:01:01.289> out<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.559> about<00:01:01.680> 6,000<00:01:02.460> square

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
measured out to be about 6,000 square

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.140 
measured out to be about 6,000 square
feet<00:01:02.820> each<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:04.040> after<00:01:05.040> viewing<00:01:05.549> each<00:01:05.880> one

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
feet each and after viewing each one

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.520 
feet each and after viewing each one
separately<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.869> kind<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.200> came<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.439> with

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
separately we kind of came up with

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.520 
separately we kind of came up with
concepts<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.369> each<00:01:08.729> each<00:01:09.540> area<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.260> what<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
concepts for each each area and what the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.320 
concepts for each each area and what the
building<00:01:10.770> would<00:01:10.830> look<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.880> let's<00:01:12.090> start

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
building would look like so let's start

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.020 
building would look like so let's start
at<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> top<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.049> building<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:14.580> key<00:01:14.760> part

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
at the top of the building the key part

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.670 
at the top of the building the key part
of<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.180> puzzle<00:01:15.420> was<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.900> figure<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.290> what<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
of this puzzle was to figure out what to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.620 
of this puzzle was to figure out what to
do<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> top<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.580> lot<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.240> people<00:01:18.479> have

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
do at the top a lot of people have

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.289 
do at the top a lot of people have
proposed<00:01:19.080> things<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.860> an<00:01:20.070> event<00:01:20.580> space<00:01:20.880> or<00:01:21.270> a

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
proposed things like an event space or a

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.539 
proposed things like an event space or a
place<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.600> get<00:01:21.689> married<00:01:21.750> or<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> religious

center there or have a restaurant on top
or<00:01:27.030> hotel<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.439> all<00:01:28.470> these<00:01:28.920> uses<00:01:29.400> are

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
or hotel but really all these uses are

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.090 
or hotel but really all these uses are
just<00:01:29.790> too<00:01:30.180> big<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.810> little<00:01:31.020> space<00:01:31.350> it's

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
just too big for this little space it's

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.030 
just too big for this little space it's
only<00:01:32.340> 415<00:01:33.299> square<00:01:33.630> feet<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.560> about<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
only 415 square feet which is about the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.399 
only 415 square feet which is about the
size<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.549> large<00:01:35.700> office<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.570> doesn't<00:01:37.290> give

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
size of a large office and doesn't give

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.620 
size of a large office and doesn't give
much<00:01:37.560> room<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.950> put<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.030> all<00:01:39.119> these<00:01:39.240> extra

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
much room to put in all these extra

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.830 
much room to put in all these extra
facilities<00:01:40.460> now<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.939> idea<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.479> came<00:01:42.630> up

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
facilities now the idea that I came up

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.380 
facilities now the idea that I came up
with<00:01:43.140> was<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.619> turn<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.100> into<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.399> 360<00:01:45.299> degree

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
with was to turn it into a 360 degree

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.749 
with was to turn it into a 360 degree
theater<00:01:46.020> here<00:01:46.770> you'd<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.040> room<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.610> about

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
theater here you'd have room for about

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.389 
theater here you'd have room for about
10<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.119> 15<00:01:48.390> people<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.200> when<00:01:49.890> they<00:01:49.979> enter<00:01:50.280> the

top<00:01:53.100> all<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.520> windows<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.200> then<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.350> would

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
top all the windows and then you would

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
top all the windows and then you would
be<00:01:55.500> blocked<00:01:55.920> out<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.399> eight<00:01:56.969> different

these<00:01:59.909> eight<00:02:00.090> projectors<00:02:00.600> would<00:02:00.780> then<00:02:00.899> start

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
these eight projectors would then start

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.139 
these eight projectors would then start
showing<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> history<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.040> Stapleton<00:02:02.640> from

when it opened back in 1929 to when it
closed<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.570> 1995<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:08.369> would<00:02:08.489> show<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
closed in 1995 it would show the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.360 
closed in 1995 it would show the
development<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.410> airport<00:02:11.009> when<00:02:11.190> it's

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
development of the airport when it's

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.230 
development of the airport when it's
just<00:02:11.550> one<00:02:11.700> runway<00:02:11.940> with<00:02:12.480> propeller

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
reigns back in the 1930s and they would

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.630 
reigns back in the 1930s and they would
show<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.720> jet<00:02:16.930> age<00:02:16.960> when<00:02:17.560> runways<00:02:18.430> were

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
show the jet age when runways were

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.370 
show the jet age when runways were
expanded<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.420> new<00:02:19.480> terminals<00:02:19.930> would<00:02:20.080> added

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
expanded and new terminals would added

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.290 
expanded and new terminals would added
and<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.950> would<00:02:21.040> also<00:02:21.190> show<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.490> demolition<00:02:22.210> of

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
and it would also show the demolition of

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.720 
and it would also show the demolition of
the<00:02:22.360> airport<00:02:22.960> in<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.590> 90s<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.400> and

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.820 
the airport in the 90s and and
eventually<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.570> would<00:02:25.660> show<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.230> development

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
eventually it would show the development

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.760 
eventually it would show the development
of<00:02:26.950> Stapleton<00:02:27.640> as<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.850> group<00:02:28.450> as<00:02:28.660> community<00:02:29.140> it

would<00:02:29.890> show<00:02:30.070> this<00:02:30.220> on<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.550> 3d<00:02:30.940> model<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.480> we

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
would show this on a 3d model and we

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.260 
would show this on a 3d model and we
really<00:02:32.200> need<00:02:32.380> for<00:02:32.620> kids<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.430> visitors<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:34.030> see

the tower now with today's ad a
standards<00:03:14.020> that<00:03:14.320> just<00:03:14.560> wouldn't<00:03:14.740> fly<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.360> we

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
standards that just wouldn't fly and we

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.540 
standards that just wouldn't fly and we
need<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.600> find<00:03:16.930> some<00:03:17.320> way<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.920> get<00:03:18.010> people<00:03:18.220> from

the lobby to the top now what I proposed

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.730 
the lobby to the top now what I proposed
was<00:03:21.550> making<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.060> new<00:03:22.270> elevator<00:03:22.690> shaft<00:03:23.020> this

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
was making a new elevator shaft this

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.830 
was making a new elevator shaft this
elevator<00:03:24.130> shaft<00:03:24.430> would<00:03:24.610> be<00:03:24.820> built<00:03:25.210> externally

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840

on to the west side of the tower and to

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.960 
on to the west side of the tower and to
help<00:03:28.900> mesh<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.350> old<00:03:29.530> with<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:29.980> new<00:03:30.010> what<00:03:30.850> we

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
help mesh the old with the new what we

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.430 
help mesh the old with the new what we
could<00:03:31.120> do<00:03:31.240> is<00:03:31.510> we<00:03:31.570> could<00:03:31.720> use<00:03:31.960> that<00:03:32.110> same

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
could do is we could use that same

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.500 
could do is we could use that same
aluminum<00:03:33.100> siding<00:03:33.400> that's<00:03:33.940> on<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.270> side<00:03:34.480> of

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
aluminum siding that's on the side of

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.240 
aluminum siding that's on the side of
the<00:03:34.720> tower<00:03:34.930> with<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.320> accent<00:03:35.680> piece<00:03:35.920> there

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
the tower with the accent piece there

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.360 
the tower with the accent piece there
and<00:03:36.510> then<00:03:37.510> mess<00:03:38.080> that<00:03:38.410> around<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:39.070> new

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
and then mess that around the new

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.420 
and then mess that around the new
elevator<00:03:39.790> shaft<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.780> disguise<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.950> make

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
elevator shaft to disguise it and make

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.220 
elevator shaft to disguise it and make
it<00:03:42.460> seem<00:03:42.880> like<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.360> was<00:03:43.630> always<00:03:43.870> there<00:03:44.110> in<00:03:44.170> the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
it seem like it was always there in the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.950 
it seem like it was always there in the
first<00:03:44.440> place<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.760> this<00:03:45.970> new<00:03:46.150> panoramic

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
first place so this new panoramic

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.870 
first place so this new panoramic
exterior<00:03:47.440> elevator<00:03:47.800> will<00:03:48.280> go<00:03:48.400> from<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.670> lobby

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
exterior elevator will go from the lobby

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.180 
exterior elevator will go from the lobby
all<00:03:49.240> the<00:03:49.720> way<00:03:49.780> up<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.080> 12th<00:03:50.290> floor<00:03:50.560> to

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
all the way up to the 12th floor to

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.670 
all the way up to the 12th floor to
connect<00:03:51.520> this<00:03:51.670> new<00:03:51.880> 360<00:03:52.720> degree<00:03:52.990> theater<00:03:53.380> and

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
connect this new 360 degree theater and

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.280 
connect this new 360 degree theater and
there<00:03:54.580> would<00:03:54.670> be<00:03:54.700> a<00:03:54.820> glass<00:03:55.330> facade<00:03:55.960> on<00:03:55.990> the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
there would be a glass facade on the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.410 
there would be a glass facade on the
west<00:03:56.470> side<00:03:56.560> so<00:03:57.040> as<00:03:57.070> you're<00:03:57.460> going<00:03:57.610> up<00:03:57.820> you're

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
west side so as you're going up you're

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.880 
west side so as you're going up you're
seeing<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.720> view<00:03:58.960> of<00:03:59.020> the<00:03:59.080> mountains<00:03:59.620> and

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
seeing the view of the mountains and

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.650 
seeing the view of the mountains and
you're<00:04:00.040> seeing<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.370> skylines<00:04:00.820> and<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.570> would

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
you're seeing the skylines and it would

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.000 
you're seeing the skylines and it would
just<00:04:01.750> be<00:04:02.020> a<00:04:02.320> fun<00:04:02.650> ride<00:04:02.860> in<00:04:03.130> itself<00:04:04.710> so<00:04:05.710> like<00:04:05.890> I

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
just be a fun ride in itself so like I

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.350 
just be a fun ride in itself so like I
said<00:04:06.070> earlier<00:04:06.220> this<00:04:06.550> building<00:04:07.120> should<00:04:07.300> be

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
said earlier this building should be

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.050 
said earlier this building should be
thought<00:04:07.570> about<00:04:07.600> in<00:04:07.840> two<00:04:08.320> main<00:04:08.740> chunks<00:04:09.340> now

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
thought about in two main chunks now

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.400 
thought about in two main chunks now
we've<00:04:10.240> already<00:04:10.390> thought<00:04:10.660> about<00:04:10.690> what<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:11.290> do

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
we've already thought about what to do

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.960 
we've already thought about what to do
with<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.650> tower<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:12.070> how<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.430> get<00:04:12.610> people<00:04:12.790> up

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
with the tower and how to get people up

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.310 
with the tower and how to get people up
to<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.150> tower<00:04:13.330> but<00:04:13.870> what<00:04:14.020> should<00:04:14.110> we<00:04:14.170> do<00:04:14.260> with

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
to the tower but what should we do with

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.289 
to the tower but what should we do with
the<00:04:14.440> rest<00:04:14.650> of<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.800> building<00:04:15.030> now<00:04:16.030> if<00:04:16.180> we<00:04:16.270> go

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
the rest of the building now if we go

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.479 
the rest of the building now if we go
along<00:04:16.600> with<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.810> brewpub<00:04:17.020> idea<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.739> propose

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
along with the brewpub idea I propose

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.949 
along with the brewpub idea I propose
that<00:04:18.520> we<00:04:18.880> turn<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.359> top<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.780> building

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
that we turn the top of the building

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.030 
that we turn the top of the building
into<00:04:20.290> a<00:04:20.920> beer<00:04:21.370> rooftop<00:04:22.000> garden<00:04:22.800> here<00:04:23.800> there'd

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
into a beer rooftop garden here there'd

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.670 
into a beer rooftop garden here there'd
be<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.250> lush<00:04:24.729> space<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.330> enjoy<00:04:25.540> some<00:04:25.960> brews

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
be a lush space to enjoy some brews

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.140 
be a lush space to enjoy some brews
you'll<00:04:26.860> be<00:04:26.979> able<00:04:27.070> to<00:04:27.250> see<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.729> view<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.060> the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
you'll be able to see the view of the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.330 
you'll be able to see the view of the
skyline<00:04:28.570> there<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.110> there<00:04:29.350> be<00:04:29.470> picnic<00:04:29.889> tables

skyline there and there be picnic tables

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.999 
skyline there and there be picnic tables
and<00:04:30.639> an<00:04:31.120> open-air<00:04:31.539> bar<00:04:31.780> up<00:04:31.960> there<00:04:32.169> and<00:04:32.410> there

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
and an open-air bar up there and there

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.640 
and an open-air bar up there and there
were<00:04:33.100> many<00:04:33.280> bushes<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.270> flowers<00:04:34.389> and<00:04:34.930> ivy<00:04:35.289> and

were many bushes and flowers and ivy and

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.499 
were many bushes and flowers and ivy and
all<00:04:35.830> things<00:04:36.009> like<00:04:36.220> that<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.669> make<00:04:37.090> it<00:04:37.240> into<00:04:37.479> a

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
all things like that to make it into a

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.110 
all things like that to make it into a
really<00:04:37.720> cool<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.229> unique<00:04:38.320> space<00:04:38.830> for<00:04:39.789> someone

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
really cool and unique space for someone

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.659 
really cool and unique space for someone
to<00:04:40.180> go<00:04:40.300> enjoy<00:04:40.509> drink<00:04:41.020> I<00:04:41.229> first<00:04:42.100> originally<00:04:42.550> got

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
to go enjoy drink I first originally got

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.550 
to go enjoy drink I first originally got
this<00:04:42.850> idea<00:04:43.030> when<00:04:43.750> I<00:04:43.840> was<00:04:43.870> viewing<00:04:44.199> the<00:04:44.350> tower

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
this idea when I was viewing the tower

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.830 
this idea when I was viewing the tower
and<00:04:44.860> you<00:04:44.889> can<00:04:45.460> actually<00:04:45.669> see<00:04:46.090> from<00:04:46.539> the<00:04:46.630> ground

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
and you can actually see from the ground

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.749 
and you can actually see from the ground
these<00:04:47.229> trees<00:04:47.889> growing<00:04:48.310> out<00:04:48.490> of<00:04:48.550> the

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
these trees growing out of the

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.870 
these trees growing out of the
insulation<00:04:49.479> of<00:04:49.509> the<00:04:50.080> roof<00:04:50.289> these<00:04:51.280> trees<00:04:51.639> don't

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
insulation of the roof these trees don't

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.249 
insulation of the roof these trees don't
know<00:04:51.940> how<00:04:52.090> they<00:04:52.210> got<00:04:52.240> there<00:04:52.630> but<00:04:52.810> now<00:04:52.990> they're

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
know how they got there but now they're

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.620 
know how they got there but now they're
growing<00:04:54.070> out<00:04:54.190> of<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.340> top<00:04:54.520> and<00:04:54.850> this<00:04:55.389> gave<00:04:55.600> me

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
growing out of the top and this gave me

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.719 
growing out of the top and this gave me
the<00:04:55.780> idea<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:56.080> make<00:04:56.380> this<00:04:56.650> rooftop<00:04:57.250> garden

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
the idea to make this rooftop garden

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.310 
the idea to make this rooftop garden
into<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.090> green<00:04:58.720> roof<00:05:00.599> so<00:05:01.599> on<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.840> second<00:05:02.199> and

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
into a green roof so on the second and

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.050 
into a green roof so on the second and
third<00:05:02.349> floor<00:05:02.800> this<00:05:03.160> would<00:05:03.340> be<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.580> main<00:05:03.759> area

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
third floor this would be the main area

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.540 
third floor this would be the main area
for<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.270> brewpub<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:05.620> third<00:05:06.070> floor<00:05:06.310> would<00:05:06.490> be

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
for the brewpub the third floor would be

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.490 
for the brewpub the third floor would be
changed<00:05:07.060> into<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.330> kind<00:05:07.630> of<00:05:07.690> a<00:05:07.780> game<00:05:07.960> room<00:05:08.259> with

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
changed into a kind of a game room with

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.909 
changed into a kind of a game room with
pool<00:05:08.740> tables<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:09.900> arcade<00:05:10.900> machines<00:05:11.380> maybe

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
pool tables and arcade machines maybe

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.120 
pool tables and arcade machines maybe
some<00:05:12.310> darts<00:05:13.000> or<00:05:13.419> shuffleboard<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.380> then<00:05:14.949> also

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
some darts or shuffleboard and then also
