particular<00:01:15.479> distortion<00:01:16.290> pedal<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.400> so

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
particular distortion pedal it's not so

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.490 
particular distortion pedal it's not so
much<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.030> distortion<00:01:18.600> that's<00:01:18.750> interesting

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
much the distortion that's interesting

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.280 
much the distortion that's interesting
it's<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.920> EQ<00:01:20.430> voicing<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.509> really<00:01:22.080> makes

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
it's the EQ voicing that really makes

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.889 
it's the EQ voicing that really makes
this<00:01:22.500> pedal<00:01:22.860> stand<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.420> now<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.750> look

interesting<00:01:47.819> about<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.360> pedal<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.770> you

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
interesting about this pedal is that you

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.859 
interesting about this pedal is that you
can<00:01:50.190> get<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.729> more<00:01:50.940> expressive<00:01:51.300> with<00:01:51.659> this

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
can get be more expressive with this

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.779 
can get be more expressive with this
pedal<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.350> use<00:01:52.560> an<00:01:52.770> expression<00:01:53.310> pedal<00:01:53.340> I

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
pedal if you use an expression pedal I

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.410 
pedal if you use an expression pedal I
have<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.179> roll<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.479> DB<00:01:54.990> 5<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.830> demonstrate<00:01:56.520> how

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
have a roll in DB 5 to demonstrate how

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.200 
have a roll in DB 5 to demonstrate how
you<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.720> sweep<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.710> variant<00:01:59.340> mass<00:01:59.580> control

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
you can sweep the variant mass control

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.180 
you can sweep the variant mass control
so<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:00.720> hear<00:02:00.899> all<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.259> range<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.799> EQ

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
so you can hear all the range of EQ

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.669 
so you can hear all the range of EQ
voicings<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.880> mid-range<00:02:03.869> sweep<00:02:04.289> that<00:02:04.470> this

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
voicings and mid-range sweep that this

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.190 
voicings and mid-range sweep that this
pedal<00:02:05.009> has<00:02:05.240> but<00:02:06.240> let's<00:02:06.450> go<00:02:06.600> through<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.990> main

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
pedal has but let's go through the main

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.460 
pedal has but let's go through the main
controls<00:02:07.739> of<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.849> TWh<00:02:09.599> or<00:02:09.750> scallion<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.800 
controls of this TWh or scallion and
show<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.709> how<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.099> works<00:02:11.340> first<00:02:11.730> thing<00:02:12.690> to

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
show you how it works first thing to

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.119 
show you how it works first thing to
keep<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.050> mind<00:02:13.200> about<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.530> Triskelion

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129

pedal through a clean amp and you can

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.950 
pedal through a clean amp and you can
listen<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.190> my<00:02:23.400> output<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:24.000> really<00:02:24.569> weak

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.390 

now<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.020> minute<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.500> turn<00:02:28.710> on<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:29.040> pedal

you're<00:02:29.820> going<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.000> hear<00:02:30.300> how<00:02:30.780> much<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.710> jump

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
you're going to hear how much of a jump

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.870 
you're going to hear how much of a jump
in<00:02:32.400> output<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.720> pedal<00:02:34.050> generates

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
in output that this pedal generates

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.380 
control pretty much acts as a level
control<00:02:46.320> but<00:02:46.950> what<00:02:47.070> happens<00:02:47.550> is<00:02:47.730> as<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.030> start

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
control but what happens is as I start

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.750 
control but what happens is as I start
to<00:02:48.570> turn<00:02:48.750> up<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.320> energy<00:02:49.710> control<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.280> starts

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
to turn up the energy control it starts

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.790 
to turn up the energy control it starts
to<00:02:50.880> get<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.300> little<00:02:51.540> more<00:02:51.900> distorted<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.710> a

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
to get a little more distorted and a

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.890 
to get a little more distorted and a
little<00:02:53.070> base<00:02:53.370> here<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:53.880> now<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.660> have<00:02:54.780> it

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
little base here so now that I have it

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.610 
little base here so now that I have it
on<00:02:56.030> let's<00:02:57.030> take<00:02:57.210> a<00:02:57.270> listen<00:02:57.510> as<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.200> start<00:02:58.470> to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
on let's take a listen as I start to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:10.370 
on let's take a listen as I start to
sweep<00:02:58.950> it<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:09.360> can<00:03:09.510> hear<00:03:09.660> how<00:03:09.750> bassy<00:03:10.050> that

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
sweep it you can hear how bassy that

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.780 
sweep it you can hear how bassy that
gets<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:13.170> here's<00:03:13.560> about<00:03:13.830> normal

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.559 

now<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.840> AmpliTube<00:03:19.590> control<00:03:20.569> amplitude

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
now the AmpliTube control amplitude

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.509 
now the AmpliTube control amplitude
control<00:03:22.349> I<00:03:22.379> should<00:03:22.650> say<00:03:23.390> starts<00:03:24.390> with<00:03:24.689> an<00:03:25.590> even

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
control I should say starts with an even

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.550 
control I should say starts with an even
level<00:03:26.730> when<00:03:27.120> dialed<00:03:27.599> all<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.959> way<00:03:28.049> back<00:03:28.290> and

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
level when dialed all the way back and

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.800 
level when dialed all the way back and
as<00:03:28.680> I'd<00:03:28.859> start<00:03:29.219> to<00:03:29.340> pull<00:03:29.579> it<00:03:29.730> in<00:03:29.879> it<00:03:30.239> starts<00:03:30.659> to

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
as I'd start to pull it in it starts to

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:48.099 
as I'd start to pull it in it starts to
get<00:03:30.959> distorted

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.750 

so<00:03:49.109> keep<00:03:49.290> in<00:03:49.409> mind<00:03:49.590> as<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.829> dial<00:03:50.099> in<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.400> all<00:03:50.609> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
so keep in mind as I dial in it all the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.520 
so keep in mind as I dial in it all the
way<00:03:50.849> up<00:03:50.879> it<00:03:51.180> gets<00:03:51.329> distorted<00:03:51.900> when<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.079> have<00:03:52.349> the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
way up it gets distorted when I have the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.429 
way up it gets distorted when I have the
engage<00:03:53.040> control<00:03:53.730> locked<00:03:54.269> in<00:03:54.569> so<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.170> adds

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
engage control locked in so that adds

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.229 
engage control locked in so that adds
the<00:03:55.859> distortion<00:03:56.519> that's<00:03:56.790> how<00:03:56.969> it<00:03:57.150> works

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
the distortion that's how it works

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.800 
the distortion that's how it works
otherwise<00:04:01.280> just<00:04:02.280> has<00:04:02.489> that<00:04:02.760> sound<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.569> I

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
otherwise just has that sound and I

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.140 
otherwise just has that sound and I
basically<00:04:04.349> am<00:04:04.560> using<00:04:04.889> the<00:04:05.280> variant<00:04:05.700> mass<00:04:05.909> is

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
basically am using the variant mass is

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.360 
basically am using the variant mass is
sort<00:04:06.329> of<00:04:06.359> an<00:04:06.510> eq<00:04:07.079> sweep<00:04:07.469> for<00:04:08.069> my<00:04:08.219> other

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
sort of an eq sweep for my other

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.770 
sort of an eq sweep for my other
distorted<00:04:09.000> sound<00:04:09.180> if<00:04:09.269> I'm<00:04:09.389> using<00:04:09.569> an

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
distorted sound if I'm using an

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.909 
distorted sound if I'm using an
overdrive<00:04:10.230> from<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.680> amp<00:04:11.689> also<00:04:12.829> there's<00:04:13.829> a

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
overdrive from the amp also there's a

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.009 
overdrive from the amp also there's a
boost<00:04:14.280> switch<00:04:14.609> which<00:04:14.909> adds<00:04:15.120> even<00:04:15.359> more<00:04:15.569> gain

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
boost switch which adds even more gain

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.500 
boost switch which adds even more gain
