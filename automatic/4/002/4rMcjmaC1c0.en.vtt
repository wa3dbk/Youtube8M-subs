workspace<00:01:57.250> but<00:01:57.640> hopefully<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.180> know<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:58.420> by

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
workspace but hopefully you know that by

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.300 
workspace but hopefully you know that by
now<00:01:59.340> but<00:02:00.340> yeah<00:02:00.520> okay<00:02:00.940> so<00:02:01.750> exporting<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:02.800> now<00:02:03.250> we

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
now but yeah okay so exporting so now we

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.640 
now but yeah okay so exporting so now we
can<00:02:03.520> see<00:02:03.730> there's<00:02:03.970> our<00:02:04.120> clip<00:02:04.390> queued<00:02:04.930> status

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
can see there's our clip queued status

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.100 
can see there's our clip queued status
queued<00:02:06.010> it's<00:02:06.910> ready<00:02:07.150> to<00:02:07.330> be<00:02:07.360> rendered<00:02:07.780> around

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
compression and then go to microsoft DV

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.449 
compression and then go to microsoft DV
you<00:02:43.240> know<00:02:43.330> people<00:02:43.720> are<00:02:43.959> going<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.230> go<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:45.040> want

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
you know people are going to go I want

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.040 
you know people are going to go I want
the<00:02:45.580> best<00:02:45.730> settings<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.420> then<00:02:46.450> set<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.930> no

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
compression but we're already working in

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.270 
compression but we're already working in
my<00:02:49.570> cliff<00:02:49.840> TV<00:02:50.140> so<00:02:50.500> we're<00:02:50.680> not<00:02:50.980> really

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
my cliff TV so we're not really

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.890 
my cliff TV so we're not really
compressing<00:02:51.910> we're<00:02:52.060> just<00:02:52.209> having<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
compressing we're just having it the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.870 
compressing we're just having it the
same<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:53.920> if<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.100> have<00:02:54.190> no<00:02:54.340> compression<00:02:54.700> you

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
same but if you have no compression you

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.160 
same but if you have no compression you
can<00:02:55.060> do<00:02:55.150> no<00:02:55.300> compression<00:02:55.630> do<00:02:55.840> what<00:02:55.959> everyone

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
can do no compression do what everyone

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.680 
can do no compression do what everyone
give<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:57.040> but<00:02:57.640> if<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:58.000> know<00:02:58.150> compression

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
give a but if you know compression

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.890 
give a but if you know compression
the<00:02:58.930> files<00:02:59.230> are<00:02:59.410> going<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.620> end<00:02:59.769> up<00:02:59.860> huge<00:03:00.340> and

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
the files are going to end up huge and

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.930 
the files are going to end up huge and
not<00:03:01.900> good<00:03:02.380> for<00:03:02.680> your<00:03:02.769> computer<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:03.459> if<00:03:03.760> you

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
not good for your computer so if you

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.340 
not good for your computer so if you
want<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.180> keep<00:03:04.269> them<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.630> same<00:03:04.660> quality

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
want to keep them the same quality

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.160 
want to keep them the same quality
you're<00:03:06.100> going<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.280> go<00:03:06.370> max<00:03:06.640> off<00:03:06.850> TV<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.870> click

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
you're going to go max off TV and click

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.070 
you're going to go max off TV and click
OK<00:03:08.530> we<00:03:08.980> get<00:03:09.130> max<00:03:09.340> off<00:03:09.519> TV<00:03:09.850> audio<00:03:10.780> output

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
OK we get max off TV audio output

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.170 
OK we get max off TV audio output
everything's<00:03:11.709> done<00:03:12.160> there<00:03:12.430> now<00:03:12.670> if<00:03:12.910> you're<00:03:13.150> in

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
everything's done there now if you're in

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.870 
everything's done there now if you're in
a<00:03:13.300> mac<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:13.870> i<00:03:14.769> guess<00:03:15.040> because<00:03:15.370> you<00:03:15.640> don't<00:03:15.820> use

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
a mac and i guess because you don't use

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.410 
a mac and i guess because you don't use
avi<00:03:16.269> use<00:03:16.540> mov<00:03:17.050> instead<00:03:17.739> of<00:03:17.800> api<00:03:18.100> so<00:03:18.910> yeah<00:03:19.120> you

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
avi use mov instead of api so yeah you

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.360 
avi use mov instead of api so yeah you
can<00:03:19.600> just<00:03:19.630> export<00:03:20.080> it<00:03:20.200> as<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.320> quicktime<00:03:20.590> just

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
can just export it as a quicktime just

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.460 
can just export it as a quicktime just
try<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.670> look<00:03:21.880> for<00:03:22.180> um<00:03:22.360> you<00:03:23.019> know<00:03:23.220> DV<00:03:24.220> mini<00:03:24.549> DV
