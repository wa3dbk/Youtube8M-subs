00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 so here's my follow one again 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.519
 from comics it-support your questions 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.860
 answered by me in videos in the last 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.269
 video was about how to install 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.119
 i have on my mac and how 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.140
 I activate the plug-in in the browser and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.180
 I could not look so fast 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.210
 there was already the instruction and the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.210
 ask how do I install the whole how 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.699
 i can from my mac 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.420
 remove for safety reasons without 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.280
 reste about staying on a x.de has 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.950
 a spectator i just take it 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.960
 night raw posted a great guide 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.329
 I would almost go after that too 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.329
 but first the light version 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.530
 yes I have here on my mac java 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.250
 installed as in the last video a mix 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.549
 shown it support and would like java for 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.680
 Programs for games do not use 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.060
 in the browser I installed like 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.690
 For example, safari to just that 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.930
 security aspect internet too 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.640
 I would like to take the java in 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.409
 my browser is disabled then go 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.680
 I first in my safari 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.630
 Settings and do not allow java here 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.810
 more and disable it here with the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.030
 hook in the rider safety java allow 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.160
 that is step 1 like that in yours 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.830
 browser goes for example google chrome 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.600
 or firefox please look for it or 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.179
 google shortly thereafter I now have it again 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.360
 also shown in the standard safari browser 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.819
 is the once in the system control 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.289
 and finds here under other years 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.869
 point of java 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.020
 then the java control panel 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.149
 open and take in rider safety 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.960
 you hook the java content in the browser 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.410
 activate 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.140
 get out of it with java control panel 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:05.039
 that already stopped on this side 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.310
 Do not use confirm that once and 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.869
 the java settings have been changed 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.430
 important is the browser must now 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.280
 to be restarted once 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.020
 Again, confirm with ok and that would be 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.849
 the light variant now i can have 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.950
 on my system use for programs 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.099
 for games but not exactly in the browser 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.760
 and in the next step i want to java 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.530
 completely uninstall completely uninstall 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.730
 I need that first 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.099
 Terminal I start on the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.080
 fastest about spotlight i give 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.849
 Just enter dates or start to 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.260
 Tap then come on, do that now 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.110
 a little bit bigger, that's good for her 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.830
 can see and let me first with the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.120
 command java version show what i have 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.110
 because I have installed 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.910
 mai initially suggested wearing it 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.890
 to use the valley routine 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.709
 that worked with an older one 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.690
 version of java still here in here 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.970
 this version as you currently 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.709
 download from oracle is offered 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.299
 it does not work anymore 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.250
 documented that the switch one 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.100
 stall no longer works 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.750
 Accordingly, now the directories 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.980
 be deleted manually you can do that 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.320
 make whole in the terminal 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.080
 I would like to share now on the 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.390
 enemies simply outsource to it 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.600
 I can show and understand 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.890
 say go now and then choose 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.010
 Computer and here I go to mine 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.180
 macintosh hd on my macintosh hd 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.180
 First and foremost I want the folder 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.810
 library and then on letter renns pence 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.600
 that is the content here from the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.959
 system settings other I would like 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.020
 now here it could delete it once 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.950
 of course with the right mouse button 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.410
 system settings remove java 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.350
 but I want to go over here 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.170
 go the finer and the whole there 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.320
 delete mark it so press command 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.680
 and backspace to delete or drag it 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.100
 alternatively confirm to the trash 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.510
 with my password and away it is and 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.640
 now it is no longer in 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.739
 the system settings that says synonymous 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.780
 oracle that we should do that 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.040
 we made the point i finished 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.080
 the driver window again to 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.600
 comprehensibility go rises again 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.570
 to computer and go back to the 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.960
 macintosh ag in the library folder and 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.169
 now in the internet plugins and there 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.400
 there is the java applet plugin 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.600
 plugin also delete that once 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.870
 confirm again with my password 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.860
 and so far says oracle that we 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.360
 should proceed 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.190
 that was not it yet i go 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.560
 Now back you know where I am 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.050
 am here on my macintosh hd and 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.979
 go to library again and choose now 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:54.390
 Here are the locations and lo and behold 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:57.210
 still a link to a java update so 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:01.530
 He would still continue after the update 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.600
 looking for the come out with me then 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.900
 close the folders again and look in 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.620
 the lounge siemens in the long tune 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.950
 I also find help from java 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.440
 I also delete tools once 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.750
 Who asks what the northern agency 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.060
 lounge siemens are to 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.560
 on a x.de and in my channel 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.660
 my own video where i go to the 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.520
 autostadt objects from the mc very 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.110
 to enter in detail 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.760
 That's what it was at this point 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.730
 his autostadt objects are his 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.610
 also cleaned me subordinate 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:38.010
 Immediately the folder java here on if we 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.260
 are in the folder library and look here 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.930
 you please once in the java virtual 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.180
 machine if there is something in it for me now 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.610
 not that please also extinguish what is there 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:52.560
 Inside is the folder view of the can 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:54.810
 stay there since 27 06 2013 is that 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.850
 with our installation from the previous one 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.130
 video to do nothing 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.490
 I 'm going back to mine 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.919
 macintosh ag to the folder system there 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:08.220
 in the folder library and also find 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.660
 here is a folder djerba there is 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.610
 but now not about what 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.520
 we have installed before but that 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.710
 is what apple comes with if you 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.020
 I want it installed 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.720
 completely delete it once in the video 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.750
 is it about the entire delete 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:29.550
 clique so on java java virtual 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:32.760
 machine and can do that 1.6.0 once 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.650
 delete the once back and who yourself 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.390
 Now complete this folder here 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.660
 can also erase it away 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:42.990
 main thing in the virtual machine 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.479
 I extinguished the jetcar in connection 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:49.140
 Please make it a restart 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:51.660
 so that the java helper tools and the java 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.160
 update test are no longer started 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.690
 Alternatively, you can also use the 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.160
 But if that's what I want now 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.260
 Do not show just make neustadt 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.270
 that 's the quickest and fastest way to go 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:04.680
 You can connect again in the terminal 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:07.500
 check with the command java - whether ob 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.990
 because you have installed java and 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.410
 you only see java runtime is 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.750
 installed and he wants that now 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.060
 install developer package that would like 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.460
 I do not have it now completely 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.180
 uninstalled completely deleted from the system 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.470
 and with that, the question is hopefully 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.520
 answered a small note for 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.330
 future ones 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.340
 Please write about a mix de kontakt 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.410
 and not via youtube 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.840
