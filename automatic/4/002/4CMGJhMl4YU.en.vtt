this<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.789> such<00:00:30.029> an<00:00:30.179> exciting<00:00:30.300> new<00:00:31.230> development

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
this is such an exciting new development

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.830 
this is such an exciting new development
by<00:00:31.949> Mia<00:00:32.189> Donna<00:00:32.430> diamond<00:00:32.820> hybrid<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
by Mia Donna diamond hybrid it's a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.690 
by Mia Donna diamond hybrid it's a
hybrid<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:34.590> we<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:35.130> take<00:00:35.309> diamond

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
hybrid so what we do is we take diamond

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.299 
hybrid so what we do is we take diamond
crystals<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.390> take<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:37.500> had<00:00:37.739> technology

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
crystals and we take it had technology

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.619 
crystals and we take it had technology
which<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.579> very<00:00:38.730> similar<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> cultured

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
which is very similar to the cultured

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.139 
which is very similar to the cultured
pearl<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.200> make<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.280> diamond<00:00:41.670> here's<00:00:42.000> an

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
pearl and make a diamond here's an

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.430 
pearl and make a diamond here's an
example<00:00:42.390> Cynthia's<00:00:42.870> wearing<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.230> right<00:00:43.260> now

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
example Cynthia's wearing one right now

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.260 
example Cynthia's wearing one right now
okay<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.940> diamond

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
okay so what is this it's a diamond

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.090 
okay so what is this it's a diamond
equivalent<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> cultured<00:00:46.200> pearl<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:46.860> what

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
equivalent to the cultured pearl so what

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.920 
equivalent to the cultured pearl so what
we<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.670> start<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> seed<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.840> it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
we do is we start with a seed but it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.260 
we do is we start with a seed but it
doesn't<00:00:49.770> come<00:00:49.890> from<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.129> mine<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.789> doesn't<00:00:51.180> have

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
doesn't come from a mine it doesn't have

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.389 
doesn't come from a mine it doesn't have
with<00:00:51.360> mine<00:00:51.539> exactly<00:00:52.140> actually<00:00:52.680> producing

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
with mine exactly actually producing

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.979 
with mine exactly actually producing
these<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.180> said<00:00:54.300> before<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
these and like I said before the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.720 
these and like I said before the
technology<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.500> very<00:00:55.559> similar<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.280> cultured

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
technology is very similar to a cultured

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.910 
technology is very similar to a cultured
pearls<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.300> take<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.510> seed<00:00:57.870> wrap<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.710> align

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
pearls so we take a seed wrap and align

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.830 
pearls so we take a seed wrap and align
that<00:00:59.100> seed<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.670> created<00:01:00.149> diamond<00:01:00.270> crystals

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that seed with created diamond crystals

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.810 
that seed with created diamond crystals
then<00:01:01.469> put<00:01:01.649> them<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.010> put<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.340> into<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> chamber

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
then put them it put it into a chamber

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.820 
then put them it put it into a chamber
of<00:01:03.000> heat<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.300> pressure<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.899> infuse<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
of heat and pressure and infuse the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.399 
of heat and pressure and infuse the
diamond<00:01:05.129> crystals<00:01:05.549> into<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.630> seat<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.049> are

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
diamond crystals into the seat and are

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.660 
diamond crystals into the seat and are
you<00:01:07.560> seeing<00:01:07.830> more<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.070> more<00:01:08.189> people<00:01:08.369> buy

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
you seeing more and more people buy

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.340 
you seeing more and more people buy
these<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:09.119> engagement<00:01:09.869> rings<00:01:09.990> obviously

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
these as engagement rings obviously

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.590

are definitely looking for a diamond

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.190 
are definitely looking for a diamond
alternative<00:01:15.600> okay<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:16.049> are<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
alternative okay so what are the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.270 
alternative okay so what are the
difference<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.159> three

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
difference is one of the three

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.620 
difference is one of the three
difference<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.729> off<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> top<00:01:18.090> from<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.450> ring

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
difference is off the top from this ring

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.440 
difference is off the top from this ring
in<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> real<00:01:18.930> diamond<00:01:19.110> ring<00:01:19.520> price<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.850> price<00:01:21.180> of

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
in a real diamond ring price a price of

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.910 
in a real diamond ring price a price of
it<00:01:21.600> did<00:01:21.900> come<00:01:22.080> early<00:01:22.380> Earth<00:01:22.500> there<00:01:22.710> are<00:01:22.770> one

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
it did come early Earth there are one

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.859 
it did come early Earth there are one
hundred<00:01:22.950> percent<00:01:23.310> conflict-free<00:01:24.180> ok<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
hundred percent conflict-free ok you
