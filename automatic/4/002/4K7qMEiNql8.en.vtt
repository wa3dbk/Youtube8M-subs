00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
way to do that I have found is to go on

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.349 
way to do that I have found is to go on
to<00:03:13.019> something<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.500> Google<00:03:13.829> Earth<00:03:14.180> type<00:03:15.180> in

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
to something like Google Earth type in

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.670 
to something like Google Earth type in
your<00:03:15.480> address<00:03:15.599> or<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.140> address<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.500> where

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.479 
very close to that and whenever I'm home
I<00:03:34.079> can<00:03:34.319> plug<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.650> in<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.010> watch<00:03:35.160> and

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
I can plug that in to the watch and

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.369 
I can plug that in to the watch and
that'll<00:03:36.090> be<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.239> good<00:03:36.480> starting<00:03:36.900> reference

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
that'll be a good starting reference

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.280 
that'll be a good starting reference

going<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.739> be<00:03:40.970> your<00:03:41.989> your<00:03:42.989> compass<00:03:43.410> what<00:03:43.949> I'm

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
going to be your your compass what I'm

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.460 
going to be your your compass what I'm
doing<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.519> I'm<00:03:44.609> actually<00:03:44.699> calibrating<00:03:45.480> it<00:03:45.629> it

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
doing is I'm actually calibrating it it

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.800 
doing is I'm actually calibrating it it
says<00:03:46.739> keep<00:03:46.919> level<00:03:47.310> rotate<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:48.449> all<00:03:48.660> I'm<00:03:48.780> doing

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
says keep level rotate so all I'm doing

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.809 
says keep level rotate so all I'm doing
is<00:03:49.169> holding<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.590> level<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:50.069> rotating<00:03:50.760> the
