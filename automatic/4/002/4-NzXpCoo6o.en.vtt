00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.500
 2 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.260
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.550
 show how to make a bun 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.440
 alfred style snails 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.690
 in fact what pleasing with the good voice 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.349
 that with death he wants to find 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.930
 the names at the moment around the video 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.400
 while usually the little time of 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.550
 reflection or to find the number of 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:32.130
 hairstyle so analytical we will start 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.570
 by rossi of a hair I guess 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.140
 since the time that the fact that it does 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.140
 how do i proceed 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.620
 look at it cut straight 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.520
 it's not beautiful that huh 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.520
 No but 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.540
 so it's gone 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.159
 so we just split a big section 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:16.330
 in three arms we come to pass the strand of 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:19.330
 right under the No. 2 the crest of Gaulle 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.340
 shogun 2 is then we go and it's up to 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.340
 edge of this liner 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.280
 so suddenly we will shoot the 13th at the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.280
 left to form the arc 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.240
 you dream 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.200
 and once we get to the bottom of the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.200
 head, take the a13 to the right 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.940
 2 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.940
 2 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.580
 hop that you finish by pulling it well 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.580
 right 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.730
 once we do not have the task as 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.730
 usually with a rubber band 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.970
 no 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.750
 so really to withdraw on the braid 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.750
 to give it volume 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.630
 and now go back to where the fighting 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.020
 we will hide the contents 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:31.480
 so this is a baba have you portrayed these 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:34.290
 flat like this suit you little 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.290
 ruined the braid 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.700
 dance on time 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.750
 2 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.180
 There you go 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.519
 so as usual can come from 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:22.410
 tasks and a few games on the front of the 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.660
 face of a most authentic side 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.360
 I do not want to be romantic 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.600
 I'm waiting to see if what I did and 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.290
 I do not play I raised heaps pictures 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.290
 to see what it was 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.080
 the 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.780
 as usual you can come from 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.400
 tasks and a few games before the 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.640
 face to give a side more 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.890
 romantic so there the most difficult 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.890
 it's to choose him side so I hesitate 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.419
 you here I am not sure who had 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.009
 been attached to the fact I tell myself that if he 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.240
 had the frank today no 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.500
 questions you ask so I had to 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.759
 turn show you what it gives 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.539
 but then I'll put some 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.539
 pictures as usual
