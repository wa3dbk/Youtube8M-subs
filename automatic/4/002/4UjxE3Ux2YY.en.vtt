compare<00:01:02.910> them<00:01:03.120> because<00:01:03.300> they're<00:01:03.840> varying<00:01:04.470> in

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
compare them because they're varying in

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.649 
compare them because they're varying in
genre<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> everything<00:01:05.700> about<00:01:06.180> them<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.540> quite

this one immediately

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.390 
this one immediately
maybe<00:01:39.990> sob<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.530> with<00:01:40.619> crows<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.070> quite<00:01:41.250> like

maybe sob to do with crows I quite like
birds<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.240> book<00:01:42.479> has<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.750> lot<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:42.960> crows

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.980 
birds and this book has a lot of crows
in<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.950> maybe<00:01:44.490> that's<00:01:44.759> why<00:01:44.939> second<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.780> my

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
in it so maybe that's why second on my

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.660 
in it so maybe that's why second on my
list<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.350> favorites<00:01:46.770> would<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.340> Harry

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670

will<00:01:53.790> narrow<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.119> down<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> one<00:01:54.659> book<00:01:54.869> that

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
will narrow it down to the one book that

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.600 
will narrow it down to the one book that
I<00:01:55.110> enjoyed<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.470> most<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.280> would<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.490> to

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
now I know who some of you may say but

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.500 
now I know who some of you may say but
that's<00:03:25.109> three<00:03:25.380> books<00:03:25.709> my<00:03:26.670> addition<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.269> one

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
that's three books my addition is one

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.370 
that's three books my addition is one
book<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:27.959> I'm<00:03:28.410> saying<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.430> one<00:03:29.609> book<00:03:29.850> also

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
book so I'm saying this is one book also

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.629 
book so I'm saying this is one book also
Tolkien<00:03:31.380> meant<00:03:31.590> for<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:31.889> be<00:03:32.100> one<00:03:32.250> book<00:03:32.430> in

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
Tolkien meant for it to be one book in

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.280 
Tolkien meant for it to be one book in
the<00:03:32.730> first<00:03:32.880> place<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:33.389> I'm<00:03:33.690> counting<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.230> as

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
the first place so I'm counting it as

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.750 
the first place so I'm counting it as
one<00:03:34.560> book<00:03:34.739> because<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.040> wouldn't<00:03:35.370> be<00:03:35.430> able<00:03:35.519> to

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
one book because I wouldn't be able to

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.150 
one book because I wouldn't be able to
choose<00:03:36.000> between<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:37.049> three<00:03:37.350> kind<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.769> parts

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
choose between the three kind of parts

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.559 
choose between the three kind of parts
of<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.459> story<00:03:38.850> pulls<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.299> along<00:03:39.389> so

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
of it story pulls you along so

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.530 
of it story pulls you along so
beautifully<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.859> description<00:03:41.549> everything

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540

the<00:03:42.690> characters<00:03:43.230> that<00:03:43.530> it's<00:03:43.829> so<00:03:44.280> built-in<00:03:45.120> so

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
the characters that it's so built-in so

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.530 
the characters that it's so built-in so
in-depth<00:03:46.380> like<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:47.190> amount<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.850> effort<00:03:48.090> that

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
in-depth like the amount of effort that

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.479 
in-depth like the amount of effort that
Tolkien<00:03:48.870> went<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.319> writing<00:03:49.709> these<00:03:50.040> stories

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
Tolkien went to writing these stories
