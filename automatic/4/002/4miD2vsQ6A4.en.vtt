break<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:05.600> need<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.689> change<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> gears<00:01:07.970> but<00:01:08.970> I

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
break I need to change the gears but I

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.260 
break I need to change the gears but I
need<00:01:11.159> somebody<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> come<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:11.850> with<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.119> good

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
need somebody to come up with a good

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.080 
need somebody to come up with a good
bracket<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.110> me<00:01:16.369> someone<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.430> shoemaker

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
bracket for me someone like shoemaker

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.840 
bracket for me someone like shoemaker
Matt<00:01:18.600> shoemaker<00:01:19.280> needs<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.400> come<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:20.820> a

Matt shoemaker needs to come up with a

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.280 
Matt shoemaker needs to come up with a
bracket<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.130> eliminate<00:01:24.200> having<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
bracket so we can eliminate having to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.520 
bracket so we can eliminate having to
drill<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.909> just<00:01:26.909> fold<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> right<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
drill and just fold it right to the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.469 
drill and just fold it right to the
motor<00:01:28.770> instead<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.549> using<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.850> stupid<00:01:30.090> motor

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
motor instead of using that stupid motor

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.310 
motor instead of using that stupid motor
bracket<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:31.460> airplanes<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.079> way<00:01:34.170> we

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
bracket for airplanes and that way we

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.280 
bracket for airplanes and that way we
can<00:01:34.470> bolt<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.799> into<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> original<00:01:35.280> slides<00:01:36.290> use

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
can bolt it into the original slides use

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.969 
can bolt it into the original slides use
the<00:01:37.439> right<00:01:37.619> gears<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> right<00:01:38.310> chain<00:01:39.979> but

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the right gears the right chain but

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.980 
the right gears the right chain but
there<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.240> works<00:01:42.829> it<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.990> unbelievably

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
there it is it works it is unbelievably

control<00:03:04.310> it's<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.370> 150<00:03:05.940> amp<00:03:06.359> turbojet<00:03:07.079> off<00:03:07.260> the

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.970 
control it's a 150 amp turbojet off the
EBA<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.750> I'd<00:03:09.750> probably<00:03:09.900> buy<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.230> 200<00:03:10.799> if<00:03:10.889> I

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
EBA and I'd probably buy the 200 if I

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.900 
EBA and I'd probably buy the 200 if I
did<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.250> again<00:03:12.139> but<00:03:13.139> I've<00:03:13.440> wired<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.130> fan<00:03:14.579> to

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
did it again but I've wired up a fan to

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.770 
did it again but I've wired up a fan to
it<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.389> it<00:03:15.510> gets<00:03:16.340> somewhat<00:03:17.340> cooled<00:03:17.639> off<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.359> 24

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
it so it gets somewhat cooled off to 24

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:26.210 
it so it gets somewhat cooled off to 24
volts<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:22.400> 5k<00:03:23.400> ohm<00:03:23.880> potentiometer<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:26.069> the

volts the 5k ohm potentiometer to the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.240 
volts the 5k ohm potentiometer to the
throttle<00:03:26.669> I<00:03:26.900> added<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:28.109> 1.5<00:03:29.099> km<00:03:30.079> to<00:03:31.079> it<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:32.069> make

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
throttle I added a 1.5 km to it to make

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.750 
throttle I added a 1.5 km to it to make
the<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:34.260> make<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.620> low<00:03:35.599> ohms<00:03:38.510> 1.5<00:03:39.510> k<00:03:39.750> minimum

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
the to make the low ohms 1.5 k minimum

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.020 
the to make the low ohms 1.5 k minimum
it's<00:03:41.760> probably<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:43.430> 1580<00:03:44.430> or<00:03:44.639> something

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
it's probably like 1580 or something

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.080 
it's probably like 1580 or something
right<00:03:45.209> now<00:03:45.739> but<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:47.040> speed<00:03:47.340> control<00:03:47.669> seems<00:03:47.910> to

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
right now but the speed control seems to

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.140 
right now but the speed control seems to
like<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.480> better<00:03:49.250> it<00:03:50.250> gets<00:03:50.549> it<00:03:50.700> closer<00:03:51.000> to

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
like that better it gets it closer to

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.960 
like that better it gets it closer to
that<00:03:51.450> minimum<00:03:51.959> in<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.650> middle<00:03:52.919> so<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.609> sets

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
that minimum in the middle so it sets

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.760 
that minimum in the middle so it sets
perfect

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
how to do it on YouTube he had a 3k ohm

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.750 
how to do it on YouTube he had a 3k ohm
potentiometer<00:05:31.800> but<00:05:32.800> he<00:05:32.950> wasn't<00:05:33.280> using<00:05:33.490> his

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
potentiometer but he wasn't using his

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.110

for<00:05:34.090> a<00:05:34.120> throttle<00:05:34.710> for<00:05:35.710> like<00:05:35.830> a<00:05:35.860> scooter<00:05:36.340> so<00:05:36.370> we

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
for a throttle for like a scooter so we

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.140 
for a throttle for like a scooter so we
have<00:05:37.330> throttles<00:05:37.810> at<00:05:37.960> 5<00:05:38.140> K<00:05:38.410> ohms<00:05:38.820> you<00:05:39.820> can<00:05:40.000> buy<00:05:40.120> a

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
have throttles at 5 K ohms you can buy a

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.420 
have throttles at 5 K ohms you can buy a
Magura<00:05:40.570> actually<00:05:41.140> I'm<00:05:41.290> in<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.860> process<00:05:42.070> of

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
buying am a guru a twist throttle

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.810 
buying am a guru a twist throttle
because<00:05:44.920> that<00:05:45.310> it's<00:05:45.580> a<00:05:45.670> little<00:05:45.850> bit<00:05:46.000> too<00:05:46.270> gaudy

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
because that it's a little bit too gaudy

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.010 
because that it's a little bit too gaudy
don't<00:05:48.820> they<00:05:48.970> don't<00:05:49.120> look<00:05:49.360> good<00:05:49.540> at<00:05:49.600> all<00:05:49.810> up

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
don't they don't look good at all up

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.550 
don't they don't look good at all up
there<00:05:51.390> but<00:05:52.390> that's<00:05:53.020> it<00:05:53.260> that's<00:05:53.470> my<00:05:53.590> he<00:05:53.800> tip
