a<00:00:43.890> lot<00:00:44.100> Apple<00:00:44.600> anyway<00:00:45.600> most<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:46.770> fixed

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
a lot Apple anyway most of it was fixed

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.950 
a lot Apple anyway most of it was fixed
when<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.820> servers<00:00:48.149> started<00:00:48.539> getting<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
when the servers started getting a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.250 
when the servers started getting a
little<00:00:49.140> bit<00:00:49.440> less<00:00:49.860> congested<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.760> also<00:00:51.690> noticed

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
little bit less congested I also noticed

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.500 
little bit less congested I also noticed
that<00:00:52.500> when<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.010> try<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.730> ours<00:00:54.030> it

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
that when we try to do it on ours it

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.400 
that when we try to do it on ours it
helps<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.289> open<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.680> firewall<00:00:56.190> now<00:00:57.030> long

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
helps if we open the firewall now long

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.110 
helps if we open the firewall now long

Iowa splat came out was that there were

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.700 
Iowa splat came out was that there were
a<00:01:19.560> lot<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:19.979> updates<00:01:20.960> period<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.259> Apple

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
a lot of updates period that Apple

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.859 
a lot of updates period that Apple
wanted<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> install<00:01:23.369> your<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.090> computer<00:01:24.570> or<00:01:24.750> on

wanted to install your on computer or on
your<00:01:24.900> Mac<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:26.390> we<00:01:27.390> tried<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.080> take<00:01:28.650> out<00:01:28.860> some

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
your Mac and we tried to take out some

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.830 
your Mac and we tried to take out some
of<00:01:29.310> those<00:01:29.369> updates<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.509> don't<00:01:30.630> need

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
of those updates you know we don't need

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.090 
of those updates you know we don't need
that<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.200> don't<00:01:31.290> need<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:31.799> don't<00:01:31.890> leave

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
that we don't need that we don't leave

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.830 
that we don't need that we don't leave
that<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:32.700> guess<00:01:32.880> what<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.450> wouldn't

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that and then guess what it wouldn't

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.080 
that and then guess what it wouldn't
install<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.040> had<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.520> through<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.850> the

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.070 
on the right hand side
the<00:03:55.470> slider<00:03:55.800> where<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.160> unlock<00:03:56.520> and<00:03:56.930> that<00:03:57.930> is

the slider where you unlock and that is

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.560 
the slider where you unlock and that is
