obviously the blue represents the
transfer<00:00:37.020> coping<00:00:37.530> okay<00:00:38.309> we're<00:00:38.520> looking<00:00:38.760> at

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
transfer coping okay we're looking at

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.720 
transfer coping okay we're looking at
the<00:00:39.030> underside<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:39.899> if<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.410> notice<00:00:40.800> you're

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the underside but if you notice you're

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.060 
the underside but if you notice you're
going<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> very<00:00:42.360> very<00:00:42.719> nice<00:00:43.110> smooth

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
going to see a very very nice smooth

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.740 
going to see a very very nice smooth
surface<00:00:45.200> that<00:00:46.200> will<00:00:47.030> give<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.239> laboratory

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
surface that will give the laboratory

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.950 
surface that will give the laboratory
technician<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.860> necessary<00:00:50.550> space<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.539> with

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
technician the necessary space and with

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.400 
technician the necessary space and with
no<00:00:52.289> undercuts<00:00:52.800> or<00:00:53.070> tissue<00:00:53.489> collapse<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:55.079> all

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
no undercuts or tissue collapse so all

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.430 
no undercuts or tissue collapse so all
that<00:00:55.440> will<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:56.070> transferred<00:00:56.760> directly<00:00:57.320> to<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
that will be transferred directly to the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.939 
that will be transferred directly to the
model<00:00:58.829> okay<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.930> think<00:01:01.170> what's<00:01:01.410> hanging<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
model okay and I think what's hanging a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.609 
model okay and I think what's hanging a
lot<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.340> dentist<00:01:02.670> up<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.210> trying<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.170> get<00:01:04.350> this

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
lot of dentist up is trying to get this

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.810 
lot of dentist up is trying to get this
tissue<00:01:06.740> replicated<00:01:07.740> from<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.189> bone<00:01:08.430> level

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
tissue replicated from the bone level

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.130 
tissue replicated from the bone level
implant<00:01:09.770> cases<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.250> getting<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> transferred

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
implant cases and getting it transferred

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.130 
implant cases and getting it transferred
identically<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.520> stone<00:01:14.909> model<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.509> then

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
identically to the stone model and then

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.440 
identically to the stone model and then
back<00:01:16.439> with<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.950> custom<00:01:17.640> abutments<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.330> are

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
back with the custom abutments that are

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.109 
back with the custom abutments that are
made<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.990> I'm<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> try<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.250> show<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.729> in

made so I'm going to try to show you in
the<00:01:21.210> next<00:01:21.450> segment<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:22.490> what<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:25.130> what<00:01:26.130> this

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the next segment of what the what this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.850 
the next segment of what the what this
all<00:01:26.549> looks<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.750> model<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.619> can

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
all looks like on the model so you can

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.600 
all looks like on the model so you can
see<00:01:29.100> how<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.400> make<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.820> abutments<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.610> crystal

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
see how we make the abutments so crystal

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.010 
see how we make the abutments so crystal
clear<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.509> perfect<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:36.180> trying<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.840> can

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
clear and perfect for the trying you can

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.969 
clear and perfect for the trying you can
see<00:01:37.890> how<00:01:38.280> much<00:01:38.460> time<00:01:38.790> we're<00:01:39.060> actually<00:01:39.210> saving

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
see how much time we're actually saving

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.870 
see how much time we're actually saving
during<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.159> technique<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:43.430> you<00:01:44.430> know<00:01:44.549> time

these are made right in my office I have

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.209 
these are made right in my office I have
a<00:02:00.899> special<00:02:01.469> little<00:02:01.759> jig<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.600> use<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.409> to

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
a special little jig that I use to to

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.969 
a special little jig that I use to to
replicate<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.329> tissue<00:02:06.659> area<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.710> we

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
replicate this tissue area so that we

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.059 
replicate this tissue area so that we
get<00:02:08.129> uniformity<00:02:09.140> coming<00:02:10.140> from<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.470> mouth<00:02:10.649> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
get uniformity coming from the mouth to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.870 
get uniformity coming from the mouth to
the<00:02:11.280> lab<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.390> impact

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
the lab and impact

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.680 
the lab and impact
from<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.120> lab<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.570> us<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:15.390> that's<00:02:16.390> about<00:02:16.540> it

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
from the lab to us so that's about it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.200 
from the lab to us so that's about it
I'm<00:02:16.990> ready<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.470> put<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.550> analog<00:02:18.910> so

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
I'm ready to put in the the analog so

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.450 
I'm ready to put in the the analog so
I'll<00:02:19.300> going<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.510> go<00:02:19.630> ahead<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.840> do<00:02:20.020> that

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
I'll going to go ahead and do that

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.100 
I'll going to go ahead and do that
that's<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.580> simple<00:02:21.910> thing<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.120> do<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.540> we<00:02:22.870> don't

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
that's a simple thing to do I we don't
