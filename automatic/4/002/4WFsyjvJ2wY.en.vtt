00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.710
 in this video we are going to see the 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.470
 representation of plans in the system 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.730
 of brico we will see a classification of 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.410
 types of planes according to their characteristic 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.540
 and we will see a bit the nomenclature that 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.420
 we are going to use the videos in the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.490
 we have come using in the videos 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.670
 previous and the one that we are going to use in 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.920
 all the videos that come on 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.539
 as for the representation in system 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.970
 10 rich 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.540
 a plane usually goes to 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.170
 represent traces by their traces 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.969
 are the intersections of the plane that 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.360
 we have represented the trico system 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.550
 with the pre-distant planes 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.340
 Usually when we have a plane 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.180
 this is going to have some intersections or 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.320
 cuts with one or two of the pre plans 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.200
 distant 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.130
 that's what we call traces 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.650
 a plane can also be defined 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.870
 for another series of elements as they would be 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.710
 two straight lines that cut two straight lines 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.690
 parallel three unaligned points or one 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.740
 straight and a point that does not belong to 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.000
 this straight this is something that we will see in 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.190
 the following videos we will measure 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.470
 working with plans now we are going to 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.290
 focus on the issue of 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.660
 representation of planes by the traces 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.360
 without plane as in this case a plane 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.450
 oblique has intersections both in the 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.650
 horizontal plane as the vertical plane 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.180
 these intersections are going to be the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.100
 representation as straight lines in both 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.220
 forecasts in such a way that we have 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.130
 a pressure for the vertical trace that 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.170
 it would be a premium and a foresight for 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.220
 horizontal trace in the horizontal plane 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.440
 what would be p 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.660
 you have to keep in mind that this is not 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.060
 the forecasts the projections of a 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.910
 same element are two different traces 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.950
 two different lines that together define 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.410
 the same plane as we are 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.930
 used to seeing that a straight has 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.300
 two precisions that represent the same 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.120
 element 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.820
 to bei we have an element that is 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.350
 p &amp; p premium may be confusing but 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.080
 let's be very clear that they are two 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.190
 different representations of two 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.310
 different elements 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.800
 but before it would be interesting to follow 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.360
 looking at the types of plans we make 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.920
 a pause and let's talk about the nomenclature 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.450
 the nomenclature is going to be the kind of 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.330
 name that we are going to put to the points 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.950
 when you accept the plans it is very 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.290
 variable there are many types of 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.290
 nomenclature I am going to comment on that 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.720
 I will use initially for 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.120
 forecasts we're going to use indexes and 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.860
 subscript is distributing it to go 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.350
 which is a horizontal projection a 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.100
 vertical and one in the profile plane a 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.290
 auxiliary plane 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.710
 in such a way that if we have a point 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.200
 for horizontal tradition will be to 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.990
 lowercase for vertical projection to 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.640
 premium and for the auxiliary or 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.640
 profile would be to your cousin 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:24.250
 and always dot lowercase letters to 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:28.150
 from the s for the line we will use 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.660
 lowercase letters from the r rst 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.040
 with its smi index on index for 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.320
 traces of straight 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.820
 if we are working with a line and 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:42.250
 we are especially interested in its trace 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.760
 we can specify those points with ho 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.700
 uve h for the horizontal trace and v for 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.570
 the vertical trace and as for planes 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:57.310
 we will use letters that have the la 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:04:00.760
 pq but in capital equal in the same way 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.950
 for the traces would be prima prima like 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.470
 premium and letters that are around the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.480
 letter p and uppercase 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.700
 well seen this let's go to the 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.100
 classification of plans according to their 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.830
 characteristics the first case that we have 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.239
 seen is a flat break or does not have 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.760
 no special feature 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.859
 simply after highlighting that you have 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.920
 two traces trapa and not the vertical plane 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.040
 and trace in the horizontal plane the 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.670
 next case will be the horizontal plane 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.950
 it is a plane parallel to the horizontal plane 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.290
 parallel also to the land line and 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.900
 that has a single trace in the plane 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.190
 vertical that will be represented as 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.460
 a line parallel to the ground line 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.200
 the next one will be a frontal plane that 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.380
 it is a plane parallel to the vertical plane 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.630
 also parallel to the land line and 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.730
 will have a single trace on the plane 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.670
 horizontal that will also be represented 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.020
 as a line parallel to the line of 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.539
 land 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.419
 the next case would be the plan or 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:06.030
 project before horizontal or flat 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.900
 vertical which is a perpendicular plane 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.750
 to the horizontal plane applied to the vertical 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.670
 its vertical trace is perpendicular to the 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.250
 land line 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.950
 and all the elements figures and points 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.820
 that are contained in the plane are 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.340
 will be confused in the horizontal trace 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.380
 agree that horizontal trace goes to 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.680
 contain all the points figures and 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:35.090
 lines in that plane the angle 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.750
 which forms the plane with the vertical plane 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:41.150
 is what we will see represented 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.000
 between the horizontal trace and the line of 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.370
 earth the next case would be a plane 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.980
 pre vertical distant or flat edge 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:52.610
 that would be a plane perpendicular to 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.710
 vertical plane and the horizontal forced the 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.910
 horizontal trace would be perpendicular to 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:02.160
 the land line 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:03.750
 and the points figures and straight lines contained 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.650
 in the plane as it happened in the plane 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:10.200
 previous will all be contained in the 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.790
 vertical trace in this case would be in the 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.070
 electrical trace in the previous plane 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.610
 it was in the horizontal 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:20.010
 the angle that the plane forms with the 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.350
 horizontal plane would be the one we see 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.440
 represented between the prediction of 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.760
 plane of the vertical plane or the 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.860
 vertical trace with the ground line 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.950
 the next case would be a plane 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.950
 parallel to the land line leaves us 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.800
 two traces one vertical and one horizontal 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:42.170
 but to correctly determine your 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.450
 position and to see it as current is 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.370
 convenient 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.340
 determine also the trace in the plane 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.710
 in profile 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.810
 the next case would be precisely a 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.639
 profile plane that is a plane 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.220
 perpendicular to the horizontal plane 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:07:00.130
 to vertical plane and therefore also 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:03.550
 perpendicular to the earth line their 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.410
 traces are going to be in some represented 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.360
 as the same line they will be 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.650
 overlapping forming a line 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.080
 perpendicular to the ground line 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.419
 and finally we would have the plan that 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.880
 it goes through the earth line it 's a plane 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:19.830
 that goes through the land line to 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.340
 represent your trace we will do two 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.650
 small lines attached to the line of 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.419
 land 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:32.120
 at the top and indicate 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:34.280
 the precisions of the plane 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.520
 to determine this plane in addition to the 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.229
 traces we will need the 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.870
 representation of a point the projection 

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:44.910
 from a point that helps us determine 

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:47.430
 the inclination of this plane 

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.650
 well this is all about the 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.510
 classification of plans the nomenclature 

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.150
 and the representation of the plane that is what 

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.700
 that we have seen like this above in this 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:59.790
 video we will continue working with system 

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:02.630
 dietrick or a greeting we all see each other in 

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.630
 a following video
