00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:14.099

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:16.640
 then we have a great project 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:23.730

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:26.550

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.760
 play with the book tai chi at what 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.430
 cora verlag has appeared and in the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.149
 new edition is so that to everyone 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.600
 exercise to each image one of the day's form 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:44.790
 movie is filmed so you film 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.640
 and book very well together 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.580
 and how can I best get yours? 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.220
 So yes movies from which of the book 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.020
 give it to everyone to every exercise 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.840
 qr-code because you can over the phone there 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.460
 go or such a player you 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.210
 but you can also do it on youtube 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.220
 go and look at these films there 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.990
 there they are, so to speak, to the chapters 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.610
 sorted by the book but you can 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.080
 also use it completely independently 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:17.700
 the whole thing costs nothing and so live 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:28.500
 that promote the whip and so you 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:30.240
 accompany on your way so say how 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.890
 my education students are in 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.290
 most intense students of mine have the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.690
 again a very own 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.210
 more sophisticated video channel there is 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.270
 so several thousand small films the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.649
 the exercise very very fine to break that up 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.240
 can be found at the students of my 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.560
 student or my own student 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.920
 here in the school in hamburg 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.140
 but it also turns to people who 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.090
 are interested in them and on these 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.220
 Note that is great because I want 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.890
 continue to make me on the way and yourself 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.750
 then the teacher seek the prior 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.990
 place in your region 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.909
 on my website shared games 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.560
 dark a teacher's list with the people 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.660
 who offer that in Germany 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.700
 but it is also thought of 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.380
 People who already play clearly anyway 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.630
 that's what it's about 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.560
 look and be interesting that build 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:23.060
 I'm one that stimulates me and uses 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.060
 just like that and make your own
