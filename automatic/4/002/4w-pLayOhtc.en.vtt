 eat healthy and enjoy a day of 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.730
 picnic a day of vacations today we 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.730
 lets go shopping 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.750
 to start a day of sales 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.570
 try my best and greatest advice of 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.370
 start with a good breakfast because 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.579
 because breakfast is the most 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.710
 important of the day and especially is 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.960
 that fattening food less as 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.090
 we have all day and we have many 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.550
 hours ahead to burn that 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.440
 breakfast then we can afford 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.020
 some whim but for there to be or 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.509
 that's not that I take care of the line myself 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.450
 I always recommend a whole toast 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.100
 rich in fiber an orange juice rich in 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.619
 vitamins that gives us energy to 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.750
 start the day on the right foot and above all 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.130
 bet on tomato you know that tomato 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.050
 has lycopene and is the best 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.270
 antioxidant as I always tell you 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.080
 after a rich breakfast you have to 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.600
 keep in mind not to eat 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.580
 at the time and especially that we do not leave 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.410
 spend more than four hours after the 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.260
 breakfast without eating and without eating a bite 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:48.280
 because because in this way we avoid 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:51.280
 anxiety caprice and we avoid that bad 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.640
 pecking that makes us fat and above all we 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.640
 It passes bill 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.390
 miguel 2005 for two wigs 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.720
 and how people are from the mall 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 the archangel I will recommend you 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.129
 different tricks to succeed in them 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.230
 and especially to follow the 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.760
 budget the most important thing and what 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.290
 first thing we have to do is 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.959
 visualize the closet 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.900
 in this way we analyze recycle 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.000
 we eliminate garments and we will also know 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.100
 our needs 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.110
 once we have done this step we are going 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.470
 the next one elaborate a list of 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.270
 partners in which we analyze and above all 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.590
 Let's notice the stores that we want 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.350
 write the stores where we want 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.240
 buy and the clothes we need 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.700
 after this list the important thing is 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.070
 have a friend or sister of ours 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.430
 not the manias to go shopping with her 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.310
 so we avoid long queues and avoid 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.530
 also buy caprice and why not 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.100
 while one waits for the other 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.660
 test you can visualize trena encina 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.270
 let's say the most fun and also 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.640
 faster the next important thing that 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.320
 I recommend is to buy pants 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.450
 the first days of rebates since it 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.250
 learn in the garment that used to be 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.950
 eliminates and that it costs us more to find 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.680
 since there is less suit and let's say that 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.590
 it flies so girls and boys scored 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.209
 the first piece of clothing to buy 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.880
 pants and the last thing I recommend 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.370
 is to always visualize the web in the 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.620
 different knots and know the offer and 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.610
 promotions of the different stores 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.120
 you propose them 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.040
 since in this way 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.440
 at fixed shot we know we want 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.390
 buy and we know your product and 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.090
 We know your offer very attentive to 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.310
 very careful label forward and to the 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.670
 after and especially enjoy the 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.090
 sales be patient and buy with 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.090
 head 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.049
 summer is coming and with it the 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.750
 vacation now I tell you another key 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.530
 important to enjoy rest and 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.370
 especially to entertain us 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.040
 first key new technologies never 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.070
 fail they are easy to carry does not occupy 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.960
 a lot of space and are suitable for all 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.000
 family for all friends to 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.389
 our partner in them we can 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.760
 enjoy movies games and why 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.180
 we can not also take advantage of time 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:49.720
 to learn to inform us and even 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.280
 to make travel routes or because 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.500
 we can not also use it as a gps 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.720
 according to the keys that are a vacation 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.250
 without a soundtrack we can not 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.350
 forget our music , music 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.750
 We are always glad we are encouraged and about 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.700
 everything invites us to evade and to 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.639
 forget about all the problems for 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.210
 that I always recommend to take the mp3 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.460
 of 24 with our music and enjoy 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.380
 this music doing sports taking the 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.020
 Sun or because we are taking a walk 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.810
 enjoying a good view 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.910
 of key scenes I do not know on my mobile but 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.560
 not to be aware of problems or 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.810
 work the mobile you have to take it 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.610
 to be connected with those 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.110
 people we love and those who 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.080
 we want to be accountable in our 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.960
 vacations and above all it serves us or we 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.479
 lets play download movies 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.120
 music and pass all that information with 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.919
 an HDMI cable to any monitor or 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.379
 television in this way we can 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:49.530
