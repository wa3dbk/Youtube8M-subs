00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.179
 the shoes have always been the 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.219
 weak point of all women for that 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.140

 cutting edge that in materials 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.320
 they predominate and today we have come to talk with 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.700

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.530
 mercedes campusano 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.930
 This designer has decided to make 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.870
 handmade shoes with the 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.159
 collaboration of Colombian artisans 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.289
 shoes that do not represent a time 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:40.989
 specific and are characterized by their 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:43.239
 timeless style that sets trend and 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.550
 highlights the femininity of all 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:50.100
 women we see that everyone is using 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:54.600
 boots ankle boots platform sandals 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.719
 and of pallets very tall drawers the height 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.589
 mean this is a super hit for this 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.000
 season 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.159
 the shoe is an accessory of the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.170
 clothing that was born with the intention of 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.570
 promote the protection and comfort of 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.100
 however walk over the years 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.680
 transformed into everything a symbol of 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.270
 sensuality beauty death 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.250
 we have to have as many styles as 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.259
 occasions of use in children women 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.420
 because every day we want to acquire 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.549
 different roles and see us divine 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.280
 always the shoes vary and evolve 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.950
 in terms of materials like leather the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.970
 rubber plastic synthetic fabrics 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.460
 the adhesives the textures the glitters and 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.600
 the colors 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.490
 this is the year of the black of the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.250
 metallic and very deep but also 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.100
 of the solos as the gold the silver the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.080
 Lead the bronze you are super winners 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.840
 they are super useful and will become 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.100
 basic as much as black or blue 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.720
 additional to that we will also have a 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.310
 little purple red a color that is 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.320
 like the one in the season now the one 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.330
 lorquÃ­ that technically is like to 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.790
 apply in the outfits because when 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.460
 we can say all of that color neither 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.229
 can not have a wallet and shoes 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.479
 color then let's go and we will wear shoes 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.390
 or a color portfolio I recommend it 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.950
 use with the other complement of another 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:20.750
 completely different color as in 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:23.510
 honey or a gold a black red balloon 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.670
 bright blunt with heel or 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.160
 cineto does not really matter because 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.250
 for all women the shoes are 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.870
 more than a dream and definitely 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.180
 many are not so many 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.790
 Today's conclusion is that they are 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.330
 fashion metallic colors color 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.769
 honey blue and black that of course 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.870
 whenever we're going to pick a couple of 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.940
 shoes we should think about the outfit in 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.849
 what we are wearing and where we 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.620
 let's go also it's very important 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.989
 Gentlemen who are watching us at home 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.750
 is an excellent option today to give a gift 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.000
 good pair of shoes for those women and 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.739
 one more thing is that we two 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.959
 mercedes and I invite you to 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.280
