00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
with him out there and I think players

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.820 
with him out there and I think players
get<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.090> point<00:02:33.330> i<00:02:33.480> think<00:02:33.510> he's<00:02:33.750> every<00:02:34.620> player

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830
