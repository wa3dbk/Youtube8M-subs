00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
definitely by no means is this going to

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.859 
definitely by no means is this going to
be<00:01:15.750> easy<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:17.060> now<00:01:18.060> there's<00:01:18.390> some<00:01:18.570> kits

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
be easy for you now there's some kits

be easy for you now there's some kits
out<00:01:19.079> there<00:01:19.350> you'll<00:01:19.500> find<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:20.009> part<00:01:20.250> store<00:01:20.609> that

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
out there you'll find a part store that

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.130 
out there you'll find a part store that
you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.119> actually<00:01:21.299> hook<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> cordless

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
you can actually hook to a cordless

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.679 
you can actually hook to a cordless
drill<00:01:22.289> that<00:01:23.219> work<00:01:23.490> fairly<00:01:23.820> well<00:01:23.969> but<00:01:24.360> just

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
drill that work fairly well but just

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.809 
drill that work fairly well but just
keep<00:01:24.899> in<00:01:25.170> mind<00:01:25.229> when<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.310> apply

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
keep in mind when you actually apply

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.660 
keep in mind when you actually apply
that<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.689> your<00:01:27.869> vehicle<00:01:28.289> that<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:29.490> don't

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
that to your vehicle that you don't

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.109 
that to your vehicle that you don't
actually<00:01:29.880> damage<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.509> plastic<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.819> put

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
actually damage the plastic and I put

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.520 
actually damage the plastic and I put
this<00:01:36.240> extreme<00:01:36.719> clean<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.319> and<00:01:37.409> hopefully

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
this extreme clean on it and hopefully

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.929 
this extreme clean on it and hopefully
we<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.829> take<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> rest<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.459> stuff<00:01:38.700> off

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
we can take the rest of the stuff off

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.719 
we can take the rest of the stuff off
here<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:40.619> some<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.009> these<00:01:41.100> ones<00:01:41.459> that<00:01:41.640> are

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
here and some of these ones that are

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.850 
here and some of these ones that are
heavily<00:01:41.939> heavily<00:01:42.420> oxidized<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.649> these

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
heavily heavily oxidized like these

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.309 
heavily heavily oxidized like these
lenses<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.520> don't<00:01:45.390> expect<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.929> get<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.170> all

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
lenses here don't expect to get it all

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.600 
lenses here don't expect to get it all
off<00:01:46.530> because<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.829> unfortunately<00:01:47.489> isn't

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
off because that unfortunately isn't

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.760 
off because that unfortunately isn't
going<00:01:47.849> to<00:01:47.909> happen<00:01:48.289> but<00:01:49.289> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
going to happen but you can get the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.229 
going to happen but you can get the
majority<00:01:49.920> off<00:01:50.399> maybe<00:01:50.640> make<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.090> little

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:51.239 
majority off maybe make it a little

00:01:51.239 --> 00:02:00.199 
majority off maybe make it a little
easier<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:58.340> sometimes<00:01:59.340> too<00:01:59.819> if<00:01:59.970> you<00:02:00.060> have

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
easier to see sometimes too if you have

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.410 
easier to see sometimes too if you have
yourself<00:02:00.860> an<00:02:01.860> orbital<00:02:02.310> buffer<00:02:02.459> that<00:02:03.239> might

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
yourself an orbital buffer that might

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.479 
yourself an orbital buffer that might
work<00:02:03.599> also<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.349> a<00:02:04.409> little<00:02:04.560> terry<00:02:04.860> cloth<00:02:05.189> I

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:05.489 
work also for you a little terry cloth I

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:07.429 
work also for you a little terry cloth I
