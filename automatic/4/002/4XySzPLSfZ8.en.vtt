Premier Li this season behind Arsenal

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.230 
Premier Li this season behind Arsenal
and<00:02:53.220> he's<00:02:54.220> obviously<00:02:54.550> not<00:02:54.910> going<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.150> be

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
and he's obviously not going to be

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.970 
and he's obviously not going to be
involved<00:02:55.480> in<00:02:55.720> any<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:56.020> those<00:02:56.250> but<00:02:57.360> he's<00:02:58.360> had<00:02:58.540> a

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
involved in any of those but he's had a

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.730 
involved in any of those but he's had a
it's<00:02:59.980> as<00:03:00.580> far<00:03:00.880> as<00:03:01.060> Ronaldo<00:03:01.780> standards<00:03:02.530> a

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
it's as far as Ronaldo standards a

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.490 
it's as far as Ronaldo standards a
concern<00:03:03.280> he<00:03:04.120> hasn't<00:03:04.450> quite<00:03:04.720> hit<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.320> heights

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
concern he hasn't quite hit the heights

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.590 
concern he hasn't quite hit the heights
he<00:03:05.770> probably<00:03:06.040> could<00:03:06.490> have<00:03:06.520> ensured<00:03:07.030> up<00:03:07.150> by<00:03:07.390> now

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
he probably could have ensured up by now

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.010 
he probably could have ensured up by now
at<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.290> age<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.620> 21<00:03:09.070> so<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.490> question<00:03:09.790> is<00:03:10.020> has

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
at the age of 21 so the question is has

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.490 
at the age of 21 so the question is has
joining<00:03:11.500> Chelsea<00:03:12.630> been<00:03:13.630> proved<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.230> be<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.380> very

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
joining Chelsea been proved to be a very

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.130 
joining Chelsea been proved to be a very
poor<00:03:15.040> decision<00:03:15.640> he's<00:03:15.910> not<00:03:16.210> their<00:03:16.930> hottest

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
poor decision he's not their hottest

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.340 
poor decision he's not their hottest
prospect<00:03:17.890> he's<00:03:18.670> not<00:03:18.850> their<00:03:19.060> key<00:03:19.270> player<00:03:19.600> he's

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
prospect he's not their key player he's

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.710 
prospect he's not their key player he's
not<00:03:20.590> in<00:03:20.710> the<00:03:20.830> starting<00:03:21.130> lineup<00:03:21.940> very<00:03:22.270> often

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
not in the starting lineup very often

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.780 
not in the starting lineup very often
and<00:03:23.850> so<00:03:24.850> although<00:03:25.360> he<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:25.720> there<00:03:26.020> so<00:03:28.110> wear<00:03:29.790> it

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
and so although he is there so wear it

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.810 
and so although he is there so wear it
while<00:03:31.060> league<00:03:31.330> wise<00:03:31.600> anyway<00:03:32.020> he's<00:03:32.200> not<00:03:32.380> but

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
while league wise anyway he's not but

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.080 
while league wise anyway he's not but
the<00:03:33.820> question<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.270> when<00:03:35.020> we<00:03:35.170> come<00:03:35.380> back<00:03:36.090> I'm

as<00:04:04.750> you<00:04:04.959> can<00:04:05.140> see<00:04:05.459> Chelsea<00:04:06.459> finished<00:04:06.760> in

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
as you can see Chelsea finished in

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.080 
as you can see Chelsea finished in
fourth<00:04:07.330> place<00:04:07.600> is<00:04:08.020> season<00:04:08.610> just<00:04:09.610> ahead<00:04:09.850> of

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
fourth place is season just ahead of

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.310 
fourth place is season just ahead of
manchester<00:04:10.390> united<00:04:10.959> on<00:04:11.050> goal<00:04:11.320> difference<00:04:11.740> and

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
manchester united on goal difference and

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.449 
manchester united on goal difference and
Cristiano<00:04:14.320> Ronaldo<00:04:14.800> was<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:14.980> bit<00:04:15.220> more

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
Cristiano Ronaldo was a bit more

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.580 
Cristiano Ronaldo was a bit more
involved<00:04:15.880> this<00:04:16.270> season<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:18.160> be<00:04:18.280> honest<00:04:19.049> he

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
involved this season to be honest he

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.840 
involved this season to be honest he
played<00:04:22.370> in<00:04:22.730> total<00:04:23.300> 45<00:04:23.960> games<00:04:24.320> scored<00:04:25.130> 20<00:04:25.820> goals

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
played in total 45 games scored 20 goals

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.290 
played in total 45 games scored 20 goals
so<00:04:26.570> you<00:04:27.470> know<00:04:27.560> he's<00:04:27.710> had<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.860> good<00:04:28.040> season<00:04:28.300> his

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
so you know he's had a good season his

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.060 
so you know he's had a good season his
abilities<00:04:29.810> have<00:04:30.020> really<00:04:30.850> really<00:04:31.850> flew<00:04:32.360> up

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
abilities have really really flew up

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.930 
abilities have really really flew up
this<00:04:34.070> season<00:04:34.550> as<00:04:34.699> well<00:04:34.820> in<00:04:35.030> quite<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:35.930> few<00:04:35.990> areas

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
this season as well in quite a few areas

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.840 
this season as well in quite a few areas
he<00:04:37.940> is<00:04:38.090> now<00:04:38.510> classed<00:04:39.020> as<00:04:39.260> a<00:04:39.320> global<00:04:39.889> superstar

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
he is now classed as a global superstar

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.900 
he is now classed as a global superstar
so<00:04:41.600> he's<00:04:41.750> starting<00:04:42.229> to<00:04:42.260> get<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:43.400> that<00:04:43.520> point

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
so he's starting to get to that point

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.890 
so he's starting to get to that point
now<00:04:44.240> where<00:04:45.370> he<00:04:46.370> is<00:04:46.610> one<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.360> their<00:04:47.690> best

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
now where he is one of their best

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.750 
now where he is one of their best
players<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.530> I<00:04:48.979> think<00:04:49.010> he'll<00:04:49.310> continue<00:04:49.610> to

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
players and I think he'll continue to

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.879 
players and I think he'll continue to
grow<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.120> become<00:04:50.270> what<00:04:50.900> probably<00:04:51.410> the<00:04:51.620> best

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
grow and become what probably the best

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.100 
grow and become what probably the best
player<00:04:52.130> in<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:53.000> Premier<00:04:53.120> League<00:04:53.449> but<00:04:53.900> we'll

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
player in the Premier League but we'll

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.180 
player in the Premier League but we'll
have<00:04:54.590> to<00:04:54.650> wait<00:04:54.860> and<00:04:54.979> see<00:04:56.740> be<00:04:57.740> interesting<00:04:57.979> to

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
have to wait and see be interesting to

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.969 
have to wait and see be interesting to
