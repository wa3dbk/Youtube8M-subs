off the talents the skills we know we

off the talents the skills we know we
have<00:01:29.170> all<00:01:29.470> this<00:01:29.590> potential<00:01:30.039> but<00:01:30.460> sometimes<00:01:30.940> we

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
have all this potential but sometimes we

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.719 
have all this potential but sometimes we
just<00:01:31.300> can't<00:01:31.420> access<00:01:32.200> that<00:01:32.259> potential<00:01:33.100> there's

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
just can't access that potential there's

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.100 
just can't access that potential there's
a<00:01:33.789> lot<00:01:33.970> of<00:01:34.000> different<00:01:34.330> theories<00:01:34.479> as<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:34.780> why

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
a lot of different theories as to why

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.289 
a lot of different theories as to why
but<00:01:35.590> even<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.039> science<00:01:36.429> community<00:01:36.640> will<00:01:37.090> tell

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
but even the science community will tell

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.270 
but even the science community will tell
us<00:01:37.479> that<00:01:37.630> between<00:01:37.869> only<00:01:38.259> use<00:01:38.560> between<00:01:39.009> three

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
us that between only use between three

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.550 
us that between only use between three
to<00:01:39.310> six<00:01:39.700> percent<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.090> our<00:01:40.179> DNA<00:01:40.539> so<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.200> DNA

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
to six percent of our DNA so the DNA

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.650 
to six percent of our DNA so the DNA
activation<00:01:41.679> what<00:01:42.190> it<00:01:42.310> does<00:01:42.549> is<00:01:42.880> take<00:01:43.390> all<00:01:43.629> of

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
activation what it does is take all of

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.410 
activation what it does is take all of
that<00:01:43.869> other<00:01:44.200> potential<00:01:45.099> that<00:01:45.190> we<00:01:45.340> have<00:01:45.550> all<00:01:45.879> of

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
that other potential that we have all of

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.740 
that other potential that we have all of
this<00:01:46.660> unused<00:01:47.470> today<00:01:48.280> parts<00:01:48.819> of<00:01:48.940> our<00:01:49.060> DNA<00:01:49.270> and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
this unused today parts of our DNA and

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.869 
this unused today parts of our DNA and
light<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.679> up<00:01:50.800> so<00:01:51.190> that<00:01:51.220> we<00:01:51.489> can<00:01:51.670> actually

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:51.879 
light it up so that we can actually

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:54.359 
light it up so that we can actually
start<00:01:52.300> to<00:01:52.840> use<00:01:53.289> that<00:01:53.590> from<00:01:53.860> both<00:01:54.009> a<00:01:54.190> physical

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
start to use that from both a physical

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.999 
start to use that from both a physical
and<00:01:54.759> a<00:01:55.330> spiritual<00:01:55.780> perspective<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:56.950> I'm

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
and a spiritual perspective and I'm

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.290 
and a spiritual perspective and I'm
going<00:01:57.129> to<00:01:57.220> go<00:01:57.310> from<00:01:57.489> the<00:01:57.610> base<00:01:57.759> of<00:01:57.940> her<00:01:58.030> skull

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
going to go from the base of her skull

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.699 
going to go from the base of her skull
all<00:01:58.569> the<00:01:58.810> way<00:01:58.899> to<00:01:58.959> the<00:01:59.140> middle<00:01:59.289> of<00:01:59.470> her<00:01:59.560> back

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
all the way to the middle of her back

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.229 
all the way to the middle of her back
and<00:01:59.979> I'm<00:02:00.099> going<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.280> open<00:02:00.429> up<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:00.789> etheric

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:01.239 
and I'm going to open up that etheric

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.540 
and I'm going to open up that etheric
energy<00:02:01.360> that<00:02:01.869> energy<00:02:02.020> of<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.590> Wills<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.099> once

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
energy that energy of the Wills and once

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.850 
energy that energy of the Wills and once
that<00:02:03.640> energy<00:02:04.149> is<00:02:04.270> open<00:02:04.660> I'll<00:02:04.810> locate<00:02:05.170> 12

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
that energy is open I'll locate 12

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.199 
that energy is open I'll locate 12
receptor<00:02:06.489> sites<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:08.310> these<00:02:09.310> 12<00:02:09.700> receptor

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
receptor sites and these 12 receptor

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.630 
receptor sites and these 12 receptor
sites<00:02:10.450> are<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.500> parts<00:02:11.830> that<00:02:11.950> correspond

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
sites are the parts that correspond

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.930 
sites are the parts that correspond
directly<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:13.540> both<00:02:13.780> her<00:02:14.050> physical<00:02:14.680> and

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
directly to both her physical and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.420 
directly to both her physical and
spiritual<00:02:15.940> lines<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.680> each<00:02:17.950> one<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.280> these

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
spiritual lines so each one of these

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.880 
spiritual lines so each one of these
receptor<00:02:18.940> sites<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.690> corresponding<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.650> one

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
receptor sites is corresponding to one

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.059 
receptor sites is corresponding to one
of<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.069> filaments

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
of the filaments

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.869 
of the filaments
and<00:02:23.400> here<00:02:23.849> you're<00:02:23.999> going<00:02:24.329> one<00:02:24.569> by<00:02:24.749> one<00:02:25.879> it's

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
and here you're going one by one it's

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.429 
and here you're going one by one it's
the<00:02:27.090> crystal<00:02:27.540> that's<00:02:27.749> channeling<00:02:28.319> that

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
the crystal that's channeling that

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.039 
the crystal that's channeling that
energy<00:02:28.859> directly<00:02:29.430> into<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:29.999> codon<00:02:30.329> and<00:02:30.510> will

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
energy directly into the codon and will

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.349 
energy directly into the codon and will
then<00:02:31.170> start<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.620> reprogram<00:02:32.400> your<00:02:32.609> DNA<00:02:33.090> and

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
then start to reprogram your DNA and

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.599 
then start to reprogram your DNA and
introduce<00:02:34.079> all<00:02:34.319> of<00:02:34.379> those<00:02:34.829> pieces<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.340> have

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
introduce all of those pieces that have

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.390 
introduce all of those pieces that have
been<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:36.060> dorm<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.629> up<00:02:36.810> until<00:02:37.139> now<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:38.099> that<00:02:38.249> you

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
been to dorm it up until now so that you

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.729 
been to dorm it up until now so that you
can<00:02:38.579> start<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.909> access<00:02:39.480> them<00:02:39.659> and<00:02:39.810> use<00:02:39.989> them<00:02:40.260> so

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
can start to access them and use them so

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.629 
can start to access them and use them so
once<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.069> finished<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.819> last<00:02:42.030> receptor<00:02:42.689> site

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
once I finished the last receptor site

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.789 
once I finished the last receptor site
I'm<00:02:44.639> actually<00:02:44.849> going<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.180> close<00:02:45.480> her<00:02:45.689> up

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
I'm actually going to close her up

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.580 
I'm actually going to close her up
completely<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:47.540> I'm<00:02:48.540> going<00:02:48.659> to<00:02:48.689> seal<00:02:49.049> off<00:02:49.079> all

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
completely and I'm going to seal off all

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.550 
completely and I'm going to seal off all
this<00:02:49.769> energy<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.400> then<00:02:51.120> I'm<00:02:51.389> going<00:02:51.599> to<00:02:51.719> heal

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
this energy and then I'm going to heal

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.309 
this energy and then I'm going to heal
it<00:02:53.060> using<00:02:54.060> my<00:02:54.209> own<00:02:54.359> hand<00:02:54.659> just<00:02:54.930> using<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
it using my own hand just using the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.429 
it using my own hand just using the
energy<00:02:55.730> flowing<00:02:56.730> through<00:02:56.969> if<00:02:57.719> you<00:02:57.870> know<00:02:58.019> Reiki

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
energy flowing through if you know Reiki

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.780 
energy flowing through if you know Reiki
sometimes<00:02:58.919> you<00:02:59.069> can<00:02:59.219> use<00:02:59.370> Reiki<00:02:59.760> energy

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
sometimes you can use Reiki energy

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.939 
sometimes you can use Reiki energy
depending<00:03:00.719> on<00:03:00.810> what's<00:03:00.989> needed<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.769> whole

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:01.949 
depending on what's needed the whole

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:05.270 
depending on what's needed the whole
idea<00:03:02.129> is<00:03:02.340> here<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:02.699> smooth<00:03:03.359> out<00:03:03.689> all<00:03:04.199> of<00:03:04.349> her

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
idea is here to smooth out all of her

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.300 
idea is here to smooth out all of her
work<00:03:05.430> then<00:03:06.060> all<00:03:06.389> I<00:03:06.419> have<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.840> do<00:03:06.989> is<00:03:07.310> reconnect

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
work then all I have to do is reconnect

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.179 
work then all I have to do is reconnect
the<00:03:08.909> energy<00:03:09.299> flowing<00:03:09.599> down<00:03:09.989> into<00:03:10.439> her<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:11.099> I'm

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
the energy flowing down into her so I'm

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:12.409 
the energy flowing down into her so I'm
going<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.370> pull<00:03:11.609> from<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:11.879> energy<00:03:12.329> at<00:03:12.389> the

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
going to pull from that energy at the

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:17.830 
going to pull from that energy at the
top<00:03:12.659> and<00:03:12.870> I'm<00:03:13.019> going<00:03:13.139> to<00:03:13.199> bring<00:03:13.439> it<00:03:13.590> down<00:03:13.799> I

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.059 

usually<00:03:18.840> tell<00:03:19.199> people<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.620> between<00:03:19.859> the
