the YouTube clips I've saw there's not a
lot<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.690> these<00:00:33.809> guys<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.230> I'm<00:00:34.440> really<00:00:34.680> just

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
lot on these guys so I'm really just

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.130 
lot on these guys so I'm really just
interpreting<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.880> off<00:00:36.000> what<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.480> see<00:00:36.719> but

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
interpreting it off what I can see but

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.600 
interpreting it off what I can see but
this<00:00:37.290> olivia<00:00:37.739> has<00:00:38.010> been<00:00:38.160> struggled<00:00:38.520> with

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
this olivia has been struggled with

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.830 
this olivia has been struggled with
injuries<00:00:39.000> over<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> past<00:00:39.540> couple<00:00:39.690> years

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
injuries over the past couple years

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.360 
injuries over the past couple years
otherwise<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.590> think<00:00:40.890> he<00:00:40.950> had<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.070> potential

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
otherwise I think he had the potential

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.209 
otherwise I think he had the potential
be<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> gold<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.270> 2011<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.079> 2010<00:00:44.010> he

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
be a gold because in 2011 and 2010 he

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.410 
be a gold because in 2011 and 2010 he
had<00:00:44.340> some<00:00:44.489> really<00:00:44.610> nice<00:00:44.850> years<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.210> last

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
had some really nice years but last

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.910 
had some really nice years but last
couple<00:00:45.719> years<00:00:45.750> he's<00:00:45.989> been<00:00:46.110> hurt<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.800> think

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
couple years he's been hurt so I think

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.590 
couple years he's been hurt so I think
he's<00:00:47.100> gonna<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.399> high<00:00:47.670> rated<00:00:48.030> silver<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
he's gonna be a high rated silver and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.150 
he's gonna be a high rated silver and
