00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 or how it is when more tense even if 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.629
 I bring you how to make a trap tree 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.880
 which is going to activate just when 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.040
 Somebody is, today we are going to see 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.259
 how all this works is very easy 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.839
 of doing you do not occupy practically great 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.310
 thing to do it and well then 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.770
 I was doing a few tests for 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.990
 here as you can notice right here 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.000
 I died I think if he wants to die this for 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.369
 Here I also tried here I tried here all 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.220
 these stretched explosions that is not 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.830
 nothing not bad this good and let's see 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.960
 how all this works and 1 and 2 ways 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.210
 either this trap the first one is with a 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.520
 little tnt to taste or if you want 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.379
 put 20 tnt that if you want to put two or 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.930
 if you want to put 100 as many as you want 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.030
 it depends on how deadly you want it 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.129
 be the trap obviously this we occupy 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.989
 a little bit of the rest with a little of these 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.510
 reston torches and also a 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.969
 lever we will also occupy a bit of 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.190
 this is a bit of land for 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.500
 can disguise the trap and then not 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.420
 it's obviously obvious obviously and well 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.059
 we are going to try, let's go to a 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.830
 site that we are going to look for a tree 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.040
 that is perfect to do this we go 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.200
 to search 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.640
 has to be recommended I 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.260
 I recommend it to be a tree of these 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.330
 this normalitos I think this is not 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.920
 let's find others look for another I think 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.570
 that this one is fine is this is fine 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.340
 it's so perfect for example this tree 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.350
 is excellent this I recommend them 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.840
 I say that it is of the normal ones no no that 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.330
 are those gigantic ones that measure 10,000 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.380
 meters have to be of these not now 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.720
 what we have to do is start 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.460
 now yes that is to finish this they are not going to 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.500
 mine attack this land down here 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.810
 this one from the web we are going to cover it 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.330
 obviously and right here below we are going to 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.520
 put this lever and down the lever 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.020
 let's put one of the remains we're not going to 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.390
 activate the lever as can be seen 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.820
 learn and here at the sides we are going to 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.200
 put these are the torches of 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.270
 Reston that are going to pay 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.570
 automatically because of the signal that 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.890
 is up here and the state the last 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.430
 what we have to do is place the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.100
 tenderentes not this we are going to place them 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.990
 here and here here we are going to place it here 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.490
 we are going to place few so that we see a 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.299
 small example 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.709
 I think it's fine here because if I 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.160
 I put here is going to be activated by this 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.590
 shit let's put here here here and 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.200
 here with that is enough now yes 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.019
 we can proceed to cover everything we are going to 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.810
 cover to cover the flat part there 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.540
 we are as you can see it is totally 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.670
 well hidden even if someone 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.739
 he comes to this place he does not even know 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.989
 imagine what is said this one has a 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.640
 a bomb down here is not we can 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.209
 obviously doing it here in a forest 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.069
 full of trap trees is obviously 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.660
 on a server that is a server with a 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.269
 friend and that you put a chingo of these 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.069
 things would not be beautiful this and good 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.390
 let's go to the simulation this one I'm already in 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.790
 uruguay again see that for example 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.560
 I start to cut down the tree totally this 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.510
 normal grass we are not going to cut down the tree 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.160
 at the time of felling 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.650
 I'm here to notice that it's going to 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.980
 activate all of this down here from 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.980
 now so 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.400
 my god sometimes it's very difficult to tell you 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.960
 it is very difficult to run this 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.820
 right now I did not run because I wanted to 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.370
 show them but obviously if you put 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.220
 a lot of tnt will be impossible to achieve 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.080
 flee that person from this who manages to flee 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.790
 because it makes me escape from that trap 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.980
 let's get creative again 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.630
 well right here I did this a bit 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.060
 more graphic so they can see well 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.280
 how is it designed so to speak 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.830
 this I tell you in the last trunk of 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.590
 down we put on the lever after 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.930
 We put the reston powder and the 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.130
 sides we place this the torches are 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.830
 subtract that obviously have to be 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.750
 switched off is not now so after 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.680
 we put around what is the tnt if 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.750
 we want can fill everything down tnt 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.100
 exaggerated and will see all the chaos 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.860
 that is going to be served I tell you 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.840
 terrific this is fine call me a lot 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.670
 the attention always fixed me that when 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.290
 is going to be a trap I want it to be 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.420
 simple to do or nobody wants 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.250
 spend hours making a trap to 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.110
 that no one falls, no one wants to make a 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.790
 fast trap for for example you're in 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.709
 a server of some friend is a Serbian 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.550
 private this one can make the trap 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.470
 fast and 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.090
 to fall at that right moment you do not want 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.640
 spend I tell you hours doing a 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.320
 trap so they do not fall and thanks to 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.880
 that are simple traps you can 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.980
 do them in many places instead of 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.140
 make one and try all this time in one 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.900
 then this guy is installed here is 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.090
 the option is not not bad and also 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.520
 we have another way of making this trap 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.010
 that I told you there were two ways this 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.780
 is practically the same as the one that has 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.150
 shown that time this were the 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.200
 mine this for the people that I know video 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.660
 because many people caught his attention 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.420
 that video really liked the theme of that 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.100
 trap and it works very much like we're going 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.600
 to put us on survivor and well I say 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.580
 this trap is one of the deadliest 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.830
 for people who have seen the other 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.180
 video I tell you it's practically the same 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.740
 here we have this something I think it's 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.230
 perfect good let's find another one that 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.640
 be a little higher I do not know if I think that 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.710
 that's fine if this is fine we're going to 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.690
 try in this this what we have to 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.790
 to do is as you can see here I have the 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.590
 materials this we are going to wear the 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.350
 survival and obviously we have to take out 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.120
 some of this leaves we're not going to 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.440
 look good I think it's better I can 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.000
 take out some leaves as you can see 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.440
 who has already collected a few but 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.370
 Well then let's cut a few 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.990
 plus 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.180
 a few leaves like put here already 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.000
 I have a few leaves we are going to put 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.410
 still today because 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.910
 or tell them what we have to do is 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.760
 let's remove the top ones here and 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.860
 let's cut down that a bit these are 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.690
 well these woods since we arrived at 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.390
 cut two I think with two is 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.660
 well if it's okay it's fine and now 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.550
 here we are going to place this rail and top 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.260
 of the dial we are going to place the main card 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.700
 with tnt and now we start 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.700
 disguise the trap in this way 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.160
 we are and ready we have our 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.870
 trap if it does a little but for example 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.820
 if someone they know who play in 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.910
 fast they will see that you do not see 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.100
 absolutely nothing good this is 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.540
 totally impossible that you can see this 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.220
 serious trap 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.660
 today we are going to put on good surval and 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.150
 this survival we are going to take this 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.560
 ax and let's see how this works 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.849
 we are not going to cut this down this 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.069
 we were this was going to notice that it is 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.439
 I tell them it's practically impossible 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:11.569
 surviving this trap seriously is 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:14.209
 beautiful is that trap I say 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:16.219
 It is very easy to do and it is very fast 

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:18.830
 how to put note 2 very very easy to do 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:20.539
 it's fast and I tell you that at least I 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.999
 I set a lot in a trap not that the 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.080
 trap is easy to do since then if 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:26.149
 you are on a server can do it 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.039
 fast and so statesmen when by some 

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:30.139
 friend, someone is not aware 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.520
 there is no less likelihood that 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.469
 realize and well, this is 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.779
 practically all are two traps very 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.369
 good that I highly recommend this 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:39.499
 if not known in some please 

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:41.479
 support this video this if you want more 

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:43.999
 traps likewise support this video already 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.619
 I tied this a little bit and I'm going to 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:47.539
 try to bring them more traps from time to time 

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:52.179
 when so I hope you liked it 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:52.179
 this video and see you until next time
