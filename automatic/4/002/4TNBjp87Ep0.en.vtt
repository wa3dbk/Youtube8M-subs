was this design is the overall design so

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.670 
was this design is the overall design so
creating<00:02:55.340> more<00:02:55.460> dynamic<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.680> sporty

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
through the shape of the IP so we have a

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.150 
through the shape of the IP so we have a
line<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.330> comes<00:03:14.540> across<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.110> car<00:03:15.350> down

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.630 
underneath and then back up the other
part<00:03:20.060> is<00:03:20.330> is<00:03:20.630> really<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:20.960> seat<00:03:21.290> design<00:03:21.640> we

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
part is is really the seat design we

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.880 
part is is really the seat design we
wanted<00:03:23.000> again<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.750> make<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.290> very<00:03:24.530> sporty

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
wanted again to make a very sporty

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.820 
wanted again to make a very sporty
statement<00:03:25.610> lots<00:03:26.360> of<00:03:26.540> dynamic<00:03:27.260> lines<00:03:27.530> and

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
statement lots of dynamic lines and

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.400 
statement lots of dynamic lines and
tension<00:03:28.520> but<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.300> practical<00:03:29.720> part<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.200> seat

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
tension but the practical part of a seat

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.070 
tension but the practical part of a seat
is<00:03:30.770> to<00:03:30.890> keep<00:03:31.100> it<00:03:31.280> open<00:03:31.460> at<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.880> top<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.450> then

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
is to keep it open at the top and then

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.860 
is to keep it open at the top and then
quite<00:03:33.560> supportive<00:03:34.460> around<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.150> waist<00:03:35.660> area

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
quite supportive around the waist area

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.260 
quite supportive around the waist area
and<00:03:36.260> this<00:03:36.770> creates<00:03:37.130> what<00:03:37.280> we<00:03:37.310> call<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.730> Cobra

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
and this creates what we call the Cobra

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.840 
and this creates what we call the Cobra
style<00:03:38.690> seat<00:03:39.080> so<00:03:39.620> it's<00:03:39.800> large<00:03:40.130> at<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.430> top<00:03:40.610> and

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
style seat so it's large at the top and

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.750 
style seat so it's large at the top and
then<00:03:40.970> wraps<00:03:41.270> in<00:03:41.800> also<00:03:42.800> by<00:03:42.980> taking<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.520> seat

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
then wraps in also by taking the seat

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.450 
then wraps in also by taking the seat
belt<00:03:43.970> off<00:03:44.210> the<00:03:44.450> seat<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.930> allows<00:03:45.530> us<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.920> gain

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
belt off the seat it allows us to gain

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.900 
belt off the seat it allows us to gain
about<00:03:46.910> 46<00:03:47.900> millimeters<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.590> space<00:03:48.890> in<00:03:49.730> the

rear compartment the next stage really

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.850 
rear compartment the next stage really
was<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.180> look<00:03:53.960> at<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.260> tension<00:03:54.530> of<00:03:54.830> the

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
was to look at the tension of the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.430 
was to look at the tension of the
surfaces<00:03:55.550> and<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:56.090> treatment<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:56.780> I<00:03:57.050> always

surfaces and the treatment and I always

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.920 
surfaces and the treatment and I always
relate<00:03:57.710> this<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:58.130> like<00:03:58.670> an<00:03:58.820> athlete<00:03:59.210> going<00:03:59.840> on

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
relate this to like an athlete going on

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.230 
relate this to like an athlete going on
a<00:03:59.960> training<00:04:00.290> program<00:04:00.860> where<00:04:01.460> we're<00:04:01.700> tensioned

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
a training program where we're tensioned

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.270 
a training program where we're tensioned
up<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:02.480> muscles<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.230> tension<00:04:03.650> in<00:04:03.800> there<00:04:03.980> in

up the muscles and tension in there in
the<00:04:04.460> surfaces<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.330> you<00:04:05.630> can<00:04:05.810> see<00:04:05.990> that<00:04:06.200> quite

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
the surfaces and you can see that quite

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.380 
the surfaces and you can see that quite
typically<00:04:06.950> on<00:04:07.070> the<00:04:07.100> side<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.550> the<00:04:07.670> console

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
here and in these areas where we've

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.570 
here and in these areas where we've
created<00:04:11.390> almost<00:04:11.810> scallops<00:04:12.440> of<00:04:12.620> form<00:04:12.950> as<00:04:13.400> if
