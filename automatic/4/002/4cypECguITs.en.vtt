00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the top and the back it's a piece of

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.060 
the top and the back it's a piece of
mahogany<00:01:48.359> that<00:01:48.780> joins<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.200> maple<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
mahogany that joins the maple to the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.130 
mahogany that joins the maple to the
maple<00:01:50.219> in<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.520> back<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:51.390> gives<00:01:51.600> guitar<00:01:51.899> more

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
maple in the back this gives guitar more

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.319 
maple in the back this gives guitar more
sustain<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.399> little<00:01:53.609> more<00:01:53.729> nor<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.090> tune

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
sustain it's a little more nor in tune

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.429 
sustain it's a little more nor in tune
and<00:01:54.890> also<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.100> more<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.520> more<00:01:56.579> pop<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.119> think

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
and also just more and more pop I think

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.880 
and also just more and more pop I think
so<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.520> some<00:01:59.640> sound<00:01:59.820> samples<00:02:00.890> maybe

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
so we have some sound samples maybe

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.679 
so we have some sound samples maybe
quick<00:02:02.369> explanation<00:02:02.609> is<00:02:02.939> how<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.179> works<00:02:03.420> is

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
quick explanation is how this works is

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.599 
quick explanation is how this works is
when<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.409> switch<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.649> down<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.250> gives<00:02:05.490> you

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
when the switch is down this gives you

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.219 
when the switch is down this gives you
the<00:02:05.729> magnetic<00:02:05.939> pickups<00:02:06.329> only<00:02:06.659> volume<00:02:07.020> and

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the magnetic pickups only volume and

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.560 
the magnetic pickups only volume and
tone<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.590> 3-way<00:02:07.950> when<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.210> gives

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
tone in the 3-way when it's up it gives

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.010 
tone in the 3-way when it's up it gives
you<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.440> piezo<00:02:10.920> bridge<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.880> this<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> level

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
you the piezo bridge and this is a level

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.230 
you the piezo bridge and this is a level
4<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.410> when<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.100> between<00:02:14.190> number<00:02:15.120> 2

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
4 that when it's in between number 2

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.180 
4 that when it's in between number 2
position<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.660> gives<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.290> combination<00:02:16.860> of

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
position it gives you a combination of

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.730 
position it gives you a combination of
the<00:02:17.670> magnetic<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.810> PA<00:02:18.990> so<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.350> becomes<00:02:19.650> a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
the magnetic and a PA so this becomes a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.830 
the magnetic and a PA so this becomes a
blend<00:02:20.010> between<00:02:20.160> those<00:02:20.910> two<00:02:21.150> pickup<00:02:21.510> systems

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
blend between those two pickup systems

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.360 
blend between those two pickup systems
so<00:02:22.770> here<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.970> magnetic<00:02:24.720> cling

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:40.080 

you

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.570 

that's<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.959> next<00:02:41.110> pickup<00:02:41.520> here's<00:02:42.520> a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
that's the next pickup here's a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:52.160 
that's the next pickup here's a
combination

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:04.750 

and<00:02:52.260> then<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.370> bridge<00:02:53.610> clean

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:22.150 

here's<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.879> piezo

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.280 

and<00:03:22.340> then<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.510> combination<00:03:24.020> of<00:03:24.080> both<00:03:24.230> the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
and then the combination of both the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:33.400 
and then the combination of both the
magnetic<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.160> piezo

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.500 

blend<00:03:34.410> for<00:03:34.590> magnetic

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
blend for magnetic

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.210 
blend for magnetic
-<00:03:37.080> piezo

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
- piezo

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.200 
- piezo
so<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:40.180> mean<00:03:41.020> ideally<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.530> want<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.740> run

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
so I mean ideally you want to run

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.460 
so I mean ideally you want to run
magnetics<00:03:43.210> to<00:03:43.390> a<00:03:43.420> normal<00:03:43.810> guitar<00:03:43.990> amplifier

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
magnetics to a normal guitar amplifier

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.650 
magnetics to a normal guitar amplifier
like<00:03:44.680> I<00:03:44.770> have<00:03:44.920> behind<00:03:45.220> me<00:03:45.370> here<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.420> piezo

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
like I have behind me here and the piezo

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.360 
like I have behind me here and the piezo
tied<00:03:46.990> to<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.200> PA<00:03:47.380> system<00:03:47.680> or<00:03:48.070> maybe<00:03:48.280> an

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
tied to the PA system or maybe an

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.950 
tied to the PA system or maybe an
acoustic<00:03:48.730> amplifier<00:03:49.180> would<00:03:49.360> be<00:03:49.480> better<00:03:49.690> and

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
acoustic amplifier would be better and

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.240 
acoustic amplifier would be better and
split<00:03:50.140> the<00:03:50.230> signal<00:03:50.410> that's<00:03:50.710> the<00:03:50.890> best

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
split the signal that's the best

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.820 
split the signal that's the best
combination<00:03:51.630> but<00:03:52.630> it's<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.200> really<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.470> fabulous

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
combination but it's a really a fabulous

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.940 
combination but it's a really a fabulous
guitar<00:03:54.310> super<00:03:55.090> lightweight<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.900> that<00:03:56.770> gives

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
guitar super lightweight and that gives

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.410 
guitar super lightweight and that gives
you<00:03:57.010> a<00:03:57.040> variety<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.430> sound<00:03:57.670> so<00:03:57.790> there's<00:03:58.360> a

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
you a variety of sound so there's a

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.790 
you a variety of sound so there's a
clean<00:03:58.630> sound<00:03:58.900> so<00:03:59.050> if<00:03:59.110> I<00:03:59.140> go<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.410> overdrive

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
clean sound so if I go to the overdrive

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:09.760 
clean sound so if I go to the overdrive
so<00:04:00.610> here's<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.300> the<00:04:02.290> bridge<00:04:03.190> pickup

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:25.200 

there's<00:04:10.770> a<00:04:10.800> lot<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.040> meat<00:04:11.250> in<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.460> bottom

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.129 

here's<00:04:25.689> the<00:04:25.900> neck<00:04:26.050> pickup

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:41.379 

baby

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.659 

and<00:04:41.960> then<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.289> combination<00:04:42.800> of<00:04:42.889> the<00:04:43.039> neck<00:04:43.550> and

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
and then the combination of the neck and

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:51.040 
and then the combination of the neck and
the<00:04:43.759> bridge

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:05:05.570 

Brij<00:04:53.749> combination<00:04:56.539> the<00:04:57.539> neck

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.580 

so<00:05:06.580> that's<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.300> challah<00:05:07.450> body<00:05:07.660> -<00:05:07.900> really

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
so that's the challah body - really

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.190 
so that's the challah body - really
awesome<00:05:08.890> guitar
