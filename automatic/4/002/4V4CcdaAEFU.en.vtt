actually<00:01:31.560> increase<00:01:31.950> natural<00:01:32.880> testosterone

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
actually increase natural testosterone

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.210 
actually increase natural testosterone
levels<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.440> it<00:01:34.470> has<00:01:34.770> healthy

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
levels because it has healthy

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.399

cholesterol<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.330> cholesterol<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
cholesterol in it and cholesterol is a

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.320 
cholesterol in it and cholesterol is a
catalyst<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.610> production<00:01:39.060> of

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
catalyst to the production of

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.240 
catalyst to the production of
