00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
citrulline malate in one scoop there's

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.460 
citrulline malate in one scoop there's
one

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
ram and a typical pre-workout those

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.480 
ram and a typical pre-workout those
would<00:02:08.170> be<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.470> scoop<00:02:08.770> so<00:02:08.950> you're<00:02:09.070> getting<00:02:09.310> two

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
would be to scoop so you're getting two

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.000 
would be to scoop so you're getting two
grand<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.119> actually<00:02:10.899> contacted<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.800> company

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
grand and actually contacted the company

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.400 
grand and actually contacted the company
and<00:02:12.340> asked<00:02:12.610> them<00:02:12.700> why<00:02:12.940> there<00:02:13.810> was<00:02:13.930> only<00:02:13.960> two

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
and asked them why there was only two

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.710 
and asked them why there was only two
grams<00:02:14.770> as<00:02:14.980> opposed<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.670> recommended<00:02:16.510> dose

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
grams as opposed to the recommended dose

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.720 
grams as opposed to the recommended dose
which<00:02:16.960> is<00:02:17.110> eight<00:02:17.290> grams<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.460> had

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
which is eight grams and it had

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.210 
which is eight grams and it had
something<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.150> do<00:02:19.360> with<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.900> mix<00:02:20.500> ability<00:02:20.980> and

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
something to do with the mix ability and

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.790 
something to do with the mix ability and
the<00:02:21.250> fact<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.170> centrally<00:02:23.170> in<00:02:23.230> clumps<00:02:23.530> up

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
the fact that centrally in clumps up

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.520 
the fact that centrally in clumps up
when<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.550> sits<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:24.970> powder<00:02:25.210> for<00:02:25.540> too<00:02:25.660> long<00:02:25.840> so

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
when it sits in a powder for too long so

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.290 
when it sits in a powder for too long so
it<00:02:26.590> was<00:02:26.710> just<00:02:26.860> something<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:27.250> they<00:02:27.640> couldn't

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
it was just something that they couldn't

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.480 
it was just something that they couldn't
do<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.140> keep<00:02:29.470> their<00:02:30.720> product<00:02:31.720> powdery<00:02:32.490> right

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
do and keep their product powdery right

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.280 
do and keep their product powdery right
so<00:02:33.850> uh<00:02:33.880> if<00:02:34.270> you're<00:02:34.450> going<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.600> be<00:02:34.750> stacking<00:02:35.200> it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
so uh if you're going to be stacking it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.650 
so uh if you're going to be stacking it
with<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.500> intro<00:02:35.740> flight<00:02:35.890> two<00:02:36.820> grams<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.330> okay

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
with the intro flight two grams is okay

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.510 
with the intro flight two grams is okay
here<00:02:37.930> if<00:02:38.110> you're<00:02:38.560> not<00:02:38.680> going<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:38.890> be<00:02:39.010> stacking

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
here if you're not going to be stacking

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.520 
here if you're not going to be stacking
them<00:02:39.640> then<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:40.030> would<00:02:40.240> we<00:02:40.720> have<00:02:40.840> both<00:02:41.020> recommend

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
them then I would we have both recommend

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.560 
them then I would we have both recommend
adding<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.160> little<00:02:42.370> supplementing<00:02:43.150> with<00:02:43.180> your

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
adding a little supplementing with your

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.630 
adding a little supplementing with your
own<00:02:43.690> citrulline<00:02:44.260> malate<00:02:44.440> there's<00:02:45.070> also<00:02:45.250> no

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
own citrulline malate there's also no

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.250 
own citrulline malate there's also no
creatine<00:02:46.209> in<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.690> if<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.840> take<00:02:46.990> creatine

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
creatine in it so if you take creatine

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.110 
creatine in it so if you take creatine
you<00:02:47.590> have<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.800> take<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:47.980> separate<00:02:48.520> right<00:02:48.910> but

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
you have to take that separate right but

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.850 
you have to take that separate right but
that's<00:02:49.209> not<00:02:49.420> really<00:02:49.630> necessary<00:02:49.860> pre-workout

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
that's not really necessary pre-workout

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.410 
that's not really necessary pre-workout
it's<00:02:51.040> just<00:02:51.220> something<00:02:51.550> that<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:52.090> should<00:02:52.270> take

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
it's just something that you should take

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.440 
it's just something that you should take
the<00:02:52.450> pre<00:02:52.810> workouts<00:02:53.200> might<00:02:53.470> have<00:02:53.709> that<00:02:54.450> this

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
the pre workouts might have that this

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.420 
the pre workouts might have that this
one<00:02:55.660> doesn't<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.470> it's<00:02:56.800> not<00:02:56.950> really<00:02:57.010> necessary

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
one doesn't so it's not really necessary

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.690 
one doesn't so it's not really necessary
of<00:02:57.940> like<00:02:58.360> he<00:02:58.480> said<00:02:58.690> pre-workout<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.530> so<00:03:00.370> for

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
of like he said pre-workout and so for

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.040 
of like he said pre-workout and so for
the<00:03:00.790> intro<00:03:01.090> flight<00:03:01.240> like<00:03:01.570> we<00:03:01.720> said<00:03:01.840> if<00:03:01.959> you're

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
the intro flight like we said if you're

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.320 
the intro flight like we said if you're
going<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.260> stack<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.620> with<00:03:03.070> this<00:03:03.430> it's<00:03:03.760> you'd

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
going to stack it with this it's you'd

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.050 
going to stack it with this it's you'd
be<00:03:04.510> getting<00:03:04.660> enough<00:03:05.110> citrulline<00:03:06.040> this<00:03:06.850> has

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
be getting enough citrulline this has

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.670 
be getting enough citrulline this has
two<00:03:07.300> grams<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.720> citrulline<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.350> this<00:03:08.470> has

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
two grams of citrulline and this has

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.310 
two grams of citrulline and this has
three<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:10.000> intra<00:03:10.300> has<00:03:10.450> three<00:03:10.750> in<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.019> but<00:03:11.230> it

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
three the intra has three in it but it

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.310 
three the intra has three in it but it
also<00:03:11.440> has<00:03:11.739> 500<00:03:12.459> milligrams<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:13.000> magma<00:03:13.330> teen<00:03:13.510> so

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
also has 500 milligrams of magma teen so

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.220 
also has 500 milligrams of magma teen so
the<00:03:14.470> effect<00:03:14.830> for<00:03:15.250> vasodilation<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.510> we<00:03:16.989> didn't

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
the effect for vasodilation is we didn't

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.020 
the effect for vasodilation is we didn't
notice<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.500> difference<00:03:17.769> between<00:03:18.040> taking<00:03:18.730> our

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
notice a difference between taking our

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.750 
notice a difference between taking our
typical<00:03:19.239> 8<00:03:19.750> grams<00:03:20.739> of<00:03:21.010> citrulline<00:03:21.550> malate

typical 8 grams of citrulline malate
that<00:03:22.180> we<00:03:22.269> usually<00:03:22.600> take<00:03:22.780> right<00:03:23.459> what<00:03:24.459> else<00:03:24.489> is

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
that we usually take right what else is

that we usually take right what else is
in<00:03:24.940> this<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:25.390> it's<00:03:25.870> pretty<00:03:26.320> much<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.530> BCA<00:03:26.950> a

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
in this is it's pretty much a BCA a

typical<00:03:36.670> vca<00:03:37.150> supplement<00:03:37.780> with<00:03:37.870> ten<00:03:38.110> grams<00:03:38.489> so

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
typical vca supplement with ten grams so

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.759 
typical vca supplement with ten grams so
that's<00:03:39.850> pretty<00:03:40.180> good<00:03:40.420> ratios<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.470> because

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
that's pretty good ratios to because

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.930 
that's pretty good ratios to because
