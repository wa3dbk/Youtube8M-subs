Welcome to Final Cut Pro X in Under 5 Minutes.
I’m Steve from RippleTraining.com. Based

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.049
on the positive feedback from last week’s
Pixelmator tutorial, I’d like to show you

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.770
another useful iOS app called TwistedWave
that allows you to record, edit and upload

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.869
audio for syncing in Final Cut Pro X.

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.990
On a typical interview shoot it’s not uncommon
to have a lot of gear. Here’s what my gear

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.340
bag typically contains: cameras, lenses, preamps,
digitals audio recorders, microphones, cables,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.440
cards, batteries, and so on. And while all
this stuff certainly is important for getting

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.410
professional results, there are times when
I just need a down and dirty solution for

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.910
recording a quick interview on the fly.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.280
One of my favorite apps is this audio recorder/editor
from TwistedWave, available on the app store

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.430
for both iPhone and iPad. Using this awesome
little $100 LaV mic from RODE, I simply connect

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.390
one end to my iDevice, and the other end to
my talent.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.450
After launching the app, tap the “plus”
button to create a document. Choose a sample

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.700
rate, and a recording mode; either stereo
or mono. You’ll need to do a test recording

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.000
to set your input gain.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.270
Tap record for the audio, then roll your camera.
If you plan on syncing the recorded audio

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.209
with your camera in Final Cut Pro X, it’s
imperative that your video camera is recording

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:19.659
reference audio. Since I’m shooting with
an iPhone 6, the built-in mic will work just

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:20.999
swell.

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:24.759
After recording you can play back the audio to verify you have it. 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.120
But more importantly, you can edit right in the app to clean it up.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.020
 Using familiar iOS gestures, you can zoom in or out of the waveform,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.040
tap to move the playhead where you want to
begin editing,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.299
then slide your finger to make selections.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.749
Here I want to remove this bit of noise between
Zion’s words.

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:46.219
Tap the gear icon, then choose from a variety
of built-in audio effects.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.659
Here, I’ll choose Silence.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.779
I also want to remove some of the unwanted
audio at the beginning of the take. I’ll

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:56.299
slide to select, then tap the X to remove
the audio.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.560
If you plan on syncing your audio, it’s
important that you do not remove sections

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.889
from the middle of the recording; only unwanted
audio at the beginning and end of your takes.

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:08.399
Here’s a feature that I wish existed in
Final Cut Pro X. Sometimes your audio gets

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.040
recorded at levels that are less than optimal.
By selecting the entire waveform, then tapping

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.750
the gear, you can choose Normalize which allows
you to increase the overall gain to a target

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.170
level while maintaining the overall dynamics
of the sound.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.780
Once you’ve made your edits, you’re ready
to export. Tap the share button, then choose

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.110
an audio format. For Final Cut Pro choose
AIFF; the standard audio file format for the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.580
Mac. If you want, you can also rename your
audio file. Finally, choose a destination

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.420
for your file. You can FTP it to a server,
upload it to Dropbox or even email a link

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.560
to the file, which is my favorite option.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.280
Open your mail, click the link and the file
is downloaded using your web browser.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.340
In Final Cut Pro, after importing the camera
and audio files, you’re now ready to sync

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.650
them. Select both clips then right-click and
choose Synchronize Clips. Rename your clip

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.460
if you want, and make sure Use audio for synchronization is checked.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.250
Click OK.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.780
Final Cut Pro’s awesome synching algorithm
goes to work and in a few seconds, a synchronized

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.220
clip is created in the Browser.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.820
To check sync, open the inspector then reveal
the channel configuration. The storyline audio

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.770
is from the camera and the Connected audio
is from the lav mic.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.780
Let’s compare.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.680
Here’s Zion’s audio recorded with 
the iPhone’s mic.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.020
Now, here is his audio recorded with the
lav mic.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.590
Given the right environment, your iPhone and
a $100 mic can yield incredible results; which

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.780
is why I always carry around this little mic
with me wherever I go.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.140
