that code stuff and I've expect this to
be<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.869> exact<00:00:31.170> same<00:00:31.260> thing<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.009> nexus

what's such a high pixel Vince states in

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.180 
what's such a high pixel Vince states in
was<00:00:51.930> going<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.710> useless

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
was going to be you know just useless

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.920 
was going to be you know just useless
it's<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.820> ridiculously<00:00:54.600> clear

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it's going to be just ridiculously clear

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.569 
it's going to be just ridiculously clear
and<00:00:55.170> crisp<00:00:55.440> especially<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.460> something

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and crisp especially if it's something

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.369 
and crisp especially if it's something
like<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.820> super<00:00:57.180> amoled<00:00:57.629> or<00:00:58.020> anything<00:00:58.320> like

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
that so the display on the nexus prime

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.299 
that so the display on the nexus prime
is<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.140> top-notch<00:01:01.649> absolutely

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
is going to be top-notch absolutely

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
is going to be top-notch absolutely
without<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.550> question<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.300> top<00:01:03.809> led<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> very

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
major impact on the world and tech world

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.180 
major impact on the world and tech world
and<00:05:54.389> everything<00:05:54.569> so<00:05:54.930> I<00:05:55.110> mean<00:05:55.590> I<00:05:55.770> know<00:05:55.889> a<00:05:56.009> lot<00:05:56.130> of

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
and everything so I mean I know a lot of

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.800 
and everything so I mean I know a lot of
people<00:05:56.279> don't<00:05:56.580> disagree<00:05:56.789> with<00:05:56.940> a<00:05:57.060> lot<00:05:57.210> of

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
people don't disagree with a lot of

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.600 
people don't disagree with a lot of
people<00:05:57.960> do<00:05:58.169> disagree<00:05:58.469> with<00:05:58.710> apples<00:05:59.130> and

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
people do disagree with apples and

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.860 
people do disagree with apples and
policy<00:06:00.029> and<00:06:00.120> all<00:06:00.150> kind<00:06:00.389> of<00:06:00.419> stuff<00:06:00.479> and<00:06:00.690> I<00:06:00.750> can

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
policy and all kind of stuff and I can

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.689 
policy and all kind of stuff and I can
understand<00:06:01.259> that<00:06:01.319> but<00:06:01.440> I'm<00:06:02.039> think<00:06:02.279> anyone<00:06:02.580> can

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
understand that but I'm think anyone can

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.469 
understand that but I'm think anyone can
deny<00:06:02.969> that<00:06:03.270> Steve<00:06:03.569> Jobs<00:06:03.599> was<00:06:04.229> a<00:06:04.440> real<00:06:04.819> a<00:06:05.819> really

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
deny that Steve Jobs was a real a really

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.450 
deny that Steve Jobs was a real a really
special<00:06:06.900> person<00:06:07.259> really<00:06:07.770> person<00:06:08.069> who<00:06:08.190> had<00:06:08.310> an

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
special person really person who had an

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.850 
special person really person who had an
eye<00:06:08.699> for<00:06:09.000> you<00:06:09.630> know<00:06:09.690> what<00:06:09.840> made<00:06:10.050> an<00:06:10.169> idea<00:06:10.440> great

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
eye for you know what made an idea great

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.430 
eye for you know what made an idea great
and<00:06:11.159> I<00:06:11.250> think<00:06:11.460> that<00:06:11.669> Apple<00:06:12.449> is<00:06:12.719> maybe<00:06:13.380> not

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
and I think that Apple is maybe not

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.959 
and I think that Apple is maybe not
gonna<00:06:13.680> really<00:06:13.889> start<00:06:14.069> hurting<00:06:14.490> now<00:06:14.669> that<00:06:14.849> he's

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:14.969 
gonna really start hurting now that he's

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.399 
gonna really start hurting now that he's
gone<00:06:15.120> but<00:06:15.449> it's<00:06:15.599> definitely<00:06:15.779> a<00:06:15.960> sad<00:06:16.169> day<00:06:16.380> for

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
gone but it's definitely a sad day for

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.209 
gone but it's definitely a sad day for
the<00:06:16.650> tech<00:06:16.830> industry<00:06:17.009> as<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.550> whole<00:06:18.080> um<00:06:19.219> what

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
the tech industry as a whole um what

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:21.499 
the tech industry as a whole um what
kind<00:06:20.340> of<00:06:20.460> chips<00:06:20.729> do<00:06:20.909> you<00:06:20.969> think<00:06:21.210> will<00:06:21.389> be

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
kind of chips do you think will be

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:24.959 
kind of chips do you think will be
inside<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:21.870> ipad<00:06:22.259> for<00:06:22.740> on<00:06:23.639> about<00:06:23.880> the<00:06:23.940> ipad<00:06:24.300> 4

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:24.969 
inside the ipad for on about the ipad 4

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:27.209 
inside the ipad for on about the ipad 4
it's<00:06:25.209> who<00:06:25.749> knows<00:06:25.959> what<00:06:26.169> will<00:06:26.259> be<00:06:26.379> around<00:06:26.649> by

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:27.219 
it's who knows what will be around by

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:28.919 
it's who knows what will be around by
then<00:06:27.429> but<00:06:27.610> I<00:06:27.669> do<00:06:27.819> think<00:06:27.939> the<00:06:28.089> ipad<00:06:28.419> 3<00:06:28.629> will<00:06:28.779> most

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:28.929 
then but I do think the ipad 3 will most

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:30.959 
then but I do think the ipad 3 will most
likely<00:06:29.110> have<00:06:29.409> a<00:06:29.439> quad-core<00:06:29.799> processor<00:06:30.699> it

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:30.969 
likely have a quad-core processor it

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:33.419 
likely have a quad-core processor it
just<00:06:31.149> makes<00:06:31.299> sense<00:06:31.949> mostly<00:06:32.949> in<00:06:33.009> pretty<00:06:33.399> much

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:33.429 
just makes sense mostly in pretty much

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:35.339 
just makes sense mostly in pretty much
the<00:06:33.519> entire<00:06:33.669> industry<00:06:34.209> is<00:06:34.269> moving<00:06:34.389> over<00:06:34.779> from

see reason why the next apple a6 chip I

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.919 
see reason why the next apple a6 chip I
suppose<00:06:42.159> it<00:06:42.279> would<00:06:42.309> be<00:06:42.489> in<00:06:43.149> the<00:06:43.239> ipad<00:06:43.629> and
