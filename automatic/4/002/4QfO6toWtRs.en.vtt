00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and i made the mistake of assuming that

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.779 
and i made the mistake of assuming that
this<00:00:25.980> end<00:00:26.689> was<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.050> screw<00:00:28.380> into<00:00:28.789> this

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
end and it's actually made to have an

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.920 
end and it's actually made to have an
adapter<00:00:35.100> go<00:00:35.399> between<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.860> i<00:00:38.809> doubt<00:00:39.809> i'm

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
adapter go between it so i doubt i'm

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.830 
adapter go between it so i doubt i'm

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
all together as one unit but I measured

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.510 
all together as one unit but I measured
my<00:01:52.200> fam<00:01:52.729> spacing<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.909> little<00:01:54.090> bit<00:01:54.299> too<00:01:55.110> well

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
my fam spacing it a little bit too well

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.920 
my fam spacing it a little bit too well
this<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.670> pretty<00:01:56.880> well<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.329> try<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> get<00:01:57.840> them

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
this is pretty well I try to get them

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.560 
this is pretty well I try to get them
back<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> exact<00:01:58.619> same<00:01:58.860> spot<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.570> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
back in the exact same spot and the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.499 
back in the exact same spot and the
radiator<00:02:01.049> will<00:02:01.710> not<00:02:01.950> line<00:02:02.850> up<00:02:02.880> with<00:02:03.090> these

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
radiator will not line up with these

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.730 
radiator will not line up with these
because<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:04.520> this

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
because of this

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.040 
because of this
then<00:02:05.950> right<00:02:06.189> here<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.490> hits<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.880> so<00:02:07.240> they're

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
then right here it hits it so they're

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.260 
then right here it hits it so they're
going<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.259> be<00:02:08.319> a<00:02:08.349> little<00:02:08.470> off<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:09.250> would<00:02:10.179> rather

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
going to be a little off I would rather

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.699 
going to be a little off I would rather
have<00:02:10.599> my<00:02:11.410> fans<00:02:11.709> lined<00:02:12.069> up<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.930> my<00:02:14.050> grades<00:02:14.380> to

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
have my fans lined up to my grades to

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.290 
have my fans lined up to my grades to
get<00:02:14.860> good<00:02:15.069> airflow<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:18.160> radiator<00:02:18.910> will

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
get good airflow and the radiator will

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.570 
get good airflow and the radiator will
just<00:02:19.480> sit<00:02:19.630> on<00:02:19.660> top<00:02:19.989> of<00:02:20.020> it<00:02:20.319> but<00:02:20.560> as<00:02:21.250> you'll<00:02:21.430> see

see<00:03:08.769> I've<00:03:09.220> got<00:03:09.250> these<00:03:09.549> indents<00:03:10.150> here<00:03:10.390> to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
see I've got these indents here to

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.360 
see I've got these indents here to
contend<00:03:10.900> with<00:03:10.989> if<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:11.980> didn't<00:03:12.220> have

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
contend with if you didn't have

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.509 
contend with if you didn't have
something<00:03:13.829> this<00:03:14.829> time<00:03:15.040> would<00:03:15.160> be<00:03:15.220> setting

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
something this time would be setting

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.789 
something this time would be setting
that<00:03:15.730> pyre<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.090> then<00:03:16.480> over<00:03:17.140> here<00:03:17.170> this<00:03:17.650> one

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
that pyre and then over here this one

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.099 
that pyre and then over here this one
would<00:03:17.980> set<00:03:18.310> on<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.549> but<00:03:19.450> then<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.660> would<00:03:19.810> kill

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
would set on it but then it would kill

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.530 
would set on it but then it would kill
down<00:03:20.410> because<00:03:20.799> that<00:03:21.609> indents<00:03:22.030> not<00:03:22.239> over<00:03:22.420> here

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
down because that indents not over here

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.039 
down because that indents not over here
to<00:03:22.630> hold<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:22.930> one<00:03:23.109> up<00:03:23.260> so<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:24.570> fabulous<00:03:25.570> year

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.080 

this<00:03:29.049> basically<00:03:29.350> just<00:03:29.680> gives<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.430> fan

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.809 

something<00:03:34.090> really<00:03:34.720> nice<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:36.160> set<00:03:36.400> on<00:03:36.549> and

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
something really nice to set on and

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.370 
something really nice to set on and
it'll<00:03:39.819> be<00:03:39.940> nice<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.120> flush<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:41.079> then<00:03:41.230> I'll

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
it'll be nice and flush and then I'll

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.430 
it'll be nice and flush and then I'll
bow<00:03:41.530> down<00:03:41.859> got<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.250> go<00:03:42.340> buy<00:03:42.519> me<00:03:42.579> some<00:03:43.440> smaller

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
bow down got to go buy me some smaller

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.580 
bow down got to go buy me some smaller
bolts<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.030> can<00:03:46.299> bolt<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.600> down<00:03:49.440> but<00:03:50.440> that

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
bolts so I can bolt it down but that

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.069 
bolts so I can bolt it down but that
will<00:03:50.769> be<00:03:50.889> that<00:03:54.150> I've<00:03:55.150> got<00:03:55.359> my<00:03:55.450> radiator<00:03:55.840> put

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
will be that I've got my radiator put

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.170 
will be that I've got my radiator put
together<00:03:56.350> here<00:03:56.680> that<00:03:57.400> are<00:03:57.489> all<00:03:57.609> flushed<00:03:57.970> out

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
together here that are all flushed out

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.559 
together here that are all flushed out
ready<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.630> go<00:04:02.549> okay<00:04:03.549> so<00:04:03.609> we're<00:04:04.269> gonna<00:04:04.359> have<00:04:04.480> an

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
ready to go okay so we're gonna have an

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.000 
ready to go okay so we're gonna have an
in<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:05.049> out<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:07.030> here<00:04:07.060> is<00:04:07.829> going<00:04:08.829> to<00:04:08.920> be

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
in and out and this here is going to be

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.059 
in and out and this here is going to be
a<00:04:09.040> drain<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:09.790> this<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:10.959> one<00:04:11.170> tight<00:04:11.470> fit<00:04:11.829> with

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
a drain and this is one tight fit with

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.259 
a drain and this is one tight fit with
this<00:04:12.190> radiator<00:04:12.609> I'm<00:04:12.760> telling<00:04:13.030> you<00:04:13.120> right<00:04:13.150> now

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
this radiator I'm telling you right now

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.920 
this radiator I'm telling you right now
once<00:04:14.229> you<00:04:14.350> get<00:04:14.440> this<00:04:14.590> 90<00:04:15.070> on<00:04:15.220> here<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:16.750> is

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
once you get this 90 on here it is

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.270 
once you get this 90 on here it is
exactly<00:04:17.290> two<00:04:17.979> feet<00:04:18.250> long

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
exactly two feet long

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.650 
exactly two feet long
and<00:04:19.370> that<00:04:19.549> is<00:04:19.700> what<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.000> inside<00:04:20.269> of<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.450> case

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
and that is what the inside of the case

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.640 
and that is what the inside of the case
is<00:04:20.980> so<00:04:22.510> this<00:04:23.510> will<00:04:23.720> basically<00:04:23.840> this<00:04:24.260> end<00:04:24.500> right

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
is so this will basically this end right

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.680 
is so this will basically this end right
here<00:04:24.830> will<00:04:25.010> be<00:04:25.100> setting<00:04:25.490> towards<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.360> back<00:04:26.540> of

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
here will be setting towards the back of

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.690 
here will be setting towards the back of
the<00:04:26.750> case<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:28.580> 90s<00:04:28.940> point<00:04:29.240> down<00:04:29.570> towards<00:04:30.700> this

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
the case the 90s point down towards this

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.810 
the case the 90s point down towards this
whole<00:04:32.240> it's<00:04:32.419> already<00:04:32.660> cut<00:04:32.870> in<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.020> case<00:04:33.290> and

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.330 

the<00:04:37.820> sound<00:04:38.240> foam<00:04:38.600> actually<00:04:39.260> makes<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.130> really

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
the sound foam actually makes a really

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.580 
the sound foam actually makes a really
tight<00:04:40.760> fit<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:41.330> will<00:04:41.600> fit<00:04:41.990> but<00:04:42.200> you<00:04:42.260> have<00:04:42.440> to

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
tight fit it will fit but you have to

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.930 
tight fit it will fit but you have to
push<00:04:42.770> it<00:04:42.919> in<00:04:43.010> matters<00:04:43.250> actually<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.610> will

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
push it in matters actually I will

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.270 
push it in matters actually I will
indent<00:04:44.389> right<00:04:44.600> here<00:04:44.780> if<00:04:45.470> you<00:04:45.530> can<00:04:45.830> see<00:04:45.860> that<00:04:46.040> or

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
indent right here if you can see that or

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.050 
indent right here if you can see that or
not<00:04:46.310> from<00:04:46.669> where<00:04:46.820> I<00:04:47.090> had<00:04:47.840> it<00:04:47.960> push<00:04:48.200> tannin<00:04:48.680> and

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
not from where I had it push tannin and

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.370 
not from where I had it push tannin and
it's<00:04:50.060> crushed<00:04:50.389> all<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.660> phone<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:51.020> can<00:04:51.200> feel

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
it's crushed all the phone I can feel

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.300 
it's crushed all the phone I can feel
the<00:04:51.530> metal<00:04:51.800> there<00:04:51.950> but<00:04:53.140> it<00:04:54.140> still<00:04:54.410> fits<00:04:54.950> it's

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
the metal there but it still fits it's

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.060 
the metal there but it still fits it's
pretty<00:04:55.940> tight<00:04:56.330> but<00:04:56.840> it's<00:04:57.320> not<00:04:57.530> so<00:04:57.740> tight<00:04:58.040> that

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
pretty tight but it's not so tight that

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.120 
pretty tight but it's not so tight that
it<00:04:59.350> feels<00:05:00.350> like<00:05:00.470> it's<00:05:00.710> going<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:00.950> break

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
it feels like it's going to break

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.500 
it feels like it's going to break
something<00:05:01.460> but<00:05:01.669> once<00:05:01.850> that's<00:05:02.000> in<00:05:02.240> there<00:05:02.360> that

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
something but once that's in there that

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.040 
something but once that's in there that
radiator<00:05:02.960> does<00:05:03.260> not<00:05:03.590> move<00:05:04.540> so<00:05:05.540> from<00:05:05.810> here<00:05:08.050> that

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
radiator does not move so from here that

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.170 
radiator does not move so from here that
90<00:05:09.410> is<00:05:09.470> going<00:05:09.620> to<00:05:09.680> go<00:05:09.770> down<00:05:09.850> through<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:10.940> case

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
90 is going to go down through the case

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.620 
90 is going to go down through the case
and<00:05:11.570> then<00:05:11.900> this<00:05:12.890> is<00:05:13.070> actually<00:05:13.760> let's<00:05:14.510> keep

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
and then this is actually let's keep

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.760 
and then this is actually let's keep
this<00:05:14.720> up<00:05:14.930> here<00:05:15.080> in<00:05:15.140> a<00:05:15.169> light<00:05:15.350> where<00:05:15.560> you<00:05:15.620> can

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
this up here in a light where you can

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.990 
this up here in a light where you can
see<00:05:15.950> it<00:05:16.510> this<00:05:17.510> is<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:18.919> mount<00:05:19.190> that<00:05:19.639> sits<00:05:19.910> on

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
see it this is the mount that sits on

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.580 
see it this is the mount that sits on
the<00:05:20.120> outside<00:05:20.419> the<00:05:20.540> case<00:05:20.750> that<00:05:21.050> this<00:05:21.320> part

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
the outside the case that this part

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.090 
the outside the case that this part
sucks<00:05:21.770> on<00:05:21.979> so<00:05:23.590> basically<00:05:24.590> you've<00:05:24.740> got<00:05:24.890> going

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
sucks on so basically you've got going

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.370 
sucks on so basically you've got going
the<00:05:25.160> wrong<00:05:25.280> way<00:05:25.340> here<00:05:25.840> so<00:05:26.840> basically<00:05:27.229> this

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
the wrong way here so basically this

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.350 
the wrong way here so basically this
sets<00:05:27.740> directly<00:05:28.460> underneath<00:05:28.700> it<00:05:29.030> just<00:05:29.180> like

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
sets directly underneath it just like

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.210 
sets directly underneath it just like
that<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.830> then<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.100> case<00:05:31.310> sets<00:05:31.700> on<00:05:32.360> top<00:05:32.600> of<00:05:32.810> it

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
that and then the case sets on top of it

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:40.240 
that and then the case sets on top of it
so<00:05:35.800> jumbled<00:05:36.800> out<00:05:36.890> a<00:05:36.919> channel<00:05:37.400> out<00:05:37.940> of<00:05:38.150> it<00:05:39.250> to

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
so jumbled out a channel out of it to

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.710 
so jumbled out a channel out of it to
run<00:05:40.460> my<00:05:40.610> tubing<00:05:41.110> to<00:05:42.110> get<00:05:42.350> better<00:05:43.720> lighting

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
run my tubing to get better lighting

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:52.150 
run my tubing to get better lighting
here<00:05:46.330> so<00:05:48.520> what<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:49.550> did<00:05:49.669> was<00:05:49.789> bought<00:05:50.500> a<00:05:51.500> quick

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
here so what I did was bought a quick

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.100 
here so what I did was bought a quick
disconnect<00:05:53.710> and

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.740 

I<00:05:57.400> made<00:05:58.400> sure<00:05:58.430> that<00:05:58.700> I<00:05:58.910> dreamt<00:05:59.210> out<00:05:59.450> just

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
I made sure that I dreamt out just

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.370 
I made sure that I dreamt out just
enough<00:05:59.870> to<00:06:00.560> get<00:06:00.740> that<00:06:01.100> in<00:06:01.400> there<00:06:01.670> so<00:06:02.360> that<00:06:02.660> the

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
enough to get that in there so that the

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.600 
enough to get that in there so that the
front<00:06:03.710> part<00:06:04.010> could<00:06:04.220> not<00:06:05.770> travel<00:06:06.770> back<00:06:07.040> out<00:06:07.280> or

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
front part could not travel back out or

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.690 
front part could not travel back out or
be<00:06:08.270> pushed<00:06:08.510> back<00:06:08.720> in<00:06:08.960> i<00:06:09.050> guess<00:06:09.260> because<00:06:09.700> it

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
be pushed back in i guess because it

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.070 
be pushed back in i guess because it
takes<00:06:10.910> quite<00:06:11.120> a<00:06:11.180> bit<00:06:11.240> of<00:06:11.360> force<00:06:11.630> to<00:06:11.690> hook<00:06:11.960> these

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
takes quite a bit of force to hook these

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.200 
takes quite a bit of force to hook these
up<00:06:12.140> and<00:06:12.560> i<00:06:12.620> didn't<00:06:12.860> want<00:06:12.890> to<00:06:13.100> get<00:06:13.670> this<00:06:13.850> all<00:06:14.030> put

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
up and i didn't want to get this all put

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.550 
up and i didn't want to get this all put
back<00:06:14.240> together<00:06:14.480> and<00:06:14.840> then<00:06:14.930> go<00:06:15.050> to<00:06:15.080> drain<00:06:15.410> it

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
back together and then go to drain it

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.190 
back together and then go to drain it
and<00:06:15.700> go<00:06:16.700> to<00:06:16.760> hook<00:06:16.880> up<00:06:17.060> my<00:06:17.090> quick<00:06:17.660> disconnect

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
and go to hook up my quick disconnect

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.280 
and go to hook up my quick disconnect
and<00:06:18.320> push<00:06:18.530> this<00:06:18.740> fitting<00:06:19.460> back<00:06:19.960> into<00:06:20.960> the<00:06:21.080> case

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.290 
and push this fitting back into the case

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.660 
and push this fitting back into the case
and<00:06:21.590> then<00:06:21.710> have<00:06:21.830> to<00:06:21.920> tear<00:06:22.100> it<00:06:22.190> apart<00:06:22.250> to<00:06:22.460> get<00:06:22.610> it

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
and then have to tear it apart to get it

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.000 
and then have to tear it apart to get it
back<00:06:22.790> out<00:06:23.030> so<00:06:23.360> i<00:06:23.650> might<00:06:24.650> try<00:06:24.680> to<00:06:24.830> figure

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
back out so i might try to figure

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.070 
back out so i might try to figure
something<00:06:25.100> else<00:06:25.520> out<00:06:25.790> to<00:06:25.970> kind<00:06:26.120> of<00:06:26.240> reinforce

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
something else out to kind of reinforce

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.620 
something else out to kind of reinforce
that<00:06:28.390> so<00:06:29.390> that<00:06:30.310> you<00:06:31.310> don't<00:06:31.490> really<00:06:31.670> there's<00:06:32.480> no

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
that so that you don't really there's no

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.490 
that so that you don't really there's no
possible<00:06:33.110> way<00:06:33.170> for<00:06:33.320> it<00:06:33.680> to<00:06:33.740> move<00:06:34.010> back<00:06:34.730> out<00:06:35.060> so

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
possible way for it to move back out so

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.770 
possible way for it to move back out so
there'll<00:06:36.500> be<00:06:36.530> a<00:06:36.620> piece<00:06:36.860> of<00:06:36.890> tubing<00:06:37.310> that

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
there'll be a piece of tubing that

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.380 
there'll be a piece of tubing that
travels<00:06:38.780> back<00:06:38.990> up<00:06:39.200> into<00:06:39.410> here<00:06:40.120> up<00:06:41.120> through

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:41.390 
travels back up into here up through

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.430 
travels back up into here up through
this<00:06:41.510> hole<00:06:41.620> into<00:06:42.620> the<00:06:42.710> 90<00:06:43.160> and<00:06:43.600> if<00:06:44.600> all<00:06:44.840> goes

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
this hole into the 90 and if all goes

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.710 
this hole into the 90 and if all goes
well<00:06:46.780> it'll<00:06:47.780> work<00:06:47.990> like<00:06:48.170> a<00:06:48.200> charm<00:06:48.260> so<00:06:49.720> that's

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
well it'll work like a charm so that's

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.050 
well it'll work like a charm so that's
where<00:06:50.870> we're<00:06:51.020> at<00:06:51.050> right<00:06:51.260> now<00:06:51.820> maybe<00:06:52.820> some

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
where we're at right now maybe some

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.330 
where we're at right now maybe some
shorter<00:06:53.990> bolts<00:06:54.290> start<00:06:55.010> putting<00:06:55.220> this<00:06:55.280> thing

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
shorter bolts start putting this thing

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.910 
shorter bolts start putting this thing
together<00:06:55.580> and<00:06:56.330> i'll<00:06:57.200> make<00:06:57.380> another<00:06:57.500> video<00:06:57.860> uh

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
together and i'll make another video uh

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.610 
together and i'll make another video uh
a<00:06:58.640> little<00:06:59.120> bit<00:06:59.300> further<00:06:59.480> down<00:06:59.570> the<00:06:59.750> road<00:06:59.870> get

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
a little bit further down the road get

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.300 
a little bit further down the road get
you<00:07:00.710> guys<00:07:00.830> later<00:07:01.070> thanks<00:07:01.730> bye
