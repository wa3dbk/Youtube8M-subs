00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.810
 good for the boys as already announced in the 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.640
 previous videos 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.590
 today I'll show you how to build 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.420
 the secret weapon of the black zombie map 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.600
 ops 2 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.250
 once taken the bus to the first 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.890
 stop at the bus station 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.020
 immediately run down into the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.660
 tunnel to the underpass where there are 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.430
 all machines destroyed 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.040
 Fri try and find a crumb sides 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.450
 turbine of an airplane and giant in this 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.550
 case I found it in this corner 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.040
 you don't see it, unfortunately for a 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.260
 error a bug in the cinema of the game made 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.390
 very badly you don't see it you see 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.700
 I just take it like you've seen it 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.010
 got the turbine the second object 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.020
 instead of a handle and found it in 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.239
 map from teheran toth hun 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.460
 if you don't know how to get in the videos or 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.860
 already in the previous videos I show 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.170
 just how to get on this map 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.120
 as usual it should be searched for everywhere 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.299
 in this case I found it up here 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.490
 above the shelf do not see it as 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.289
 first, as I have already explained, but see 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.149
 now that I've got it 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.280
 look well because in here watts e 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.380
 other objects also find a radio if 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.499
 I am not mistaken so you take the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.200
 handle the third object is a cable and lo 

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:22.909
 found in the third stop if not 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.600
 mistake where there is where it is activated 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.369
 electricity in the bright room is a 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.310
 hollow you see it as a kind of 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.639
 reel string searched as usual 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.560
 below in the lower side usually 

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:39.799
 you should find it for a while 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.599
 everywhere as long as you find it here 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.310
 now they go on a little faster vi 

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:47.270
 I'll show you where I found it e 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.389
 where it is usually found 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.299
 right where I jumped down on it 

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:56.989
 these electrical things I don't know how 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.359
 say now you will see that I took it e 

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:01.999
 let's move on to the fourth object and last 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.590
 object is a barometer to you will result 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:06.469
 as a kind of dynamo for the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.630
 bicycle a kind of e bulb though 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.289
 is a barometer take precisely from 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.500
 area 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.689
 where is the bus leticia and when 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.230
 you see a lamppost on your left 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:20.150
 which is illuminated in this case by me is 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.519
 lit green can also be 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.780
 illuminated with a normal white light 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.510
 anyway when you see street lamp go down 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.620
 let the bus pass followed to 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.870
 a few meters the bus to 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.090
 lamp post and immediately after the lamp post a 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.730
 right you will find a mega rock one 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.299
 giant rock and go right 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.150
 you will find these fields in the distance 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.859
 a fire on the ground found the fire 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.750
 manager you towards that area e 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:52.370
 you will find an abandoned house one 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.290
 slum but fucking little house revenue 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.510
 wind the house as you usually look for 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.359
 well anywhere inside the cottage up to 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.980
 find the barometer very often like 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.329
 in this case it is inside the 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.340
 fire in the fireplace 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.560
 now in fact, I am moving forward quickly 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.069
 I show you that I find it precisely 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.069
 from the fireplace 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.729
 as for the green lamp post vi 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.120
 I already mention it when a lamppost 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:18.799
 and green is a teleporter later or 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.359
 tomorrow I will put a video precisely where 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.609
 I launch into that such transportation 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:26.180
 just to show you the curiosity that 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.530
 I had not yet realized it 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.139
 once I took all four 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.359
 all four items must be brought 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.549
 in the city work bench that is 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.709
 the last stage is there you can 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.169
 put once put all built 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.169
 the weapon and you can take your own in the 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:44.540
 only one person and I recommend used 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:48.590
 the condition of discretion because it lasts 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.750
 very little is very powerful and proper 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.209
 as a sort of aircraft turbine 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.060
 because there is a time that you Lazio 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.010
 born we say that shoot is not that it shoots 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.549
 seas on which inside the zombies and 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.459
 it blows them by shooting all the behind 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.979
 blood and beautiful that is as a weapon is 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.480
 gigantic however it lasts very little if not 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:15.239
 mistake will also serve to achieve 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.239
 of the east and rex then in the next video 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.930
 I will put it precisely as to complete 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.210
 ex leicester of this map and a lot 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.380
 probably this weapon will not serve you 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.419
 advance nothing else 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.270
 if you liked the video put me 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.949
 like sign up and comment hello a 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.949
 all nice guys from dynamo
