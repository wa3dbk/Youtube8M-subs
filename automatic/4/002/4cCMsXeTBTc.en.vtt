00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.599
 in an apartment of 60 mÂ² 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.519
 the architect jean david benhamou has 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.540
 chosen to give a central role to 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.540
 the kitchen dining area 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.630
 we have in France a small 60 mÂ² so 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.539
 the idea was not to partition 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.500
 maximum and quite the opposite of 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.050
 facilitate the circulation so 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.179
 the apartment with this central block that 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.920
 is the kitchen and dining room gives 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.210
 the possibility of passing on the right 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.829
 towards the room of the room 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.930
 bathroom but also from the left 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.940
 so no partition all stayed very 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.860
 opened these kitchens in celebration she is 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.329
 sub divided in a fairly 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.309
 traditional since an ideal kitchen 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.170
 it's a little bit of a triangle kitchen 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.780
 with three important points that are the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.000
 fire cold and water so we find 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.710
 the fire with its plate has here and there 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.960
 high that works like these one 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.329
 find the fridge that are in 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.010
 this column and wolf that's just 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.949
 behind me so in the end we have 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.150
 a small step to do and again for 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.890
 to be able to access fire with cold water 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.090
 everything goes pretty easily blog 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.530
 kitchen that has been treated in a 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.820
 dominant material and a color 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.439
 dominant which is obviously the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.030
 white as you can see gave 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.770
 place to an island on this island on there 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.409
 works with a traditional height 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.200
 guilaume and we also eat there is rather 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.180
 than to bring a table from the outside 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.860
 I preferred to continue the plan section 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.170
 work down it down slightly for 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.200
 turn that into the room space to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.200
 eat 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.009
 the suspension is a small element it is 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.720
 not the only one that lets you forget that 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.009
 this kitchen is a kitchen since 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.840
 she's completely open on 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.950
 the space to live in no way I had 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.259
 desire 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.759
 to have a note that go down a 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.560
 bar on which we hang the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.810
 knives and sausages so I have 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.329
 preferred to actually work a 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.159
 concealed door inside and that 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.049
 avoid any handle not know if you 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.060
 have noticed zero level 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.860
 ports so we're in a kitchen 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.850
 totally open it's true but who 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.850
 stay a little discreet
