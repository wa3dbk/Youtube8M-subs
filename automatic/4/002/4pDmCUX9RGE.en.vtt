00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.670
 we have seen a little more the battle of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.740
 these invocations of naruto sakura 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.450

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.190
 controlled pretty epic in 3 funate and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.170
 some and bad and everything we have seen more 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.640
 flashback and innovation without the al ahli 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.960
 menu we drop flashback in order we're going to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.880
 start as usual to comment this 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.619
 chapter by part first is 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.300
 say the general charges this chapter 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.430
 The first part is divided into two parts 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.439
 where we see more action where we see this 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.910
 battle between naruto and sas that against 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.349
 this rain like that cure 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.669
 helping all the gentlemen and in the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.140
 second part where general features 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.180
 we also see no self - esteem 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.550
 meeting with his side and there is hugo and 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.800
 karen helping your ship to recover 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.719
 next to the slug that has executed that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.489
 has invoked sakura let's comment 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.750
 first the first part of the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.640
 episode in the first part of 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.800
 episode we've seen practically two 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.570
 attacks of naruto and sas that long 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.579
 tresserras in shuriken and you know that 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.649
 that kind of arrow that throws the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.239
 susano and here they have also shown us 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.160
 a flashback but this flash comes out in the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.379
 manga obviously in the manga comes a 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.870
 flashback cartoon and they have lengthened it 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.970
 where little appeal says that despite 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.840
 let the wind win its own light 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.630
 wind too 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.579
 therefore you know that you can count 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.140
 say it so Naruto with that fire already 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.820
 we've seen that kind of board 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.069
 Techniques where racing 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.469
 shuriken fanned the fire of those that and 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.030
 direct point to the eye of liu live here 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.619
 I want to discuss a bit and it's the fact 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.509
 that the dimensions that we see 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.520
 example of Naruto regarding the toad that 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.920
 invokes or of those that regarding the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.179
 snake are a bit exaggerated from my 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.490
 point of view just like the 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.560
 perspectives of the naruto toad by 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.880
 example and from you very well if the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.920
 sizes like they do not just convince 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.720
 as they are too exaggerated from 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.099
 my point of view and sure it does in 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.780
 this part of the episode well basically 

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:43.679
 is that makes that kind of symbol that 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.229
 it came out in the previous episode 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.610
 get health is to recover all 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.630
 without men who were half defeated 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.280
 on the battlefield 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.590
 thanks to these slugs that invoked their 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.599
 I would swim so basically that has been 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.610
 a news that totally against you be 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:58.349
 and ensures acting from behind as 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.239
 healer a team that the truth that I 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.560
 he liked it a lot and to do support 

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:03.479
 to this team because it has also appeared 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.489
 the other team of cheers the team 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.110
 inside the and marull iraira and his ship 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:08.819
 well basically the moment when 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.160
 appeared would turn obviously is this a 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.810
 flashback a totally invented salvo 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.220
 by the anime the important edge of this 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.950
 second 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.020
 of the episode is the fact that his daughter 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.970
 you can put the bottom of your 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.110
 ship or on top like 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.970
 also karim can make it 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.580
 recover more quickly and more 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.050
 suitable doing that is one of bite to 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.490
 karim of we remember that kind of 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.380
 uncanny ability to speak well of 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.270
 cary where you know he kept biting 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.730
 to karim and here may this look like a 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.500
 little bit of stuffing the fact that for a 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.870
 his side is outraged because the tails 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.180
 slugs attach the bottom of your 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.190
 ship with the top on the other hand 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.570
 is totally inclined karim of that 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.220
 is going to bite someone who is not 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.470
 you know that in this case I had to 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.030
 bite your ship and then where we see 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.220
 another estimate that is quite scary 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.590
 because like you stretch your head and 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.240
 he tells karim jan follows his that as no 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.430
 really help last what clearly 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.840
 snakes by the mouth and it's going to be that 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.670
 is in the owns 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.990
 that part seems totally stuffed 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.580
 but it is not filler or that is in the 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.470
 manga happens as is and removing this 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.540
 we also see how at first 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.070
 it was posed that he had holed sakura and 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.900
 that he was helping his ship because he did not 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.520
 trust me again the last to 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.900
 trust in that after all he has 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.520
 done after that attempt to upload 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.200
 with leaves but then file or 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.150
 it says ok if you do not trust me you can 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.920
 throwing that acid fulminar me in any 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.390
 and suddenly the slug says oh yes already 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.459
 trust you now we're going to 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.319
 comment what happens from fillings to these 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.239
 and almost completely filling the flower 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.040
 is that we have had in three one of 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.709
 lleida and in trolls and mario and the shit 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.209
 is from the weak point of the three or something 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.890
 well that fucking shit has been totally 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.359
 invented by the anime in this dish 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.980
 we have seen basically approximates a 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.870
 tried to get rid of going to go for 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.549
 all the means and air air chuleando 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.530
 now last moon truth is that it is a 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.090
 moment I loved it when I was 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.890
 dictating is one of this is going to die here 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.780
 come on one of let's save us two 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.370
 and we are going to leave there to go to irak and thrown 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.900
 suddenly going to go to really like that 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.560
 wake up the chimarruts makers that you 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.480
 den bitch who gives you whore and puts these 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.220
 fingers like that in a plan that gives you that has 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.780
 pretty much liked the only thing of the flash for 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.459
 the rest of the flashback this about that there 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.109
 we're not going to save him there we're not going to 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.340
 leave it here that's the truth is that it does not 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.829
 he liked it all and the others 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.840
 throwing him a kind of stone by 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.549
 mouth to this cave is destroyed 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.769
 finally it is once awake 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.120
 young lady wey and nothing because that 's 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.680
 practically what we see in this 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.030
 episode as you have seen the following 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.340
 floor let's continue to see the 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.889
 confrontation between death and poop like this 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.780
 basic while a pretty episode 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.580
 dedicated to that I suppose 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.590
 by means that has nothing to do with 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.970
 end things that anime do and nothing 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.320
 well simply this what you have to 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.669
 comment on this chapter and on the 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.990
 next comment a label because 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.550
 This capi that you thought this review 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.990
 télam like if you liked the truth is that 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.580
 I help you very much and good, I say goodbye 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.200
 here but not before saying that 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.500
 effectively thanks to my luck 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.380
 the 690 manga has come out today instead of 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.300
 tomorrow or Saturday of Sunday and nothing 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.980
 just tell you that I do not think I 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.840
 give time to do the review since here in 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.120
 Spain is six twenty between 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.250
 credits I raise this will end up being 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.750
 8 and I do not like doing things with 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.430
 Hurry I like things calm and 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.530
 well done so probably if not 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.360
 you have the review of the 690 manga by car 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.650
 today you will have it tomorrow so I do not 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.090
 worry about that and as a sub addiction 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.650
