00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.190 

right<00:00:02.280> so<00:00:04.220> that<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.580> what<00:00:06.150> my<00:00:06.390> simulator

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
right so that is what my simulator

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.100 
right so that is what my simulator
predicts<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.220> prop<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:09.179> going<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.510> do<00:00:09.660> given

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
predicts this prop is going to do given

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.629 
predicts this prop is going to do given
those<00:00:10.349> initial<00:00:11.010> starting<00:00:11.340> speeds

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
those initial starting speeds

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.129 
those initial starting speeds
orientations<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.509> all<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.870> physics

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
orientations and all the physics

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.770 
orientations and all the physics
conditions<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:14.490> addition<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.540> actually

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
conditions in addition to actually

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.810 
conditions in addition to actually
plotting<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.350> positions<00:00:16.710> i<00:00:16.830> can<00:00:16.980> actually

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
plotting the positions i can actually

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.450 
plotting the positions i can actually
just<00:00:18.210> make<00:00:18.900> hologram<00:00:19.350> move<00:00:19.800> between<00:00:19.980> them<00:00:20.189> all

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
just make hologram move between them all

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.480 
just make hologram move between them all
so<00:00:20.990> this<00:00:21.990> green<00:00:22.650> hologram<00:00:23.430> here<00:00:24.590> that's<00:00:25.590> what

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
so this green hologram here that's what

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.660 
so this green hologram here that's what
i<00:00:26.519> predict<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.510> prop<00:00:27.720> will<00:00:27.869> do<00:00:28.050> now<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.529> is

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
i predict the prop will do now this is

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.479 
i predict the prop will do now this is

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
which are rather complicated i'm not

which are rather complicated i'm not
going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.079> go<00:00:34.140> into<00:00:34.320> how<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.590> all<00:00:34.680> works<00:00:34.890> here

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
going to go into how it all works here

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
going to go into how it all works here
you<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.850> read<00:00:35.969> about<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.360> walmart

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
you can read about that on the walmart

you can read about that on the walmart
forums<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.680> some<00:00:38.040> angular<00:00:38.430> and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
forums but it's some angular and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.030 
forums but it's some angular and
translational<00:00:39.329> drag<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.870> got<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> few

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
translational drag and got a few

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.530 
translational drag and got a few
different<00:00:41.280> effects<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.610> inertia<00:00:41.820> speed

limits<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:44.370> gravity<00:00:44.820> obviously<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.960> what

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
limits and gravity obviously so what

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.750 
limits and gravity obviously so what
I'll<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.789> show<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:49.219> verify<00:00:50.219> this

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
I'll do now is show you and verify this

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.689 
I'll do now is show you and verify this
is<00:00:50.940> actually<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.360> happens<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.840> games<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.699> in

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
is actually what happens in games so in

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.340 
is actually what happens in games so in
order<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.360> launch<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.750> prof<00:00:54.989> I've<00:00:55.140> gotta

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
order to launch this prof I've gotta

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.369 
order to launch this prof I've gotta
apply<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.100> San<00:00:56.370> deployed<00:00:56.640> talk<00:00:57.379> setup

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.310 
actually within the initial conditions
expression<00:01:01.160> and<00:01:02.160> that'll<00:01:02.640> launch<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:04.199> get

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
expression and that'll launch it to get

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.800 
expression and that'll launch it to get
a<00:01:04.350> perfect<00:01:04.830> launch<00:01:05.090> as<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.210> record<00:01:06.570> this

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
a perfect launch as I record this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.080 
a perfect launch as I record this
requires<00:01:07.170> me<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.409> fully<00:01:08.340> predict<00:01:08.760> what<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
requires me to fully predict what the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.820 
requires me to fully predict what the
initial<00:01:09.450> conditions<00:01:09.780> will<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:10.020> i<00:01:10.229> am<00:01:12.830> just

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
initial conditions will be i am just

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.219 
initial conditions will be i am just
make<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> prop<00:01:14.369> go<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> sleep<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.930> then

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
make the prop go to sleep and then

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.460 
make the prop go to sleep and then
reapply<00:01:16.680> gravity<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.820> now<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:17.970> props

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
reapply gravity it's now the props

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.130 
reapply gravity it's now the props
asleep<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.430> got<00:01:20.880> gravity<00:01:21.180> applied<00:01:21.479> so

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
asleep but it's got gravity applied so

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.740 
asleep but it's got gravity applied so
if<00:01:22.229> i<00:01:22.320> launch<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.009> should<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.240> real<00:01:24.420> prop

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
if i launch you should see the real prop

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.210 
if i launch you should see the real prop
do<00:01:24.930> exactly<00:01:25.200> what<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> holograms<00:01:25.950> just

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
do exactly what the holograms just

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.859 
do exactly what the holograms just
predicted<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.729> would<00:01:29.210> like<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:32.630> there<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.810> go

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
predicted it would like so there you go

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.109 
predicted it would like so there you go
it's<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.890> perfect<00:01:35.640> prediction<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:38.670> only<00:01:38.850> limit

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
it's a perfect prediction the only limit

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.050 
it's a perfect prediction the only limit
here<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.530> how<00:01:40.650> accurate<00:01:41.070> i<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
here as to how accurate i can be is the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.080 
here as to how accurate i can be is the
step<00:01:42.840> size<00:01:43.490> give<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.579> an<00:01:44.640> idea<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.000> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
step size give you an idea of what that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.210 
step size give you an idea of what that
is<00:01:45.240> these<00:01:45.600> Holograms<00:01:46.380> are<00:01:46.560> positioned<00:01:47.009> along

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
is these Holograms are positioned along

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.340 
is these Holograms are positioned along
every<00:01:47.460> four<00:01:48.770> steps<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.909> my<00:01:51.600> calculation<00:01:52.200> it

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
every four steps so in my calculation it

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.249 
every four steps so in my calculation it
does<00:01:52.700> four<00:01:53.700> steps<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.060> between<00:01:54.149> each<00:01:54.329> one<00:01:54.630> I

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
does four steps in between each one I

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.020 
does four steps in between each one I
can<00:01:55.979> obviously<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.399> increased<00:01:56.939> our

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
can obviously just increased our

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.389 
can obviously just increased our
resolution<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.540> as<00:01:57.630> high<00:01:57.960> as<00:01:58.020> I'd<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.399> I'll

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
resolution to as high as I'd like I'll

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.469 
resolution to as high as I'd like I'll
show<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.640> another<00:01:59.820> completely<00:02:00.210> different

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
show you another completely different

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.440 
show you another completely different
kind<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.020> simulation<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.060> if<00:02:03.060> I

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
kind of simulation so if I

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.900 
kind of simulation so if I
change<00:02:05.229> from<00:02:05.409> velocities<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:10.569> we<00:02:10.720> now<00:02:10.899> give<00:02:11.110> it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
change from velocities if we now give it

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.119 
change from velocities if we now give it
Thank<00:02:12.910> You<00:02:12.970> velocity<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.110> Zed<00:02:14.470> around

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
Thank You velocity and the Zed around

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:21.120 
Thank You velocity and the Zed around
the<00:02:15.220> z-axis<00:02:19.379> or<00:02:20.379> into<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.680> bit<00:02:20.709> different

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
the z-axis or into it a bit different

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.220 
the z-axis or into it a bit different
this<00:02:21.750> will<00:02:22.750> be<00:02:22.870> completely<00:02:23.019> different<00:02:23.620> so

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
this will be completely different so

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.690 
this will be completely different so
let's<00:02:26.230> go<00:02:26.380> ahead<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:27.420> refresh<00:02:28.420> those<00:02:28.870> to

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
let's go ahead and refresh those to

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.250 
let's go ahead and refresh those to
compute<00:02:30.700> another<00:02:31.799> trajectory<00:02:33.840> yeah<00:02:34.840> now

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
compute another trajectory yeah now

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.500 
compute another trajectory yeah now
trajectories<00:02:35.980> complete<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.700> I'll<00:02:37.060> plot<00:02:37.390> it

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
trajectories complete and I'll plot it

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.699 
trajectories complete and I'll plot it
again<00:02:39.690> all<00:02:40.690> right<00:02:40.810> that's<00:02:41.140> an<00:02:41.319> interesting

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
again all right that's an interesting

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.259 
again all right that's an interesting
one<00:02:44.790> looks<00:02:45.790> kind<00:02:46.299> of<00:02:46.329> like<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.599> he<00:02:46.690> looks<00:02:46.900> so

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
one looks kind of like it he looks so

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.330 
one looks kind of like it he looks so
again<00:02:49.269> I'll<00:02:49.360> just<00:02:49.510> show<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:50.950> get<00:02:51.099> the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
again I'll just show you and you get the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.660 
again I'll just show you and you get the
green<00:02:51.579> prop<00:02:51.910> is<00:02:52.410> well<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.890> green<00:02:54.069> hologram<00:02:54.519> is

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
green prop is well the green hologram is

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:03.449 
green prop is well the green hologram is
what<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.569> props<00:02:55.780> going<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.110> do<00:03:02.280> I'll<00:03:03.280> just

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
what the props going to do I'll just

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.830 
what the props going to do I'll just
draw<00:03:03.610> attention<00:03:03.819> to<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.150> color<00:03:04.360> as<00:03:04.510> well<00:03:04.540> the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
draw attention to the color as well the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.930 
draw attention to the color as well the
color<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.590> these<00:03:05.739> Holograms<00:03:06.069> is<00:03:06.250> proportional

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
color of these Holograms is proportional

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.840 
color of these Holograms is proportional
to<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.180> speed<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:08.489> translational<00:03:09.489> speed<00:03:09.700> that

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
to the speed a translational speed that

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.400 
to the speed a translational speed that
they<00:03:09.970> props<00:03:10.209> got<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:10.660> can<00:03:10.780> see<00:03:10.989> obviously

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
they props got and you can see obviously

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.370 
they props got and you can see obviously
that<00:03:11.590> linear<00:03:12.220> air<00:03:12.400> drags<00:03:12.670> taken<00:03:13.180> out<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:13.540> lot<00:03:14.290> of

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
that linear air drags taken out a lot of

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.080 
that linear air drags taken out a lot of
the<00:03:14.440> horizontal<00:03:14.920> component<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.730> velocity

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
the horizontal component the velocity

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.490 
the horizontal component the velocity
which<00:03:16.209> is<00:03:16.239> why<00:03:16.450> this<00:03:16.930> doesn't<00:03:17.109> look<00:03:17.319> like<00:03:17.380> a

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
which is why this doesn't look like a

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.500 
which is why this doesn't look like a
parabola<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:19.180> reality<00:03:20.139> hand<00:03:20.560> in<00:03:20.709> Garry's<00:03:21.190> Mod

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
parabola in reality hand in Garry's Mod

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.210 
parabola in reality hand in Garry's Mod
things<00:03:22.510> don't<00:03:22.720> travel<00:03:22.930> in<00:03:23.049> parabolas<00:03:23.950> because

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
things don't travel in parabolas because

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.420 
things don't travel in parabolas because
of<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.459> air<00:03:25.180> drag<00:03:25.420> so<00:03:26.260> i'll<00:03:27.040> go<00:03:27.220> ahead<00:03:27.250> and

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
of the air drag so i'll go ahead and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.370 
of the air drag so i'll go ahead and
launch<00:03:27.670> this<00:03:29.940> again<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:30.970> same<00:03:31.209> thing<00:03:31.480> send<00:03:32.290> a

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
launch this again the same thing send a

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.629 
launch this again the same thing send a
prop<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.650> sleep<00:03:34.859> give<00:03:35.859> it<00:03:35.980> back<00:03:36.010> its<00:03:36.310> gravity

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
prop to sleep give it back its gravity

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:44.940 
prop to sleep give it back its gravity
and<00:03:39.269> launch<00:03:41.459> so<00:03:42.459> there<00:03:42.819> you<00:03:42.910> go
