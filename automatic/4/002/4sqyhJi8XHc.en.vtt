00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.840
 hello today let's talk about ox cloud 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.210
 we are facing an online platform where 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.240
 We can buy or rent series and 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.460
 movies is an initiative of antena3 and 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.980
 the group planet of agostini and its offer 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.800
 has more than 2,000 titles and close 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.600
 of 80 series that yes samson is the only 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.180
 TV platform where we can use 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.340
 this is because it has its exclusivity 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.710
 ox cloud strong point resides in its 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.390
 content its maximum is that same day 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.870
 that a movie is commercialized in 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.339
 dvd will also be here in turn affirm 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.909
 that four months after its premiere 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.080
 in cinema they will upload it to ox cloud to achieve 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.390
 that we have the best experience 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.000
 possible ox cloud has incorporated the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.620
 adaptive streaming is that it is 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.420
 the platform itself who adapts the 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.400
 emission to the possible quality that we 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.839
 offer our internet connection for 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.729
 further facilitate its use 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.900
 Cloud developers have loved you 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.089
 make the most of the command to 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.100
 distance providing functionality to 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.320
 those colored buttons like in the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.119
 ancient teletext can also be 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.180
 use from a mobile device with 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.190
 remote control 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.050
 we can not forget such a step 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.240
 important how is the payment of our 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.590
 acquisitions for this I do not see that 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.170
 he also wanted to put us very 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.820
 easy and we have the ox cloud pin to the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.979
 confirm the purchase we just have to 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.229
 enter a 4-digit code as 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.960
 the one of our sim card and we will perform 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.040
 the purchase is comfortable is easy and is very 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.560
 sure because it has the 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.930
 VeriSign certification comes time 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.390
 to value this application in design you 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.119
 let's give a 7 the developers have 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.500
 had priority as functionality and 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.840
 they have sacrificed in part the aspect 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.790
 visual in relation to the contents 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.170
 the note on a point we are going to give you a 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.479
 8 because the quality of the movies 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.130
 both classical and modern is very high 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.470
 and it has a lot of series in which 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.630
 hook the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.460
 in development we will also give 18 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.640
 thanks to its good streaming and its 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.470
 ease of payment and with an average 77 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.700
 I do not see that it is consecrated as a 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.700
 fantastic online video store
