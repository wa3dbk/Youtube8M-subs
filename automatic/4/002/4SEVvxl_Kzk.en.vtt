same<00:00:28.130> way<00:00:28.609> as<00:00:29.090> you<00:00:29.240> produce<00:00:29.480> these<00:00:29.900> little

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
same way as you produce these little

the Niagara Falls if you like and the

foreground<00:00:53.350> first<00:00:54.350> of<00:00:54.530> all<00:00:54.680> I'm<00:00:54.920> going<00:00:55.100> to

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
foreground first of all I'm going to

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.340 
foreground first of all I'm going to
simplify<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.760> picture<00:00:56.269> quite<00:00:56.690> considerably

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
simplify the picture quite considerably

certainly<00:00:58.280> in<00:00:58.400> relation<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:59.000> these<00:00:59.119> trees<00:00:59.540> in

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
certainly in relation to these trees in

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.079 
certainly in relation to these trees in
the<00:00:59.839> background<00:01:00.019> and<00:01:00.860> most<00:01:01.129> certainly<00:01:01.400> we're

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
the background and most certainly we're

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.320 
the background and most certainly we're
going<00:01:02.239> to<00:01:02.299> take<00:01:02.510> this<00:01:03.489> slightly<00:01:04.489> messy<00:01:04.820> area

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
going to take this slightly messy area

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.200 
going to take this slightly messy area
house<00:01:05.600> here<00:01:05.930> if<00:01:06.320> we<00:01:06.409> take<00:01:06.650> a<00:01:06.680> piece<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.210> plastic

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
house here if we take a piece of plastic

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.730 
house here if we take a piece of plastic
I<00:01:08.420> was<00:01:08.810> going<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.020> take<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.229> piece<00:01:09.469> of<00:01:09.619> acetate

I was going to take a piece of acetate

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.039 
I was going to take a piece of acetate
but<00:01:10.159> it<00:01:10.280> didn't<00:01:10.460> have<00:01:10.579> one<00:01:10.759> handy<00:01:11.180> this<00:01:11.840> will

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
but it didn't have one handy this will

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.120 
but it didn't have one handy this will
do<00:01:12.229> just<00:01:12.680> as<00:01:12.859> well<00:01:13.039> all<00:01:14.000> that<00:01:14.240> I've<00:01:14.329> done<00:01:14.359> is

do just as well all that I've done is
about<00:01:16.130> just<00:01:16.340> line<00:01:16.579> that<00:01:16.609> up<00:01:16.820> like<00:01:17.149> that<00:01:17.210> all

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
about just line that up like that all

about just line that up like that all
that<00:01:18.109> I've<00:01:18.200> done<00:01:18.380> you<00:01:18.590> can<00:01:18.740> see<00:01:18.979> is<00:01:19.219> to<00:01:20.090> draw<00:01:20.329> a

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
that I've done you can see is to draw a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.230 
that I've done you can see is to draw a
series<00:01:20.840> of<00:01:21.020> straight<00:01:21.560> red<00:01:22.189> lines<00:01:22.490> very

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
series of straight red lines very

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.209 
series of straight red lines very
important<00:01:23.780> obviously<00:01:24.170> with<00:01:24.289> water<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:25.070> keep

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
important obviously with water to keep

important obviously with water to keep
it<00:01:25.369> horizontal<00:01:26.000> at<00:01:26.119> all<00:01:26.210> times<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.159> that

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
it horizontal at all times and that

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.469 
it horizontal at all times and that
those<00:01:28.969> simple<00:01:29.679> red<00:01:30.679> lines<00:01:30.950> like<00:01:31.310> that<00:01:31.579> will

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
those simple red lines like that will

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.380 
those simple red lines like that will
give<00:01:32.659> you<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.170> basis<00:01:33.679> of<00:01:33.890> your<00:01:34.670> composition

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
give you the basis of your composition

give you the basis of your composition
it's<00:01:35.780> not<00:01:35.960> difficult<00:01:36.499> than<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.920> draw<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.429> letter

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
it's not difficult than to draw a letter

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.749 
it's not difficult than to draw a letter
C<00:01:38.390> or<00:01:38.659> a<00:01:38.719> couple<00:01:39.049> of<00:01:39.229> letter<00:01:39.409> C's<00:01:39.770> on<00:01:40.189> its<00:01:40.460> face

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
C or a couple of letter C's on its face

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.230 
C or a couple of letter C's on its face
and<00:01:41.600> put<00:01:42.320> in<00:01:42.469> a<00:01:42.560> few<00:01:42.799> random<00:01:43.429> shapes<00:01:43.759> here

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
and put in a few random shapes here

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.849 
and put in a few random shapes here
which<00:01:44.479> are<00:01:44.659> mostly<00:01:45.079> sort<00:01:45.259> of<00:01:45.380> triangular

going<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:04.310> look<00:02:04.520> so<00:02:04.909> I'm<00:02:05.060> gonna<00:02:05.179> put<00:02:05.420> some

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
going to look so I'm gonna put some

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.929 
going to look so I'm gonna put some
masking<00:02:06.020> fluid<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.530> here<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.249> then<00:02:07.490> we'll<00:02:07.700> get

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
masking fluid on here and then we'll get

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.490 
masking fluid on here and then we'll get
on<00:02:08.090> with<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.330> painting<00:02:08.539> right<00:02:09.259> now<00:02:09.440> the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
on with the painting right now the

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.220 
on with the painting right now the
picture<00:02:09.890> has<00:02:10.039> a<00:02:10.069> lot<00:02:10.340> of<00:02:10.369> yellows<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.230> browns

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
picture has a lot of yellows and browns

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.559 
picture has a lot of yellows and browns
and<00:02:12.470> golds<00:02:12.709> in<00:02:13.069> which<00:02:13.280> suggests<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:14.090> me<00:02:14.239> that

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
and golds in which suggests to me that

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.059 
and golds in which suggests to me that
it's<00:02:14.720> an<00:02:14.840> earlier<00:02:15.170> or<00:02:15.260> some<00:02:15.560> day<00:02:15.769> especially

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
it's an earlier or some day especially

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.680 
it's an earlier or some day especially
the<00:02:16.459> fact<00:02:16.700> there's<00:02:16.879> a<00:02:16.909> lot<00:02:17.060> of

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
the fact there's a lot of

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.530 
the fact there's a lot of
lying<00:02:18.200> on<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.440> top<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.490> rocks<00:02:19.730> here<00:02:20.030> so

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
lying on the top of the rocks here so

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.510 
lying on the top of the rocks here so
I'm<00:02:20.780> going<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:20.990> reflect<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.590> in<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.220> colors

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
I'm going to reflect that in the colors

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.730 
I'm going to reflect that in the colors
I'm<00:02:22.610> going<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.880> use<00:02:23.230> right<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.410> we've<00:02:24.500> got<00:02:24.590> that

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
I'm going to use right so we've got that

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.490 
I'm going to use right so we've got that
area<00:02:25.130> nice<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.610> damp<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:26.150> all<00:02:26.780> I'm<00:02:26.930> doing<00:02:26.990> is

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
area nice and damp and all I'm doing is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.090 
area nice and damp and all I'm doing is
just<00:02:27.560> very<00:02:28.100> very<00:02:28.220> quickly<00:02:28.640> putting<00:02:29.450> in<00:02:29.750> a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
just very very quickly putting in a

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.360 
just very very quickly putting in a
medium<00:02:31.100> tone<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:32.150> pale<00:02:32.540> blue<00:02:32.800> into<00:02:33.800> that<00:02:33.950> area

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
medium tone of pale blue into that area

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.400 
medium tone of pale blue into that area
now<00:02:34.850> you've<00:02:35.000> seen<00:02:35.210> a<00:02:35.240> similar<00:02:35.540> technique<00:02:36.080> when

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
now you've seen a similar technique when

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.330 
now you've seen a similar technique when
we<00:02:36.620> did<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.600> tree<00:02:38.600> in<00:02:38.900> blossom<00:02:39.290> in<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.100> trees

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
we did the tree in blossom in the trees

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.610 
we did the tree in blossom in the trees
video<00:02:40.760> it's<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:41.300> same<00:02:41.600> sort<00:02:41.990> of<00:02:42.200> technique

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
video it's the same sort of technique

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.280 
video it's the same sort of technique
really<00:02:42.890> right<00:02:43.730> next<00:02:44.090> stage<00:02:44.270> is<00:02:44.570> to<00:02:44.780> dampen<00:02:45.260> the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
really right next stage is to dampen the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.320 
really right next stage is to dampen the
bridge<00:02:45.590> area<00:02:47.050> including<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:49.030> inside<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.209> the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
bridge area including the inside of the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.120 
bridge area including the inside of the
artwork<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:51.020> want<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.260> put<00:02:51.380> some<00:02:51.530> fairly<00:02:51.770> dark

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
artwork I want to put some fairly dark

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.970 
artwork I want to put some fairly dark
color<00:02:52.910> on<00:02:53.000> this<00:02:53.270> bridge<00:02:53.600> eventually<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:54.800> I

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
color on this bridge eventually so I

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.940 
color on this bridge eventually so I
don't<00:02:55.190> want<00:02:55.370> that<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:56.050> go<00:02:57.050> all<00:02:57.080> over<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.590> tree

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
don't want that to go all over the tree

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.949 
don't want that to go all over the tree
having<00:02:58.520> wet<00:02:58.820> this<00:02:59.090> what<00:02:59.360> we're<00:02:59.510> going<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.750> do

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
having wet this what we're going to do

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.750 
having wet this what we're going to do
now<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.440> just<00:03:00.680> drop<00:03:01.640> in<00:03:01.850> some<00:03:03.489> burnt<00:03:04.489> umber

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
now is just drop in some burnt umber

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.270 
now is just drop in some burnt umber
like<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:05.959> I'm<00:03:06.410> going<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.739> introduce<00:03:06.920> a

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
like that I'm going to introduce a

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.860 
like that I'm going to introduce a
little<00:03:07.400> bit<00:03:07.520> of<00:03:07.670> blue<00:03:08.150> here<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.690> there<00:03:08.930> that

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
little bit of blue here and there that

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.960 
little bit of blue here and there that
Harlequin<00:03:11.980> kaleidoscope<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.070> colors<00:03:13.430> as<00:03:13.760> it

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970

Harlequin kaleidoscope of colors as it
looks<00:03:14.180> like<00:03:14.360> you<00:03:14.480> guys<00:03:14.660> here<00:03:14.840> at<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:14.989> moment

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
will actually tone down now under the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.870 
will actually tone down now under the
bridge<00:03:18.260> it's<00:03:18.650> going<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:18.890> be<00:03:19.010> much<00:03:19.220> darker<00:03:19.520> but

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.090 
a base coat of burnt umber right I'm
gonna<00:03:29.480> paint<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.930> base<00:03:30.140> colors<00:03:30.590> of<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.830> rocks

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
gonna paint the base colors of the rocks

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.160 
gonna paint the base colors of the rocks
now<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:32.110> mix<00:03:33.110> of<00:03:33.470> burnt<00:03:33.950> umber<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:34.720> raw<00:03:35.720> sienna

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
some ultramarine blue at the base of

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.190 
some ultramarine blue at the base of
some<00:03:49.280> of<00:03:49.430> these<00:03:49.549> rocks<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.239> on<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.930> shadow

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
some of these rocks and on the shadow

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.440 
some of these rocks and on the shadow
side<00:03:51.590> it's<00:03:52.130> going<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.340> put<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.519> greeny<00:03:53.030> should

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
side it's going to put a greeny should

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.570 
side it's going to put a greeny should
of<00:03:53.570> gray<00:03:54.610> up<00:03:55.610> here<00:03:56.260> in<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.470> background<00:03:58.010> next

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
of gray up here in the background next

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.949 
of gray up here in the background next
up<00:03:58.850> is<00:03:59.030> a<00:03:59.060> very<00:03:59.420> strong<00:03:59.810> mix<00:04:00.110> of<00:04:00.440> birds<00:04:00.769> on<00:04:01.100> the

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
up is a very strong mix of birds on the

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.940 
up is a very strong mix of birds on the
an<00:04:02.959> ultramarine<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:03.680> that's<00:04:04.250> giving<00:04:04.970> us<00:04:05.150> that

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
an ultramarine and that's giving us that

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.650 
an ultramarine and that's giving us that
shadow<00:04:06.950> color<00:04:07.370> underneath<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.420> bridge

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
shadow color underneath the bridge

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.979 
shadow color underneath the bridge
itself<00:04:09.260> now<00:04:10.100> that'll<00:04:10.459> certainly<00:04:11.000> help<00:04:11.239> these

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
itself now that'll certainly help these

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.140 
itself now that'll certainly help these
light<00:04:12.320> areas<00:04:12.799> around<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.610> stand<00:04:13.940> out

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
light areas around it to stand out

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.030 
light areas around it to stand out
notice<00:04:14.840> I<00:04:14.900> put<00:04:14.930> some<00:04:15.260> neat<00:04:15.470> alter<00:04:15.799> marine

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
notice I put some neat alter marine

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.920 
notice I put some neat alter marine
there<00:04:16.250> it<00:04:16.400> gives<00:04:16.519> an<00:04:16.700> added<00:04:16.970> interest<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.840> the

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
there it gives an added interest to the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.650 
there it gives an added interest to the
bridge<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:18.350> also<00:04:18.470> helps<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.040> darken<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:20.299> the

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
bridge and also helps to darken the the

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.050 
bridge and also helps to darken the the
roof<00:04:20.900> area<00:04:21.169> and<00:04:21.829> also<00:04:22.250> put<00:04:22.669> some<00:04:22.700> little

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
roof area and also put some little

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.270 
roof area and also put some little
Nick's<00:04:23.479> you<00:04:24.169> can<00:04:24.350> see<00:04:24.560> I'm<00:04:24.770> doing<00:04:24.979> that

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
Nick's you can see I'm doing that

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.960 
Nick's you can see I'm doing that
because<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:26.180> will<00:04:26.300> represent<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.870> shadows

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
because that will represent the shadows

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.670 
because that will represent the shadows
between<00:04:28.970> those<00:04:29.780> verticals

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
between those verticals

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.689 
between those verticals
stones<00:04:30.949> that<00:04:31.789> form<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:33.430> archway<00:04:34.430> of<00:04:34.460> the

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
stones that form the archway of the

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.240 
stones that form the archway of the
bridge<00:04:34.970> but<00:04:35.389> what<00:04:35.570> I<00:04:35.600> want<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:35.870> do<00:04:36.139> is<00:04:36.410> just<00:04:37.009> to

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
bridge but what I want to do is just to

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.529 
bridge but what I want to do is just to
paint<00:04:37.550> in<00:04:38.080> some<00:04:39.080> of<00:04:39.199> these<00:04:39.520> trees<00:04:40.520> there's<00:04:41.360> a

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
paint in some of these trees there's a

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.330 
paint in some of these trees there's a
sitting<00:04:42.080> in<00:04:42.229> the<00:04:42.350> background<00:04:42.560> perhaps<00:04:43.190> do

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
sitting in the background perhaps do

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.499 
sitting in the background perhaps do
that<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.550> little<00:04:43.669> bit<00:04:43.910> stronger<00:04:44.240> because

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
that a little bit stronger because

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:45.820 
that a little bit stronger because
that's<00:04:44.660> going<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.810> be<00:04:44.900> silhouetted<00:04:45.560> against

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
that's going to be silhouetted against

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.939 
that's going to be silhouetted against
the<00:04:45.919> sky<00:04:46.419> right<00:04:47.419> I've<00:04:47.660> put<00:04:47.900> a<00:04:47.930> little<00:04:48.259> hint<00:04:48.740> of

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
the sky right I've put a little hint of

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.430 
the sky right I've put a little hint of
ultramarine<00:04:49.610> blue<00:04:49.789> and<00:04:50.449> some<00:04:50.930> burnt<00:04:51.199> umber

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
ultramarine blue and some burnt umber

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.790 
ultramarine blue and some burnt umber
very<00:04:51.800> pale<00:04:52.100> wash<00:04:52.479> just<00:04:53.479> at<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.320> base<00:04:54.470> of<00:04:54.500> the

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
very pale wash just at the base of the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.219 
very pale wash just at the base of the
trees<00:04:55.070> really<00:04:55.880> so<00:04:56.060> we<00:04:56.210> get<00:04:56.389> a<00:04:56.600> light<00:04:56.900> against

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
trees really so we get a light against

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.800 
trees really so we get a light against
dark<00:04:57.590> effect<00:04:58.039> where<00:04:58.220> I<00:04:58.250> take<00:04:58.520> that<00:04:58.820> masking

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
dark effect where I take that masking

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.969 
dark effect where I take that masking
fluid<00:04:59.960> off<00:05:00.289> the<00:05:01.039> top<00:05:01.250> of<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.460> bridge<00:05:02.650> will<00:05:03.650> use

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
fluid off the top of the bridge will use

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.960 
fluid off the top of the bridge will use
the<00:05:04.400> number<00:05:04.550> one<00:05:04.880> brush<00:05:05.150> I<00:05:05.330> think<00:05:05.570> to<00:05:05.930> get<00:05:06.139> this

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
the number one brush I think to get this

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.650 
the number one brush I think to get this
quickly<00:05:07.970> get<00:05:08.210> this<00:05:09.820> darker<00:05:10.820> branch<00:05:11.060> in<00:05:11.330> here

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
quickly get this darker branch in here

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.210 
quickly get this darker branch in here
right<00:05:12.259> now<00:05:12.289> we<00:05:12.710> will<00:05:12.889> put<00:05:13.039> some<00:05:13.310> very<00:05:14.180> strong

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
right now we will put some very strong

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.580 
right now we will put some very strong
burnt<00:05:16.220> umber<00:05:16.400> and<00:05:16.880> the<00:05:17.810> shadow<00:05:18.050> side<00:05:18.410> of<00:05:18.440> the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
burnt umber and the shadow side of the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.839 
burnt umber and the shadow side of the
tree<00:05:18.800> without<00:05:18.979> a<00:05:19.099> little<00:05:19.340> bit<00:05:19.460> of<00:05:19.580> blue<00:05:19.820> I

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
tree without a little bit of blue I

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.140 
tree without a little bit of blue I
think<00:05:20.139> make<00:05:21.139> it<00:05:21.289> stronger<00:05:21.620> still<00:05:22.039> write<00:05:22.910> that

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
think make it stronger still write that

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.909 
think make it stronger still write that
tree<00:05:23.389> nicely<00:05:23.690> frames<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.289> bridge<00:05:24.530> which<00:05:24.740> in

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
tree nicely frames the bridge which in

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.219 
tree nicely frames the bridge which in
turn<00:05:25.160> frames<00:05:25.550> the<00:05:25.729> water<00:05:25.910> so<00:05:26.539> I'm<00:05:26.810> happy<00:05:27.080> with

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
turn frames the water so I'm happy with

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.159 
turn frames the water so I'm happy with
that<00:05:27.289> I'm<00:05:27.530> going<00:05:27.620> to<00:05:27.680> leave<00:05:27.860> that<00:05:28.070> as<00:05:28.280> it<00:05:28.400> is

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
that I'm going to leave that as it is

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.200 
that I'm going to leave that as it is
I've<00:05:30.169> added<00:05:30.289> some<00:05:30.620> areas<00:05:31.220> of<00:05:31.460> pale

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
I've added some areas of pale

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.830 
I've added some areas of pale
ultramarine<00:05:33.080> blue<00:05:33.110> on<00:05:33.949> its<00:05:34.130> own<00:05:34.340> just<00:05:35.180> in<00:05:35.449> so

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
ultramarine blue on its own just in so

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.350 
ultramarine blue on its own just in so
these<00:05:36.020> areas<00:05:36.560> where<00:05:37.190> I<00:05:37.400> want<00:05:37.639> to<00:05:37.789> pick<00:05:37.970> up<00:05:38.000> the

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
these areas where I want to pick up the

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.310 
these areas where I want to pick up the
reflection<00:05:39.020> of<00:05:39.139> the<00:05:39.229> water<00:05:39.409> in<00:05:39.979> the<00:05:40.430> sky<00:05:40.729> and

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
reflection of the water in the sky and

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.770 
reflection of the water in the sky and
I've<00:05:42.320> used<00:05:43.220> the<00:05:43.820> flat<00:05:44.090> brush<00:05:44.360> for<00:05:44.419> this<00:05:44.720> and

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
I've used the flat brush for this and

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.430 
I've used the flat brush for this and
all<00:05:44.990> I've<00:05:45.169> done<00:05:45.199> is<00:05:45.560> just<00:05:46.720> scrape<00:05:47.720> the<00:05:47.780> colour

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
all I've done is just scrape the colour

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.379 
all I've done is just scrape the colour
on<00:05:48.650> like<00:05:48.889> that<00:05:49.099> I'll<00:05:49.610> show<00:05:49.849> you<00:05:49.880> what<00:05:50.120> I<00:05:50.150> mean

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
on like that I'll show you what I mean

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.250 
on like that I'll show you what I mean
by<00:05:51.130> just<00:05:52.130> doing<00:05:52.760> this<00:05:52.909> pool<00:05:53.210> here<00:05:53.570> what<00:05:54.050> I<00:05:54.080> want

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
by just doing this pool here what I want

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.670 
by just doing this pool here what I want
to<00:05:54.349> do<00:05:54.560> is<00:05:54.710> just<00:05:54.949> simply<00:05:55.729> just<00:05:56.120> pick<00:05:56.360> up<00:05:56.680> some

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
to do is just simply just pick up some

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.550 
to do is just simply just pick up some
little<00:05:58.310> hit-and-miss<00:05:58.789> effect<00:05:59.330> here<00:06:00.259> like

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
little hit-and-miss effect here like

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.240 
little hit-and-miss effect here like
that<00:06:00.770> and<00:06:01.130> you<00:06:01.580> can<00:06:01.820> see<00:06:02.090> how<00:06:02.960> good<00:06:03.470> the<00:06:03.800> flat

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
that and you can see how good the flat

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.850 
that and you can see how good the flat
brush<00:06:04.580> is<00:06:04.880> at<00:06:05.210> doing<00:06:05.599> this<00:06:05.750> and<00:06:06.380> try<00:06:06.800> to

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
brush is at doing this and try to

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.600 
brush is at doing this and try to
imitate<00:06:07.580> and<00:06:08.060> replicate<00:06:08.630> how<00:06:08.840> I<00:06:08.870> think<00:06:09.169> the

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
imitate and replicate how I think the

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.029 
imitate and replicate how I think the
water<00:06:10.610> would<00:06:11.030> be<00:06:11.180> pushing<00:06:11.690> itself<00:06:12.080> from<00:06:12.770> two

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
water would be pushing itself from two

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.100 
water would be pushing itself from two
directions<00:06:13.250> here<00:06:14.030> there's<00:06:14.509> perhaps<00:06:14.720> a<00:06:15.099> fairly

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
directions here there's perhaps a fairly

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.200 
directions here there's perhaps a fairly
strong<00:06:18.130> color<00:06:19.130> all<00:06:19.400> right<00:06:19.550> and<00:06:19.669> go<00:06:19.789> over<00:06:20.120> that

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
strong color all right and go over that

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.360 
strong color all right and go over that
can't<00:06:20.539> I<00:06:20.750> because<00:06:21.110> I'm<00:06:21.620> just<00:06:21.830> going<00:06:22.130> over<00:06:22.250> the

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
can't I because I'm just going over the

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.159 
can't I because I'm just going over the
masking<00:06:22.820> fluid<00:06:22.970> so<00:06:23.360> after<00:06:23.750> worried<00:06:23.930> about

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
masking fluid so after worried about

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:24.640 
masking fluid so after worried about
that

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
that

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.409 
that
take<00:06:24.949> that<00:06:25.099> down<00:06:25.370> like<00:06:25.550> that<00:06:25.699> and<00:06:25.909> all<00:06:26.030> you<00:06:26.060> do

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
take that down like that and all you do

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.790 
take that down like that and all you do
all<00:06:26.720> I'm<00:06:26.870> doing<00:06:27.169> you<00:06:27.289> see<00:06:27.620> is<00:06:27.860> just<00:06:28.220> simply

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
all I'm doing you see is just simply

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.649 
all I'm doing you see is just simply
scraping<00:06:30.800> that<00:06:30.919> brush<00:06:31.250> sideways<00:06:32.120> and<00:06:32.479> in

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:32.659 
scraping that brush sideways and in

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:36.189 
scraping that brush sideways and in
doing<00:06:32.960> so<00:06:33.199> it<00:06:33.710> gives<00:06:34.009> a<00:06:34.190> lovely<00:06:34.490> sparkle<00:06:35.300> to

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
doing so it gives a lovely sparkle to

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.300 
doing so it gives a lovely sparkle to
the<00:06:36.320> water<00:06:36.669> without<00:06:37.669> any<00:06:37.820> effort<00:06:38.360> whatsoever

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
the water without any effort whatsoever

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.769 
the water without any effort whatsoever
while<00:06:40.310> I<00:06:40.340> still<00:06:40.729> damp<00:06:40.969> I'm<00:06:41.210> just<00:06:41.419> going<00:06:41.570> to<00:06:41.599> put

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:41.779 
while I still damp I'm just going to put

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:44.090 
while I still damp I'm just going to put
some<00:06:42.070> darker<00:06:43.070> color<00:06:43.310> in<00:06:43.490> there<00:06:43.700> because

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
some darker color in there because

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.940 
some darker color in there because
that's<00:06:44.280> quite<00:06:44.970> dark<00:06:45.360> where<00:06:45.630> it<00:06:45.780> picks<00:06:46.080> up<00:06:46.290> the

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
that's quite dark where it picks up the

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.260 
that's quite dark where it picks up the
reflection<00:06:47.610> of<00:06:48.420> these<00:06:48.710> rocks<00:06:49.710> a<00:06:50.270> fairly

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
reflection of these rocks a fairly

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.480 
reflection of these rocks a fairly
strong<00:06:51.570> color<00:06:51.930> not<00:06:52.200> a<00:06:52.230> huge<00:06:52.710> amount<00:06:52.920> of<00:06:53.220> water

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
strong color not a huge amount of water

00:06:53.490 --> 00:07:02.240 
strong color not a huge amount of water
in<00:06:53.730> it<00:06:56.480> but<00:06:57.480> that'll<00:06:57.720> do<00:06:57.870> fine<00:07:00.050> for<00:07:01.050> the<00:07:01.830> area

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
in it but that'll do fine for the area

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.980 
in it but that'll do fine for the area
underneath<00:07:02.790> the<00:07:02.910> bridge<00:07:03.270> that's<00:07:03.540> going<00:07:03.870> to

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
underneath the bridge that's going to

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.370 
underneath the bridge that's going to

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
roll in to the light area that we've

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.070 
roll in to the light area that we've
painted<00:07:07.680> for<00:07:08.100> the<00:07:08.130> sky<00:07:08.460> now<00:07:09.180> I'm<00:07:09.660> putting<00:07:09.990> a

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
painted for the sky now I'm putting a

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.920 
painted for the sky now I'm putting a
dark<00:07:10.350> area<00:07:10.620> here<00:07:10.980> because<00:07:11.610> I<00:07:11.910> want<00:07:12.660> to<00:07:12.720> create

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
dark area here because I want to create

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.830 
dark area here because I want to create
the<00:07:13.230> impression<00:07:13.320> of<00:07:13.950> this<00:07:14.790> area<00:07:15.300> here<00:07:15.510> being

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
the impression of this area here being

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.150 
the impression of this area here being
an<00:07:16.020> overhanging<00:07:16.500> rock<00:07:16.890> and<00:07:17.540> creating<00:07:18.540> shadows

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 
an overhanging rock and creating shadows

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.340 
an overhanging rock and creating shadows
on<00:07:20.160> the<00:07:20.220> water<00:07:20.610> like<00:07:21.210> that<00:07:21.240> that's<00:07:22.050> a<00:07:22.170> nice

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350 
on the water like that that's a nice

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.700 
on the water like that that's a nice
little<00:07:22.950> bit<00:07:23.220> of<00:07:23.310> added<00:07:23.460> character<00:07:23.990> to<00:07:24.990> an<00:07:25.320> area

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.710 
little bit of added character to an area

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.050 
little bit of added character to an area
that<00:07:27.590> often<00:07:28.590> happens<00:07:28.950> but<00:07:29.340> you<00:07:29.580> don't<00:07:29.730> always

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 
that often happens but you don't always
