00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.359
 for a new little video at the relatively 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.010
 late friday evening 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.080
 the reason for this package is what 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.330
 I like that sony today 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.620
 and one or the other could 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.880
 already think what's in yours 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.000
 it says department of use file 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.789
 protection us as we see this 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.980
 logo in corner and all informations 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.810
 friends a game or an exclusive title 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.420
 the next friday the 21st 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.949
 appear have already idea what you there 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.269
 This is my review kit 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.369
 this dÃ©partement on unified 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.710
 protection is of course this unit 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.020
 in the match against the conduit starts and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.670
 write hamdi me a few documents 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.510
 sent and I would say that 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.170
 have a look 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.920
 not like a classic unboxing 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.510
 Now we will step here for 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.950
 step as unpack but me 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.079
 jump through the video a bit 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.090
 Show you the matter is simply because 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.680
 that I have the video here with one hand 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.199
 take up with the other try things 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.539
 to show something good in the fundamental 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.250
 The package in it were three proofs 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.710
 made bags really nice 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.390
 fitting to have an infamous one 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.000
 We have a bag for you 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.979
 evidence of course, something with 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.770
 delsen probably in the world 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.960
 left behind and bag with the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.909
 disco that means three bags 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.200
 different content what exactly in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.360
 the bags in there we will be 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.970
 take a look 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.320
 even if it is already here quite small 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.909
 I do not know how good it is in the video 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.560
 but has to see how nice 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.790
 We like real proof bag 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.049
 are raised when the seal 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.920
 you should be broken first 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.680
 contact partner 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.710
 nice little idea which of course is perfect 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.030
 into this world fits in well by infamous 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.060
 now we have the whole I've got it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.079
 Unpacked in bag a the as a disc 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.970
 was described 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.670
 after I broke the seal 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.159
 I have my full version of infamous 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.020
 second sun the ps4 version's different 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.570
 the whole thing is not so exclusive 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.770
 Bag B with the evidence was in it 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.320
 delsen bini with two little buttons that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.759
 is a man two button is natural 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.670
 fitting because sucker punch is that 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.040
 studio responsible for sly cooper 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.039
 was and a button with the company logo 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.409
 and we have a bag of files 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.349
 heaps of informational material too 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:15.120
 nelson roses allied his friends 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.950
 was in there and we have a cat the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.329
 was not included because that would be 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.390
 a bit difficult for sony 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.250
 but he confesses that by now 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.680
 i record a video emilia is never 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.879
 especially far so I wanted to go short 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.010
 look because these files are whole 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.650
 interesting came to the normal 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.299
 One would almost say you are a file folder 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.170
 such a perfect difference will be the 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.889
 characters 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.030
 We have artworks that you can see the 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.819
 have information about the individual 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.159
 character is really incredibly nice 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.200
 made so heavy from the basic building the 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.909
 cat is trying to get a look inside 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.849
 to catch the camera is actually 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:53.159
 made this whole cool 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.689
 media press kit is as I said so not 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.909
 in the form of trade but available 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.439
 as I said only for press so 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.069
 trying nowhere to buy it 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.849
 not possible in the form here too 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.040
 monitor images set with model 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.409
 his abilities were recorded 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.909
 I think that's really cool 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.840
 Of course it does not affect you in any way 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:14.250
 somehow my test or like me 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.139
 the game before faster but me 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.060
 always find it cool when 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.560
 developers really take time or 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.959
 happens when the pr company delta 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.519
 timeliness and and matching pr kids 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.560
 Just make and just when I am 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.449
 I want to see this here 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.970
 actually raise directly with the 138 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:31.680
 and as is dells pini 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.299
 he wants that right on pretty much 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.609
 fall unstable 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.229
 now i know a rank good you have 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.409
 the game now there how it looks from when 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:42.269
 it starts with the videos is the thing 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.829
 The next thursday is still to come 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.909
 an embargo on the game I can not 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.400
 in court not on no screenshots 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.069
 I can actually publish 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.849
 not to show the game and I can 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.280
 break of course 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.409
 that is when we will have videos 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.010
 the next thursday 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.139
 20 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.540
 I think at 15 or something like that 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.739
 embargo exactly when a tree has fallen 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.030
 is the first videos online 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.590
 go by that of course now 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.480
 a leap a few days ago 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.620
 but it will look like we have some 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.849
 are bang out of videos 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.500
 that means it might be similar 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.120
 be over south park that i am the first one 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.970
 just start a larger amount 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.350
 videos was large and possible them 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.940
 I get a good impression with the game 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.769
 really curious but not yet 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.359
 this is playing we thought we were watching 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.760
 the whole thing first what it is here in 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.830
 this media kit in there because I think as 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.979
 Idea cool and thought I'll show you 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.330
 that joke a bit with you and 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.130
 how it looks like I am happy and 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.070
 then you have a ps4 you still have 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.150
 No taps waiting for you 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.800
 it's an exclusive lot for you guys 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.960
 one would really buy me 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.729
 so here you are interested in Romaniacs 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.990
 the comments and yes I hope this 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:48.389
 small impression in this little media 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.910
 press goes a little lust 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.120
 at stake for me is now 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.690
 huge will insert the console and 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.220
 defenseless play 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.590
 who changes me in the ps that will be 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.000
 So the next day we've seen her 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.710
 so good do not want to ask me how 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.150
 this one i can not answer anything and 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.789
 that will not be broken friends 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.700
 Well that was it in the place with one 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.680
 small I call it semi unboxing 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.530
 because i personally do not like unboxing 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.330
 and have also mostly a hands-free 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.039
 that's why there is not boxing after 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.389
 with us and now again emilia 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.280
 seen is doing well 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.990
 otherwise you will hear only good friends 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.990
 that was it until next time
