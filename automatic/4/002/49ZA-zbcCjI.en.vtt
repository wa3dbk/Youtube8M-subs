once with your left hand and that's the
kind<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> tricky<00:01:47.520> part<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.909> takes<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
kind of the tricky part that takes a

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.210 
kind of the tricky part that takes a
little<00:01:48.299> bit<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.509> work<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.689> line<00:01:49.079> up<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.920> make

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
little bit of work to line up and make

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.490 
little bit of work to line up and make
it<00:01:50.250> clean<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.329> once<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.140> starts<00:01:52.439> to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
it clean but once you do it starts to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.840 
it clean but once you do it starts to
sound<00:01:52.649> pretty<00:01:52.860> cool<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.520> really

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
sound pretty cool and you can really

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.240 
sound pretty cool and you can really
lock<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.170> go<00:01:55.290> right<00:01:55.560> left<00:01:55.799> right

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
lock it in so we go right left right

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.490 
lock it in so we go right left right
left<00:01:56.310> okay<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.360> let's<00:01:57.600> try<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.869> again

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500 

and<00:02:01.190> now<00:02:01.280> let's<00:02:01.460> just<00:02:01.580> try<00:02:01.730> to<00:02:01.790> loop<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.300> at<00:02:02.480> a

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
and now let's just try to loop that at a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:10.960 
and now let's just try to loop that at a
fairly<00:02:02.840> slow<00:02:03.230> speed<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:03.740> we'll<00:02:03.860> go<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:10.759> we<00:02:10.850> do

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
fairly slow speed so we'll go so we do

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.030 
fairly slow speed so we'll go so we do
that<00:02:11.120> twice<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.870> then<00:02:11.990> on<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.200> third<00:02:12.230> time<00:02:12.740> we

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
that twice and then on the third time we

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.980 
that twice and then on the third time we
just<00:02:13.190> go<00:02:13.370> right<00:02:13.640> left<00:02:13.910> right<00:02:14.300> left<00:02:14.360> on<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
just go right left right left on the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.300 
just go right left right left on the
snare<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.530> then<00:02:15.680> that's<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:15.980> that's<00:02:16.130> the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
snare and then that's it that's the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.400 
snare and then that's it that's the
whole<00:02:16.430> fill<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:16.940> it's<00:02:17.090> just<00:02:17.240> right<00:02:17.630> left<00:02:18.020> right

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
whole fill so it's just right left right

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.640 
whole fill so it's just right left right
left<00:02:18.470> right<00:02:19.160> left<00:02:19.730> right<00:02:20.330> left<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:21.230> then

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
left right left right left and then

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.010 
left right left right left and then
right<00:02:21.680> left<00:02:22.370> right<00:02:22.760> left<00:02:22.820> on<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.480> snare<00:02:23.720> and

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
right left right left on the snare and

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.840 
right left right left on the snare and
so<00:02:24.230> that's<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.530> whole<00:02:24.680> fill<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.520> let's<00:02:25.670> do<00:02:25.760> it

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
so that's the whole fill so let's do it

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.880 
so that's the whole fill so let's do it
from<00:02:26.000> start<00:02:26.240> to<00:02:26.330> finish<00:02:26.630> pretty<00:02:27.320> slowly<00:02:27.620> so

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
from start to finish pretty slowly so

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:39.640 
from start to finish pretty slowly so
here<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.100> goes<00:02:33.370> let's<00:02:34.370> do<00:02:34.459> it<00:02:34.489> again<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:39.530> now

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
here it goes let's do it again so now

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.990 
here it goes let's do it again so now
let's<00:02:39.830> work<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.100> into<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.310> bead<00:02:40.580> at<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.760> fairly

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
let's work it into a bead at a fairly

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.760 
let's work it into a bead at a fairly
slow<00:02:41.360> pace<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:41.900> we'll<00:02:42.080> see<00:02:42.230> how<00:02:42.350> it<00:02:42.380> starts<00:02:42.680> to

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
slow pace and we'll see how it starts to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:03:06.699 
slow pace and we'll see how it starts to
sound<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.310> let's<00:02:43.459> do<00:02:43.580> it<00:03:05.410> so<00:03:06.410> it's<00:03:06.530> nice<00:03:06.680> and

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709
