okay we'll get to the giant battle-ax
made<00:00:16.209> out<00:00:16.360> of<00:00:16.480> saw<00:00:16.660> blades<00:00:16.960> in<00:00:17.080> a<00:00:17.170> second<00:00:17.590> but

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
made out of saw blades in a second but

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
made out of saw blades in a second but
we're<00:00:17.980> just<00:00:18.010> going<00:00:18.310> to<00:00:18.400> start<00:00:18.640> out<00:00:18.760> small

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
we're just going to start out small

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.730 
we're just going to start out small
right<00:00:19.450> now<00:00:19.660> and<00:00:19.930> we're<00:00:20.080> going<00:00:20.200> to<00:00:20.230> ramp<00:00:20.470> it<00:00:20.620> up

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
right now and we're going to ramp it up

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.920 
right now and we're going to ramp it up
alright<00:00:21.220> so<00:00:21.790> here's<00:00:22.150> a<00:00:22.210> couple<00:00:22.510> of<00:00:22.600> machetes

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
alright so here's a couple of machetes

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.320 
alright so here's a couple of machetes
that<00:00:23.200> I<00:00:23.230> made<00:00:23.470> this<00:00:24.250> one<00:00:24.550> I<00:00:24.820> drilled<00:00:25.150> these

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
that I made this one I drilled these

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.180 
that I made this one I drilled these
drill<00:00:26.020> these<00:00:26.140> holes<00:00:26.200> in<00:00:26.590> it<00:00:26.710> to<00:00:26.830> lighten<00:00:27.130> up

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
drill these holes in it to lighten up

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.800 
drill these holes in it to lighten up
the<00:00:27.310> blade<00:00:27.550> so<00:00:27.760> you<00:00:27.790> can<00:00:27.970> swing<00:00:28.240> it<00:00:28.360> faster

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
the blade so you can swing it faster

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.300 
the blade so you can swing it faster
right<00:00:28.930> but<00:00:29.050> a<00:00:29.080> pointy<00:00:29.470> tip<00:00:29.650> on<00:00:29.830> it<00:00:30.010> so<00:00:30.160> it's

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
right but a pointy tip on it so it's

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.310 
right but a pointy tip on it so it's
better<00:00:30.460> for<00:00:30.700> stabbing<00:00:31.030> rather<00:00:31.900> than<00:00:32.169> that

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
better for stabbing rather than that

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.709 
better for stabbing rather than that
rounded<00:00:32.920> tip<00:00:33.190> usually<00:00:33.430> see<00:00:33.910> an<00:00:34.030> machetes<00:00:34.510> I

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
rounded tip usually see an machetes I

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.189 
rounded tip usually see an machetes I
put<00:00:35.620> this<00:00:36.519> handle<00:00:37.059> on<00:00:37.179> it<00:00:37.390> that's<00:00:37.600> made<00:00:37.870> out<00:00:37.899> of

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
put this handle on it that's made out of

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:39.810 
put this handle on it that's made out of
like<00:00:38.379> probably<00:00:38.649> a<00:00:38.800> million<00:00:39.280> feet<00:00:39.460> of<00:00:39.489> paracord

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
like probably a million feet of paracord

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.079 
like probably a million feet of paracord
and<00:00:40.179> then<00:00:40.329> I<00:00:40.359> pulled<00:00:41.159> an<00:00:42.159> inner<00:00:42.489> tube<00:00:42.730> from<00:00:42.969> a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
and then I pulled an inner tube from a

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.590 
and then I pulled an inner tube from a
tire<00:00:43.329> over<00:00:43.659> it<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:45.070> thing<00:00:45.699> I'm<00:00:45.969> carved<00:00:46.449> it

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
tire over it this thing I'm carved it

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.299 
tire over it this thing I'm carved it
out<00:00:46.690> of<00:00:46.899> I<00:00:47.079> think<00:00:47.109> just<00:00:47.649> some<00:00:47.800> kind<00:00:47.980> of<00:00:48.039> scrap

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
out of I think just some kind of scrap

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.209 
out of I think just some kind of scrap
wood<00:00:48.339> from<00:00:48.730> a<00:00:48.850> basement<00:00:49.089> and<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.920> I<00:00:51.010> wrap

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
wood from a basement and then I wrap

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.729 
wood from a basement and then I wrap
tape<00:00:51.489> around<00:00:51.519> it<00:00:51.879> because<00:00:52.269> I<00:00:52.480> am<00:00:52.690> super<00:00:53.589> super

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
tape around it because I am super super

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.540 
tape around it because I am super super
rich<00:00:54.100> and<00:00:54.579> I<00:00:55.149> can<00:00:55.359> afford<00:00:55.629> tape<00:00:55.899> instead<00:00:56.409> of

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
rich and I can afford tape instead of

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.020 

okay<00:01:45.410> here's<00:01:45.620> one<00:01:45.770> of<00:01:45.830> my<00:01:45.890> favorites<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.580> don't

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
know if you remember those knives from

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.650 
know if you remember those knives from
Part<00:01:48.530> two<00:01:48.800> but<00:01:49.520> they<00:01:49.940> looked<00:01:50.240> pretty<00:01:50.480> cool

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
Part two but they looked pretty cool

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.360 
Part two but they looked pretty cool
they<00:01:50.840> didn't<00:01:51.080> have<00:01:51.260> very<00:01:51.470> good<00:01:51.590> blades<00:01:52.070> though

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
they didn't have very good blades though

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.270 
they didn't have very good blades though
because<00:01:52.580> they're<00:01:52.790> made<00:01:53.000> out<00:01:53.120> of<00:01:53.180> street<00:01:53.930> signs

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
because they're made out of street signs

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.430 
because they're made out of street signs
so<00:01:55.280> I<00:01:55.310> went<00:01:55.730> into<00:01:56.270> my<00:01:56.540> house<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:56.990> I<00:01:57.020> found<00:01:57.200> this

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
so I went into my house and I found this

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.920 
so I went into my house and I found this
display<00:01:58.010> sword<00:01:58.400> that<00:01:58.910> had<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.210> really<00:01:59.660> sharp

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
display sword that had a really sharp

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.060 
find this thing so I mean I got over it
but<00:02:10.720> it's<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.900> it's<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.200> pretty<00:02:12.380> good<00:02:12.590> weapon<00:02:12.770> now

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
but it's a it's a pretty good weapon now

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.560 
but it's a it's a pretty good weapon now
I<00:02:13.310> mean<00:02:13.520> obviously<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:14.030> don't<00:02:14.120> use<00:02:14.390> these

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
I mean obviously I don't use these

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.720 
I mean obviously I don't use these
things<00:02:14.780> for<00:02:14.960> anything<00:02:15.230> violent<00:02:16.070> but<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.610> know

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
things for anything violent but you know

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.540 
things for anything violent but you know
it<00:02:16.850> cuts<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.180> mean<00:02:17.390> water<00:02:17.600> bottle<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.550> here's

it cuts a mean water bottle so here's

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.690 
it cuts a mean water bottle so here's
the<00:02:19.820> demonstration<00:02:20.810> oh<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:20.990> I<00:02:21.890> wrapped<00:02:22.460> that

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
the demonstration oh I I wrapped that

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.630 
the demonstration oh I I wrapped that
tape<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.330> high<00:02:23.570> on<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:23.930> handle<00:02:24.290> because<00:02:24.860> now

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
tape so high on this handle because now

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.510 
tape so high on this handle because now
you<00:02:25.700> can<00:02:25.970> use<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.420> for<00:02:27.130> one-handed<00:02:28.130> use<00:02:28.280> or

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
you can use it for one-handed use or

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.210 
you can use it for one-handed use or
two-handed<00:02:28.850> use<00:02:29.210> so<00:02:29.720> I'll<00:02:30.560> give<00:02:31.190> a

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
two-handed use so I'll give a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:41.860 
two-handed use so I'll give a
demonstration<00:02:31.460> of<00:02:32.060> both<00:02:32.210> methods

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.920 

here<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.170> really<00:02:44.099> giant<00:02:44.489> huge<00:02:45.000> thing<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.900> I

this is a blade that is shaped similarly
to<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.769> kukri<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.930> has<00:03:03.930> similar<00:03:04.260> mechanics<00:03:04.980> to

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
to a kukri and has similar mechanics to

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.979 
to a kukri and has similar mechanics to
a<00:03:05.159> kukri<00:03:05.549> but<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.879> not<00:03:06.090> appropriate<00:03:06.689> this

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
a kukri but is not appropriate this

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.339 
a kukri but is not appropriate this
thing<00:03:07.290> right<00:03:07.799> here<00:03:07.829> this<00:03:08.310> extension<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.349> made

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
thing right here this extension I made

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.110 
thing right here this extension I made
it<00:03:10.500> out<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.739> some<00:03:10.950> kind<00:03:11.099> of<00:03:11.220> street<00:03:11.459> sign<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.760> can

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
it out of some kind of street sign I can

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.050 
it out of some kind of street sign I can
read<00:03:12.359> a<00:03:12.540> FF<00:03:13.470> but<00:03:13.769> I<00:03:13.799> don't<00:03:13.980> remember<00:03:14.129> what<00:03:14.940> it

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
read a FF but I don't remember what it

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.960 
read a FF but I don't remember what it
was<00:03:15.090> its<00:03:15.599> traffic<00:03:15.900> something<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.970> again

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
was its traffic something and again

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.240 
was its traffic something and again
about<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.269> million<00:03:18.690> feet<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:18.900> paracord<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.709> an

about a million feet of paracord and an
inner<00:03:20.459> tube<00:03:20.730> wrapped<00:03:21.629> around<00:03:22.139> therefore<00:03:22.799> a

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
inner tube wrapped around therefore a

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.759 
inner tube wrapped around therefore a
handle<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.849> pretty<00:03:24.780> much<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.109> same<00:03:25.290> thing<00:03:25.590> as

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
handle so pretty much the same thing as

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.800 
handle so pretty much the same thing as
that<00:03:26.010> first<00:03:26.340> machete<00:03:26.819> that<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.060> had<00:03:27.269> so<00:03:27.540> we'll

that first machete that I had so we'll

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:42.630 
that first machete that I had so we'll
do<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.139> demonstration<00:03:28.769> video<00:03:29.010> now

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.580 

no<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.819> blades<00:03:44.060> don't<00:03:44.330> spin<00:03:44.780> on<00:03:45.110> it<00:03:45.319> to<00:03:45.440> get

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
no the blades don't spin on it to get

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.869 
no the blades don't spin on it to get
that<00:03:45.769> out<00:03:45.890> of<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.040> way<00:03:46.129> before<00:03:46.190> anybody<00:03:46.670> asks

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
that out of the way before anybody asks

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.899 
that out of the way before anybody asks
me<00:03:47.299> they<00:03:47.690> are<00:03:47.950> stationary<00:03:48.950> they<00:03:49.280> are<00:03:49.489> static

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
me they are stationary they are static

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.559 
me they are stationary they are static
they<00:03:50.540> are<00:03:50.750> stuck<00:03:51.080> in<00:03:51.230> one<00:03:51.409> spot<00:03:51.769> so<00:03:52.069> if<00:03:53.000> you<00:03:53.390> ask

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
they are stuck in one spot so if you ask

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.020 
they are stuck in one spot so if you ask
me<00:03:53.750> if<00:03:53.870> they<00:03:54.019> spin<00:03:54.319> you're<00:03:54.560> just<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:55.640> funniest

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
me if they spin you're just the funniest

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.309 
me if they spin you're just the funniest
person<00:03:56.239> I've<00:03:56.540> ever<00:03:56.569> met<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.110> you<00:03:57.170> should

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
person I've ever met and you should

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.360 
person I've ever met and you should
probably<00:03:57.440> be<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:57.709> comedian

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
probably be a comedian

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.759 
probably be a comedian
these<00:03:58.970> are<00:03:59.180> tennis<00:03:59.660> raps<00:03:59.989> like<00:04:00.260> four<00:04:00.500> tennis

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
these are tennis raps like four tennis

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.420 
these are tennis raps like four tennis
racquets<00:04:01.220> so<00:04:01.599> this<00:04:02.599> is<00:04:02.780> probably<00:04:03.220> it<00:04:04.220> is

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
racquets so this is probably it is

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.069 
racquets so this is probably it is
probably<00:04:04.819> the<00:04:04.910> most<00:04:05.000> I've<00:04:05.360> ever<00:04:05.450> spent<00:04:05.840> on<00:04:06.019> a

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
probably the most I've ever spent on a

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.960 
probably the most I've ever spent on a
handle<00:04:06.560> just<00:04:06.709> these<00:04:06.920> little<00:04:07.190> these<00:04:07.910> little

handle just these little these little

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.330 
handle just these little these little

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
out of the edge of a stop sign as you

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.080 
out of the edge of a stop sign as you
can<00:04:15.709> see<00:04:15.920> if<00:04:16.100> you've<00:04:16.220> ever<00:04:16.370> been<00:04:16.579> up<00:04:16.729> close<00:04:16.760> to

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
a stop sign you can tell this is a

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.279 
a stop sign you can tell this is a
pretty<00:04:18.769> huge<00:04:18.949> thing<00:04:19.310> it's<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.539> weight<00:04:20.810> close<00:04:21.109> to

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
pretty huge thing it's a weight close to

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
okay okay let's do a shield now here is

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.260 
okay okay let's do a shield now here is
where<00:05:04.289> the<00:05:04.470> gauntlet<00:05:04.680> over<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.520> risk

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
into a stop sign shield I built in this

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.350 
into a stop sign shield I built in this
little<00:05:11.690> machete<00:05:12.650> folder<00:05:13.040> right<00:05:13.250> here<00:05:13.280> so<00:05:14.270> you

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
little machete folder right here so you

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.030 
little machete folder right here so you
can<00:05:14.540> start<00:05:14.780> your<00:05:14.930> machete<00:05:15.260> in<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.740> shield

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
actually develop it just slide it back

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.020 
actually develop it just slide it back
in<00:05:21.460> with<00:05:22.460> this

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
in with this

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.190 
in with this
good<00:05:25.150> to<00:05:25.360> go<00:05:26.070> nowhere<00:05:27.070> because<00:05:27.580> we<00:05:28.570> dumb<00:05:28.870> to

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
good to go nowhere because we dumb to

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.560 
good to go nowhere because we dumb to
carry<00:05:29.470> that<00:05:29.740> around

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
don't do that okay here's just a little

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.340 
don't do that okay here's just a little
modification<00:05:35.390> that<00:05:35.540> I<00:05:35.600> did<00:05:35.810> to<00:05:35.960> that<00:05:35.990> light

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
just this design that I did my callsign

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.930 
just this design that I did my callsign
on<00:05:43.700> it<00:05:43.880> for<00:05:44.120> that<00:05:44.270> up<00:05:45.250> that<00:05:46.250> movie<00:05:46.580> that<00:05:46.760> I<00:05:46.790> mean

same helmets just looks a little
different<00:05:59.510> so<00:05:59.660> I<00:06:00.320> thought<00:06:00.980> you<00:06:01.070> guys<00:06:01.130> might

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
want to see that because I thought it

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.630 
want to see that because I thought it
was<00:06:03.170> pretty<00:06:03.290> cool<00:06:03.590> this<00:06:03.860> one's<00:06:04.070> completely

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.460 
that I cut the form out of invented in
the<00:06:19.220> shape<00:06:19.490> and<00:06:19.760> it<00:06:20.330> actually<00:06:20.540> has<00:06:20.990> a<00:06:21.020> fully

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
the shape and it actually has a fully

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.500 
the shape and it actually has a fully
functional<00:06:22.040> particle<00:06:22.580> mask<00:06:22.790> inside<00:06:23.240> that

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
functional particle mask inside that

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.680 
functional particle mask inside that
there's<00:06:23.720> no<00:06:23.840> filters<00:06:24.290> in<00:06:24.410> it<00:06:24.500> right<00:06:24.620> now<00:06:24.680> but

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
there's no filters in it right now but

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.990 
there's no filters in it right now but
just<00:06:27.200> pop<00:06:27.470> that<00:06:27.710> off<00:06:27.830> and<00:06:28.040> pop<00:06:28.220> a<00:06:28.250> filter<00:06:28.700> into

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
just pop that off and pop a filter into
