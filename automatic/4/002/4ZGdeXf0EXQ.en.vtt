00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.240
 another video like me 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.240
 today about the topic minne kraft 2 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.070
 because yes I have times in the days 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.350
 thought over and somehow there was yes 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.750
 sometimes we are yes will minecraft 2 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.670
 give or not and if so how could 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.200
 the whole because so be that 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.790
 play and I just have a look 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.770
 think about turning a round over 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.940
 this theme 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.290
 and yes the video will be here too 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.350
 I'm not too long now 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.230
 Here's another free kick 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.810
 receiving and the type will get me 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.489
 or not or not 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:50.480
 because I have the angel of death and 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.640
 very blow away minecraft anyway 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.629
 let's just stop it, it will be 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.280
 it will not happen 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.280
 and if so how could the whole 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.440
 of course, and yes me 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.899
 honestly, think of it at the beginning 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.080
 it will probably be minecraft two 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:10.850
 Do not give or type behind me 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.790
 It will be cross two, I guess 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.620
 not honestly why 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.330
 should you minecraft two because at all 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.890
 bring out a guy who is following 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.759
 me just what is going on permanently 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.829
 Schifani German what another 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.720
 and yes what should I think then 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.490
 be changed if the two minecraft 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.369
 So my eyes even look like that 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.470
 no sense because it has to be any 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.240
 innovations come to that if it is 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.909
 should give 2 microns and be honest 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.970
 said and the innovation in 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:45.290
 can be added to sent 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.479
 yes, just in minecraft 1 or just 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.219
 in minecraft pure packaging therefore results 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.329
 in my eyes somehow none at all 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:54.590
 to make sense as a new minecraft on what 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.560
 the others may say 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.729
 could of course be yes one could do so 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.729
 make a better graphic 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.240
 but honestly I'm wondering 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.640
 somehow remotely doing the whole thing 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.150
 because sense so new graphics in minecraft 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.890
 to do that because frankly yes 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.220
 minecraft is minecraft that it is pixelated 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.930
 And that's the basic principle that would 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.840
 I find mine destroy minecraft if that 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.620
 not pixel anymore I would be 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.600
 and yes, at least that's how I see it now 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.480
 and 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.490
 it is so I see it now 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.140
 at least because if minecraft is just 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.300
 just not so turned up 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.430
 built like your vision pixel players 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.700
 would be the framework before my time 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.410
 just broken and therefore think about it 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.480
 will definitely not minecraft 2 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.580
 because there were also the one or 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.140
 other speculation because microsoft now 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.520
 maybe bought minecraft 2 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.600
 will give or something but I guess 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.310
 that will not happen 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.610
 it will continue to shut down normally 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.220
 what a shame 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.720
 Well, no matter it will I think quite 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.070
 continue normally in development 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.370
 and so yes yes minecraft want two 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.690
 you do not think you give because something should 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.190
 you have to change it, please 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.780
 you can do everything you want in there 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.100
 minecraft so in the normal minecraft 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.500
 just pack it in and some others 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.760
 play like black ops for example 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.860
 I'll just take a call of duty 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.380
 as an example because he certainly only ever 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.460
 the graphics actually mostly ok and it 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.620
 Of course, the one or 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.750
 other new weapons or others 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.880
 Maps and but something minecraft is so 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.910
 built that one has rental maps one 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.630
 always has that means always but you have 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.090
 definitely 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.890
 You can not really do a graphic 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.890
 bring in improvements because it stops 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.470
 36 what you could do maybe 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.790
 but the standard textures improve 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.020
 then you could just stop again 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.960
 that standard resorts 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.460
 revise and I mean how much 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.520
 sinn makes it something like that again somehow 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.440
 I find it meaningless and yes now I will 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.430
 attacked by two sides and he 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.780
 ever burns perfect for such 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.470
 First of all, not in the race 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.180
 take care that does not get me ok 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.500
 Now I grab that but happy 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.739
 I want to go along with all this 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.739
 the belly there with those corner pick 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:28.030
 but now beautiful in your face effect 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.800
 round so far in any case and 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.389
 Of course today writes your opinion 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.419
 this topic in the comments would me 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:37.150
 definitely interested 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.669
 and oh so ok I understand what the type 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.230
 Of course I can write in chat 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.230
 fully understand your problems 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:58.810
 pizza oh shit i believe that one 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:01.860
 year or so mennel heck what is that 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.210
 because it is also a German 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.830
 and I just hope that the kanti 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:14.080
 because otherwise the two get 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:15.520
 run baldy's patch yeah okay me 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.110
 think he wants to express it 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.070
 that he does not understand that language and 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.510
 to now we look forward to the first 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.650
 guys come here now we grab 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.650
 which must grab the in any case 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:40.860
 excited at padborg pattburg so it 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.860
 was a yes I think team make 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.170
 oh man this is really bitter but right 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:54.640
 bitter if you should be her 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:56.700
 the think so looks very much afterwards 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.420
 because they just do not attack you 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.270
 do not mature 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.150
 and that is forbidden here because we 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.910
 are in normal sg and not him 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:14.460
 That's why I think so the times 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:18.610
 grab me well he writes a teams 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:22.540
 ask the grasping the attack 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.950
 yes ok attack but I have the 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.030
 have early on, the attacks have 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.690
 I saw that damn shit that 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:35.350
 was so stupid 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:39.250
 it was really stupid ok I still have 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:40.420
 it does not seem that the problem but man 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.760
 I can definitely say that 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:48.370
 not attacked because of that 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:49.660
 that a bit weird I have to 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.190
 so be careful so that's me 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.140
 careful just because I want now 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.850
 I did not collect more damage 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.850
 quite a bit through the fire 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:01.230
 cashed and then of course I have to 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.880
 watch out pretty well 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.940
 He wants to push me in lava but nothing 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.940
 there 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:15.460
 yes, he gives me the pink school 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.170
 frankly do not care, I guess that 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.830
 was everything I wanted to address in 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.930
 the video 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.310
 it was kinda fucking shit that dave 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.440
 if I heard right grabs me from 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.690
 because they just did not attack 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.960
 have, after all , ultimately has 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:31.530
 but individually lies and therefore I would 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.430
 people say what synonymous with the video and 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.140
 In any case, write your opinion 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.760
 the topic in the comments and there would 

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.690
 I care until next time load 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.690
 runs there and looks
