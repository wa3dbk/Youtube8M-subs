00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.210
 hello guys here I will do a tutorial 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.019
 very serious about what you are going to see now 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.110
 same 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.949
 when it's done a lot, it will get them but 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.720
 it's very difficult and this is a tutorial of 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:23.210
 I do not know if many people can use it 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.210
 Italian I do not know you want to know 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.440
 I do not know if many who are going to be able to do 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:38.280
 treat this is about how to open a chest 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:42.150
 worth the first thing is going to be that how to use 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.190
 the first action that as you see here I'm going 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.579
 to use not any block 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.100
 I'm going to use this block if you press the 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.100
 left that will be where to point to 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.960
 your door on the left to break is 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.239
 a block but this what we want 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.559
 because if we do not break the chest like that 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.840
 but that we do not want it worth 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:10.520
 but if we were a right click it 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.850
 will put a block like this very easy 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.170
 but not so easy and if we use the same 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:22.520
 method for the chest we can see that it 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.890
 It opens up, but if you give the brain 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.319
 will open a little handle but if we will 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.060
 so open up a little bit further and if the 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.770
 time right in the center not 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.820
 try because it's impossible because 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.950
 always serve there 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.670
 and with this tutorial I hope that I have 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.250
 liked and the chest since this yours is 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.250
 so hard to put things in 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.100
 you understand 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.240
 I already knew that I did not understand it but that 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.280
 have understood I hope they are 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.400
 lucky I hope you show this 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.080
 how to open tutorial 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.080
 our chest in maya 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.640
 goodbye
