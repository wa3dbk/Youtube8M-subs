next<00:00:09.310> up<00:00:09.430> is<00:00:09.580> to<00:00:09.700> put<00:00:09.880> brake<00:00:10.150> fluid<00:00:10.510> into<00:00:10.870> the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
next up is to put brake fluid into the

next up is to put brake fluid into the
system<00:00:11.700> we're<00:00:12.700> going<00:00:12.790> to<00:00:12.880> use<00:00:13.090> gal<00:00:13.360> for<00:00:13.600> super

system we're going to use gal for super
dot<00:00:14.080> for<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:15.639> really<00:00:16.270> important<00:00:16.780> that

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
dot for it's really important that

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.529 
dot for it's really important that
whenever<00:00:17.350> you<00:00:17.620> do<00:00:17.800> a<00:00:17.830> job<00:00:18.160> you<00:00:18.910> start<00:00:19.300> with<00:00:19.510> a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
whenever you do a job you start with a

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.100 
whenever you do a job you start with a
fresh<00:00:19.780> bottle<00:00:20.520> because<00:00:21.520> it's<00:00:21.670> hydroscopic<00:00:22.210> it

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
fresh bottle because it's hydroscopic it

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.140 
fresh bottle because it's hydroscopic it
absorbs<00:00:23.710> moisture<00:00:23.890> from<00:00:24.280> the<00:00:24.430> air<00:00:24.460> and<00:00:24.820> that

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
absorbs moisture from the air and that

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.000 
absorbs moisture from the air and that
is<00:00:25.300> really<00:00:25.570> not<00:00:25.870> good<00:00:26.050> for<00:00:26.080> your<00:00:26.290> brake<00:00:26.590> system

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
is really not good for your brake system

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.950 
is really not good for your brake system
whatsoever<00:00:27.340> so<00:00:27.910> if<00:00:28.390> you're<00:00:28.540> going<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.720> do<00:00:28.840> the

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
whatsoever so if you're going to do the

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.540 
whatsoever so if you're going to do the
job<00:00:29.200> start<00:00:29.530> with<00:00:29.650> a<00:00:29.680> brand<00:00:29.920> new<00:00:30.010> bottle<00:00:30.190> every

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
time recommended shelf life is about a

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.010 
time recommended shelf life is about a
month<00:00:33.160> but<00:00:33.550> that's<00:00:33.670> about<00:00:34.000> it<00:00:34.059> so<00:00:34.629> we<00:00:34.809> prefer

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
month but that's about it so we prefer

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.590 
month but that's about it so we prefer
just<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:35.500> start<00:00:35.739> fresh<00:00:35.980> every<00:00:36.280> time<00:00:36.600> today

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
into our brake fluid bottle next step is

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.570 
into our brake fluid bottle next step is
to<00:01:10.270> draw<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.600> fluid<00:01:10.960> all<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.159> way<00:01:12.280> through

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
to draw the fluid all the way through

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.060 
to draw the fluid all the way through
the<00:01:12.700> line<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.120> we'll<00:01:13.210> see<00:01:13.420> it<00:01:13.510> come<00:01:13.780> into<00:01:14.740> the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
the line and we'll see it come into the

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the line and we'll see it come into the
upper<00:01:15.310> chamber<00:01:15.520> here<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:21.430> we<00:01:21.490> need<00:01:21.760> to<00:01:21.909> take

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
upper chamber here now we need to take

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.630 
upper chamber here now we need to take
the<00:01:22.270> protective<00:01:22.930> rubber<00:01:23.170> cap<00:01:23.799> off<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.430> bleed

the protective rubber cap off the bleed

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.330 
the protective rubber cap off the bleed
nipple<00:01:24.820> loosen<00:01:25.659> the<00:01:25.750> nipple<00:01:26.049> attach<00:01:26.950> our

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
nipple loosen the nipple attach our

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.910 
nipple loosen the nipple attach our
fitting<00:01:28.210> on<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.540> end<00:01:28.570> of<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:28.930> tool<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.799> the

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
fitting on the end of the tool to the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.750 

now<00:01:34.869> we<00:01:34.930> quite<00:01:35.290> simply<00:01:35.680> use<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.010> pump<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.549> send

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
now we quite simply use the pump to send

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.700 
now we quite simply use the pump to send
the<00:01:36.880> fluid<00:01:37.240> through<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.630> caliper<00:01:38.229> up<00:01:38.409> through

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
the fluid through the caliper up through

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.399 
the fluid through the caliper up through
the<00:01:38.860> lines<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.400> wait<00:01:40.150> for<00:01:40.450> it<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.659> appear<00:01:41.170> up

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
the lines and wait for it to appear up

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:48.859 
the lines and wait for it to appear up
here<00:01:41.470> in<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.549> reservoir

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.230 

we<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.530> already<00:01:49.740> hear<00:01:50.280> air<00:01:50.549> popping<00:01:50.970> out<00:01:51.210> of

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
we can already hear air popping out of

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.910 
we can already hear air popping out of
the<00:01:51.390> top<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.840> reservoir<00:01:54.440> brake<00:01:55.440> systems

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.530 
the top of the reservoir brake systems
don't<00:01:56.040> take<00:01:56.280> very<00:01:56.490> much<00:01:56.640> fluid<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.119> all<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.450> you

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
don't take very much fluid at all so you

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.359 
don't take very much fluid at all so you
can<00:01:57.720> see<00:01:57.900> four<00:01:58.380> or<00:01:58.409> five<00:01:58.560> pumps<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.310> we

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
can see four or five pumps and we

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.700 
can see four or five pumps and we
already<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.970> fluid<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.600> reservoir<00:02:01.140> now

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
already have fluid in the reservoir now

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.469 
already have fluid in the reservoir now
we<00:02:01.770> don't<00:02:02.009> need<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:02.340> put<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.580> ton<00:02:02.880> into<00:02:03.360> the

we don't need to put a ton into the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.030 
we don't need to put a ton into the
reservoir<00:02:03.930> because<00:02:04.080> we<00:02:04.290> still<00:02:04.470> have<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.800> bleed

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
reservoir because we still have to bleed

like this there's going to be brake

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.729 
like this there's going to be brake
fluid<00:02:35.190> somewhere<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.330> clean<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.780> up<00:02:36.959> always

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
fluid somewhere so clean it up always

fluid somewhere so clean it up always
use<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.069> contact<00:02:38.700> cleaner<00:02:39.230> such<00:02:40.230> as<00:02:40.260> brake<00:02:41.040> or

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
use a contact cleaner such as brake or

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.850 
use a contact cleaner such as brake or
parts<00:02:41.970> clean<00:02:42.300> because<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.140> want<00:02:43.350> everything

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
parts clean because you want everything

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.970 
parts clean because you want everything
to<00:02:44.130> evaporate<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.480> contact<00:02:45.959> cleaner<00:02:46.230> or

to evaporate the contact cleaner or
literally<00:02:47.489> contact<00:02:48.030> cleaner<00:02:48.300> will<00:02:48.870> leave<00:02:49.050> a

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
literally contact cleaner will leave a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.750 
literally contact cleaner will leave a
residue<00:02:49.319> behind<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.220> don't<00:02:50.430> want<00:02:50.610> that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
residue behind and you don't want that

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.940 
residue behind and you don't want that
so<00:02:51.030> brake<00:02:51.360> clean<00:02:51.630> or<00:02:51.840> parts<00:02:52.200> clean<00:02:52.440> something

so brake clean or parts clean something

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.009 
so brake clean or parts clean something
like<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.310> get<00:02:53.910> rid<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.120> all<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.810> brake

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
go ahead and bleed the system the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.380 
go ahead and bleed the system the
traditional<00:03:06.660> way<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:08.130> will<00:03:08.280> be<00:03:08.459> just

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
traditional way and that will be just

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.270 
traditional way and that will be just
pumping<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.019> lever<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.530> releasing<00:03:11.160> our

bleed nipple to get any remaining air
that<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.769> caliper<00:03:14.100> out<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.120> system

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
that is in the caliper out of the system

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.110 
that is in the caliper out of the system
if<00:03:15.720> we<00:03:16.500> find<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:16.920> we<00:03:16.980> don't<00:03:17.190> have<00:03:17.430> all<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.820> it

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
if we find that we don't have all of it

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.990 
if we find that we don't have all of it
out<00:03:18.269> then<00:03:18.630> we<00:03:19.140> will<00:03:19.530> if<00:03:19.829> necessary<00:03:20.459> go<00:03:20.730> up<00:03:20.880> to

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
out then we will if necessary go up to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.150 
out then we will if necessary go up to
the<00:03:21.090> banjo<00:03:21.510> bolt<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.989> bleed<00:03:22.350> there<00:03:22.590> too<00:03:22.799> but

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
the banjo bolt and bleed there too but

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.910 
the banjo bolt and bleed there too but
in<00:03:23.310> general<00:03:23.760> just<00:03:24.140> use<00:03:25.140> your<00:03:25.290> bleed<00:03:25.530> screws

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
in general just use your bleed screws

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.770 
in general just use your bleed screws
and<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.430> should<00:03:26.700> get<00:03:27.120> rid<00:03:27.269> of<00:03:27.420> most<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.690> the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
and that should get rid of most of the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.560 
and that should get rid of most of the
air<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.140> system<00:03:28.790> now<00:03:29.790> traditional<00:03:30.329> brake

bleeding<00:03:30.900> is<00:03:31.260> quite<00:03:32.160> simple<00:03:32.579> you<00:03:33.090> pump<00:03:33.359> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
bleeding is quite simple you pump the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.330 
bleeding is quite simple you pump the
brake<00:03:33.660> lever<00:03:33.930> until<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:34.620> pressure<00:03:34.980> and

brake lever until you have pressure and
then<00:03:36.180> once<00:03:36.359> you've<00:03:36.510> got<00:03:36.660> pressure<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.680> very

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
then once you've got pressure you very

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.210 
then once you've got pressure you very
gently<00:03:38.190> relieve<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.540> bleed<00:03:39.810> screw<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.920> allow

you'll<00:03:51.570> see<00:03:51.840> we<00:03:51.989> also<00:03:52.140> have<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.410> rubber<00:03:52.680> line

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
you'll see we also have a rubber line

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.289 
you'll see we also have a rubber line
that<00:03:53.130> goes<00:03:53.250> back<00:03:53.579> into<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.060> brake<00:03:54.269> fluid

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
that goes back into the brake fluid

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.660 
that goes back into the brake fluid
bottle<00:03:55.019> because<00:03:55.859> this<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.190> brand<00:03:56.489> new

bottle because this is a brand new
system<00:03:56.879> so<00:03:57.150> if<00:03:57.629> we<00:03:57.810> want<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.050> be<00:03:58.140> really

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
system so if we want to be really

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.990 
system so if we want to be really
thorough<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:59.010> spend<00:03:59.280> twenty<00:03:59.580> minutes<00:03:59.610> doing

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
thorough and spend twenty minutes doing

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.030 
thorough and spend twenty minutes doing
this<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.450> get<00:04:00.569> it<00:04:00.720> absolutely

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
this to get it absolutely

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.250 
this to get it absolutely
fact<00:04:02.219> we<00:04:02.760> can<00:04:03.030> recycle<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.750> brake<00:04:03.930> fluid<00:04:03.959> to

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
fact we can recycle the brake fluid to

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.770 
fact we can recycle the brake fluid to
do<00:04:04.439> that<00:04:04.680> as<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:05.549> can<00:04:05.700> see<00:04:05.849> from<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.239> footage

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
do that as you can see from the footage

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.390 
do that as you can see from the footage
we're<00:04:07.200> not<00:04:07.409> getting<00:04:07.650> any<00:04:07.769> pressure<00:04:08.069> on<00:04:08.189> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
we're not getting any pressure on the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.000 
we're not getting any pressure on the
lever<00:04:08.609> here<00:04:08.969> at<00:04:09.120> all<00:04:09.590> so<00:04:10.590> we're<00:04:10.739> going<00:04:10.829> to<00:04:10.920> go

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
lever here at all so we're going to go

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.949 
lever here at all so we're going to go
ahead<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.609> start<00:04:11.819> at<00:04:11.969> the<00:04:12.000> top<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.329> bleed<00:04:12.780> the

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
ahead and start at the top and bleed the

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.170 
ahead and start at the top and bleed the
master<00:04:13.349> cylinder<00:04:13.530> we<00:04:14.310> have<00:04:14.459> two<00:04:14.640> options<00:04:14.819> we

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
master cylinder we have two options we

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.759 
master cylinder we have two options we
have<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.420> bleed<00:04:15.659> nipple<00:04:15.810> here<00:04:16.259> and<00:04:16.500> we<00:04:16.590> also

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
have the bleed nipple here and we also

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.189 
have the bleed nipple here and we also
have<00:04:16.949> the<00:04:17.070> banjo<00:04:17.489> joint<00:04:17.820> underneath<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:19.049> we'll

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
have the banjo joint underneath so we'll

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.259 
have the banjo joint underneath so we'll
use<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.440> primary<00:04:19.889> will<00:04:20.549> try<00:04:20.759> and<00:04:20.850> bleed<00:04:21.030> that

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
use the primary will try and bleed that

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.730 
use the primary will try and bleed that
down<00:04:21.509> and<00:04:21.840> get<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.049> air<00:04:22.199> out<00:04:22.380> through<00:04:22.410> the

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
down and get the air out through the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.740 
down and get the air out through the
bleed<00:04:22.949> hole<00:04:23.190> here<00:04:23.820> then<00:04:24.389> if<00:04:24.509> we're<00:04:24.660> getting

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
bleed hole here then if we're getting

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.050 
bleed hole here then if we're getting
good<00:04:25.020> pressure<00:04:25.289> then<00:04:25.620> we<00:04:25.740> can<00:04:25.889> go<00:04:26.070> back<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.610> the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
good pressure then we can go back to the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.240 
good pressure then we can go back to the
lower<00:04:27.240> lines<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:27.870> bleed<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.500> calipers<00:04:28.949> after

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
lower lines and bleed the calipers after

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:46.670 
lower lines and bleed the calipers after
that<00:04:29.400> oh<00:04:31.729> yeah<00:04:33.080> lots<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.289> air<00:04:45.199> we<00:04:46.199> got<00:04:46.349> most<00:04:46.590> of

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
that oh yeah lots of air we got most of

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.710 
that oh yeah lots of air we got most of
the<00:04:46.740> air<00:04:46.949> out<00:04:46.979> of<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.430> cylinder<00:04:47.729> so<00:04:48.330> now<00:04:48.539> we're

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
the air out of the cylinder so now we're

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.120 
the air out of the cylinder so now we're
getting<00:04:48.810> bar<00:04:49.080> pressure<00:04:49.349> what<00:04:49.620> does<00:04:49.770> that<00:04:49.800> mean

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
getting bar pressure what does that mean

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.610 
getting bar pressure what does that mean
well<00:04:50.460> when<00:04:50.669> you<00:04:50.789> pump<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.240> up<00:04:51.389> and<00:04:51.780> you<00:04:52.440> go<00:04:52.560> to

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
well when you pump it up and you go to

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.770 
well when you pump it up and you go to
release<00:04:52.949> pressure<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.820> bar<00:04:54.030> will<00:04:54.270> fold<00:04:54.599> in

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
release pressure the bar will fold in

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.140 
release pressure the bar will fold in
easily<00:04:55.289> so<00:04:55.949> now<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:56.250> know<00:04:56.699> that<00:04:56.729> you're

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
easily so now you know that you're

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.779 
easily so now you know that you're
reaching<00:04:57.389> a<00:04:57.630> stopping<00:04:58.020> point<00:04:58.229> that's<00:04:58.740> good<00:04:59.099> so

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
reaching a stopping point that's good so

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.610 
reaching a stopping point that's good so
we'll<00:05:00.270> go<00:05:00.419> ahead<00:05:00.660> go<00:05:00.900> to<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.199> bottom<00:05:01.349> of<00:05:01.560> the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
we'll go ahead go to the bottom of the

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.770 
we'll go ahead go to the bottom of the
bike<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:02.099> both<00:05:02.550> calipers<00:05:03.060> bleed<00:05:03.449> the<00:05:03.570> lines

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
bike to both calipers bleed the lines

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.649 
bike to both calipers bleed the lines
out<00:05:04.160> it's<00:05:05.160> up<00:05:05.280> to<00:05:05.400> you<00:05:05.550> but<00:05:05.789> I<00:05:05.820> will<00:05:06.000> spend<00:05:06.449> like

because I want to know my front brakes
are<00:05:10.260> perfect<00:05:11.220> so<00:05:11.520> be<00:05:11.909> patient<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.900> may<00:05:13.139> take<00:05:13.380> a

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
are perfect so be patient it may take a

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.290 
are perfect so be patient it may take a
little<00:05:13.680> longer<00:05:13.919> than<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:14.340> think<00:05:17.150> now<00:05:18.150> we've

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
little longer than you think now we've
