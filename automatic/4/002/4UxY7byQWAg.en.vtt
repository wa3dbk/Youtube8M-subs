the filter on my truck

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.340 
the filter on my truck

out wash it and put it back in so I'm

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.549

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
going to swap this out today and we'll

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.500 
going to swap this out today and we'll
take<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> look<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.579> difference<00:00:48.329> between

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
take a look in the difference between

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.619 
take a look in the difference between
the<00:00:48.750> two<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.899> them<00:00:50.329> all<00:00:51.329> right

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
the two of them all right

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.990 
the two of them all right
I've<00:00:51.780> already<00:00:51.930> got<00:00:52.140> my<00:00:52.250> four<00:00:53.250> screws<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.850> hold

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
I've already got my four screws to hold

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.810 
I've already got my four screws to hold
my<00:00:54.210> air<00:00:54.390> box<00:00:54.600> together<00:00:55.129> loosened<00:00:56.129> up<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.579> I

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
my air box together loosened up so I

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.229 
my air box together loosened up so I
just<00:00:57.000> need<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.239> reach<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.539> here<00:00:58.940> take<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> old

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
just need to reach in here take the old

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.420 
just need to reach in here take the old
filter<00:01:00.510> out

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.340 

so<00:01:07.430> here's<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.730> old<00:01:07.880> filter<00:01:08.290> this<00:01:09.290> filter

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
so here's the old filter this filter

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.880 
so here's the old filter this filter
actually<00:01:09.890> fits<00:01:10.870> four<00:01:11.870> or<00:01:12.110> five<00:01:12.350> different

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
actually fits four or five different

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.160 
actually fits four or five different
varieties<00:01:13.370> of<00:01:13.730> truck<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.390> truck<00:01:14.600> engines<00:01:14.960> so

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
varieties of truck and truck engines so

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.250 
varieties of truck and truck engines so
it's<00:01:15.440> sort<00:01:15.620> of<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:15.770> generic<00:01:16.160> filter<00:01:17.050> and<00:01:18.050> not

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
it's sort of a generic filter and not

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.200 
it's sort of a generic filter and not
very<00:01:18.500> specific<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:19.310> this<00:01:19.460> particular<00:01:19.610> model

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
very specific to this particular model

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.450 
very specific to this particular model
so<00:01:21.170> you'll<00:01:21.380> see<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.560> pretty<00:01:21.979> big<00:01:22.100> difference

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
so you'll see a pretty big difference

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.480 
so you'll see a pretty big difference
when<00:01:22.580> I<00:01:22.640> take<00:01:22.850> out<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.150> K&amp;N<00:01:23.360> filter<00:01:27.490> so

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
when I take out the K&amp;N filter so

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.690 
when I take out the K&amp;N filter so
there's<00:01:28.670> definitely<00:01:29.510> a<00:01:29.869> difference<00:01:30.260> in<00:01:30.700> the

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
there's definitely a difference in the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.520 
there's definitely a difference in the
width<00:01:32.830> and<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.890> depth<00:01:34.220> of<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.550> filter<00:01:35.530> this

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
width and the depth of the filter this

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.440 
width and the depth of the filter this
filter<00:01:36.590> is<00:01:36.920> pretty<00:01:37.190> tight<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.670> compact<00:01:37.880> I

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
filter is pretty tight and compact I

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.060 
filter is pretty tight and compact I
mean<00:01:38.690> I<00:01:38.840> can<00:01:39.020> see<00:01:39.229> where<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.470> sort<00:01:39.830> of<00:01:39.890> really

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
mean I can see where you sort of really

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.290 
mean I can see where you sort of really
have<00:01:40.160> to<00:01:40.280> force<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.640> air<00:01:40.759> to<00:01:40.940> get<00:01:41.030> through<00:01:41.090> it

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
have to force the air to get through it

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.020 
have to force the air to get through it
this<00:01:41.960> K&amp;N<00:01:42.259> filter<00:01:42.770> actually<00:01:43.000> increases<00:01:44.000> your

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
this K&amp;N filter actually increases your

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.840 
this K&amp;N filter actually increases your
horsepower<00:01:45.040> gas<00:01:46.040> mileage<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.550> things<00:01:46.729> along

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
horsepower gas mileage and things along

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.430 
horsepower gas mileage and things along
with<00:01:46.910> that<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:48.130> filters<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.160> lot<00:01:49.430> more<00:01:49.640> wider

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
with that the filters a lot more wider

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.770 
with that the filters a lot more wider
and<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.530> lot<00:01:51.710> better<00:01:51.920> material<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:53.570> cost

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
and a lot better material so this cost

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.480 
and a lot better material so this cost
forty<00:01:54.259> dollars<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:54.830> actually<00:01:54.979> I<00:01:55.220> think<00:01:55.399> it

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
forty dollars and actually I think it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.700 
forty dollars and actually I think it
cost<00:01:55.640> forty<00:01:56.000> seven<00:01:56.330> dollars<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:57.350> this<00:01:57.500> cost

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
cost forty seven dollars and this cost

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.040 
cost forty seven dollars and this cost
about<00:01:57.830> twenty<00:01:58.340> dollars<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:58.910> over<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.899> course

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
about twenty dollars so over the course

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.469 
about twenty dollars so over the course
of<00:02:00.229> just<00:02:00.470> three<00:02:01.310> filter<00:02:01.640> replacements<00:02:02.300> for<00:02:02.420> a

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
of just three filter replacements for a

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.060 
of just three filter replacements for a
normal<00:02:02.810> one<00:02:02.930> I'm<00:02:03.440> going<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.649> pay<00:02:03.770> for<00:02:03.979> the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070
