however<00:01:52.429> I'm<00:01:52.579> not<00:01:52.700> going<00:01:52.759> head<00:01:53.179> good<00:01:53.329> luck

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
however I'm not going head good luck

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.599 
however I'm not going head good luck
with<00:01:53.689> that<00:01:53.719> because<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.590> does<00:01:54.890> have<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.310> flex

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
with that because it does have to flex

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.969 
with that because it does have to flex
as<00:01:55.819> it<00:01:55.909> goes<00:01:55.999> in<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.270> out<00:01:56.359> of<00:01:56.479> there<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.200> clay

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
as it goes in and out of there the clay

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.580 
as it goes in and out of there the clay
does<00:01:58.249> not<00:01:58.490> flex<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.149> it's<00:01:59.179> it's<00:01:59.420> hardened<00:01:59.960> so

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
does not flex so it's it's hardened so

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.739 
does not flex so it's it's hardened so
we<00:02:00.770> generally<00:02:01.189> used<00:02:01.609> other<00:02:01.939> means<00:02:02.420> for

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
the seat pan that you need just take a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.090 
the seat pan that you need just take a
sharpie<00:02:36.180> now<00:02:36.620> depending<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.830> shape<00:02:38.070> that

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
sharpie now depending on the shape that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.220 
sharpie now depending on the shape that
you<00:02:38.400> want<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.760> top<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.240> seat<00:02:39.480> or<00:02:39.780> if<00:02:40.140> you

you want the top of the seat or if you

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.410 
you want the top of the seat or if you
come<00:02:40.410> up<00:02:40.440> out<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.860> tank<00:02:41.010> or<00:02:41.130> whatever<00:02:41.460> you

come up out of the tank or whatever you

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.080 
come up out of the tank or whatever you
can<00:02:42.600> refine<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.560> shape<00:02:43.890> later<00:02:44.310> once<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.910> pan

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
can refine that shape later once the pan

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.760 
can refine that shape later once the pan
is<00:02:45.270> made<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.780> draw<00:02:45.990> right<00:02:46.200> onto<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.590> seat

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
is made you can draw right onto the seat

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.290 
is made you can draw right onto the seat
pan<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.190> determine<00:02:47.580> where<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.910> want<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.120> cut

it at but for our purposes right now I'm
just<00:02:50.820> going<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.030> make<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:52.680> largest

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
just going to make it the largest

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.770 
just going to make it the largest
possible<00:02:53.250> area<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.850> might<00:02:54.090> want<00:02:54.330> for<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.570> seat
