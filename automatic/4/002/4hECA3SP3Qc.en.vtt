00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.270
 the latest farming tools 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.760
 of precision in combination with 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.500
 Axial harvesters were highly 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.230
 demanded by visitors who 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.279
 attended expoagro 2013 technology 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.289
 national service to producers 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.929
 rafael tosco and eduardo beruti de 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.199
 metalfor reviewed the development that has 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:28.269
 made the mark on axial harvesters 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.880
 to grow in the national market with 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.220
 more technology the harvest theme for 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.530
 we are a very important subject given 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.120
 that we have faced three years ago a 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.090
 very important project as has been the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.699
 1475 that today is in full condition 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.280
 of sale a machine that has evolved 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.679
 that the market today is watching it with 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.980
 the good eyes of a machine 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.300
 international competition with aptitudes 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.769
 excellent and as in the competitiveness of 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.929
 a national product that has the 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.870
 I support the support and all the technology 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.390
 a simple, easy-to-use machine that 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.370
 responds to all crops 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.989
 that we have tried and tested up 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.630
 unconventional crops where the 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.560
 machine has had a development 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.420
 excellent and good for our taste 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.729
 we are very happy 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.500
 the producer continues to support that the 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.470
 national industry through metalfor 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.780
 in the harvest line evolves and does not 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.340
 has difference against the big ones 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.530
 leaders who have managed the market for 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.970
 the harvest now the characteristics that 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.220
 make this machine stand out and 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.979
 power over the competition are in 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.649
 principle your rotor which is a machine 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.320
 a single axial rotor is purely axial 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.110
 It is a rotor that consists of an element 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.640
 delivery in the front that we 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.950
 guarantees that all the material is 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.979
 entering consistently uniform 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.990
 forming a whole mantle around that in 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.940
 definitive with that we achieved a 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.710
 excellent grain quality and a 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.319
 excellent separation in the final part 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.990
 in the part are not the fingers of this 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.479
 rotor is a rotor that has 750 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.149
 millimeters in diameter 3 thousand 150 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.860
 mm long and it really 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.090
 is behaving very well and behaved 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.399
 very well in all the tests that 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.739
 we did field in all crops the 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.130
 head is a 30-foot head on a 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.180
 flexible head has the swingarm 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.130
 they are really doing very well in 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.860
 complicated terrain we have tried it a 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.980
 ground of walls with presence 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.690
 the rest of roots like that we really have 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.910
 had very good results in the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.700
 Hopper capacity is 10 thousand 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.010
 liters that gives you flexibility gives you 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.290
 tranquility to the operator due to 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.780
 large capacity that the hopper has 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.210
 we have mapping we have what it is 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.150
 performance everything they need 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.959
 work already of precision in this machine 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.420
 As an option , you can 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.209
 acquire another important topic 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.700
 was the difference it generates in the 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.400
 operative work the type of the rotor that 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.540
 they use these machines one of the things 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.550
 that we have detected through the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.739
 queries and from which machines that already 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.190
 we have marketed is the system of 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.620
 rotor motorization 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.950
 This machine is equipped with a 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.350
 hydrostatic drive system 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.350
 both the transmission and the rotor 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.690
 that makes that in conjunction with the 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.020
 engine gives operational tranquility to 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.750
 that is driving the machine because they are 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.700
 many situations where the user 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.340
 the contractor comes across lands that 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.350
 are not only uneven on the level but 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.140
 that in crops are uneven with 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.330
 presence of pests and many times the 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.830
 rotor and they fall a bit back then 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.780
 through hydrostatic transmission 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.540
 and through the engine that equips it 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.610
 machine that is a motor is cane of that 9 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.870
 we not only give you the power 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.210
 but still falling a little wrapped 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.040
 we always maintain the torque so that 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.170
 does not have to walk the operator before 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.780
 adversity of before variations of 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.820
 condition of the crop lowering the speed 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.540
 of the machine in no way he 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.580
 only drive the engine before some 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.410
 demand or some power peak that is 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.680
 common in this state in these systems 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.000
 axial exceeds that and turns to 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.510
 restoring that is due 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.480
 It is an engine that works 1,900 laps 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.049
 which has its maximum torque between 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.780
 1600 and the 1900 turns so that in 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.270
 that range the operator who drives the 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.040
 user is calm and free of that 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.310
 upset we know it 's a fall 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.800
 wrapped in a single rotor system 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.770
 motorized with a belt many times 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.440
 be that it ends up burning or pulling out 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.060
 service to the drive belt that 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.250
 motorizes the rotor us from this 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.530
 way we are freeing him from that regret 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.430
 and doing the workday a lot 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.140
 more interesting and much more bearable 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.820
 We believe that we have the technical element 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.850
 and the credit for the producer 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.370
 think of Argentine in national and we 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.669
 let us grow as we need 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.340
 in a country that demands machinery 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.080
 agricultural technology and evolves well 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.250
 that we think we have a good set 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.250
 to advance
