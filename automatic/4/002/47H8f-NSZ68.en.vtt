controller and I've had this for a while

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.689 
controller and I've had this for a while
now<00:00:42.320> there's<00:00:43.010> a<00:00:43.100> box<00:00:43.309> down<00:00:43.940> there<00:00:43.970> and<00:00:45.610> I'm<00:00:46.610> not

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
my opinion on it anyway as you can see

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.340 
my opinion on it anyway as you can see
we<00:00:56.239> have<00:00:56.269> to<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.600> stretch<00:00:57.159> decks<00:00:58.159> and<00:00:58.610> i<00:00:59.350> would

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
we have to to stretch decks and i would

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.310 
we have to to stretch decks and i would
say<00:01:00.500> this<00:01:00.650> i<00:01:00.830> see<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:01.729> midi<00:01:02.659> controller<00:01:03.049> is<00:01:03.290> a

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
say this i see this midi controller is a

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.130 
say this i see this midi controller is a
bit<00:01:03.559> bit<00:01:04.280> more<00:01:04.720> for<00:01:05.720> beginning<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:08.020> does<00:01:09.020> the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
bit bit more for beginning and does the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.210 
bit bit more for beginning and does the
same<00:01:09.170> thing<00:01:09.650> but<00:01:09.890> I<00:01:10.430> mean<00:01:11.440> suppose<00:01:12.440> it<00:01:12.799> depends

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
same thing but I mean suppose it depends

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.460 
same thing but I mean suppose it depends
what<00:01:13.460> program<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.390> I'm<00:01:14.900> using<00:01:15.080> virtual

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
what program you and I'm using virtual

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.090 
what program you and I'm using virtual
DJ<00:01:15.799> at<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.250> moment<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:17.380> because<00:01:18.380> I<00:01:18.710> got<00:01:20.710> PC<00:01:21.710> DJ

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
DJ at the moment and because I got PC DJ

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.700 
DJ at the moment and because I got PC DJ
decks<00:01:22.670> with<00:01:23.420> this<00:01:23.690> but<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:24.170> didn't<00:01:24.500> really

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
decks with this but it didn't really

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.539 
decks with this but it didn't really
work<00:01:25.420> which<00:01:26.530> is<00:01:27.530> annoying<00:01:27.799> so<00:01:28.100> i'll<00:01:28.220> be<00:01:28.340> using

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
work which is annoying so i'll be using

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.209 
work which is annoying so i'll be using
virtual<00:01:29.030> DJ<00:01:29.329> and<00:01:29.539> my<00:01:29.869> good<00:01:30.049> use<00:01:30.259> factor<00:01:30.649> but

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
virtual DJ and my good use factor but

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:32.709 
virtual DJ and my good use factor but
that's<00:01:31.399> not<00:01:31.549> opening<00:01:31.880> eva<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:32.420> it's<00:01:32.539> really

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
that's not opening eva so it's really

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.490 
that's not opening eva so it's really
nice<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.549> right<00:01:34.549> anyway<00:01:35.030> as<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:35.270> see<00:01:35.719> where

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500

Cuba and you still have our whipping
guns<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:39.439> can<00:01:39.590> change<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:39.979> whip<00:01:40.159> now<00:01:41.560> you

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
guns and you can change the whip now you

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.950 
guns and you can change the whip now you
can<00:01:42.710> program<00:01:42.950> these<00:01:43.340> films<00:01:43.939> do<00:01:44.149> everyone

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
can program these films do everyone

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.709 
can program these films do everyone
obviously<00:01:45.229> by<00:01:45.859> using<00:01:46.130> any<00:01:46.880> program<00:01:47.270> mapper

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
obviously by using any program mapper

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.090 
obviously by using any program mapper
and

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.340 
and
but<00:01:49.760> I<00:01:49.970> didn't<00:01:50.330> see<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.540> have<00:01:50.689> the<00:01:50.810> scratch<00:01:51.110> on

but I didn't see you have the scratch on
offer<00:01:51.530> in<00:01:52.000> Java<00:01:53.000> Neil<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:53.570> if<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:54.680> have<00:01:55.070> the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
offer in Java Neil and if you have the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.280 
offer in Java Neil and if you have the
pitch<00:01:56.210> deck<00:01:56.479> is<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:57.619> pitch<00:01:58.100> control<00:01:58.549> here<00:01:58.970> and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
pitch deck is a pitch control here and

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.700 
pitch deck is a pitch control here and
there<00:02:00.290> on<00:02:00.409> both<00:02:00.650> sides<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:01.780> it's<00:02:02.780> but<00:02:03.380> what<00:02:03.560> is

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
there on both sides and it's but what is

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.249 
there on both sides and it's but what is
annoying<00:02:04.040> is<00:02:04.450> instead<00:02:05.450> of<00:02:05.600> having<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.930> lot<00:02:06.110> of

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
annoying is instead of having a lot of

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.680 
annoying is instead of having a lot of
different<00:02:06.290> control<00:02:06.860> it's<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.970> same<00:02:08.270> on<00:02:08.479> each

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
different control it's the same on each

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.729 
different control it's the same on each
side<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.289> you<00:02:09.530> have<00:02:10.009> four<00:02:10.310> samples<00:02:10.940> here<00:02:11.739> for

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
side so you have four samples here for

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.470 
side so you have four samples here for
samples<00:02:13.340> i<00:02:13.430> can<00:02:13.580> place<00:02:13.790> these<00:02:14.030> are<00:02:14.209> all<00:02:14.330> my

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
samples i can place these are all my
