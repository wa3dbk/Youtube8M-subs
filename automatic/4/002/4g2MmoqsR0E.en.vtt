like just hit it whenever you're hitting

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.050 
like just hit it whenever you're hitting
one<00:01:44.400> of<00:01:44.430> your<00:01:44.690> B<00:01:45.690> string<00:01:46.050> notes<00:01:46.260> like<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.910> do<00:01:47.910> it

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
one of your B string notes like I do it

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.370 
one of your B string notes like I do it
in<00:01:48.150> between<00:01:48.420> sometimes<00:01:48.660> too<00:01:49.080> like

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.140 

so<00:01:57.380> that's<00:01:57.620> pretty<00:01:57.740> much<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.159> whole<00:01:58.369> intro

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
so that's pretty much the whole intro

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.480 
so that's pretty much the whole intro
and<00:01:59.390> then<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.350> guitar<00:02:00.500> stops<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.250> I<00:02:01.310> think

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
and then the guitar stops and I think

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.789 
and then the guitar stops and I think
just<00:02:01.700> bass<00:02:01.970> is<00:02:02.240> going<00:02:02.270> on<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:03.080> then<00:02:03.590> there's

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
just bass is going on and then there's

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:26.220 
just bass is going on and then there's
this<00:02:03.920> part

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.040 

and<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.320> part's<00:02:27.680> still<00:02:28.010> with<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.220> a-string

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
and that part's still with the a-string

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.940 
and that part's still with the a-string
but<00:02:30.320> it's<00:02:30.470> on<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.740> fifth<00:02:31.010> fret<00:02:31.190> B<00:02:31.580> string<00:02:31.610> now

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.710 
but it's on the fifth fret B string now
third<00:02:33.950> fret<00:02:34.250> B<00:02:34.430> string<00:02:34.459> then<00:02:35.770> open<00:02:36.770> B<00:02:36.950> string
