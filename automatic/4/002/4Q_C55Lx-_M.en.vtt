kind of fell into place but always when
I<00:02:11.520> painted<00:02:12.000> right<00:02:12.810> from<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.080> beginning<00:02:13.230> even

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
I painted right from the beginning even

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.460 
I painted right from the beginning even
though<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:15.209> chops<00:02:15.480> weren't<00:02:15.870> there<00:02:16.050> it's

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
though the the chops weren't there it's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.250 
though the the chops weren't there it's
like<00:02:16.620> playing<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.730> piano<00:02:17.910> every<00:02:18.239> day<00:02:18.480> but<00:02:18.780> you

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
like playing the piano every day but you

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.750 
like playing the piano every day but you
know<00:02:19.290> what<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.770> want<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.100> hear<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.580> don't

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
know what you want to hear but you don't

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.340 
know what you want to hear but you don't
have<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> ability<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.420> do<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.870> it's<00:02:22.110> like

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
have the ability to do it it's like

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.199 
have the ability to do it it's like
playing<00:02:22.620> an<00:02:22.770> instrument<00:02:23.130> was<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.640> same<00:02:23.910> with

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
playing an instrument was the same with

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.979 
playing an instrument was the same with
painting<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.959> would<00:02:25.620> go<00:02:25.739> out<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.840> knew<00:02:27.840> what

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
painting I would go out and I knew what

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.020 
painting I would go out and I knew what
I<00:02:28.020> wanted<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.500> see<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.489> knew<00:02:29.670> what<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:29.850> wanted

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
I wanted to see and I knew what I wanted

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.790 
I wanted to see and I knew what I wanted
it<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.330> be<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.690> was<00:02:30.780> very<00:02:31.050> frustrating<00:02:31.650> but<00:02:31.739> I

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
it to be it was very frustrating but I

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.160 
it to be it was very frustrating but I
couldn't<00:02:32.400> pull<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.610> off<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.239> think<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.959> was

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
couldn't pull it off so I think that was

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.430 
couldn't pull it off so I think that was
the<00:02:34.500> motivation<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:35.880> try<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.870> get<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.410> a

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
the motivation to just try to get to a

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.480 
the motivation to just try to get to a
point<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:39.750> was<00:02:40.100> satisfied<00:02:41.100> with

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.200 

every<00:02:44.150> night<00:02:44.350> there's<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.470> different<00:02:45.770> backdrop

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
every night there's a different backdrop

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.460 
every night there's a different backdrop
every<00:02:47.210> night<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.660> weather<00:02:47.810> patterns<00:02:48.320> are

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
every night the weather patterns are

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.040 
every night the weather patterns are
different<00:02:48.670> I've<00:02:49.670> spent<00:02:50.090> time<00:02:50.270> out<00:02:50.510> west<00:02:50.780> and
