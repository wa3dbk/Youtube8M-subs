this is what works for me I changed my

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.560 
this is what works for me I changed my
UI<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.670> our<00:00:29.760> factor<00:00:30.060> if<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.240> wonder<00:00:30.420> why<00:00:30.510> it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
UI and our factor if you wonder why it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.610 
UI and our factor if you wonder why it
looks<00:00:30.750> awesome<00:00:31.369> but<00:00:32.369> um<00:00:32.690> here<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.719> load<00:00:34.290> my<00:00:34.410> tune

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
looks awesome but um here I load my tune

looks awesome but um here I load my tune
this<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.040> my<00:00:35.250> setup<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.700> try<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.910> use<00:00:36.440> gears<00:00:37.440> that

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
this is my setup I try to use gears that

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.619 
this is my setup I try to use gears that
work<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.070> don't<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.520> specifically<00:00:39.149> on

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
work I don't really go specifically on

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.540 
work I don't really go specifically on
real<00:00:40.200> life<00:00:40.379> or<00:00:40.649> things<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.399> use

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
real life or things like that I just use

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.240 
real life or things like that I just use
what<00:00:41.700> works<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.410> use<00:00:43.590> tires<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
what works and I use tires that have a

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.420 
what works and I use tires that have a
lot<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.489> grip<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.030> will<00:00:45.239> say<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.570> um<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.770> that

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
lot of grip I will say that um and that

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.830 
lot of grip I will say that um and that
I<00:00:47.579> tune<00:00:47.879> really<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.450> wouldn't<00:00:48.719> force

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
I tune really just like I wouldn't force

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.389 
I tune really just like I wouldn't force
it<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.200> higher<00:00:49.379> numbers<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.039> some<00:00:50.190> things

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
it with higher numbers and some things

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.310 
it with higher numbers and some things
like<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.210> front<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.570> always<00:00:51.690> stiffer<00:00:52.199> than

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
like the front is always stiffer than

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.260 
like the front is always stiffer than
the<00:00:52.440> rear<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> anti<00:00:53.160> rolls<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the rear on the anti rolls and in the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.439 
the rear on the anti rolls and in the
rebounded<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> bump<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.760> om4<00:00:56.760> rebound

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
rebounded the bump and om4 rebound

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.270 
rebounded the bump and om4 rebound
whatever<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.350> set<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:58.500> rebound<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.980> half

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
whatever you set your rebound you half

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.770 
whatever you set your rebound you half
of<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.609> for<00:00:59.670> your<00:00:59.910> bump<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.539> say

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
of that for your bump so it's like say

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.020 
of that for your bump so it's like say
your<00:01:01.020> rebounds<00:01:01.320> 14<00:01:01.770> or<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.190> your<00:01:02.309> bump<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.670> 7

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
your rebounds 14 or do your bump at 7

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.450 
your rebounds 14 or do your bump at 7
and<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:03.899> fast<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.379> slow<00:01:04.680> rebound<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and that's for fast and slow rebound and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.600 
and that's for fast and slow rebound and
fast<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.820> slow<00:01:05.970> blow<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.189> use<00:01:08.340> soft

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
fast and slow blow so and I use soft

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.219 
fast and slow blow so and I use soft
Springs<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.200> soft<00:01:10.470> Springs<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:12.229> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
Springs like really soft Springs and the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.920 
Springs like really soft Springs and the
drifting<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.650> taught<00:01:14.060> awful<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.210> will<00:01:15.360> say

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
drifting was taught awful I will say

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.740 
drifting was taught awful I will say
it's<00:01:16.080> awful<00:01:16.439> because<00:01:16.820> I<00:01:17.820> was<00:01:18.119> getting<00:01:18.240> framed

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
I get framerate like crazy when I try

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.609 
I get framerate like crazy when I try
and<00:01:24.720> drift<00:01:25.110> or<00:01:25.350> whatever<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.460> bad

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
and drift or whatever so it's just bad

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
this I turned anti-aliasing off for a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.620 
this I turned anti-aliasing off for a
better<00:01:32.520> warm<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.060> their<00:01:33.740> tracklist<00:01:35.630> Thank

so there's there's some tracks that I
don't<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.770> I'm<00:01:43.890> never<00:01:44.040> drift<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
don't know like I'm never drift it

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.370 
don't know like I'm never drift it
before<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.420> matte<00:01:45.630> plug-in<00:01:45.990> basically

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
before and that matte plug-in basically

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.749 
before and that matte plug-in basically
tell<00:01:46.530> me<00:01:46.619> what<00:01:46.920> corners<00:01:47.280> where<00:01:47.460> how<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
tell me what corners where how the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.880 
tell me what corners where how the
corner<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.240> things<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.500> that's<00:01:49.680> why

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
corner is things like that so that's why

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.530 
corner is things like that so that's why
I<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.310> map<00:01:50.490> plug-in<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.390> turn

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
I have that map plug-in I can I can turn

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.260 
I have that map plug-in I can I can turn
it<00:01:51.659> off<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.110> didn't<00:01:52.680> think<00:01:52.829> about<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.270> -

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
it off but I didn't think about it -

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.289 
it off but I didn't think about it -
sorry<00:01:54.450> if<00:01:54.570> that's<00:01:54.659> annoying<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:56.090> more<00:01:57.090> like

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
tuning fork amber I always go like

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.389 
tuning fork amber I always go like
negative<00:02:00.750> 0.5<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> rear<00:02:01.770> unless<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.310> an

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.670 
underpowered car with an underpowered
car<00:02:04.649> then<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.920> go<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.070> 1<00:02:05.549> or<00:02:05.579> 1.5<00:02:06.590> negative<00:02:07.590> of

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
car then I go like 1 or 1.5 negative of

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.800 
car then I go like 1 or 1.5 negative of
course<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.250> rear<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.610> for<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.270> front<00:02:09.569> and

course on the rear and for the front and

course on the rear and for the front and
mean<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.110> price<00:02:10.289> varies<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.310> depends<00:02:11.580> on

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
mean the price varies it just depends on

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.430 
mean the price varies it just depends on
how<00:02:11.730> much<00:02:11.849> grip<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.750> front<00:02:12.989> end<00:02:13.110> has<00:02:13.200> like

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
how much grip the front end has like

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.680 
how much grip the front end has like
it's<00:02:13.590> running<00:02:13.770> has<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.010> lot<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.220> grip<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
it's running has a lot of grip and I

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.449 
it's running has a lot of grip and I
don't<00:02:15.900> really<00:02:16.080> want<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.260> feel<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.680> then<00:02:17.340> I've

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
don't really want to feel it then I've

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.240 
don't really want to feel it then I've
put<00:02:17.730> more<00:02:18.209> negative<00:02:18.540> camber<00:02:18.720> if<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.250> doesn't

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
put more negative camber if it doesn't

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.710 
put more negative camber if it doesn't
kind<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.180> for<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.420> game<00:02:21.629> if

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
kind of for this game if

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.540 
kind of for this game if
it<00:02:24.140> has<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.680> grip<00:02:24.860> but<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.100> don't<00:02:25.250> feel<00:02:25.490> it

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
it has the grip but you don't feel it

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.730 
it has the grip but you don't feel it
you<00:02:25.820> want<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.060> feel<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.420> more<00:02:26.630> like<00:02:27.410> for<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.680> to

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
you want to feel it more like for it to

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.280 
you want to feel it more like for it to
be<00:02:27.800> responsive<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.430> guess<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:29.510> put<00:02:29.690> less<00:02:29.900> front

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
be responsive I guess you put less front

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.130 
be responsive I guess you put less front
camera<00:02:31.090> but<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.120> wouldn't<00:02:32.420> go<00:02:32.540> below<00:02:32.900> negative

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
camera but I wouldn't go below negative

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.890 
camera but I wouldn't go below negative
to<00:02:33.680> probably<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.330> won't<00:02:35.510> go<00:02:35.630> above

to probably and I won't go above

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.980 
to probably and I won't go above
negative<00:02:36.230> 4<00:02:36.860> point<00:02:37.280> 5<00:02:37.460> negative<00:02:37.910> 5<00:02:38.240> wouldn't

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
negative 4 point 5 negative 5 wouldn't

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.900 
negative 4 point 5 negative 5 wouldn't
go<00:02:39.050> above<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.320> but<00:02:40.280> that's<00:02:40.400> just<00:02:40.460> me

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
go above that but that's just me

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.390 
go above that but that's just me
oh<00:02:41.860> by<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.890> way<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.720> me<00:02:45.190> drifting<00:02:46.190> on<00:02:46.340> a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
oh by the way this is me drifting on a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.380 
oh by the way this is me drifting on a
new<00:02:46.550> firmware<00:02:46.990> after<00:02:47.990> like<00:02:48.170> 30<00:02:48.410> minutes<00:02:48.650> and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
new firmware after like 30 minutes and

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.500 
new firmware after like 30 minutes and
and<00:02:50.390> with<00:02:51.020> like<00:02:51.830> I<00:02:52.130> will<00:02:52.760> turning<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.210> lot<00:02:53.300> more

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
and with like I will turning a lot more

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.100 
and with like I will turning a lot more
than<00:02:53.690> normal

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
than normal

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.040 
than normal
like<00:02:54.740> I<00:02:54.770> will<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.250> always<00:02:56.000> doing<00:02:56.420> at<00:02:56.720> least<00:02:56.930> a

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
like I will is always doing at least a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.990 
like I will is always doing at least a
full<00:02:57.260> rotation<00:02:57.380> now<00:02:57.860> in<00:02:58.160> like<00:02:58.400> almost<00:02:58.700> every

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
full rotation now in like almost every

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.230 
full rotation now in like almost every
car<00:02:59.320> so<00:03:00.320> oh<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:01.400> I'm<00:03:01.460> on<00:03:01.550> new<00:03:01.670> farmer<00:03:01.970> because

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
car so oh and I'm on new farmer because

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.790 
car so oh and I'm on new farmer because
my<00:03:02.450> other<00:03:02.720> firmware<00:03:03.080> didn't<00:03:03.290> him<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.440> will<00:03:03.590> spin

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
my other firmware didn't him I will spin

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.830 
my other firmware didn't him I will spin
fast<00:03:04.070> enough<00:03:04.190> with<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.940> new<00:03:05.240> sensitivity

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
fast enough with the new sensitivity

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.720 
fast enough with the new sensitivity
don't<00:03:06.290> worry<00:03:06.410> about<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.620> anyway<00:03:07.160> drifting

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
don't worry about it anyway drifting

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.340 
don't worry about it anyway drifting
wasn't<00:03:07.970> good<00:03:08.060> that's<00:03:08.480> that's<00:03:08.870> point<00:03:09.110> one<00:03:10.990> so<00:03:11.990> I

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
wasn't good that's that's point one so I

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.750 
wasn't good that's that's point one so I
guess<00:03:12.860> that's<00:03:12.980> that's<00:03:13.190> really<00:03:13.400> what<00:03:13.520> works

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
guess that's that's really what works

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.700 
guess that's that's really what works
for<00:03:13.850> me<00:03:13.990> I<00:03:14.990> try<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:15.800> tune<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.190> cars<00:03:16.370> like<00:03:16.580> I

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
for me I try to tune the cars like I

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.900 
for me I try to tune the cars like I
guess<00:03:18.710> yeah<00:03:18.860> I'm<00:03:18.950> assuming<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:19.550> this<00:03:19.790> guy

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
guess yeah I'm assuming that this guy

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.640 
guess yeah I'm assuming that this guy
knows<00:03:20.090> attitude<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:21.050> he<00:03:21.140> just<00:03:21.320> seemed<00:03:21.530> us

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
knows attitude and he just seemed us

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.480 
knows attitude and he just seemed us
know<00:03:22.250> what<00:03:22.430> works<00:03:22.520> for<00:03:22.670> me<00:03:22.820> um<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:25.070> always

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
know what works for me um so I always

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.520 
know what works for me um so I always
tune<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.940> car<00:03:26.150> for<00:03:26.420> what<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.780> car<00:03:26.930> needs<00:03:27.260> like

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
tune the car for what the car needs like

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.320 
tune the car for what the car needs like
than<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:28.100> front<00:03:28.310> more<00:03:28.550> or<00:03:28.790> doesn't<00:03:29.240> have

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
than the in front more or doesn't have

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.580 
than the in front more or doesn't have
enough<00:03:29.510> front<00:03:29.690> grip<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:29.990> I<00:03:30.020> put<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.500> know

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
enough front grip and I put you know

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.350 
enough front grip and I put you know
tuned<00:03:30.830> for<00:03:31.040> more<00:03:31.130> front<00:03:31.370> River<00:03:31.580> but<00:03:32.240> it's

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
tuned for more front River but it's

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.090 
tuned for more front River but it's
happened<00:03:32.600> a<00:03:32.660> rip<00:03:33.050> in<00:03:33.290> general<00:03:33.620> on<00:03:33.680> tuned<00:03:33.830> for

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
happened a rip in general on tuned for

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.660 
happened a rip in general on tuned for
more<00:03:34.190> grip

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
more grip

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.570 
more grip
I<00:03:34.700> got<00:03:35.120> us<00:03:35.209> do<00:03:35.510> different<00:03:35.780> things<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.580> that's

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
I got us do different things and that's

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.920 
I got us do different things and that's
just<00:03:37.910> me

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
just me

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.380 
just me
I<00:03:39.400> really<00:03:40.400> do<00:03:40.520> I<00:03:40.550> tune<00:03:40.820> just<00:03:40.970> like<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:41.150> wouldn't

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
I really do I tune just like I wouldn't

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.230 
I really do I tune just like I wouldn't
force<00:03:41.540> it<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:42.709> just<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.310> numbers<00:03:43.880> are<00:03:44.000> higher

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
force it it just the numbers are higher

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.940 
force it it just the numbers are higher
that's<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.720> only<00:03:44.930> difference<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:47.770> if<00:03:48.770> you

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
that's the only difference so and if you

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.430 
that's the only difference so and if you
really<00:03:49.340> want<00:03:49.520> to<00:03:49.610> see<00:03:49.790> how<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.030> how<00:03:50.660> a<00:03:50.690> tune<00:03:50.959> and

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
really want to see how I how a tune and

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.130 
really want to see how I how a tune and
what<00:03:51.830> I<00:03:51.860> do<00:03:52.180> then<00:03:53.180> go<00:03:53.330> watch<00:03:53.480> my<00:03:53.600> Forza<00:03:53.930> bids

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
what I do then go watch my Forza bids

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.440 
what I do then go watch my Forza bids
and<00:03:54.440> kind<00:03:54.739> of<00:03:55.030> transfer<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.330> this

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
and kind of transfer that to this

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.760 
and kind of transfer that to this
especially<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.110> design<00:03:57.350> on<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.560> side<00:03:57.739> of

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
especially the design on the side of

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.670 
especially the design on the side of
this<00:03:57.980> give<00:03:58.220> those<00:03:58.400> good<00:03:58.790> bits<00:03:59.300> where<00:03:59.630> I<00:03:59.680> videos

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
this give those good bits where I videos

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.010 
this give those good bits where I videos
vids<00:04:01.070> we<00:04:01.250> call<00:04:01.610> them<00:04:01.730> where<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:01.910> actually<00:04:02.330> tune

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
vids we call them where I actually tune

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.650 
vids we call them where I actually tune
cars<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:03.709> you<00:04:04.340> see<00:04:04.520> what<00:04:04.700> I<00:04:04.730> do<00:04:04.820> as<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.090> base<00:04:05.330> and

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
cars and you see what I do as a base and

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.390 
cars and you see what I do as a base and
then<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:05.810> see<00:04:05.989> what<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.200> do<00:04:06.260> at<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.590> end<00:04:06.709> for

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
then you see what I do at the end for

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.020 
then you see what I do at the end for
what<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.580> car<00:04:07.730> needed<00:04:08.110> so<00:04:09.459> if<00:04:10.459> you<00:04:10.640> want<00:04:10.850> if

what the car needed so if you want if
you<00:04:11.150> want<00:04:11.300> really<00:04:11.390> more<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:12.080> VAE

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
you want really more of a VAE
