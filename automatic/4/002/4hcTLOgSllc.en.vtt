00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.040
 hello greetings friends give saavedra and 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.760
 in this video tutorial I'm going to teach you 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.070
 to create a photomontage of the face like this 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.130
 how to use the image adjustment of 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:19.419
 Match color to get excellent 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.789
 let's see how it was before and 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.730
 how will it be after 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:28.859
 you are in easy photoshop dance with zero 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.859
 and do not go we started 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.450
 ok first I'm going to open my two 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.450
 documents with these two images 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.510
 the selection 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.490
 and dragged them to photoshop 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.140
 these images of the buoy I'm going to 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.140
 leave in the description of the video 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.240
 in case you want to use them for 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.370
 exercise that you can use those that 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.280
 you want 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.280
 ok then this face 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.500
 we are going to pass it 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.500
 to this other photograph 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.930
 and first we are going to take our 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.540
 tool tie 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.990
 make sure that the option to add the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.370
 selection is on and fade 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.370
 we are going to give him a pixel 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.930
 and we had it on the face it does not have 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.930
 to make a perfect selection 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.040
 in this way 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.910
 if you had to select 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.910
 you just happen again 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.940
 the loop 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.320
 to add 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.100
 more actions of the face 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.219
 here I go grabbed a little bit more 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.400
 now let's press control j 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.370
 to make us a duplicate of what 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.370
 that we just selected 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.680
 this selection I take it to the other 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.730
 document dragging 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.730
 and loose 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.260
 thus 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.099
 right away we are going to do the same 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.640
 operation but with the background layer that is 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.640
 where is it 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.020
 the face of the girl we want 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.690
 change 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.690
 if he says he took the lasso tool 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.570
 and I make a selection 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.040
 likewise I press control j 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.349
 and we disable the background layer 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:32.420
 now let's select layer 1 and 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.420
 we 're going to go to image adjustments 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.010
 equal to color 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.660
 here in origin we select 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.410
 the mother and daughter document that is where 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.990
 we are working and in layer 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.170
 we indicate that we want to match the layer 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.170
 two 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.370
 in dominance you can move your the 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.370
 parameters 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.579
 depending on the image that is 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.470
 working to resemble it a little bit 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:13.470
 even more I'm going to leave it like that let's say the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.470
 95% 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.030
 and we give ok 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.150
 I'm going to disable layer 2 and enabled 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.150
 back to the background layer 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.090
 Now I'm going to approach the face 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.090
 pressure or control t 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:40.909
 and pressing the shift key and 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.909
 dragging 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:50.360
 let's match the size that it has 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:55.780
 the background layer here not peace and that 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.780
 you can download a little to guide you 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.530
 as for such a bad position 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.190
 since you 're happy with your result 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.300
 then we give enter to validate and 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.289
 we raise the opacity 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.420
 let's create a layer mask 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:25.300
 we take the brush 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.870
 and we make sure that the black color is 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.870
 in front 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.929
 and we spend here on the face to 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.220
 to judge more 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.520
 in this way 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.690
 we see that it is a little bit bigger like that 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.540
 is that we keep adjusting remember 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.960
 press control to simply the 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.360
 click on some of these squares 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.300
 to get these squares out you have 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.780
 have to be enabled this option 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.470
 show transformation controls this 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.470
 what we see here 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:25.380
 well we see how it has already adapted 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.530
 if you want to create a little more 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:33.500
 adjustments then you go here to this 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.500
 icon and let's selective correction 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.650
 and here you can move your tones even more 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.930
 for example 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.130
 in the red colors I can apply them 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.130
 a little bit more black 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.110
 and in yellow we can also move it 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:05.490
 and we click on this icon so that 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:08.030
 just act on trimming the 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.030
 face 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:16.190
 he lowered the yellows 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.720
 in short, this is going to go according to 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.720
 what are you looking for 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.740
 and to improve a little bit more the photo 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:29.810
 then I create another mask for him 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.810
 adjustment but now of curves 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.570
 and achieve it down to 

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:45.380
 have a little more shadow 

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.380
 in this way 

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.620
 and we see how it was before 

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:57.340
 and how is it after 

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:59.770
 it 's really easy, well, I'm
