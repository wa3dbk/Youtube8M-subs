I<00:01:32.950> got<00:01:33.130> this<00:01:33.249> thing<00:01:33.490> suspend<00:01:33.969> on<00:01:36.390> no<00:01:38.939> that's

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
I got this thing suspend on no that's

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.779 
I got this thing suspend on no that's
for<00:01:40.299> this<00:01:40.420> little<00:01:40.630> magnet<00:01:41.079> here<00:01:41.200> seated<00:01:42.159> ports

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.130 

light<00:01:45.789> stays<00:01:46.119> on<00:01:46.469> about<00:01:47.469> 28<00:01:48.420> 29<00:01:49.420> goals<00:01:49.780> some

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
light stays on about 28 29 goals some

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.949 
light stays on about 28 29 goals some
around<00:01:50.439> there<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:52.060> in<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.329> circuit<00:01:52.810> right

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
around there it's in the circuit right

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.740 
around there it's in the circuit right
now<00:01:53.140> but<00:01:53.590> light<00:01:53.770> takes<00:01:54.549> 90<00:01:54.789> to<00:01:55.030> kick<00:01:55.179> it<00:01:55.299> on<00:01:55.420> to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
now but light takes 90 to kick it on to

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.199 
now but light takes 90 to kick it on to
that<00:01:55.929> again<00:01:56.200> watch<00:01:56.849> 27<00:01:57.849> volts<00:01:58.500> dropping

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
that again watch 27 volts dropping

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.359 
that again watch 27 volts dropping
magnet<00:02:01.209> still<00:02:01.450> spins<00:02:01.719> so<00:02:01.959> that's<00:02:02.170> why<00:02:02.409> you<00:02:03.159> get

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
magnet still spins so that's why you get

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.669 
magnet still spins so that's why you get
it<00:02:03.489> and<00:02:03.659> get<00:02:04.659> it<00:02:04.689> towards<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.200> center<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.560> this

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
it and get it towards the center of this

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.059 
it and get it towards the center of this
thing<00:02:06.929> it'll<00:02:07.929> build<00:02:08.110> up<00:02:08.259> with<00:02:08.440> my<00:02:08.560> 90<00:02:08.920> volts

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
thing it'll build up with my 90 volts

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.009 
thing it'll build up with my 90 volts
and<00:02:09.399> then<00:02:09.640> watch<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.390> they<00:02:10.569> don't<00:02:10.750> talk<00:02:10.869> to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
and then watch that they don't talk to

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.690 
and then watch that they don't talk to
about<00:02:11.079> 90<00:02:11.620> course<00:02:11.829> that's<00:02:12.040> when<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.280> kicks<00:02:12.489> on

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
about 90 course that's when it kicks on

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.880 
about 90 course that's when it kicks on
boy<00:02:13.000> pics<00:02:13.299> on<00:02:16.200> there<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.349> is<00:02:17.640> white<00:02:18.640> kicks<00:02:18.910> on

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
boy pics on there it is white kicks on

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.199 
boy pics on there it is white kicks on
ok<00:02:20.890> I'm<00:02:21.099> going<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.310> take<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:21.549> little<00:02:21.760> guy<00:02:22.000> way

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
ok I'm going to take this little guy way

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:31.610 
ok I'm going to take this little guy way
let<00:02:23.049> me<00:02:23.140> try<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.319> bigger<00:02:23.560> one<00:02:27.690> ok<00:02:29.280> here<00:02:30.280> we<00:02:30.670> go

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
let me try a bigger one ok here we go

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:40.790 
let me try a bigger one ok here we go
this<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.769> one<00:02:32.950> inch<00:02:33.099> by<00:02:33.280> one<00:02:33.310> inch<00:02:33.489> same<00:02:33.880> thing

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.700 

60<00:02:41.550> 50<00:02:41.790> 60<00:02:42.860> 70<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.010> going<00:02:44.220> up<00:02:44.400> going<00:02:44.700> over

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
60 50 60 70 it's going up going over

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.190 
60 50 60 70 it's going up going over
there<00:02:47.030> about<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.240> same<00:02:48.270> thing<00:02:48.660> same<00:02:48.960> voltage

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
there about the same thing same voltage

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.880 
there about the same thing same voltage
rating<00:02:53.570> now<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.630> see<00:02:54.900> with<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.740> could

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
rating now you see with this I could

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.530 
rating now you see with this I could
take<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.250> up<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.520> little<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.940> watch<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.390> light

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
take it up a little and watch that light

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.260 
take it up a little and watch that light
a<00:02:57.570> good<00:02:57.870> break<00:02:58.110> look<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.890> comes<00:02:59.010> up<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.460> a

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
a good break look it comes up to a

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.020 
a good break look it comes up to a
certain<00:03:00.480> point<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.250> it's<00:03:02.250> been<00:03:02.670> magnetized

able<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.209> measure<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.630> frequency<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:15.040> you

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
able to measure the frequency so you

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.000 
able to measure the frequency so you
take<00:04:15.340> frequency<00:04:15.850> times<00:04:16.060> 60<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:17.739> gives<00:04:17.919> you

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
take frequency times 60 and it gives you

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.220 
take frequency times 60 and it gives you
