that non pro cameras digital is allowed

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.380 
that non pro cameras digital is allowed
which<00:01:54.010> would<00:01:54.160> be<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.310> cellphone<00:01:54.880> smartphone

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
which would be a cellphone smartphone

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.600

hat they have digital camera smartphones

hat they have digital camera smartphones
so<00:01:58.300> obviously<00:01:58.690> that<00:01:58.840> should<00:01:59.170> be<00:01:59.260> allowed<00:01:59.440> but
