00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.380 
so I'm not on mind they're not all going
to<00:02:20.950> be<00:02:21.070> someone<00:02:21.400> over<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.820> next<00:02:22.030> one<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.180> might

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
to be someone over the next one I might

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.260 
to be someone over the next one I might
do<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:23.530> know<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:23.950> like<00:02:24.130> one<00:02:24.400> of<00:02:24.430> these<00:02:24.640> locks

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.380 

with<00:02:28.270> an<00:02:28.390> inverted<00:02:28.720> one<00:02:29.670> or<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.850> pinwheels

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
with an inverted one or the pinwheels

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.880 
with an inverted one or the pinwheels
which<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:32.160> more<00:02:33.160> like<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:33.550> inside<00:02:33.970> block<00:02:34.890> and

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
which is more like this inside block and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.150 
which is more like this inside block and
make<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.340> my<00:02:36.580> inside<00:02:37.180> block<00:02:37.770> like<00:02:38.770> this<00:02:38.950> one

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
make that my inside block like this one

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.630 
make that my inside block like this one
here<00:02:39.400> only<00:02:39.640> doing<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.090> bigger<00:02:41.220> job<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.460> more

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
here only doing a bigger job it's more

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.130 
here only doing a bigger job it's more
ideas<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:44.010> we'll<00:02:45.010> see<00:02:45.130> where<00:02:45.280> they<00:02:45.400> go<00:02:46.140> well

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
ideas and we'll see where they go well

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.260 
ideas and we'll see where they go well
so<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:47.710> another<00:02:47.950> video<00:02:48.220> yet<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.850> figured<00:02:49.180> I

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
so I have another video yet I figured I

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.480 
so I have another video yet I figured I
would<00:02:49.450> just<00:02:49.480> take<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.320> short<00:02:50.620> clip<00:02:50.800> of<00:02:50.980> one<00:02:51.280> more

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
would just take a short clip of one more

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.300 
would just take a short clip of one more
step<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.000> just<00:02:52.210> made<00:02:52.390> today<00:02:53.010> decide<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.190> do

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
step that I just made today decide to do

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.710 
step that I just made today decide to do
one<00:02:54.520> more<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.850> use<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.090> decorative<00:02:58.570> stitch

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
one more and and use a decorative stitch

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.520 
one more and and use a decorative stitch
