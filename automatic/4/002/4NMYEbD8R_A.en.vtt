00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
window so you can see the lines it's got

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.770

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.360 
build quality inside not sure exactly
the<00:00:39.899> design<00:00:40.050> inside<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.800> think<00:00:41.010> maybe<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the design inside but I think maybe the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.400 
the design inside but I think maybe the
whole<00:00:41.520> top<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.450> antenna<00:00:42.780> or<00:00:43.079> something

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
whole top is the antenna or something

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.959 
whole top is the antenna or something
like<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.559> because<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.309> gotten<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.610> 2-piece

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
like that because it's gotten a 2-piece

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.090 
like that because it's gotten a 2-piece
sort<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.300> design<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:46.020> see<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.379> it's

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
sort of design as you can see but it's

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.740 
sort of design as you can see but it's
sort<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.250> an<00:00:47.370> aluminum<00:00:47.610> plastic<00:00:48.300> design<00:00:48.450> it's

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
sort of an aluminum plastic design it's

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.040 
sort of an aluminum plastic design it's
quite<00:00:49.410> heavy<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.480> you<00:00:51.480> know<00:00:51.570> very<00:00:51.750> sturdy

quite heavy and you know very sturdy

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.069

one of the things that I really like

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.729 
one of the things that I really like
about<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.670> though<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.140> when<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.350> security

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
about it though is when you get security

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
about it though is when you get security
updates<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.309> firmware<00:00:59.520> updates<00:00:59.969> Apple

can probably find ones more expensive

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.500 
can probably find ones more expensive
but<00:03:33.310> in<00:03:33.459> general<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:33.820> do<00:03:33.880> think<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:34.239> is<00:03:34.390> the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510
