00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.690
 girls hello everyone today i'm filming 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.289
 the third part of the destroyers of myths contact 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.029
 and I found such an interesting recipe for 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.550
 whitening nail strengthening 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.029
 I know that the topic of nails is enough 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.840
 popular now so let's get started 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.369
 so we need a teaspoon 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.969
 grated potatoes here here it here 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.180
 I already have I rubbed on the middle grater 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.680
 and then all the ingredients for a teaspoon 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.430
 further teaspoon 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.530
 ordinary toothpaste in principle we 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:51.270
 probably naked eye and so about 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:01:07.770
 that is, it is somewhere upstairs further tea 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:10.470
 soda spoon me a little bit overslept well 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.799
 okay it's all wiped out like this 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.159
 now while we are all going 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.930
 mix 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.930
 to immediately have us 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:29.610
 and add a teaspoon of peroxide 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.790
 hydrogen honestly before that never 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.210
 did this one here let's add 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.690
 2 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.370
 so that a little more was never before 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.640
 This did not make this recipe right here 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:47.010
 decided that today we need all this 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.830
 shuffle and we got here 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:54.840
 such a substance that smells 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:02:01.620
 mint so on we put it all on 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:03.900
 nails and leave for 10-15 minutes now 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.940
 I will then do it and not show us better 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:15.240
 in the photo not to sleep not 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:16.950
 get dirty camera and so as for 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.620
 result i by the way all this 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.780
 removed all this mixture with the usual 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.270
 toothbrush so here rubbed 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.390
 what can I say the skin certainly dried 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:32.490
 due to peroxide and soda in principle they 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.540
 Well, a little bit more tightly 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.459
 and by the way got whites that is all 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.150
 Equally they are not perfectly white but 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.459
 at least you see here I have 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.980
 I will insert a little later a photo before and after 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.140
 after this video and you will see that everything 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.530
 still some lived glasses nails they 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.100
 became less noticeable I think that this 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.270
 well let's say nail mask 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.120
 has the truth to be and this myth is confirmed 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.220
 so wait for the photos before and after 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.110
 and I say goodbye to you thanks for the fact that 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.890
 stayed with me until the end of everything. Today 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.890
 bye Bye 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.540
 viper 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.490
 but
