 alone before introducing the sugar for 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.300

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.570
 Foam well to close properly because the texture 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.570

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.299
 I add this flour by sums in 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.890
 Small amounts sieving I prefer 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:08.479
 to not place the resulting mixture and 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.479

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.890
