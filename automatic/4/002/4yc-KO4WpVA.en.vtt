00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
was success here it was six in the jab

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.600

department<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.420> know<00:03:45.750> Oscars<00:03:46.430> arms<00:03:47.430> are

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
department and you know Oscars arms are

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.890 
department and you know Oscars arms are
almost<00:03:47.910> as<00:03:48.120> long<00:03:48.239> as<00:03:48.420> mines<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.940> know<00:03:51.090> he

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
almost as long as mines so you know he

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.509 
almost as long as mines so you know he
did<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.140> very<00:03:52.350> good<00:03:52.680> job<00:03:52.799> B<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.010> think<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.430> he

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
did it very good job B I think that he

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.009 
did it very good job B I think that he
just<00:03:53.549> stopped<00:03:53.850> on<00:03:54.030> his<00:03:54.060> jab<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.450> he<00:03:54.750> couldn't

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
just stopped on his jab and he couldn't

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.960 
just stopped on his jab and he couldn't

probably can throw it anymore I was this

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.539
