which<00:01:20.910> I<00:01:21.090> will<00:01:21.450> also<00:01:21.690> link<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.440> the

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
which I will also link in the

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.400 
which I will also link in the
description<00:01:23.160> is<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.540> exhalation<00:01:25.110> of

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
description is that the exhalation of

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.990 
description is that the exhalation of
this<00:01:25.620> thing<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.640> higher<00:01:26.910> than<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.450> ccxr<00:01:29.000> yeah

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
this thing is higher than the ccxr yeah

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.380 
this thing is higher than the ccxr yeah
it's<00:01:30.810> fine<00:01:31.610> especially<00:01:32.610> at<00:01:32.760> the<00:01:32.850> high<00:01:33.060> speed

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
it's fine especially at the high speed

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.679 
it's fine especially at the high speed
it<00:01:33.810> is

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:45.050 

so<00:01:37.759> nothing<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:39.859> go<00:01:40.859> very<00:01:41.819> very<00:01:42.179> very<00:01:43.670> fast<00:01:44.670> in

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
so nothing can go very very very fast in

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.889 
so nothing can go very very very fast in
a<00:01:45.240> very<00:01:45.600> short<00:01:46.259> amount<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.950> time<00:01:47.630> it<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:49.700> kill

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
a very short amount of time it can kill

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.020 
a very short amount of time it can kill
anyone<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.709> can<00:01:52.920> go<00:01:53.130> into<00:01:53.429> high<00:01:53.609> speeds

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
anyone and it can go into high speeds

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.270 
anyone and it can go into high speeds
like<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.709> truck<00:01:56.039> the<00:01:56.700> main<00:01:56.909> street<00:01:58.280> it's

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280

straight ahead and this is what you get
respect<00:02:07.289> from<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.619> shop<00:02:09.319> it's<00:02:10.319> damn<00:02:10.920> fast

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
respect from the shop it's damn fast

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.270

I<00:02:13.010> mean<00:02:14.010> seriously<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:16.709> handling<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:18.329> is<00:02:18.510> there

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
I mean seriously so handling it is there

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.220 
I mean seriously so handling it is there
definitely<00:02:20.280> because<00:02:20.730> tires<00:02:21.329> it's<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
definitely because tires it's in the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.559 
definitely because tires it's in the
corners<00:02:22.680> then<00:02:22.920> when<00:02:23.160> compared<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.849> ccxr

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
corners then when compared to the ccxr

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.770 
corners then when compared to the ccxr
but<00:02:25.500> house<00:02:25.980> view<00:02:26.640> well<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.140> kurupi

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
but house view well it is kurupi

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.259 
but house view well it is kurupi
sometimes<00:02:30.780> can<00:02:31.379> be<00:02:31.560> sleeping<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.790> depends<00:02:33.150> on

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
sometimes can be sleeping it depends on

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.619 
sometimes can be sleeping it depends on
the<00:02:33.420> parts<00:02:33.750> half<00:02:34.019> on<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.879> but<00:02:35.879> the<00:02:36.060> main<00:02:36.239> thing

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
the parts half on it but the main thing

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.430 
the parts half on it but the main thing
is<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:37.620> stable

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.150 

but<00:02:41.070> if<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.580> will<00:02:41.910> make<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.900> lose<00:02:43.170> traction<00:02:43.680> on

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
but if you will make it lose traction on

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.990 
but if you will make it lose traction on
the<00:02:44.310> three<00:02:44.580> wheels<00:02:44.820> it<00:02:45.150> will<00:02:45.330> go<00:02:45.780> into<00:02:45.960> script

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
the three wheels it will go into script

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.590 
the three wheels it will go into script
that's<00:02:48.000> quite<00:02:48.540> an<00:02:48.720> easy<00:02:48.990> trip<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.740> manage<00:02:50.600> the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
that's quite an easy trip to manage the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.620 
that's quite an easy trip to manage the
main<00:02:52.530> thing<00:02:52.860> about<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.250> car<00:02:53.460> is<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.700> not<00:02:54.000> let

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
main thing about this car is to not let

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.250 
main thing about this car is to not let
the<00:02:54.690> traction<00:02:55.410> go<00:02:56.240> if<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.450> will<00:02:57.750> lose<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
the traction go if you will lose the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.190 
the traction go if you will lose the
traction<00:02:58.770> this<00:02:59.010> car<00:02:59.340> will<00:02:59.520> go<00:02:59.700> slow<00:03:00.060> but<00:03:00.960> if

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
traction this car will go slow but if

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.330 
traction this car will go slow but if
you<00:03:01.320> will<00:03:01.500> keep<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.010> traction<00:03:03.350> then<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:04.650> will

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
you will keep the traction then it will

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.780 
you will keep the traction then it will
be<00:03:06.090> able<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.660> compete<00:03:07.020> with<00:03:07.080> everything<00:03:07.920> and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
be able to compete with everything and

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.110 
be able to compete with everything and
it<00:03:09.300> can<00:03:09.690> be<00:03:09.930> everything<00:03:10.680> especially<00:03:11.370> on<00:03:11.910> high

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
it can be everything especially on high

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.080 
it can be everything especially on high
speed<00:03:12.450> tracks<00:03:13.190> it's<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.490> serial<00:03:15.090> killer<00:03:15.660> I

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
speed tracks it's a serial killer I

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.210 
speed tracks it's a serial killer I
already<00:03:18.090> said<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.630> my<00:03:18.810> ccxr<00:03:19.380> review<00:03:19.740> that<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
already said in my ccxr review that the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.910 
already said in my ccxr review that the
ccxr<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:21.120> powered<00:03:21.930> asunder<00:03:22.850> but<00:03:23.990> this<00:03:24.990> is<00:03:25.320> very

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
ccxr is powered asunder but this is very

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.990 
ccxr is powered asunder but this is very
that's<00:03:26.640> one<00:03:27.210> thing<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.660> say<00:03:28.040> so<00:03:29.040> does<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:29.580> mean

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
that's one thing to say so does it mean

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.100 
that's one thing to say so does it mean
it's<00:03:30.360> better<00:03:31.080> than<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.500> Zonda<00:03:31.890> well<00:03:32.840> yes<00:03:33.840> and

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
it's better than the Zonda well yes and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.550 
it's better than the Zonda well yes and
no<00:03:34.520> it's<00:03:35.520> a<00:03:35.760> lot<00:03:36.060> better<00:03:36.840> when<00:03:37.050> it<00:03:37.200> comes<00:03:37.440> to

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
no it's a lot better when it comes to

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.700 
no it's a lot better when it comes to
high<00:03:37.740> speed<00:03:38.040> tracks<00:03:38.660> it's<00:03:39.660> still<00:03:40.110> not<00:03:40.440> fair

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
high speed tracks it's still not fair

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.250 
high speed tracks it's still not fair
when<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:40.980> comes<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.490> low<00:03:41.760> speed<00:03:41.820> tracks<00:03:42.420> it's

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
when it comes to low speed tracks it's

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.650 
when it comes to low speed tracks it's
just

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
just

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.130 
just
just<00:03:45.350> becomes<00:03:45.770> more<00:03:46.250> competitive<00:03:47.140> sooner

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
just becomes more competitive sooner

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.100 
just becomes more competitive sooner
than<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:48.890> CCX<00:03:49.310> part<00:03:49.610> it's<00:03:50.330> a<00:03:50.510> lot<00:03:50.750> more

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
than the CCX part it's a lot more

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.080 
than the CCX part it's a lot more
competitive<00:03:51.920> minutes<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.550> high<00:03:52.730> speed

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
competitive minutes and high speed

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.990 
competitive minutes and high speed
tracks<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:54.020> even<00:03:54.230> on<00:03:54.500> drugs<00:03:54.830> without<00:03:55.580> any

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
tracks and even on drugs without any

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.440 
tracks and even on drugs without any
kind<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.660> skill<00:03:57.170> most<00:03:57.350> drugs<00:03:57.950> it's<00:03:58.450> monster

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
kind of skill most drugs it's monster

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.680 
kind of skill most drugs it's monster
and<00:04:00.430> now<00:04:01.540> what<00:04:02.540> you<00:04:02.900> probably<00:04:03.350> all<00:04:03.680> community

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
and now what you probably all community

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.030 
and now what you probably all community
then<00:04:05.690> comprise<00:04:06.850> between<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:08.000> Agora<00:04:08.450> and<00:04:09.040> ccxr

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
then comprise between the Agora and ccxr

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.650 
then comprise between the Agora and ccxr
while<00:04:10.940> performance<00:04:11.780> is<00:04:12.100> disabled<00:04:13.120> I'm<00:04:14.120> out

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
while performance is disabled I'm out

00:04:14.660 --> 00:06:01.960 
while performance is disabled I'm out
enjoy

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.290 

so<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.660> Agora<00:06:04.020> is<00:06:04.290> one<00:06:04.860> second<00:06:05.610> faster<00:06:05.850> on

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
so the Agora is one second faster on

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.320 
so the Agora is one second faster on
park<00:06:06.990> boundary<00:06:07.620> then<00:06:08.400> the<00:06:08.790> ccxr<00:06:09.950> that<00:06:10.950> is

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
park boundary then the ccxr that is

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.270 
park boundary then the ccxr that is
quite<00:06:12.330> a<00:06:12.540> lot<00:06:12.930> I<00:06:14.120> know<00:06:15.139> from<00:06:16.139> some<00:06:16.680> people<00:06:17.010> that

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
quite a lot I know from some people that

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.350 
quite a lot I know from some people that
the<00:06:17.490> Tran<00:06:17.820> stick<00:06:19.220> setting<00:06:20.220> on<00:06:20.460> the<00:06:20.910> Agora

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
the Tran stick setting on the Agora

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.140 
the Tran stick setting on the Agora
works<00:06:21.930> wonders<00:06:22.680> it's<00:06:22.950> like<00:06:23.190> on<00:06:23.370> Rails<00:06:23.880> then

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
works wonders it's like on Rails then

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.310 
works wonders it's like on Rails then
and<00:06:24.360> it's<00:06:25.020> got<00:06:25.650> a<00:06:25.889> lot<00:06:26.370> of<00:06:26.669> power<00:06:27.419> well<00:06:28.050> I

and it's got a lot of power well I

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.210 
and it's got a lot of power well I
personally<00:06:29.330> can't<00:06:30.330> put<00:06:30.660> that<00:06:31.320> setting<00:06:31.950> since

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
personally can't put that setting since

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.390 
personally can't put that setting since
I<00:06:32.460> don't<00:06:32.669> have<00:06:32.910> it<00:06:33.110> so<00:06:34.110> I'm<00:06:34.260> putting<00:06:34.650> the<00:06:35.190> best

amazing performance
and<00:06:55.180> they<00:06:55.750> think<00:06:55.810> to<00:06:57.030> just<00:06:58.030> be<00:06:58.150> able<00:06:58.240> to<00:06:58.390> take

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
and they think to just be able to take

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.230 
and they think to just be able to take
down<00:06:58.890> everyone<00:06:59.970> pussies

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
down everyone pussies

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.920 
down everyone pussies
of<00:07:02.170> course<00:07:02.500> as<00:07:02.740> one<00:07:03.100> being<00:07:03.460> the<00:07:03.670> only<00:07:04.030> problem

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
of course as one being the only problem

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.890 
of course as one being the only problem
out<00:07:05.170> but<00:07:05.920> still<00:07:06.250> it<00:07:06.850> will<00:07:07.060> be<00:07:07.120> easier<00:07:07.660> than

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
out but still it will be easier than

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.730 
out but still it will be easier than
with<00:07:08.050> anything<00:07:08.590> else<00:07:09.720> so<00:07:10.720> if<00:07:11.110> you<00:07:11.230> have<00:07:11.410> any
