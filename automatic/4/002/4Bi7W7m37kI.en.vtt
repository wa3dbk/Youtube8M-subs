00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.280 
once we're going to put the oil in the
car<00:02:25.950> here<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.940> lot<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.750> these<00:02:27.840> 3.0<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.650> we'll<00:02:29.220> say

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
car here a lot of these 3.0 so we'll say

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.200 
car here a lot of these 3.0 so we'll say
4.5<00:02:31.290> quarts<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.250> book<00:02:32.490> however<00:02:32.820> you'll

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
4.5 quarts in the book however you'll

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.950 
4.5 quarts in the book however you'll
notice<00:02:33.600> they<00:02:34.560> take<00:02:34.770> 5<00:02:35.070> quarts<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:36.540> get<00:02:36.720> them<00:02:36.840> up

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
notice they take 5 quarts to get them up

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.630 
notice they take 5 quarts to get them up
to<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> proper<00:02:37.650> mark<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.490> dipstick<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:40.640> if

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
to the proper mark on the dipstick so if

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.700 
to the proper mark on the dipstick so if
I<00:02:41.850> had<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.000> pick<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.420> would<00:02:42.600> say<00:02:42.750> go<00:02:42.930> five<00:02:43.230> quarts

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
I had to pick I would say go five quarts

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:51.410 
I had to pick I would say go five quarts
on<00:02:44.280> these<00:02:44.520> engines<00:02:50.060> all<00:02:51.060> right<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.300> we're

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
on these engines all right so we're

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.720 
on these engines all right so we're
gonna<00:02:51.510> check<00:02:51.780> start<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.230> watch<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.130> oil<00:02:53.400> can

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
gonna check start it watch that oil can

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.150 
gonna check start it watch that oil can
go<00:02:54.270> off<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.960> means<00:02:55.530> we've<00:02:55.680> built<00:02:55.920> pressure

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
go off that means we've built pressure

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.600 
go off that means we've built pressure
up<00:02:56.750> so<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:57.900> case<00:02:58.110> we're<00:02:58.350> good<00:02:58.610> we're

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
up so in this case we're good we're

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.180 
up so in this case we're good we're
going<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.790> go<00:02:59.850> back<00:03:00.060> out<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:00.630> check<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.710> oil

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
going to go back out and check the oil

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.270 
going to go back out and check the oil
level<00:03:03.230> verify<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.440> we're<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:04.800> below<00:03:05.130> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
level verify that we're just below the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.560 
level verify that we're just below the
full<00:03:05.460> mark<00:03:07.610> we're<00:03:08.610> looking<00:03:08.880> for<00:03:09.090> halfway<00:03:09.300> up

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
full mark we're looking for halfway up

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.950 
full mark we're looking for halfway up
the<00:03:09.720> stick<00:03:10.020> but<00:03:10.890> as<00:03:11.130> long<00:03:11.340> as<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:11.610> not<00:03:11.960> way

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
the stick but as long as it's not way

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.449 
the stick but as long as it's not way
over<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.320> full<00:03:13.530> mark<00:03:13.770> which<00:03:13.980> in<00:03:14.100> this<00:03:14.250> case

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
over the full mark which in this case

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.030 
over the full mark which in this case
it's<00:03:14.760> not<00:03:14.970> even<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.510> full<00:03:15.720> mark<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.770> I'm

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
it's not even to the full mark so I'm

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.030 
it's not even to the full mark so I'm
happy<00:03:17.250> with<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:20.480> all<00:03:21.480> right<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.050> that<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.560> it

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
happy with that all right and that is it

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.650 
happy with that all right and that is it
that's<00:03:23.610> how<00:03:23.730> we<00:03:23.850> do<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> oil<00:03:24.120> change<00:03:24.450> on<00:03:24.630> a

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
that's how we do the oil change on a

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.920 
that's how we do the oil change on a
Taurus<00:03:25.050> or<00:03:25.230> sable
