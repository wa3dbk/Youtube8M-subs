00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.589
 my friends 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.140
 and my friends 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.470
 I want to talk to you this evening 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.680
 on the global economic crisis 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.689
 is a crisis very different from the previous ones 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.870
 did not come from an emerging country 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.500
 or periphery of the system 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.800
 on the contrary was born exploded in the heart of the developed world 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.249
 more precisely 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.789
 the united states and europe 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.060
 this crisis that affects everyone 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.670
 was caused by the lack of control of the financial system in the most 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.599
 rich 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.280
 instead of fulfilling its role in the economy ' 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.330
 financing the productive sector 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.880
 the banks have turned into a big casino 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.210
 the game went away 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.190
 but one day 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.420
 the bill arrived 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.690
 banks broke 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.519
 the large number of companies encountered difficulties 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.290
 and millions of workers 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.870
 lost their homes 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.210
 with their jobs 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.560
 Here in Brazil 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.820
 we did not have this type of crisis 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.820
 our banking system was healthy 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.159
 our organized and armed economy has been growing at the most robust rates 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:04.730
 in the last 30 years 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.870
 therefore the crisis known with our best moment 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.750
 it is a pity 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.730
 but we are very well 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.230
 the situation is less complicated 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.690
 everyone agrees 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.970
 that we are one of the countries most prepared to face this challenge 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.070
 in previous crises 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.500
 In a few days 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.730
 Brazil broke 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.110
 and was forced to seek help from the IMF 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.670
 this time brazil did not break or break 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.710
 is facing the situation with his head held high 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.080
 while most of the rich countries are in recession 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.410
 Brazil will continue to grow 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.429
 it is true 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.330
 that convert favor 'we could go further 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.370
 but even with the wind against 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.340
 we can 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.100
 and we will continue to progress 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.950
 if today we are in a better position to face any crisis 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.130
 it's because we knew how to make the right choices 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.720
 it is because we accelerate the growth of the economy in consistent steps 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.869
 and we grew distributing income 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.920
 and reducing inequalities 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.460
 between regions 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.670
 first of all 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.869
 we kept inflation under control 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.119
 when I assumed the government inflation was above 9% 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.019
 was declining double in the year 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.209
 in 2008 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.729
 even with the explosion of international prices it will remain 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.109
 within the goal 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.100
 also reducing public debt 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.220
 in 2003 it represented 52% of GDP 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.520
 was falling and this year should be 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.229
 in 36% 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:34.339
 Besides that 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.999
 we diversify our exports 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:38.909
 I traveled all over the world 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.049
 with a true peddler of our products 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:42.889
 some 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.089
 those who stayed 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:45.109
 but today 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.209
 when the United States and Europe are the eye of the hurricane 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.060
 we see how the decision to diversify 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.599
 our business relations 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.889
 my friends 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.439
 and my friends 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.230
 another advantage is our large reserves in international currency 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:03.570
 when we assume 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.670
 the brazil owed a lot the fmi is the paris club 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.919
 we should not only accept 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.700
 at that time our foreign currency reserves 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.669
 were very low 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.649
 reached 207 billion dollars 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:18.569
 thereby 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.759
 we are no longer debtors to be international creditors 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.099
 a difference and so much 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.190
 we have a security mattress 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.639
 to protect us 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.860
 but our biggest defense today 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.859
 is the strength of the internal market 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.499
 he made extraordinary progress 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:36.739
 in the last years 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:37.649
 for this 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:40.159
 were decisive of the family grant 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.159
 the improvement of the minimum wage and the employment situation 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.509
 from 2003 to here 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.489
 the minimum wage grew in real terms fifty-one percent 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.109
 and employment also grew strongly 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.250
 in 2007 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.660
 we hit the record 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.670
 a million 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.119
 812 thousand new jobs with a formal contract 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:00.290
 in 2008 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.660
 new record until October 2 million 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.800
 148 thousand jobs 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.909
 result 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.000
 the unemployment rate fell 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.349
 of all point 3 in 2003 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:12.870
 to seven points 6 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.669
 in October of 2008 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.250
 our economic and social development 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.180
 6 because in recent years 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.670
 with more than 20 million people 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.259
 enters the middle class 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.080
 made the economy wheel spin stronger 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.719
 and April the world the virtuous circle in our country 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.180
 we change face and face 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.559
 my friends 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:35.969
 and my friends 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:37.420
 these advances 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.460
 are allowing Brazil and facing the current moment with firmness and serenity 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.870
 we have been acting on all fronts since the crisis began 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:50.719
 we have already adopted measures to normalize credit 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:55.639
 to support our exporting companies and to maintain activity in the sectors 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.689
 which generate more jobs 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.809
 such as small and medium-sized enterprises 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:01.040
 agriculture 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.339
 public construction and pardon 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.669
 reinforce the firepower of state-owned banks 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.159
 and lowered taxes 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.029
 so that businesses and consumers can rather have a little more money 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:15.069
 in box and pocket 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.229
 at the same time 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:17.800
 the government will keep 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.080
 all the investments foreseen in the pac and the social programs 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.539
 in no case 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.589
 there will be a cut in government investments 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:28.909
 why decisive elections 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:32.759
 to Brazil to face the crisis and get out of it but reinforce 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:35.059
 my friends 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:36.599
 and my friends 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.349
 I mean with all the serenity 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.770
 that the crisis does not scare us 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.610
 the country is prepared and has command 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.610
 we are following with a magnifying glass economy situation 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.960
 24 hours a day 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.430
 whatever has to be done will be done 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.050
 at the right time and at the right dose 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.669
 and always talking to the country 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.280
 but it is fundamental 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.629
 everyone to do their part 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:05.589
 it is important that businesspeople get dressed 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:09.629
 it is imperative that workers advocate production and employment 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.720
 already the financial sector 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.180
 should work to stimulate credit 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.749
 and lowering interest rates that are very high 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:17.770
 is that you 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.439
 my friend is my friend 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.439
 do not be afraid to consume with responsibility 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.859
 if you are in debt look for penalties to balance your budget 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:29.719
 but if you have a buck in your pocket 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:35.339
 or received the 13th is wanting to buy a refrigerator a stove another each car 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:38.509
 You were not your dream, afraid of the future. 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:40.289
 because if you do not buy 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:41.759
 the commercial comes 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.200
 if the store does not sell 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.369
 will not make new orders to the factory 

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:47.719
 and then the factory will produce less 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:49.010
 and in the medium term 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.649
 your job may be at risk 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:52.470
 like this 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.990
 when you are family bought yesterday you are not only realizing a dream 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:01.889
 are also helping to keep the economy spinning around 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:02.740
 it is 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.379
 It's good for everyone. 

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:05.680
 my friends 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.960
 and my friends 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.889
 I can assure that Brazil will not only overcome the crisis 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.040
 How will you get out of it? 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.169
 but strong 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.569
 I fear that all the conditions for this in 2009 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:21.289
 we will begin to explore the immense reserves of pre-salt 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.509
 Brazil will become one of the world's major oil producers. 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:29.449
 we are all in the same boat 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.469
 and wanted more goals together in the same direction 

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:34.300
 we will overcome turbulence 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.699
 and we will continue 

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:36.509
 on the route 

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:37.580
 growth 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.569
 just up to us 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:42.839
 A merry christmas to you and your family. 

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:45.839
 2009 is an even better year than 2008 

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:48.259
 that is a year of health 

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:49.319
 Details 

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:51.149
 and prosperity 

00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:52.749
 Do you know in Brazil? 

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:56.899
 because first of all you'll be believing in yourself 

00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:58.279
 good night
