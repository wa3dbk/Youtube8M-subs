anything it really doesn't matter i'm

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.759 
anything it really doesn't matter i'm
just<00:04:02.209> going<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.510> use<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.989> white<00:04:03.170> and<00:04:03.470> then

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
just going to use the white and then

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.750 
just going to use the white and then
color<00:04:04.100> it<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:05.060> pink<00:04:05.620> rose<00:04:06.620> pink<00:04:07.130> don't<00:04:07.579> use

color it the pink rose pink don't use
any<00:04:08.180> other<00:04:08.510> paint<00:04:08.900> so<00:04:09.799> I'm<00:04:09.860> guessing<00:04:10.610> that

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
any other paint so I'm guessing that

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.289 
any other paint so I'm guessing that
could<00:04:11.239> be<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.510> um<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:13.400> could<00:04:13.579> draw<00:04:13.970> some

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
could be it um you could draw some

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.550 
could be it um you could draw some
designs<00:04:14.750> on<00:04:15.110> it<00:04:15.970> so<00:04:16.970> it<00:04:17.150> doesn't<00:04:17.180> look<00:04:17.780> cheap

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.710
