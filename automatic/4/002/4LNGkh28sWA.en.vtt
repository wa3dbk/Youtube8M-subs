00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 so welcome to the krimis 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.620
 video for my new project yes i have 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.330
 liked it 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.980
 I have to say why to make Beijing 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.599
 Neither, I mean, that's somehow 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.190
 the most exciting way to do such a thing 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.450
 can imagine a new project without that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.730
 then you yourself then one 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.710
 bit rum was lammert I do not know 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:26.369
 i like that yes i say to that before 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.010
 yes I said friends need what you or 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.510
 I grab the most even and then 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.930
 I say something because I want that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.430
 the best exciting thing is I am 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.710
 not yet with a sonata through 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.850
 complete and I will this video then 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.350
 probably only upload if 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.670
 I really completely through ben and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.040
 by means of which I am not yet 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.360
 but I have the game now 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.950
 already ordered because I stop here 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.969
 wanted to have when I'm done then 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.710
 that I really start right away 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.920
 can 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.969
 and so far I have that here and now 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.050
 in such a way that always 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.460
 I've made apologies times 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.640
 for that my voice is a bit strange 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.500
 Sounds like you know I have to go now 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.780
 Germany handed and make them even 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.290
 okay that is difficult i out of mine 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.810
 cameraman to keep himself 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:16.439
 you are watching a lot from now on 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.259
 it was so now I have to just like that 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.360
 everything is in it 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.439
 this is so guilty here 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.290
 get it out of the way and now 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:32.299
 much advertising god the camera he flies 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.299
 everything will be illegal and only once the 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.670
 kingdom hearts hd-remakes 1.5 the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.200
 kingdom hearts 1 already played what 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.060
 here is kingdom hearts 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.460
 chain of memories and that will be mine 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.620
 new project people yes i am happy 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.030
 already totally out which ended in resin-me 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.090
 but somehow done but I have 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.000
 I read a lot that I was often 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.560
 asked if I have him in the resin 21 player and 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.930
 I experienced that and I thought 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.820
 give and then came but the announcement 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.280
 for this game and I have so many times 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.630
 read that one the story of kingdom 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.280
 hearts 2 practically does not stand for 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.570
 one does not shattered memories before 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.860
 has played and I do not have that 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.450
 played so far I have only really 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.340
 that was ultimately done by pediatrician 1 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.540
 and that's why I thought it would be 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.850
 probably the better choice if I am 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.610
 first chain of memories player and 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.870
 not kingdom hearts 2 with me now 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.760
 I do not want to promise that I was then 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.080
 two sometime let's play but me 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.550
 definitely wants ten of 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.760
 memories play next project 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.650
 after it all its aunt destiny and how 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.450
 I do this with katamari forever must 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.470
 I'll just stop and look like that 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.120
 i do not want all partners 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.110
 Upload in a row because I believe 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.940
 that would be a bit on the way 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.680
 boring yes in any case we do 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.340
 The best way to play or we want 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.470
 First we look 100 euro coupon 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.940
 good luck and years make you 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.440
 there with somewhere and then you can get one 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:57.780
 toothbrush have ok we leave that 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.840
 we'll do it right now 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.040
 here something interesting on it 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.570
 cards based battle system, the only 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.860
 I did not know at all oh yes and 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:11.370
 that is also on it kingdom 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:13.230
 hearts 358 days through 2 but thats 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.270
 stop just as a film sequence I still remember 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.670
 not if I'll show it 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.459
 because I am still quite sure 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.100
 look at does not want for here 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.150
 actually playing before the game 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.940
 or at least once 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.739
 try it out before i find myself 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.519
 I sort of summarize that 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.519
 look at history 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.590
 today you can not make beautiful 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.060
 I've come specially that I here this 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.580
 Great story can be pretty fast 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.780
 make up 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.269
 I can win it is not nice 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.269
 only make 58 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.290
 many countries play well 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.230
 I love the smell of nine , yes 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.760
 that too is just so seriously serious 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.950
 there is a guide in there because 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.120
 that must be in march sank the last time 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.859
 that's really it's really such a 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.470
 There is hardly any disease left recently 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.820
 play a proper guide and that 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.229
 I think it's a pity because I am 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.359
 always left me instructions 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.930
 through before I got the values rcd one thing 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:30.110
 that is a product 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:32.210
 registration code and right here that 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.350
 the instruction is now we are looking 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.669
 if she is anything in it 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.740
 synonymous okay control of miks 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.289
 steurer harris of the children in hartz iv 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.870
 a mix actually on this game 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.090
 this cd but the problem is 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.460
 I do not play a game again 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.240
 completely new by just a few extra 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.560
 thing to do 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.310
 that's why I'll probably do it 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.599
 first do not play and this final 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.190
 then I'm interested in mix elements 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.320
 personally not so much i am rather 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.370
 so I'm so interested in the story 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.260
 and everything else me 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.460
 I'm interested in looking 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
 that is all control for the 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.389
 different players come now 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.300
 Warranty drawing hotline 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.530
 ok so it is not a real guide 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.210
 the only thing on it is the 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.810
 control but the game is sweet looking 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:23.060
 times rico sorat's and career 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:25.460
 that's exactly and the others 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.020
 I do not even know any characters yet 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.479
 curious who this is about Michael 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.000
 micky and jersey can but you 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.830
 nich and 3 where I already somewhere 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.360
 views I sometimes times 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.620
 on the internet is traveling then you come 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.700
 yes practically not around it 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.410
 all times to see 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.420
 so baby seat rhymed okay sorry i want 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.680
 not so much and long over it la 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.090
 bonne because I can do that too 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.630
 I will not say I 'll just do it 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.980
 to begin 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.330
 and I do not know how long 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.470
 the game is and I hope I get it 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:58.230
 also no problems with copy with clear 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.230
 mid mid mid copyright copyright I but 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:05.070
 Do not guess kingdom is hearts 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.540
 By now I had chieming 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.570
 also has a lot of problems 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:12.650
 except at the last part of the was 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:18.060
 because the audio track is blocked because of 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.050
 because of this ending song so with these 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.690
 I have to take care a little bit 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.770
 but otherwise I do not know how 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.880
 long the game is i want you 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.890
 Just guess that it is one 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.830
 a bit shorter than kingdom hearts 1 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.820
 but how long it really is 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.250
 no idea 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.850
 Let's see I'm I'll leave me 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.800
 to surprise 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.240
 I do not think so I think so 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.710
 sometimes play a shorter game 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.150
 and so can though I do now 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.170
 not from every game what actually 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.240
 other short I make a long 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.470
 I just had to play around for a long time 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.840
 to play because I enjoy the game 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:49.290
 would like and not just by 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.690
 play so well then I'm done now 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.380
 with the announcement video 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.750
 I probably already have that 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.520
 recorded before you finally get that 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.810
 But see, I have said this as that 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.550
 I've already got it now and 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.350
 I did not want two more here now 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.000
 weeks long or three weeks long the 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.530
 pack the packaged game here 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.390
 that's why it wanted to lie around 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.740
 take apart want the 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.230
 also on make i love the smell of 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.850
 new games and in general of 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.620
 new things books as well as great 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.960
 Books are so great when you go to 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:19.770
 first time hits 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.740
 ok i want to finish well then i hope 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.330
 that you are happy about this project 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.530
 I just hope there is such a thing 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.960
 many people are always following me 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.580
 kingdom have asked hearts and me 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.350
 I really wanted it myself 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.660
 that you have to play it and I thought 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:39.980
 that would be a nice base too 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:42.180
 children once set up and then 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.139
 that will definitely be idyllic 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.569
 such a kind of destiny 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:49.560
 in that sense, I wish you one more 

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:49.560
 nice day adiós
