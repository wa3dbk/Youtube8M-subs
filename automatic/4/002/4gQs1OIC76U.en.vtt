00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.530
 what applied a base on everything 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.250
 the eye now I take this paint pot 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.320
 of max and is the black ground however one 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.419
 black base a good soft car 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.570
 it will be the same thing and the hostel on everything 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.570
 the eye 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.309
 once arrived at this point I take 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.430
 the eye shadow protagonist of make up and 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.820
 eca pleiadi nabla and it really began 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:52.829
 press it and dust it all over mine 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:59.589
 black base intensifies well cataleya 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.359
 pressing it on the eyelid takes one 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.940
 black pencil laments inside 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:12.400
 of the eye in the upper rhyme and also 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:14.970
 slightly under the lashes I lightly bleed 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.970
 under 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.450
 I pick up clothes and apply it 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.020
 with a large blending gradient brush 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.020
 more edges 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.520
 with a matte black eye shadow and a brush 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.259
 a little bit smaller than precision begins 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.259
 to define the external way 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.190
 and fades with the brush with which I have 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.190
 applied cataleya 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.700
 once done this I take mine again 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:24.120
 gradient brush and soften again 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:26.010
 the edges with an angled brush 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.530
 I take my black and the optician a 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:35.519
 little below even surnames I will 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.159
 I take mother-of-pearl and I apply just one 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.090
 little here at the beginning to give right 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:44.670
 a little reflection and the smoke I take a 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.669
 illuminating eyeshadow and apply it below 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:52.680
 the eyebrow arch and with a 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:55.879
 illuminating eye shadow but a little shimmer 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.879
 light the inner corner 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.849
 naturally for mail eyeliner 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.849
 then inevitable eye liner 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.260
 I don't know if you see it in the video camera though 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.239
 cataleya lost some purple then 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.090
 now I'm going to remove this part here 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.269
 and I removed the under part from make-up 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.109
 I apply my concealer I wear 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.879
 just a little to clean this area 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:40.099
 brushes to my bare skin concealer 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:42.230
 prefer the sigma taper kabuki f 86 with 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.290
 this also helps me to define the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:49.060
 shape of my tuxedo bend now 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.060
 eyelashes of so much mascara 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.319
 I already did with touring he used top of 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.720
 ny ex while the blush he uses 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:16.010
 this bobby brown here is a blush in 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.209
 cream and is the color for pink 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.880
 of course you can use 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.610
 the one that suits you the most 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.290
 you have is what you like most 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.639
 it is never necessary to have the same 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:33.240
 things to recreate a trick like 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.230
 illuminating copacabana use of nars and lo 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.230
 I apply with my fingers 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:02.740
 as always, outline the lips with the 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:05.380
 snow cosmetics ballerina and the lip 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.470
 gloss that I'm going to use this here 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:14.979
 of the naked urban decay line and yes 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:17.199
 call besso girls it's beautiful then 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.150
 this is the finished trick I'm happy 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.949
 that you enjoyed it so much but I have 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.990
 received many requests 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.870
 I had made this trick for 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.550
 the blog in fact in the info box you find the 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.740

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.199

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.880
 that you saw during the video 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.520
 however I will be really happy that you 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.949

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.030

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.659
