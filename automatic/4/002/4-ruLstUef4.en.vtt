00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.770
 and good morning everyone if you 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.390
 see had no comments and you 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.430
 legs to me I'm doing great then 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.369
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.260
 attempt mobo masto is that it's 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.450
 possible you will listen well 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.310
 play and watch the hour before 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.380
 go to the gameplay but I introduce myself 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.800
 my name is ryu ken guile there is a 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.720
 fault when do not you do the accent that 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.520
 is missed so I have on the psn and 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.070
 where we could not put it 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.800
 pity so I'm 16 years old and I'm going to 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.359
 show from the south since March 14, 2012 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.070
 and also I will try to try 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.230
 to send his subject rating because I 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.239
 think it's a video already of one that 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.160
 only rarely to see an attempt to 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.160
 mastodon so now yes it's 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.140
 possible and I quickly looked at them on 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.090
 youtube if there was nobody who had 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.300
 posted a video there but there was a 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.010
 person he had just posted he 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.890
 had passed by cenet it's a friend of mine 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.510
 so I just had my lease at 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.920
 rather ask a person but is 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.080
 what it is possible to rage that and 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.120
 everything is precisely he told me yeah but 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.590
 no I could not because she 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.290
 was good room partner the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.060
 parenthesis precisely you present this 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.610
 new game mode called money 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.650
 is the tech or that's what this mode of 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.420
 game what is it and precisely if a 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.579
 part in sabotages pretty fast 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.020
 good fast enough he abuses a little but 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.210
 which still lasts ten minutes 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.380
 so frankly it's 10 minutes it 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.180
 pass he passes quickly 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.189
 and precisely that you start the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.590
 part there is a there is of course the bomb 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.930
 in the middle so the advanced to be limited in 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.340
 search and destruction but with 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.170
 a single bomb there is everybody who 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.850
 stops of course for first because 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.610
 that this bomb there is still 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.689
 something magical 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.390
 for example that you learn it 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.290
 precisely you have a mastodon and there 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.210
 its limits there are all 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.940
 who come to you use thresholds 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.440
 to kill you kill and that's what is 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.270
 although you are thin toda this is where 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.060
 where you can attempt attempts 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.950
 bug in the mastodon so precisely after 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.140
 there are still classes that are 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.630
 already prepared because I do not know where 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.790
 there is peace 90 m and even bessette or 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.920
 which is already classes creates so 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.860
 that's the positive point for me 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.010
 I loved it so there is a pcet here a 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.500
 live and this is a huge pessac joke 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.060
 there m alas a pcet that ti fast that 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.610
 it's the special tears for the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.340
 researches that's me I took early 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.050
 because I did not think what was it 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.670
 these sums and where did you go 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.560
 it was now quite special of 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.410
 clients there is a pessac quick shot 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.150
 for searches there is the sniper that 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.750
 it's a shame he will not go well 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.000
 hideout 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.790
 that's the negative point so you had to 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.310
 of this game mode there because we can 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.500
 do not hurt that he did in this mode 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.750
 frankly ugly there for 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.880
 people who do that is a dream but 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.310
 you still have to have a specialist 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.100
 to have a good hiding place after you 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.510
 have the model and 8b the model is a 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.550
 shame that I have to rediscover 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.260
 since before put tons and 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.470
 tons of it would mark the omit you 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.540
 no it is abused admits its limits 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.610
 I have one time at least once 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.090
 on five and frankly there is still 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.280
 enough are still rare then after you 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.640
 have the apeca punch is just a normal 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.959
 we will say super special for 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.390
 people they like screwed 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.760
 to go mastodon frankly it's me 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.950
 I took once and these standards 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.570
 special you have I'm more how much 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.160
 of balls I believe without a ball on a 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.540
 charger and there you can disassemble the 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.610
 early mas 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.580
 so it's still men already 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.100
 created and then after precisely what is 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.430
 well it's rather what is not good 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.630
 when you have the mastodon it's that 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.519
 the first kill you make good 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.290
 know but you still have to succeed 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.209
 have the specialist assets if you 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.040
 do not have the other specialists at 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.420
 you are slow you its limits you 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.910
 have to barrett and you try to 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.920
 rocks with and two as if they were 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.630
 submachine guns and afterwards also knows 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.640
 you have the desire linden trees what is 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.510
 pity but 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.610
 frankly happily they have it 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.060
 put because the super powerful and we 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.660
 looks like it's not the same as online 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.520
 if we could say that and also when 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.170
 makes you shoot like me well 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.790
 sure when you're slaughtering ya not 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.560
 bad enemies ben there you are in the 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.329
 shit when you do not have the trumps 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.030
 specialists what are you slow and 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.070
 all its limits we can not put any 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.690
 drop shot and when you have 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.820
 Ben specialist assets there frankly 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.930
 makes you happy because you 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.910
 look like it's like you have a 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.710
 Turkish trotter marathon where you have 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.210
 all the pros there it's limit you 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.400
 can do anything you want 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.350
 it's limited you are usain bolt of 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.410
 run deep in the mastodon this is it 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.990
 exactly that's right there I come 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.430
 to get my mob August and before so 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.230
 little parenthesis I do not have the gameplay 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.030
 on under my eyes 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.910
 so what is a pity so I have 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.860
 maybe times in my hands 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.390
 so I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.370
 that I tried to give you 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.240
 want to play on this mode of play there 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:08.360
 so that's it so I hope I'll be at 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.340
