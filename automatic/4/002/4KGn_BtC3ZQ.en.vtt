next period genes but that was a very it

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.120 
next period genes but that was a very it
was<00:04:41.300> one<00:04:41.449> there's<00:04:41.960> a<00:04:42.080> really<00:04:42.320> outstanding<00:04:42.590> win

those tell hasn't beaten elder very

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.800 
those tell hasn't beaten elder very
often<00:04:45.229> in<00:04:45.320> football<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:46.220> so<00:04:46.789> anytime<00:04:47.449> we<00:04:47.479> beat

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
often in football and so anytime we beat

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.110 
often in football and so anytime we beat
them<00:04:47.960> it's<00:04:48.470> a<00:04:48.560> great<00:04:48.680> game<00:04:48.979> in<00:04:49.610> fact<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:49.970> most

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
them it's a great game in fact the most

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.420 
them it's a great game in fact the most
NFL<00:04:50.389> players<00:04:50.900> but<00:04:51.199> we<00:04:51.740> haven't<00:04:51.919> had<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.250> best

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
NFL players but we haven't had the best

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.310 
NFL players but we haven't had the best
winning<00:04:52.729> history<00:04:53.150> so<00:04:53.360> we're<00:04:53.990> trying<00:04:54.139> to

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
winning history so we're trying to

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.870 
winning history so we're trying to
change<00:04:54.500> that<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.860> class<00:04:55.039> of<00:04:55.070> OA<00:04:55.310> is<00:04:55.460> trying<00:04:55.820> to

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
change that the class of OA is trying to

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.430 
change that the class of OA is trying to
change<00:04:56.060> that<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.330> I<00:04:56.510> think<00:04:56.539> that<00:04:56.930> this<00:04:57.229> is<00:04:57.289> a

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
change that and I think that this is a

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.500 
change that and I think that this is a
first<00:04:57.680> step<00:04:57.830> towards<00:04:58.699> changing<00:04:59.060> out<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.240> think

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
first step towards changing out I think

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.460 
first step towards changing out I think
that<00:04:59.599> we<00:04:59.690> just<00:04:59.870> got<00:04:59.960> to<00:05:00.050> come<00:05:00.199> back<00:05:00.229> to

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
that we just got to come back to

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.910 
that we just got to come back to
practice<00:05:00.740> on<00:05:00.830> money<00:05:01.010> right<00:05:01.130> at<00:05:01.370> work

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
practice on money right at work

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.370 
practice on money right at work
ok
