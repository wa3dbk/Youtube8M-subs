tell<00:01:39.900> them<00:01:40.409> apart<00:01:41.130> was<00:01:41.790> by<00:01:42.030> their<00:01:42.540> weapons<00:01:43.490> but

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
tell them apart was by their weapons but

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.740 
tell them apart was by their weapons but
um<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.090> actually<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.600> my<00:01:45.689> favorite

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
issues just close the front cover I just

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.149 
issues just close the front cover I just
love<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.200> because<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.560> reason<00:01:49.799> why<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.920> like

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
love this because the reason why I like

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.249 
love this because the reason why I like
it<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.430> because<00:01:50.460> when<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.939> look<00:01:51.119> at<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.299> it

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
it is because when you look at it it

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.649 
it is because when you look at it it
looks<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:53.090> hand-drawn<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.540> know

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
looks like it's like hand-drawn you know

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
really grew up with are the Archie

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.170 
really grew up with are the Archie
series<00:05:13.870> now<00:05:14.139> I<00:05:14.169> think<00:05:15.039> and<00:05:15.219> Archie<00:05:15.610> is<00:05:15.969> pretty

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
series now I think and Archie is pretty

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.589 
series now I think and Archie is pretty
weak<00:05:16.419> actually<00:05:17.349> I<00:05:17.379> think<00:05:17.759> well<00:05:18.759> to<00:05:19.029> me<00:05:19.180> in<00:05:19.449> my

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
weak actually I think well to me in my

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.269 
weak actually I think well to me in my
opinion<00:05:19.900> I<00:05:20.169> think<00:05:20.199> the<00:05:20.529> Archie<00:05:20.740> series<00:05:21.069> by<00:05:21.250> the
