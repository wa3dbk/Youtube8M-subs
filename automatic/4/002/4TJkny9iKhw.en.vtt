00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.849 

Here<00:00:01.620> I<00:00:01.650> am<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:02.040> tiger<00:00:02.700> helicopter<00:00:03.570> simulator

00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:03.859 
Here I am a tiger helicopter simulator

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:07.490 
Here I am a tiger helicopter simulator
and<00:00:04.859> real<00:00:05.250> pilot<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.850> left<00:00:06.089> till<00:00:06.509> we<00:00:06.540> do

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
and real pilot and left till we do

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.870 
and real pilot and left till we do
180<00:00:08.069> degrees<00:00:08.580> turn<00:00:09.860> this<00:00:10.860> simulator<00:00:11.430> is<00:00:11.730> an

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
180 degrees turn this simulator is an

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.480 
180 degrees turn this simulator is an
absolutely<00:00:12.360> realistic<00:00:13.020> simulator<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:14.129> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
absolutely realistic simulator of the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.950 
absolutely realistic simulator of the
tiger<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.990> used<00:00:16.380> for<00:00:16.740> training<00:00:17.070> real<00:00:17.460> piles

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
tiger it is used for training real piles

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.570 
tiger it is used for training real piles
of<00:00:18.960> course<00:00:19.259> this<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> today<00:00:20.430> it's

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
of course this is a today it's

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.490 
of course this is a today it's
simplified<00:00:20.939> because<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.689> no<00:00:21.960> weapon

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
simplified because we have no weapon

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.849 
simplified because we have no weapon
systems<00:00:22.980> are<00:00:23.369> no<00:00:24.330> real<00:00:24.869> battles<00:00:25.380> or<00:00:25.560> whatever

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
systems are no real battles or whatever

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.370 
systems are no real battles or whatever
but<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.520> just<00:00:27.029> basic<00:00:27.390> flying<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:27.960> still

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
but it's just basic flying but still

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.310 
but it's just basic flying but still
you've<00:00:29.189> got<00:00:29.430> the<00:00:29.910> tool<00:00:30.119> rudder<00:00:30.420> pedals<00:00:30.840> then

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
you've got the tool rudder pedals then

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.380 
you've got the tool rudder pedals then
you've<00:00:31.470> got<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.680> joystick<00:00:32.189> for<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.970> and<00:00:33.210> down

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
you've got a joystick for up and down

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.600 
you've got a joystick for up and down
left<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.870> right<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.379> is<00:00:34.559> between<00:00:35.280> your<00:00:35.430> legs

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
left and right that is between your legs

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.939 
left and right that is between your legs
and<00:00:35.910> then<00:00:36.629> on<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> left<00:00:37.080> side<00:00:37.350> with<00:00:37.650> your<00:00:37.830> left

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
and then on the left side with your left

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.010 
and then on the left side with your left
hand<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.580> have<00:00:38.699> to<00:00:38.910> control<00:00:39.269> the<00:00:39.449> rotor<00:00:39.660> speed

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
hand you have to control the rotor speed

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.290 
hand you have to control the rotor speed
so<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:41.040> all<00:00:41.219> those<00:00:41.640> things<00:00:41.910> at

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so you have to do all those things at

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.760 
so you have to do all those things at
once<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:43.500> keep<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.399> helicopter<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.239> air

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
once to keep the helicopter in the air

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.860 
once to keep the helicopter in the air
and<00:00:46.770> trust<00:00:47.160> me<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.700> really<00:00:48.090> not<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:48.510> easy<00:00:48.719> as

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and trust me it's really not as easy as

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.380 
and trust me it's really not as easy as
it<00:00:49.110> looks<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.680> think<00:00:49.860> about<00:00:50.399> two-thirds

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
it looks here I think about two-thirds

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.940 
it looks here I think about two-thirds
of<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> people<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.559> up<00:00:52.710> I'm

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
of the people really up I'm

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.040 
of the people really up I'm
trying<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.480> they<00:00:54.600> crashed<00:00:54.899> a

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
trying to do this so they crashed a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.549 
trying to do this so they crashed a
helicopter<00:00:56.870> yeah<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.899> should<00:00:58.110> have<00:00:58.200> really

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
helicopter yeah I should have really

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.650 
helicopter yeah I should have really
taken<00:00:58.739> videos<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.610> really<00:01:00.270> hope<00:01:00.449> I

I just mentioned that I used to play
flight<00:01:53.440> simulators<00:01:54.040> but<00:01:54.220> have<00:01:54.340> only<00:01:54.460> been

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
flight simulators but have only been

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:09.200 
flight simulators but have only been
signed<00:01:55.120> yet

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.170

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and honestly told me to maintain 2,000

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.910 
and honestly told me to maintain 2,000
and<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.540> just<00:02:12.750> basically<00:02:13.230> said<00:02:13.560> Roger

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.610 

now<00:02:24.340> we<00:02:24.400> were<00:02:24.670> discussing<00:02:25.410> landing<00:02:26.410> and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
now we were discussing landing and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.770 
now we were discussing landing and
takeoff<00:02:27.250> what<00:02:27.430> especially<00:02:27.700> landing<00:02:28.270> is<00:02:28.360> very

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
takeoff what especially landing is very

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.950 
takeoff what especially landing is very
difficult<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:30.310> she<00:02:30.850> said<00:02:31.060> she<00:02:31.270> wants<00:02:31.690> me<00:02:31.810> to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
difficult but she said she wants me to

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.990 
difficult but she said she wants me to
try<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.850> I'm<00:02:34.810> doing<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.620> 180<00:02:36.310> degree<00:02:36.430> turn

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
try and so I'm doing a 180 degree turn

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.360 
try and so I'm doing a 180 degree turn
and<00:02:37.240> off<00:02:37.720> her<00:02:37.930> orders<00:02:38.380> don't<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.800> fast<00:02:42.130> you

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
she is telling me to land on that

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.059 
she is telling me to land on that
brownfield<00:02:50.940> right<00:02:51.239> up<00:02:51.450> ahead<00:02:51.599> you<00:02:52.230> can<00:02:52.470> see<00:02:52.950> it

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
brownfield right up ahead you can see it

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:13.650 
brownfield right up ahead you can see it
in<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.280> second<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.760> suppose
