00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
circular motions now well I'm going to

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.249 
circular motions now well I'm going to
get<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:34.979> everywhere<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.689> me<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.960> great

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.990 

but<00:01:44.330> I<00:01:44.390> do<00:01:44.450> talk<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:45.230> whilst<00:01:45.980> doing<00:01:46.700> this

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
but I do talk to you whilst doing this

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.070 
but I do talk to you whilst doing this
so<00:01:47.150> I'm<00:01:47.270> not<00:01:47.420> going<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.630> do<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.870> whole<00:01:47.960> way

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
so I'm not going to do the whole way

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.020 
so I'm not going to do the whole way
through<00:01:48.320> basically<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.280> lot<00:01:49.730> of<00:01:49.850> small

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
through basically a lot of small

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.240 
through basically a lot of small
circular<00:01:50.270> motions<00:01:50.450> gets<00:01:51.380> further<00:01:51.650> into<00:01:52.100> your

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
circular motions gets further into your

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.180 
circular motions gets further into your
pores<00:01:52.520> clean<00:01:53.450> them<00:01:53.660> out<00:01:53.750> better<00:01:54.020> it's<00:01:55.010> better

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
pores clean them out better it's better

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.430 
pores clean them out better it's better
than<00:01:55.370> a<00:01:55.430> scrub<00:01:55.760> because<00:01:56.120> less<00:01:56.300> abrasive<00:01:56.540> it's

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
than a scrub because less abrasive it's

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.190 
than a scrub because less abrasive it's
actually<00:01:57.680> more<00:01:57.770> efficient<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.930> get<00:01:59.930> all<00:02:00.110> that

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
actually more efficient I get all that

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.800 
actually more efficient I get all that
may<00:02:00.320> I<00:02:00.350> i<00:02:00.620> I'm<00:02:01.160> use<00:02:01.640> a<00:02:01.670> lot<00:02:01.880> scrubs<00:02:02.210> because<00:02:02.630> I

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
may I i I'm use a lot scrubs because I

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.000 
may I i I'm use a lot scrubs because I
like<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.050> slow<00:02:03.380> down<00:02:03.530> i<00:02:03.710> think<00:02:03.890> i've<00:02:03.950> been

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
like to slow down i think i've been

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.680 
like to slow down i think i've been
doing<00:02:04.190> something<00:02:04.490> however<00:02:04.730> this<00:02:05.300> is<00:02:05.450> much

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
doing something however this is much

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.500 
doing something however this is much
better<00:02:05.900> because<00:02:06.820> one<00:02:07.820> you<00:02:08.060> can<00:02:08.210> tell<00:02:08.360> any

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
better because one you can tell any

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.240 
better because one you can tell any
cleanser<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.170> getting<00:02:09.649> more<00:02:09.830> choice<00:02:10.100> of

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
cleanser so you getting more choice of

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.190 
cleanser so you getting more choice of
what<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.430> want<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.670> use<00:02:10.850> except<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.810> scrub<00:02:12.050> and

what you want to use except to scrub and

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.960 
what you want to use except to scrub and
it's<00:02:12.800> betting<00:02:13.070> it's<00:02:13.190> further<00:02:13.460> in<00:02:13.610> your<00:02:13.730> pores

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
it's betting it's further in your pores

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.580 
it's betting it's further in your pores
