classical guitar it turns out that in

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.830 
classical guitar it turns out that in
America<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.670> like<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> lower<00:01:00.210> action<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.750> our

America we like a lower action on our

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.959 
America we like a lower action on our
classical<00:01:01.289> guitars<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.280> Europe<00:01:02.640> they

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
classical guitars and in Europe they

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.429 
classical guitars and in Europe they
like<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> higher<00:01:03.449> action<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.049> guess<00:01:04.260> because

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
like a higher action I guess because

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:17.899 
like a higher action I guess because
they<00:01:04.650> stay<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.960> I<00:01:06.960> guess<00:01:07.320> they

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.820
