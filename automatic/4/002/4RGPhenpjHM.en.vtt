00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.930
 we have two nervous system system 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.219
 deep venous and the system only one 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.440
 superficial 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.750
 When we talk about varicose veins surgery 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.930
 we are talking about superficial veins 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:26.580
 that when they are insufficient they can be 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:29.939
 withdrawn without harm to health the surgery of 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.150
 varicose veins is accurate under general anesthesia or 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.579
 about spinal anesthesia the surgeon does 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.670
 two groin incisions and one 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.469
 below the knee for removal of this 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.039
 on sick leave 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.829
 in the groin decision is made ligature 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.890
 the crust of this scene or to see this 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.309
 faith is selected and instilled so that 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.449
 make the mother blood inside as 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:02.070
 she is sick and no problem in that 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:06.150
 after that section is past steel trusts 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.250
 this thread runs through the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.460
 sick daughter 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.400
 shortly thereafter it is 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:21.030
 that the vein is withdrawn by buying 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:23.460
 incision very often after the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.950
 economy than the withdrawal of this 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.100
 it is necessary to withdraw other 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.440
 superficial veins and these are made 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.540
 with incisions above the path of these 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.160
 old 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.080
 these decisions may be small 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.250
 slightly larger depending on the diameter 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.360
 these veins but they should also be 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.810
 withdrawals 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.180
 these decisions are often closed 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.370
 no need to tip and in the post 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.670
 the patient is left with the leg 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.670
 bandaged
