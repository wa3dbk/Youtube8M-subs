00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.799
 the two have changed their assortment, including the market situation and me 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.469
 Just wanted to compare the old new plants 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.949
 I chose myself as a test person 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:17.509
 of the old plants believe in us and now want to keep cattle 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.000
 In danger of that I have certainly shown voices more clearly 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.489
 the nail polish costs continue 1 55 with the former Lech falls on that one 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.440
 a comrade and Robin Dutt 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.440
 I do not think so now 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.370
 since the Lord has the area compared to that the ladies 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.850
 it's an orchestra out as he notes in the old one 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.370
 however, had a substantial majority of all content in the two trades 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.660
 Percent break 8 meters but want to contain 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.240
 that's just because 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.480
 that with the new plants the soil is a lot higher than with the old ones 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.740
 facilities 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.850
 and also the poor country 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.020
 is much more 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.730
 Mounts and greed is simply more nail polish percent off visually 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.700
 especially it applies that if such a not equal kiss is a guy 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.700
 higher and he is also a bit wider 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.430
 and the old ones were introduced in a rounded manner in Hesse and in the covenant 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.260
 6 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.250
 and the new facilities 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.250
 are the Egyptians 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.859
 at the EM Neuenrade Lackner 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.160
 that's huge here 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.860
 at the new facilities 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.670
 the other things in German stand with each other Ohnemus with the old one 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.130
 nail polish 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.050
 then they are next to each other 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.130
 Basis for a new era ushered in that it is the eleventh we know that 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.620
 Trend towards the valley 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.640
 and the first time I did not explain it 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.370
 took some getting used to the city but what am 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.830
 most disturbed 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.900
 This is 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.080
 if that says then I will continue to be a lot higher at Napoli than at 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.329
 the old rag 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:12.259
 and then 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:14.199
 he did not direct episode 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.039
 episode 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.239
 and smears 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.239
 you have to start from top form Lina 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.849
 and there also the referee, which was completely omitted, was much smaller 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.619
 as of the old ones 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.719
 although here too he did not want that nobody in prospect 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.479
 yes some scratches already 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.879
 although I'm infected too 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.489
 this is a very important undertaking when it has got involved 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.019
 So on the ceiling is from the new markets 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:52.659
 and I do not like that at all 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.790
 because that makes the church work as planned and I do not think it's good 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.869
 I do not know how he finds that 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:04.279
 Map with the old Kinzel better right now and now with the "Lohengrin" 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:05.849
 are 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.700
 at the new border, the color of the top goes up and that's really thick 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:17.650
 where a competitor also some color on the stem but not so extreme 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:19.509
 a lot of 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:23.329
 the consistency of me also break something different sour 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.539
 so far, many 02 30 today raise your money 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.919
 on time for Easter or Pentecost 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.579
 only long 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.829
 Philippe Boucard 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.159
 I think you can learn that you can not hide anything 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.709
 but 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.799
 The consistency was a little thicker than the old lamps 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.299
 should it be with this question i can still put it in this question it is the 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.780
 only thing I know him 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.839
 bought 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:59.399
 and 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:01.599
 he is also gave cover 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.599
 this deficiency also covers Otmar in the first taxis 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.469
 and Weilimdorf forced you 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.519
 assignments 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.930
 without net around 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.990
 I am also one that the new plants 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.949
 Developing countries need it as the old arena there went through Luca 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.620
 dry and warm 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.509
 they also hold much better 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:27.999
 forever 

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:32.090
 was on the second day samples Germania was packaged 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.919
 but he is still wonderfully brown and 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.860
 looks like freshly told 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.289
 I want all that very well 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.620
 choose your age from nine brands which liked the over the alps or the 9 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.650
 Â«I hope I save elegance to help Altena as a little bit 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.949
 if i hope i could help you 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.659
 or it was informative to you and interested you i wish you a 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.169
 nice weekend destination is
