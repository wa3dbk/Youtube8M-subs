00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.990
 hello everyone guys 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.600
 always new tutorials you can call 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.450
 tutorial for that will last 2 seconds will be 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.210
 a very simple and fast effect 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.730
 this is what we are going to do 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.529
 effect this eye this effect does not 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.619
 I know how to call it but I call it 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.720
 let's pretend ball for those approaching 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.910
 so much to the color of the fire that has a 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.440
 fire reflection on one eye 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.410
 so we make the price of fire on a 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.710
 eye we call it nothing is an effect 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.850
 very simple that we're going to do right away 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.930
 with the instrument only the instrument 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.790
 fencing 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.640
 let's start immediately by unblocking ours 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.940
 double click padlock 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.530
 ok and let's go to another bar 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.110
 tools and just select it 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.030
 tool screen to this key here 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.550
 right if you don't see it anyway 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.460
 here tool fencing we go here in 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.360
 top interval half- tones exposure 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.360
 hundred percent 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.930
 and sorry explosions one hundred percent 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.930
 we dominate at 50 percent 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.729
 ok as you see 50 percent 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.920
 and now that we have done exposure 50 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.200
 percent 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.889
 vote for a hundred we are going to select 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.420
 a little the size of our brush 

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:33.520
 we see 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.329
 let's go to a dimension that covers one 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.079
 bit the eye so I go on 139 pixels 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:46.319
 then it depends on the size of the eye 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:51.179
 my near new york now clicking e 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:55.509
 dragging long click I drag 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:59.819
 let me click re drag soft click 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:03.670
 free drag soft wash drag 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.889
 perfect and a lot of effect will appear 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.350
 like this now let's go 

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:10.690
 resize our tool 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.980
 we mention it much more 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:20.080
 small perhaps even smaller than me 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:23.380
 I put a 10px and we do it less 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.480
 a 1 pixel topix car with 18 pixels 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.660
 of water begins to make zigzags 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.390
 in this way 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:37.150
 you see how simple it is used like 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:48.940
 then I go back to the paintings of quari 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:51.190
 start but quarini continue so vinke 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.920
 that there came an effect very similar to 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:59.560
 quests even if you go out a little does it 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:02.349
 same is not so much that we see so much a 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.329
 in other words, the effect that there is 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.690
 a similar effect will appear very similar 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:11.709
 this is how much you could have done 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.290
 see very simple and fast so it is 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.650
 a little within the reach of everyone we say how 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.390
 you see 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.980
 the effect is very pretty where it is 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.340
 should see a picture with two eyes 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.910
 a face maybe because so right 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.200
 anything 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.110
 here is the completed effect I hope there is 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.130
 it was useful to share the video on 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.130
 facebook subscribe to comment in short 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.600
