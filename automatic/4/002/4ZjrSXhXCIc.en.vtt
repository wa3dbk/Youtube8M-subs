00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
jinx jinx took a hit in patch 5.1 where

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.120 
jinx jinx took a hit in patch 5.1 where
a<00:00:41.030> minigun<00:00:41.510> is<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:41.780> bit<00:00:42.110> weaker<00:00:42.410> since<00:00:42.890> it<00:00:43.010> now

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
a minigun is a bit weaker since it now

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.220 
a minigun is a bit weaker since it now
scales<00:00:43.520> on<00:00:43.670> her<00:00:43.820> level<00:00:44.090> instead<00:00:44.570> of<00:00:44.750> how<00:00:45.020> much

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
scales on her level instead of how much

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.560 
scales on her level instead of how much
point<00:00:45.500> she<00:00:45.650> has<00:00:45.770> in<00:00:45.950> Q<00:00:46.280> so<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:47.120> does<00:00:47.270> hurt<00:00:47.420> her

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
point she has in Q so it does hurt her

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.510 
point she has in Q so it does hurt her
early<00:00:47.989> game<00:00:48.140> laning<00:00:48.470> phase<00:00:48.650> a<00:00:48.680> bit<00:00:48.980> but<00:00:49.370> not

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
early game laning phase a bit but not

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.680 
early game laning phase a bit but not
too<00:00:49.550> much<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.060> it<00:00:50.150> doesn't<00:00:50.390> really<00:00:50.570> affect

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
too much and it doesn't really affect

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.240 
too much and it doesn't really affect
her<00:00:51.020> mid<00:00:51.200> game<00:00:51.320> in<00:00:51.470> late<00:00:51.590> game<00:00:51.620> because<00:00:52.100> she's

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
her mid game in late game because she's

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.190 
her mid game in late game because she's
only<00:00:52.520> using<00:00:52.640> her<00:00:52.940> rockets<00:00:53.360> at<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:53.690> point<00:00:53.989> I

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
only using her rockets at that point I

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.080 
only using her rockets at that point I
also<00:00:54.559> do<00:00:54.830> feel<00:00:55.070> like<00:00:55.190> some<00:00:55.400> 80<00:00:55.640> cares<00:00:55.910> are

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
also do feel like some 80 cares are

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.939 
also do feel like some 80 cares are
stronger<00:00:56.420> than<00:00:56.600> her<00:00:56.780> right<00:00:57.020> now<00:00:57.170> but<00:00:57.590> she<00:00:57.860> is

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
stronger than her right now but she is

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.200 
stronger than her right now but she is
still<00:00:58.100> probably<00:00:58.280> one<00:00:58.520> of<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.640> best<00:00:58.820> Lake<00:00:59.059> he

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
still probably one of the best Lake he

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.910 
still probably one of the best Lake he
made<00:00:59.360> he<00:00:59.449> carries<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.020> of<00:01:00.110> course<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.559> bunch<00:01:00.830> of

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
made he carries and of course a bunch of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.070 
made he carries and of course a bunch of
steroids<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:01.550> she<00:01:02.090> has<00:01:02.270> one<00:01:02.720> of<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:02.900> best

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
steroids and she has one of the best

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.079 
steroids and she has one of the best
finishers<00:01:03.710> in<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:03.949> game<00:01:04.129> nexon<00:01:04.670> number<00:01:04.879> four

we<00:01:05.239> have<00:01:05.420> been<00:01:05.660> you<00:01:06.110> know<00:01:06.410> honestly<00:01:06.800> I<00:01:06.890> do<00:01:07.010> feel

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
we have been you know honestly I do feel

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.200 
we have been you know honestly I do feel
like<00:01:07.340> she's<00:01:07.399> actually<00:01:07.640> a<00:01:07.850> stronger<00:01:08.149> champion

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
like she's actually a stronger champion

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.719 
like she's actually a stronger champion
been<00:01:08.810> jinx<00:01:09.229> even<00:01:09.800> if<00:01:09.920> that<00:01:09.950> mini<00:01:10.280> gun<00:01:10.520> nerf

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
been jinx even if that mini gun nerf

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.730 
been jinx even if that mini gun nerf
never<00:01:11.090> hit<00:01:11.360> just<00:01:11.720> because<00:01:11.930> right<00:01:12.110> now<00:01:12.140> I<00:01:12.290> guess

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
never hit just because right now I guess

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.350 
never hit just because right now I guess
you<00:01:12.890> can<00:01:13.009> say<00:01:13.160> it's<00:01:13.280> like<00:01:13.399> a<00:01:13.430> tank<00:01:13.790> meta<00:01:14.060> going

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
you can say it's like a tank meta going

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.410 
you can say it's like a tank meta going
on<00:01:14.509> so<00:01:15.020> when<00:01:15.470> she<00:01:15.770> versus<00:01:16.310> those<00:01:16.520> tanks<00:01:17.030> she

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
on so when she versus those tanks she

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.880 
on so when she versus those tanks she
has<00:01:17.509> her<00:01:17.540> silver<00:01:17.960> bullets<00:01:18.229> plus<00:01:18.410> blade<00:01:18.649> a<00:01:18.680> room

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
has her silver bullets plus blade a room

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.680 
has her silver bullets plus blade a room
king<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.550> a<00:01:19.670> lot<00:01:19.790> of<00:01:19.820> attack<00:01:20.119> speed<00:01:20.330> backing

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
king and a lot of attack speed backing

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.480 
king and a lot of attack speed backing
that<00:01:20.780> up<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.259> she<00:01:21.770> can<00:01:21.800> kite<00:01:22.040> around<00:01:22.160> them

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
that up so she can kite around them

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.070 
that up so she can kite around them
effectively<00:01:22.910> and<00:01:23.240> take<00:01:23.600> him<00:01:23.720> down<00:01:23.840> really

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
effectively and take him down really

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.230 
effectively and take him down really
swiftly<00:01:24.590> I<00:01:24.770> also<00:01:25.160> do<00:01:25.460> feel<00:01:25.729> like<00:01:25.880> if<00:01:26.060> you're

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
swiftly I also do feel like if you're

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.359 
swiftly I also do feel like if you're
actually<00:01:26.479> a<00:01:26.720> better<00:01:26.899> vain<00:01:27.229> than<00:01:27.530> most<00:01:28.130> players

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
actually a better vain than most players

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.400 
actually a better vain than most players
then<00:01:29.000> she's<00:01:29.300> actually<00:01:29.450> probably<00:01:29.899> higher<00:01:30.170> in

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
then she's actually probably higher in

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.800 
then she's actually probably higher in
the<00:01:30.530> stairs<00:01:30.800> than<00:01:31.100> other<00:01:31.490> AD<00:01:31.759> carries<00:01:32.149> don't

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
the stairs than other AD carries don't

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.969 
the stairs than other AD carries don't
anything<00:01:32.960> I<00:01:33.110> was<00:01:33.229> really<00:01:33.470> stopping<00:01:33.710> her

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
anything I was really stopping her

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.950 
anything I was really stopping her
before<00:01:34.310> like<00:01:34.550> this<00:01:34.729> tank<00:01:35.030> meta<00:01:35.240> was<00:01:35.720> just<00:01:35.869> a

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
before like this tank meta was just a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.029 
before like this tank meta was just a
bunch<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.200> assassins<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:36.800> straight<00:01:37.009> up

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
bunch of assassins to straight up

that she is a really strong leaner and

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.949 
that she is a really strong leaner and
they<00:02:31.430> do<00:02:31.489> emphasize<00:02:31.910> in<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.450> early<00:02:32.690> game<00:02:32.840> of

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
they do emphasize in the early game of

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.840 
they do emphasize in the early game of
course<00:02:33.200> before<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.860> had<00:02:34.130> her<00:02:34.220> at<00:02:34.340> number<00:02:34.549> four

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
course before I had her at number four

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.699 
course before I had her at number four
but<00:02:35.420> that's<00:02:35.600> because<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.930> thought<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.530> their

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
but that's because I thought that their

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.220 
but that's because I thought that their
wind-up<00:02:37.250> attack<00:02:37.610> animation<00:02:38.150> was<00:02:38.329> really<00:02:39.049> big

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
wind-up attack animation was really big

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.920 
wind-up attack animation was really big
nerf<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.769> her<00:02:39.890> but<00:02:40.400> obviously<00:02:40.700> it's<00:02:41.239> not<00:02:41.329> and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
nerf to her but obviously it's not and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.599 
nerf to her but obviously it's not and
obviously<00:02:42.320> there's<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.680> lot<00:02:42.860> of<00:02:42.890> synergy<00:02:43.459> with

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
obviously there's a lot of synergy with

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.550 
obviously there's a lot of synergy with
their<00:02:43.790> supports<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.299> she<00:02:44.480> has<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.930> this

initiate or like obviously peel back or
something<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.980> mean<00:02:53.129> she<00:02:53.340> still<00:02:53.670> has<00:02:53.910> her

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
something and I mean she still has her

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.570 
something and I mean she still has her
really<00:02:54.510> strong<00:02:54.750> mid<00:02:54.959> game<00:02:55.140> because<00:02:55.620> she<00:02:55.920> has<00:02:56.550> a

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
really strong mid game because she has a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.009 
really strong mid game because she has a
lot<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:56.910> tightness<00:02:57.300> which<00:02:57.660> equals

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
lot of tightness which equals

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.780 
lot of tightness which equals
survivability<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.010> she<00:02:59.099> can<00:02:59.370> like<00:02:59.489> skip

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
survivability so she can like skip

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.580 
survivability so she can like skip

interesting so yeah it did hurt but
finally<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.810> mean<00:03:19.019> they<00:03:19.200> reduced<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.620> by<00:03:19.680> 20

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
finally I mean they reduced it by 20

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.039 
finally I mean they reduced it by 20
damage<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:21.209> doesn't<00:03:21.569> hurt<00:03:21.630> like<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.810> bitch

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.650 
damage so it doesn't hurt like a bitch
when<00:03:22.349> she<00:03:22.470> uses<00:03:22.739> her<00:03:22.830> w<00:03:23.160> at<00:03:23.400> level<00:03:23.880> 1<00:03:24.030> she<00:03:24.540> can

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
when she uses her w at level 1 she can

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.600 
when she uses her w at level 1 she can
also<00:03:24.810> no<00:03:25.019> longer<00:03:25.200> take<00:03:25.560> down<00:03:25.769> towers<00:03:26.160> as<00:03:26.340> fast

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
also no longer take down towers as fast

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.520 
also no longer take down towers as fast
as<00:03:26.790> she<00:03:26.910> could<00:03:27.090> before<00:03:27.480> with<00:03:27.630> her<00:03:27.780> cue<00:03:28.079> but

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
as she could before with her cue but

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.080 
as she could before with her cue but
that's<00:03:28.709> whatever<00:03:28.920> it's<00:03:29.280> not<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.430> big<00:03:29.670> deal<00:03:29.700> and

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
that's whatever it's not a big deal and

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.059 
that's whatever it's not a big deal and
so<00:03:30.660> was<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.840> nerf<00:03:31.079> honor<00:03:31.290> e<00:03:31.530> that's<00:03:31.769> not<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.920> big

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
so was a nerf honor e that's not a big

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.009 
so was a nerf honor e that's not a big
deal<00:03:32.130> either<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:32.910> yeah<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.360> still<00:03:33.780> think<00:03:33.959> she's

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
deal either so yeah I still think she's

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.229 
deal either so yeah I still think she's
really<00:03:34.470> good<00:03:34.739> despite<00:03:35.220> her<00:03:35.370> level<00:03:35.640> is<00:03:35.700> 125

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
really good despite her level is 125

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.970 
really good despite her level is 125
getting<00:03:36.569> nerfed<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.900> little<00:03:37.170> bit<00:03:37.349> I<00:03:37.590> say<00:03:37.950> that

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
getting nerfed a little bit I say that

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.520 
getting nerfed a little bit I say that
because<00:03:38.130> most<00:03:38.670> ashes<00:03:39.000> do<00:03:39.180> level<00:03:39.480> up<00:03:39.569> w<00:03:40.140> first

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
because most ashes do level up w first

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.130 
because most ashes do level up w first
so<00:03:40.890> yeah<00:03:41.340> people<00:03:41.819> max<00:03:42.030> no<00:03:42.150> q<00:03:42.420> second<00:03:42.840> if<00:03:43.079> you

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
so yeah people max no q second if you

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.479 
so yeah people max no q second if you
really<00:03:43.440> want<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.709> know<00:03:43.799> why<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:43.980> feel<00:03:44.370> like

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
she's number one is because she has a

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.110 
she's number one is because she has a
lot<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.530> damage<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.130> she<00:03:47.640> has<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.790> lot<00:03:48.090> of
