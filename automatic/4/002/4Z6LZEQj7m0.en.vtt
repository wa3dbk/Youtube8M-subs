00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
wanted to do something a little bit

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.520 
wanted to do something a little bit
different<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.390> what<00:00:38.600> I've<00:00:38.750> been<00:00:38.780> doing<00:00:39.200> is

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
basically I've been wearing different

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.270

patterns<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:50.660> that<00:00:50.690> my<00:00:51.020> two<00:00:51.079> hands<00:00:51.530> don't

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
patterns so that my two hands don't

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.459 
patterns so that my two hands don't
match<00:00:52.550> each<00:00:52.820> other<00:00:53.149> it's<00:00:53.690> not<00:00:53.960> for<00:00:54.230> everyone

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
match each other it's not for everyone

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.740

sort of diamond shape just four dots
clustered<00:03:42.949> together<00:03:44.859> obviously<00:03:46.209> if<00:03:47.209> you<00:03:47.329> use

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
clustered together obviously if you use

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.360 
clustered together obviously if you use
in<00:03:47.720> regular<00:03:48.139> polish<00:03:48.500> you'll<00:03:48.799> need<00:03:49.009> to<00:03:49.189> wait

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
in regular polish you'll need to wait

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.520 
in regular polish you'll need to wait
for<00:03:49.400> this<00:03:49.699> to<00:03:49.759> dry<00:03:49.909> and<00:03:50.449> if<00:03:51.109> you're<00:03:51.259> using

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
for this to dry and if you're using

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.189 
for this to dry and if you're using
shellac<00:03:52.009> at<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.759> end<00:03:52.909> of<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.239> petal<00:03:53.720> process

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
shellac at the end of the petal process

00:03:54.199 --> 00:04:16.240 
shellac at the end of the petal process
you<00:03:54.769> need<00:03:54.949> to<00:03:55.099> cure<00:03:55.280> for<00:03:55.549> two<00:03:55.699> minutes

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.340 

so<00:04:16.880> after<00:04:17.060> that's<00:04:17.390> cured<00:04:17.780> for<00:04:17.989> two<00:04:18.109> minutes

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
so after that's cured for two minutes

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.270 
so after that's cured for two minutes
take<00:04:18.920> a<00:04:18.950> blob<00:04:19.280> of<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.730> glitter<00:04:20.000> polish<00:04:20.480> and

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
take a blob of the glitter polish and

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.190 
take a blob of the glitter polish and
then<00:04:22.280> with<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.550> dotting<00:04:22.940> tool<00:04:23.120> again<00:04:23.450> just

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
then with the dotting tool again just

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.050 
then with the dotting tool again just
going<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.440> add<00:04:24.590> it<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.070> center<00:04:25.340> of<00:04:25.730> each

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
going to add it to the center of each

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:38.610 
going to add it to the center of each
cluster<00:04:27.050> of<00:04:27.290> petals

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.010 

as<00:04:38.830> this<00:04:39.550> is<00:04:39.610> polish<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.270> do<00:04:40.360> need<00:04:40.690> to<00:04:40.720> wait<00:04:40.990> for
