of alienating part of your audience but

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.670 
of alienating part of your audience but
here<00:00:20.240> we<00:00:20.330> go<00:00:20.359> if<00:00:20.869> there's<00:00:21.080> any<00:00:21.199> Talent<00:00:21.560> I've

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
here we go if there's any Talent I've

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.019 
here we go if there's any Talent I've
developed<00:00:21.919> a<00:00:22.130> mastery<00:00:22.490> of<00:00:22.580> over<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:22.880> years

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
developed a mastery of over the years

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.429 
developed a mastery of over the years
it's<00:00:23.179> saying<00:00:23.359> things<00:00:23.630> that<00:00:23.689> lose<00:00:23.929> me<00:00:24.109> friends

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
it's saying things that lose me friends

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:25.989

so first things first it might surprise
you<00:00:26.330> to<00:00:26.359> hear<00:00:26.660> this<00:00:26.839> but<00:00:27.289> there<00:00:27.410> are<00:00:27.439> some

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
you to hear this but there are some

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.050 
you to hear this but there are some
theories<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.310> right-wing<00:00:28.640> half<00:00:28.849> that<00:00:29.029> I

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
theories the right-wing half that I

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.019 
theories the right-wing half that I
actually<00:00:29.300> agree<00:00:29.810> with<00:00:29.990> what<00:00:30.499> the<00:00:30.949> fuck<00:00:31.579> I<00:00:31.880> know

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
actually agree with what the fuck I know

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.250 
actually agree with what the fuck I know
it<00:00:32.150> seems<00:00:32.360> strange<00:00:32.450> for<00:00:32.870> someone<00:00:33.110> with

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
it seems strange for someone with

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.050 
it seems strange for someone with
vaguely<00:00:33.530> Marxist<00:00:34.220> leanings<00:00:34.610> to<00:00:34.730> admit<00:00:34.940> that

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
vaguely Marxist leanings to admit that

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.880 
vaguely Marxist leanings to admit that
but<00:00:35.239> it's<00:00:35.360> true<00:00:35.630> I<00:00:36.020> happen<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.440> think<00:00:36.530> that<00:00:36.770> the

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
but it's true I happen to think that the

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.500 
but it's true I happen to think that the
welfare<00:00:37.250> state<00:00:37.340> does<00:00:37.730> in<00:00:37.880> some<00:00:38.120> cases

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
welfare state does in some cases

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.390 
welfare state does in some cases
actually<00:00:38.720> hold<00:00:39.200> people<00:00:39.650> in<00:00:39.860> an<00:00:39.980> unlivable

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
vortex of poverty and despair but that's

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.250 
vortex of poverty and despair but that's
where<00:00:43.220> we<00:00:43.370> stop<00:00:43.610> agreeing<00:00:43.970> see<00:00:44.330> for<00:00:44.540> me<00:00:44.720> I'd<00:00:45.020> be

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
where we stop agreeing see for me I'd be

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.840 
where we stop agreeing see for me I'd be

they actually mean is cheaply they mean

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.380 
they actually mean is cheaply they mean
smaller<00:01:28.159> budgets<00:01:28.579> they<00:01:28.789> mean<00:01:28.969> less<00:01:29.179> people

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
smaller budgets they mean less people

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.969 
smaller budgets they mean less people
