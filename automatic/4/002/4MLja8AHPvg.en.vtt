was the biggest name out that should

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.110 
was the biggest name out that should
have<00:03:41.109> been<00:03:41.139> there<00:03:41.379> that<00:03:42.250> is<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.579> youtuber

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
have been there that is the youtuber

have been there that is the youtuber
formerly<00:03:43.449> known<00:03:43.660> as<00:03:43.690> a<00:03:43.930> I<00:03:44.440> guess<00:03:45.040> most<00:03:45.310> people

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
formerly known as a I guess most people

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.080 
formerly known as a I guess most people
remember<00:03:45.730> his<00:03:46.090> rustling<00:03:46.569> merchandise<00:03:47.970> he<00:03:48.970> had

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
remember his rustling merchandise he had

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.699 
remember his rustling merchandise he had
a<00:03:49.120> few<00:03:49.389> different<00:03:49.599> accounts<00:03:50.379> and<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.530> few

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
a few different accounts and a few

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.110 
a few different accounts and a few
different<00:03:51.129> names<00:03:51.310> but<00:03:51.519> that<00:03:51.790> was<00:03:51.879> the<00:03:51.940> one<00:03:52.090> I

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
different names but that was the one I

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.420 
different names but that was the one I
think<00:03:52.239> most<00:03:52.569> people<00:03:52.930> would<00:03:53.109> remember<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.310> buy

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
think most people would remember and buy

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.119 
think most people would remember and buy
even<00:03:54.699> though<00:03:54.910> i<00:03:54.940> don't<00:03:55.150> think<00:03:55.299> most<00:03:55.449> people

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
even though i don't think most people

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.849 
even though i don't think most people
was<00:03:57.129> it<00:03:57.310> non<00:03:57.790> dickish<00:03:58.060> me<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.329> say<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.569> we<00:03:59.169> would

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
was it non dickish me to say it we would

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.650

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
want to remember him I guess maybe his

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.650

legacies<00:04:02.199> in<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.500> best<00:04:02.709> legacy<00:04:03.209> out<00:04:04.209> there

David I'm sure there'll be another name
here<00:04:27.460> there<00:04:27.730> we<00:04:28.480> don't<00:04:28.690> have<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:28.870> tag<00:04:29.170> team<00:04:29.350> or<00:04:29.560> a
