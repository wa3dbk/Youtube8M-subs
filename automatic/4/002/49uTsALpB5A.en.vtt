00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
smoke for it but then I decided i'll go

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.150 
smoke for it but then I decided i'll go
ahead<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.559> obtained<00:01:02.129> a

ahead and do it's just obtained a
triangle<00:01:03.059> three<00:01:03.809> lanes<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.500> that's<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.369> that

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
triangle three lanes and that's it that

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.090 
triangle three lanes and that's it that
is<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.479> no<00:01:06.780> that's<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.950> maybe

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
