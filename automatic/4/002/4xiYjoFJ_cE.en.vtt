you need to make sure and you take note

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.730 
you need to make sure and you take note
of<00:01:30.180> what<00:01:30.240> he's<00:01:30.659> selling<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.229> when<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.409> was<00:01:31.619> at

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
of what he's selling so when I was at

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.380 
of what he's selling so when I was at
bungie<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.280> looked<00:01:32.520> at<00:01:32.640> him<00:01:32.670> he<00:01:33.000> had<00:01:33.180> like

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
bungie and I looked at him he had like

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.179 
bungie and I looked at him he had like
gloves<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.020> something<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.439> can't<00:01:34.619> remember<00:01:34.829> I

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
gloves or something I can't remember I

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.160 
gloves or something I can't remember I
think<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:35.970> gloves<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.020> probably

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
think it was gloves this is probably

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.810 
think it was gloves this is probably
gonna<00:01:37.320> rotate<00:01:37.619> every<00:01:37.979> week<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.640> could<00:01:38.790> be

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
gonna rotate every week so it could be

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.030 
gonna rotate every week so it could be
random<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.840> when<00:01:39.990> house<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.380> wolves<00:01:40.500> drops<00:01:40.890> he

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
random so when house of wolves drops he

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.590 
random so when house of wolves drops he
could<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.579> chess<00:01:41.820> piece<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.360> make

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
could have the chess piece just make

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.300 
could have the chess piece just make
sure<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.840> take<00:01:43.049> note<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.710> because<00:01:44.130> what

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
sure you take note of this because what

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.590 
sure you take note of this because what
we're<00:01:44.399> gonna<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.579> doing<00:01:44.700> after<00:01:45.240> we've<00:01:45.390> seen

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
we're gonna be doing after we've seen

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300 
we're gonna be doing after we've seen
what<00:01:45.780> Luke<00:01:46.020> he<00:01:46.229> has<00:01:46.439> we're<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.250> be

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
what Luke he has we're going to be

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.730 
what Luke he has we're going to be
upgrading<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.240> piece<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.780> exotic<00:01:49.320> armor

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
upgrading one piece of exotic armor

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.770 
upgrading one piece of exotic armor
obviously<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> opposite<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.329> what<00:01:51.420> he<00:01:51.570> has

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
obviously do the opposite to what he has

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.780 
obviously do the opposite to what he has
so<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.170> he's<00:01:52.320> selling<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.710> chess<00:01:52.920> piece<00:01:53.130> don't

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
so if he's selling a chess piece don't

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.700 
so if he's selling a chess piece don't
upgrade<00:01:54.000> an<00:01:54.450> exotic<00:01:54.899> chess<00:01:55.200> piece<00:01:55.470> because

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
upgrade an exotic chess piece because

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.980 
upgrade an exotic chess piece because
that<00:01:55.829> would<00:01:55.950> be<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.579> waste<00:01:56.850> upgrade<00:01:57.780> like

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
that would be just a waste upgrade like

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.139 
that would be just a waste upgrade like
a<00:01:58.020> helmet<00:01:58.380> or<00:01:58.680> some<00:01:59.100> gloves<00:01:59.490> something<00:01:59.969> like

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
a helmet or some gloves something like

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.819 
a helmet or some gloves something like
that<00:02:00.329> I'm<00:02:00.570> probably<00:02:01.020> gonna<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.320> upgrading<00:02:01.740> a

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
that I'm probably gonna be upgrading a

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.440 
that I'm probably gonna be upgrading a
helmet<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.340> he's<00:02:02.490> selling<00:02:02.820> chess<00:02:03.030> piece<00:02:03.240> or

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
helmet if he's selling chess piece or

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.480 
helmet if he's selling chess piece or
gloves<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.229> do<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.680> that's<00:02:05.070> your<00:02:05.280> first

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
gloves so do that that's your first

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.980 
gloves so do that that's your first
piece<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.969> armor<00:02:06.270> done<00:02:06.420> as<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.930> you

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
don't need a thoroughly to upgrade

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.750 
don't need a thoroughly to upgrade
exacts<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.539> only<00:02:09.780> need<00:02:10.229> exotic<00:02:11.069> shards<00:02:11.580> which

exacts you only need exotic shards which
is<00:02:11.940> awesome<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.780> upgrade<00:02:13.140> destroy<00:02:13.530> ways

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
is awesome and it upgrade destroy ways

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.410 
is awesome and it upgrade destroy ways
you<00:02:13.920> don't<00:02:14.100> have<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.310> grind<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.790> out<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.300> the
