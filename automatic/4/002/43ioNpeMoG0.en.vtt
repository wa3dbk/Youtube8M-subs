Fett<00:01:12.830> let<00:01:13.830> me<00:01:13.920> show<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.430> back<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.810> I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
Fett let me show you the back and I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.950 
Fett let me show you the back and I
guess<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.189> brand<00:01:18.030> new<00:01:18.270> figure<00:01:18.720> so

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
guess this is a brand new figure so

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.990 
guess this is a brand new figure so
that's<00:01:19.170> why<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> back<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.040> says<00:01:20.220> first

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that's why on the back it says first

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.450 
that's why on the back it says first
