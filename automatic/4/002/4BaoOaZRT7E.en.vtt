00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.339
 if you go through the ice 8 or relatively long 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.960
 swim in cold water 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.210
 the core temperature is going to be your leader and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.349
 really searched down 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.389
 line fifteen minutes maximum then you have 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.980
 have you seen it and you can 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.470
 so even your death becomes normal 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.100
 your body functions x between 35 and 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.380
 37 38 degrees Celsius core temperature 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.539
 and if you fall below a certain limit then 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.760
 one may think less well than 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.040
 do you react differently than if you were slower and slower 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.510
 that is called king for the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.040
 processes of cooling that in it 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.760
 body scientifically 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.290
 to follow 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.540
 they have at the innosportlab 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.670
 an electronic pill and you put that one 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.100
 I as a guinea pig also start to swallow seed 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.840
 from this pill, they take metal 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.760
 It is important that you are short 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.079
 do not have an MRI in the long term because then one 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.370
 crazy things happen 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.989
 and then when that pill is taken 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.430
 have to wait half an hour and take pictures 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.210
 We can do this with this device 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.329
 read out temperatures 6x an easy one 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.640
 big cg too long in cold water and that is 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.589
 all my water is at 18 degrees celsius 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.780
 good way to get on the net of will 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.850
 come 9 after a degree jumped can that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.650
 cold to confusion we lead swimmers 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:17.670
 so also with skaters who go through the ice 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:21.960
 sometimes people get into water 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.400
 18 degrees had a lot warmer but that one 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.439
 sinner for a while around that 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.360
 could no longer answer question 3 after an hour 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.130
 plus 3 answer what is it 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.049
 outcome of three plus three hills 15 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.070
 min 8 15 min 8 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.100
 yes 15 min 8 i want to make sure that is 23 was 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.409
 added 15 min 8 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.030
 I play gris message 15 min 8 so that 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.259
 is also one of the method that can 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.030
 test whether someone actually 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.159
 supercooled is one of the simplest 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.110
 method where the three minutes in it 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.880
 freezing cold water and fall 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.570
 core temperature, I am the newspaper 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.689
 supercooled and a bit confused 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.100
 final conclusion is the very best for free 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.100
 by dropping the ice
