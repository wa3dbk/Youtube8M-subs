00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:07.630 
hi this is a video of how to help

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.300 
hi this is a video of how to help
students<00:00:08.109> learn<00:00:08.290> about<00:00:08.680> the<00:00:08.860> number<00:00:09.130> 9

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.310 
students learn about the number 9

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.669 
students learn about the number 9
particularly<00:00:10.180> with<00:00:10.510> multiplication<00:00:11.200> of<00:00:11.559> the

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:11.679 
particularly with multiplication of the

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.640 
particularly with multiplication of the
number<00:00:11.920> 9<00:00:12.070> so<00:00:12.700> here's<00:00:13.030> one<00:00:13.809> very<00:00:14.200> beginner

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
number 9 so here's one very beginner

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.820 
number 9 so here's one very beginner
trick<00:00:14.980> for<00:00:15.490> the<00:00:15.610> multiple<00:00:16.030> are<00:00:16.380> learning<00:00:17.380> the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
trick for the multiple are learning the

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.310 
trick for the multiple are learning the
nine<00:00:18.070> times<00:00:18.340> table<00:00:18.670> if<00:00:19.090> you<00:00:19.269> put<00:00:19.539> your<00:00:19.689> ten

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
nine times table if you put your ten

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.220 
nine times table if you put your ten
fingers<00:00:20.680> in<00:00:21.100> front<00:00:21.189> of<00:00:21.400> you<00:00:21.490> and<00:00:22.080> from<00:00:23.080> the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
fingers in front of you and from the

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.160 
fingers in front of you and from the
left<00:00:23.470> to<00:00:23.590> the<00:00:23.740> right<00:00:23.830> will<00:00:24.310> number<00:00:24.730> them<00:00:24.910> 1<00:00:25.119> 2<00:00:25.420> 3

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
left to the right will number them 1 2 3

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.599 
left to the right will number them 1 2 3
4<00:00:26.830> 5<00:00:27.400> 6<00:00:27.670> 7<00:00:28.240> 8<00:00:28.420> 9<00:00:28.630> 10<00:00:29.140> so<00:00:29.859> you're<00:00:30.039> ten<00:00:30.220> fingers<00:00:30.580> and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so you're ten fingers and

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.060 
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so you're ten fingers and
then<00:00:30.970> just<00:00:31.119> in<00:00:31.240> order<00:00:31.509> so<00:00:32.439> all<00:00:32.590> I<00:00:32.619> have<00:00:32.830> to<00:00:32.860> do

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
then just in order so all I have to do

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.549 
then just in order so all I have to do
is<00:00:33.280> a<00:00:33.820> close<00:00:34.480> certain<00:00:34.900> fingers<00:00:35.200> and<00:00:35.350> I<00:00:35.379> can

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
is a close certain fingers and I can

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.040 
is a close certain fingers and I can
figure<00:00:35.739> out<00:00:35.860> what<00:00:36.219> the<00:00:36.520> time<00:00:37.450> tables<00:00:37.870> are

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
figure out what the time tables are

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.270 
figure out what the time tables are
formed<00:00:38.469> in<00:00:38.530> number<00:00:39.219> nine<00:00:39.399> so<00:00:40.210> 1<00:00:40.629> times<00:00:40.960> 9<00:00:41.280> if

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
formed in number nine so 1 times 9 if

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.000 
formed in number nine so 1 times 9 if
it's<00:00:42.520> a<00:00:42.670> 1<00:00:43.090> times<00:00:43.390> 9<00:00:43.570> I<00:00:43.780> have<00:00:43.989> to<00:00:44.140> close<00:00:44.649> my

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
it's a 1 times 9 I have to close my

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.459 
it's a 1 times 9 I have to close my
first<00:00:45.399> finger<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:46.030> can<00:00:46.989> how<00:00:47.110> many<00:00:47.289> fingers

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
first finger and can how many fingers

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.830 
first finger and can how many fingers
that<00:00:47.860> i<00:00:47.890> left<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:48.460> there<00:00:48.610> nine<00:00:48.879> so<00:00:49.210> 1<00:00:49.390> times<00:00:49.600> 9

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
that i left and there nine so 1 times 9

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.000 
that i left and there nine so 1 times 9
is<00:00:50.110> 9<00:00:51.180> 2<00:00:52.180> times<00:00:52.510> that<00:00:52.719> I<00:00:52.930> close<00:00:53.260> my<00:00:53.440> second

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
is 9 2 times that I close my second

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.860 
is 9 2 times that I close my second
finger<00:00:54.160> we're<00:00:54.940> going<00:00:55.300> to<00:00:55.420> call<00:00:55.600> thumbs

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
finger we're going to call thumbs

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.979 
finger we're going to call thumbs
fingers<00:00:56.320> just<00:00:56.559> just<00:00:57.010> for<00:00:57.160> argument's<00:00:57.609> sake

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
fingers just just for argument's sake

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.090 
fingers just just for argument's sake
and<00:00:59.160> now<00:01:00.160> I've<00:01:00.489> got<00:01:01.120> one<00:01:02.079> finger<00:01:02.530> on<00:01:02.649> this<00:01:02.859> side

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
and now I've got one finger on this side

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.280 
and now I've got one finger on this side
and<00:01:03.309> then<00:01:03.730> eight<00:01:03.940> fingers<00:01:04.330> on<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.930> other<00:01:05.019> side

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
and then eight fingers on the other side

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.120 
and then eight fingers on the other side
so<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:07.090> one<00:01:07.300> represents<00:01:07.870> a<00:01:07.930> 10<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:08.380> then

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
so the one represents a 10 and then

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.090 
so the one represents a 10 and then
eight<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:09.700> just<00:01:10.150> represents<00:01:10.570> 8<00:01:10.720> so<00:01:11.050> 10<00:01:11.470> plus<00:01:11.680> 8

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
eight so just represents 8 so 10 plus 8

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.470 
eight so just represents 8 so 10 plus 8
is<00:01:12.250> 18<00:01:12.910> so<00:01:13.810> 2<00:01:14.290> times<00:01:14.650> 9<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:14.950> 18<00:01:15.310> this<00:01:15.940> works<00:01:16.180> for

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
is 18 so 2 times 9 is 18 this works for

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.300 
is 18 so 2 times 9 is 18 this works for
any<00:01:16.750> multiple<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.380> nine<00:01:18.010> up<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.370> 10<00:01:18.550> so<00:01:18.930> 3<00:01:20.310> so

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
any multiple of nine up to 10 so 3 so

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.060 
any multiple of nine up to 10 so 3 so
close<00:01:21.670> my<00:01:21.880> third<00:01:22.120> finger<00:01:22.330> 3<00:01:22.720> times<00:01:22.930> 9<00:01:23.140> there's

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
close my third finger 3 times 9 there's

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.040 
close my third finger 3 times 9 there's
two<00:01:24.250> fingers<00:01:24.640> on<00:01:24.670> this<00:01:24.910> side<00:01:25.180> so<00:01:25.390> that's<00:01:25.750> 20

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
two fingers on this side so that's 20

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.750 
two fingers on this side so that's 20
and<00:01:27.360> eke<00:01:28.360> out<00:01:28.540> another<00:01:28.600> one's<00:01:29.020> a<00:01:29.170> 7<00:01:29.530> so<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.430> two

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
and eke out another one's a 7 so the two

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.060 
and eke out another one's a 7 so the two
times<00:01:31.260> sorry<00:01:32.260> 3<00:01:32.650> times<00:01:32.860> 9<00:01:32.980> is<00:01:33.160> 27<00:01:33.400> same<00:01:34.120> with<00:01:34.360> 4

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
times sorry 3 times 9 is 27 same with 4

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.010 
times sorry 3 times 9 is 27 same with 4
30<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:37.420> I<00:01:37.450> got<00:01:37.690> 30<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:39.060> six<00:01:40.060> on<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.420> side<00:01:40.750> so

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
30 see I got 30 and six on the side so

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.900 
30 see I got 30 and six on the side so
36<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.650> this<00:01:41.890> will<00:01:42.010> work<00:01:42.100> all<00:01:42.370> the<00:01:42.490> way<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.610> 10

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
36 and this will work all the way to 10

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.030 
36 and this will work all the way to 10
so<00:01:43.150> with<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.960> number<00:01:44.200> 10<00:01:44.380> I'd<00:01:44.530> close<00:01:44.830> that

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
so with the number 10 I'd close that

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.200 
so with the number 10 I'd close that
finger<00:01:45.370> and<00:01:46.150> I<00:01:46.300> end<00:01:46.480> up<00:01:46.570> with<00:01:46.720> just<00:01:46.810> 90<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.970> I<00:01:49.150> do

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
finger and I end up with just 90 if I do

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.260 
finger and I end up with just 90 if I do
five<00:01:49.780> I<00:01:50.230> don't<00:01:50.890> know<00:01:50.980> with<00:01:51.160> 1<00:01:51.400> 2<00:01:51.640> 3<00:01:51.670> 4<00:01:53.130> 45<00:01:54.130> no<00:01:54.910> and

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
five I don't know with 1 2 3 4 45 no and

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.510 
five I don't know with 1 2 3 4 45 no and
54<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.110> it<00:01:56.230> will<00:01:56.710> always<00:01:56.950> work<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.460> this

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
54 and it will always work and this

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.090 
54 and it will always work and this

I've written some of the nine times
table<00:02:08.200> here<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:10.090> up<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.209> four<00:02:10.509> if<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.320> add<00:02:11.500> up

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
table here just up to four if I add up

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.850 
table here just up to four if I add up
the<00:02:11.920> individual<00:02:12.520> digits<00:02:12.880> of<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:14.440> multiples

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
the individual digits of the multiples

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.680 
the individual digits of the multiples
online<00:02:15.100> they<00:02:15.280> also<00:02:15.310> add<00:02:15.790> up<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.030> nine<00:02:16.210> so<00:02:16.510> if

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
online they also add up to nine so if

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.830 
online they also add up to nine so if
you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
you

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.119 
you
look<00:02:17.099> 1090<00:02:18.099> quiz<00:02:19.470> 92<00:02:20.470> times<00:02:20.709> 9<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:20.890> 18<00:02:21.160> 1<00:02:21.970> plus<00:02:22.360> 8

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
look 1090 quiz 92 times 9 is 18 1 plus 8

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:28.229 
look 1090 quiz 92 times 9 is 18 1 plus 8
would<00:02:24.129> equal<00:02:24.430> 9<00:02:25.140> 3<00:02:26.140> times<00:02:26.379> 9<00:02:26.560> 2<00:02:27.250> plus<00:02:27.700> 7<00:02:28.060> equals

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
would equal 9 3 times 9 2 plus 7 equals

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.030 
would equal 9 3 times 9 2 plus 7 equals
9<00:02:29.069> 4<00:02:30.069> times<00:02:30.310> 9<00:02:30.489> 3<00:02:31.330> plus<00:02:31.780> 6<00:02:32.050> would<00:02:32.620> equal<00:02:32.920> night

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
9 4 times 9 3 plus 6 would equal night

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.600 
9 4 times 9 3 plus 6 would equal night
and<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:33.640> works<00:02:33.879> for<00:02:34.120> all<00:02:34.299> multiples<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:34.900> 9

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
and this works for all multiples of 9

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.100 
and this works for all multiples of 9
except<00:02:36.610> for<00:02:36.849> very<00:02:37.150> large<00:02:37.420> numbers<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:37.870> if

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
except for very large numbers and if

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.800 
except for very large numbers and if
it's<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.349> very<00:02:38.590> large<00:02:38.799> number<00:02:39.269> this<00:02:40.269> nine<00:02:40.510> would

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
it's a very large number this nine would

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.150 
it's a very large number this nine would
just<00:02:41.019> change<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.349> an<00:02:41.470> eighteen<00:02:41.890> or<00:02:42.129> twenty

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
just change to an eighteen or twenty

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.720 
just change to an eighteen or twenty
seven<00:02:42.760> it'll<00:02:43.299> be<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.420> multiple<00:02:44.049> of<00:02:44.260> nine<00:02:44.730> and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
seven it'll be a multiple of nine and

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.729 
seven it'll be a multiple of nine and
this<00:02:45.970> works<00:02:46.239> only<00:02:46.780> with<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.200> number<00:02:47.410> night<00:02:47.620> in

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
this works only with a number night in

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.710 
this works only with a number night in
the<00:02:47.830> magic<00:02:48.069> member<00:02:48.280> night<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:48.910> what<00:02:49.540> can<00:02:49.660> you

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
the magic member night so what can you

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.650 
the magic member night so what can you
do<00:02:49.900> with<00:02:49.989> this<00:02:50.400> well<00:02:51.400> if<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.090> know<00:02:52.299> it's<00:02:52.480> going

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
do with this well if you know it's going

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.420 
do with this well if you know it's going
to<00:02:52.720> be<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:53.079> number<00:02:53.410> nine<00:02:53.620> what<00:02:53.829> you<00:02:53.920> can<00:02:54.069> do<00:02:54.220> is

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
to be a number nine what you can do is

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.830 
to be a number nine what you can do is
ask<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:56.160> trick<00:02:57.160> some<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.269> your<00:02:58.390> students<00:02:58.720> and

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
ask a trick some of your students and

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.150 
ask a trick some of your students and
say<00:02:59.190> give<00:03:00.190> me<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.340> number<00:03:00.610> between<00:03:01.110> 1<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.260> 12<00:03:02.440> or

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
say give me a number between 1 and 12 or

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.819 
say give me a number between 1 and 12 or
one<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.610> 10<00:03:03.760> ok<00:03:04.629> and<00:03:04.840> let's<00:03:04.930> say<00:03:05.200> they<00:03:05.379> say

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.670 

four<00:03:08.829> and<00:03:09.480> then<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.780> ask<00:03:10.900> them<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.290> multiply

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
four and then you ask them to multiply

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.390 
four and then you ask them to multiply
that<00:03:11.860> by<00:03:11.920> nine<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.510> get<00:03:13.629> 36<00:03:14.049> and<00:03:14.319> then<00:03:15.010> ask

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
that by nine so you get 36 and then ask

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.890 
that by nine so you get 36 and then ask
them<00:03:15.579> to<00:03:15.730> add<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.970> together<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.569> get<00:03:16.660> nine

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
them to add it together and you get nine

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.890 
them to add it together and you get nine
so<00:03:17.379> we<00:03:17.410> know<00:03:17.920> no<00:03:18.220> matter<00:03:18.400> what<00:03:18.670> they<00:03:18.910> do<00:03:19.360> is

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
so we know no matter what they do is

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.229 
so we know no matter what they do is
going<00:03:20.319> to<00:03:20.500> end<00:03:20.859> up<00:03:20.980> with<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.220> number<00:03:21.340> nine<00:03:21.639> so

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
going to end up with the number nine so

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.629 
going to end up with the number nine so
I<00:03:22.769> could<00:03:23.769> have<00:03:23.859> something<00:03:24.160> like<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.400> deck<00:03:24.609> of

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
I could have something like a deck of

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.520 
I could have something like a deck of
cards<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.209> could<00:03:25.389> count<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.870> ninth<00:03:26.109> card

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
cards and I could count the ninth card

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.500 
cards and I could count the ninth card
two<00:03:27.420> three<00:03:28.420> four<00:03:29.319> five<00:03:29.680> six<00:03:30.670> seven<00:03:31.660> eight<00:03:32.560> nine

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
two three four five six seven eight nine

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.379 
two three four five six seven eight nine
and<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:36.010> have<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.370> prediction<00:03:36.579> up<00:03:36.970> here<00:03:37.150> on<00:03:37.299> the

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
and I have a prediction up here on the

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.580 
and I have a prediction up here on the
whiteboard<00:03:37.709> six<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:38.859> clubs<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:41.260> course<00:03:41.470> it

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
whiteboard six of clubs and of course it

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.979 
whiteboard six of clubs and of course it
matches<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.790> all<00:03:42.970> how<00:03:43.209> did<00:03:43.359> I<00:03:43.450> do<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.599> all<00:03:43.930> I

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
matches and all how did I do that all I

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.610 
matches and all how did I do that all I
did<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.519> before<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.609> start<00:03:45.849> of<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.000> trick<00:03:46.269> I

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
did is a before the start of the trick I

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.000 
did is a before the start of the trick I
found<00:03:47.620> out<00:03:47.829> what<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.310> Ninth<00:03:48.819> card<00:03:49.209> was<00:03:49.419> and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
found out what the Ninth card was and

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.080 
found out what the Ninth card was and
then<00:03:51.010> I've<00:03:51.130> just<00:03:51.609> written<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:51.940> on<00:03:52.000> the

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
then I've just written a on the

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.800 
then I've just written a on the
whiteboard<00:03:52.239> all<00:03:52.959> right<00:03:53.549> because<00:03:54.630> that's<00:03:55.630> the

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
whiteboard all right because that's the

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.190 
whiteboard all right because that's the
ninth<00:03:56.019> cut<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:57.099> know<00:03:57.190> no<00:03:57.639> matter<00:03:58.200> what

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
ninth cut and I know no matter what

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.870 
ninth cut and I know no matter what
multiple<00:03:59.709> they<00:03:59.859> pick<00:04:00.069> of<00:04:00.190> nine<00:04:00.370> is<00:04:00.519> going<00:04:00.790> to

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
multiple they pick of nine is going to

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.550 
multiple they pick of nine is going to
end<00:04:01.000> up<00:04:01.120> with<00:04:01.180> nine<00:04:01.569> at<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.930> end<00:04:02.049> after<00:04:02.260> you

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
end up with nine at the end after you

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.830 
end up with nine at the end after you
add<00:04:02.709> up<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:03.010> individual<00:04:03.549> digits<00:04:03.840> I'm

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
add up the individual digits I'm

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.809 
add up the individual digits I'm
basically<00:04:05.230> forcing<00:04:05.829> them<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:05.980> pick<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.609> ninth

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
basically forcing them to pick the ninth

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.400 
basically forcing them to pick the ninth
card<00:04:07.090> from<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.269> top<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:08.049> can<00:04:08.079> do<00:04:08.260> the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
card from the top and you can do the

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.129 
card from the top and you can do the
same<00:04:08.440> thing<00:04:08.859> with<00:04:09.340> a<00:04:09.790> word<00:04:10.389> from<00:04:10.599> a<00:04:10.780> book<00:04:10.989> a

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
same thing with a word from a book a

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.650 
same thing with a word from a book a
sentence<00:04:11.590> from<00:04:11.680> paragraph<00:04:12.340> a<00:04:12.819> word<00:04:13.389> from<00:04:13.540> a

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
sentence from paragraph a word from a
