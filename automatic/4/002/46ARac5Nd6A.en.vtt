00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.700
 let's see a bit of the thread of the fabric 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.330
 the thread of the fabric in a pattern is 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.110
 represents with this arrow 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.930
 here we have the edge of the cloth 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.340
 this shore in the fabrics that went through 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.820
 fabrics tells us that this is the thread of 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.570
 the fabric and therefore this pattern should 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.700
 coincide with it and when we place the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.390
 pattern on the web is not simply 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.100
 place it and suppose it's okay 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.040
 we need to check with a tape 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.250
 metric that one of the edges is 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.550
 find the same distance as the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.550
 other 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.180
 and good since we are well 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.019
 how to place it with respect to the thread of 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.809
 the fabric here I have a fabric that is not 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:02.879
 symmetric up and down in this case not 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.879
 we could place the patterns 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.979
 either like this or so 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.700
 both patterns the right and the left 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.369
 they must be placed in the same 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.180
 meaning this is because if not one 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.520
 would stay with the colors like this and another 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.229
 would stay with the colors so which does not 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.380
 is what we want at the moment of joining 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.380
 the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.350
 in the fabric when the loom is 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.280
 and stops her 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.320
 here by the way this what is the shore 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.650
 of the fabric should not be used in 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.620
 no garment since it has a fall 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.220
 different from the rest 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.350
 when the fabric is on the loom 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.909
 have all the threads here 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:59.579
 and go through some and 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.579
 this is the warp and this is the plot 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.140
 we need to put the garments also in 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:10.739
 this position because the fabric is not 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.340
 deforms and on this side if indeed in 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.849
 This fabric tends to be more elastic 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.470
 the plot that the warp but not nothing 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.150
 more in this here I have a fabric of 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.819
 cotton 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.310
 this is the thread of the cloth and you will see that 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:31.680
 do not stretch here the fabric if stretched 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.860
 a little despite not being a fabric 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.860
 elastic 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.780
 on this side of the button remove some 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.180
 centuries to read the thread of the fabric that 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.329
 comes here and the next plot 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.329
 here 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:53.610
 when you see it up close here it 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:56.850
 they get to see how it's like wavy 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.820
 and the threads that cross it and these 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.610
 threads are completely straight when 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.260
 make a garment remember the thread of 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.720
 the fabric because if you do not respect it 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.379
 is going to be able to form if 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:17.710
 so we used the fabric would have a 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:21.540
 very rare fall and would tend to deform 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.540
 thank you and have a very good day
