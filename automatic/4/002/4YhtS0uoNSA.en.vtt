00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
surprised we're doing pretty well on

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.840 
surprised we're doing pretty well on
this<00:03:48.260> one<00:03:48.500> most<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:49.160> time<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.460> takes<00:03:49.550> an<00:03:49.790> hour

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
this one most the time it takes an hour

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.070 
this one most the time it takes an hour
to<00:03:50.000> clear<00:03:50.270> level<00:03:50.600> and<00:03:50.690> we're<00:03:50.780> getting<00:03:50.870> pretty

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
to clear level and we're getting pretty

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.890 
to clear level and we're getting pretty
close<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.500> then<00:03:51.620> it's<00:03:51.890> only<00:03:52.040> like<00:03:52.190> 40<00:03:52.520> minutes

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
close to then it's only like 40 minutes

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.600 
close to then it's only like 40 minutes
which<00:03:53.900> admittedly<00:03:54.260> isn't<00:03:54.710> really<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.430> best

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
which admittedly isn't really the best

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:04.500 
which admittedly isn't really the best
overall<00:03:55.790> but<00:03:59.350> I<00:04:00.880> just<00:04:01.880> wanted<00:04:02.120> your<00:04:02.240> hammer

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
overall but I just wanted your hammer

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.360 
overall but I just wanted your hammer
actually<00:04:05.510> late<00:04:05.900> here<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:06.830> take<00:04:06.980> this<00:04:07.130> knife

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
actually late here you take this knife

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.980 
actually late here you take this knife
or<00:04:07.520> since<00:04:07.670> you<00:04:07.790> know<00:04:07.940> how<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.120> use<00:04:08.330> it<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:10.990> I'll

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
or since you know how to use it and I'll

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.080 
or since you know how to use it and I'll
go<00:04:12.170> up<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.560> rampage<00:04:13.160> at<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.550> hammer<00:04:13.820> because

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
go up and rampage at the hammer because

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.360 
go up and rampage at the hammer because
I'm<00:04:14.390> sort<00:04:14.870> of<00:04:14.990> okay<00:04:15.380> at<00:04:15.530> using<00:04:15.740> a<00:04:16.010> hammer<00:04:16.190> I

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
I'm sort of okay at using a hammer I

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.710 
I'm sort of okay at using a hammer I
guess<00:04:18.820> although<00:04:19.820> this<00:04:20.030> is<00:04:20.239> really<00:04:20.390> not<00:04:20.570> the

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
guess although this is really not the

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.200 
guess although this is really not the
best<00:04:20.750> hammer<00:04:21.110> opportunity

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
best hammer opportunity

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.279 
best hammer opportunity
although<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.330> worked<00:04:24.539> out<00:04:24.780> better<00:04:24.990> than<00:04:25.110> I<00:04:25.199> was

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
although it worked out better than I was

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.710 
although it worked out better than I was
expecting<00:04:28.729> I've<00:04:29.729> like<00:04:30.090> there<00:04:30.360> were<00:04:30.449> three

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
expecting I've like there were three

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.080 
expecting I've like there were three
shots<00:04:30.990> left<00:04:31.229> or<00:04:31.409> something<00:04:31.740> right<00:04:31.860> there<00:04:32.129> what

just going to kamikaze because that's

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.629 
just going to kamikaze because that's
probably<00:04:59.099> the<00:04:59.250> best<00:04:59.340> strategy<00:04:59.610> at<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.090> point

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
probably the best strategy at this point

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:08.300 
probably the best strategy at this point
oh<00:05:04.460> hey<00:05:05.460> we're<00:05:06.020> clear<00:05:07.020> to<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.830> last<00:05:08.039> part

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
oh hey we're clear to the last part

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.070 
oh hey we're clear to the last part
which<00:05:08.580> i<00:05:08.699> remember<00:05:09.030> being<00:05:09.270> really<00:05:09.360> hard<00:05:09.960> when

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
which i remember being really hard when

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.939 
which i remember being really hard when
i<00:05:10.169> was<00:05:10.319> like<00:05:10.500> doing<00:05:10.770> heroic<00:05:11.400> on<00:05:11.550> my<00:05:11.729> own

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
i was like doing heroic on my own

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:14.809 
i was like doing heroic on my own
actually<00:05:13.949> it's<00:05:14.039> more<00:05:14.310> hard<00:05:14.580> when<00:05:14.729> you<00:05:14.789> don't

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:14.819 
actually it's more hard when you don't

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.279 
actually it's more hard when you don't
have<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.150> buddy

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.320 

I<00:05:18.379> think<00:05:19.039> tsavo<00:05:19.339> highway<00:05:19.819> is<00:05:19.879> actually<00:05:20.300> a

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
I think tsavo highway is actually a

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.269 
I think tsavo highway is actually a
decent<00:05:20.479> bit<00:05:20.719> harder<00:05:21.050> than<00:05:21.110> this<00:05:21.379> what<00:05:21.949> ships

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:22.279 
decent bit harder than this what ships

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:26.139 
decent bit harder than this what ships
are<00:05:22.460> closing<00:05:22.639> fast<00:05:23.979> gone<00:05:24.979> I'm<00:05:25.550> still<00:05:26.029> a<00:05:26.059> bit

are closing fast gone I'm still a bit

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:31.980 
are closing fast gone I'm still a bit
anxious<00:05:26.539> about<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.469> whole<00:05:27.710> blood<00:05:28.669> level

uh-huh<00:05:32.990> although<00:05:33.409> really<00:05:33.830> that<00:05:33.979> shouldn't<00:05:34.369> be

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
uh-huh although really that shouldn't be

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.179 
uh-huh although really that shouldn't be
as<00:05:34.550> bad<00:05:34.789> as<00:05:35.029> the<00:05:35.240> actual<00:05:35.659> flood<00:05:36.080> level<00:05:36.499> towards

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:37.189 
as bad as the actual flood level towards
