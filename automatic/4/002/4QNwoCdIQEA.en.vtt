I'm<00:00:12.650> working<00:00:13.040> on<00:00:13.129> a<00:00:13.190> spindle<00:00:13.730> for<00:00:13.969> a<00:00:14.000> chair<00:00:14.389> so

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
I'm working on a spindle for a chair so

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.089 
I'm working on a spindle for a chair so
what's<00:00:15.019> going<00:00:15.200> to<00:00:15.230> happen<00:00:15.290> when<00:00:15.679> this<00:00:15.769> is<00:00:15.950> all

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
what's going to happen when this is all

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.010 
what's going to happen when this is all
done<00:00:16.130> I've<00:00:16.849> got<00:00:16.880> to<00:00:17.150> have<00:00:17.240> a<00:00:17.270> ten<00:00:17.599> and<00:00:17.779> on<00:00:17.869> each

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
done I've got to have a ten and on each

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.200 
done I've got to have a ten and on each
end<00:00:18.349> that<00:00:18.439> perfectly<00:00:19.220> mates<00:00:19.490> into<00:00:19.849> a<00:00:19.880> hole<00:00:20.180> I

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
end that perfectly mates into a hole I

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.730 
end that perfectly mates into a hole I
drill<00:00:20.660> in<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:20.900> chair<00:00:21.110> itself

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
drill in the chair itself

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.109 
drill in the chair itself
why<00:00:22.040> don't<00:00:22.189> make<00:00:22.310> sure<00:00:22.460> I<00:00:22.520> have<00:00:22.669> a<00:00:22.700> good<00:00:22.790> fit

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
why don't make sure I have a good fit

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.900 
why don't make sure I have a good fit
chairs<00:00:23.480> take<00:00:23.689> a<00:00:23.720> lot<00:00:23.960> of<00:00:23.990> abuse<00:00:24.170> so<00:00:25.100> I<00:00:25.460> need<00:00:25.820> to

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
chairs take a lot of abuse so I need to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.700 
chairs take a lot of abuse so I need to
make<00:00:26.060> sure<00:00:26.090> that<00:00:26.539> when<00:00:26.660> I<00:00:26.689> turn<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:27.260> tenon<00:00:27.619> on

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
make sure that when I turn the tenon on

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.230 
make sure that when I turn the tenon on
the<00:00:27.769> end<00:00:27.890> of<00:00:28.130> this<00:00:28.250> it's<00:00:28.519> going<00:00:28.609> to<00:00:28.730> perfectly

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
the end of this it's going to perfectly

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.420 
the end of this it's going to perfectly
match<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:29.750> hole<00:00:29.960> I<00:00:30.289> drill<00:00:30.859> in<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.099> leg<00:00:31.250> of<00:00:31.369> the

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
match the hole I drill in the leg of the

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.939 
match the hole I drill in the leg of the
chair<00:00:31.670> one<00:00:32.390> way<00:00:32.540> I<00:00:32.570> could<00:00:32.720> do<00:00:32.930> that<00:00:33.080> would<00:00:33.769> be

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
chair one way I could do that would be

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.540 
chair one way I could do that would be
using<00:00:34.550> my<00:00:34.699> parting<00:00:35.120> tool<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:35.629> my<00:00:36.620> calipers<00:00:37.250> I

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
using my parting tool and my calipers I

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.729 
using my parting tool and my calipers I
can<00:00:38.000> set<00:00:38.269> the<00:00:38.390> calipers<00:00:38.839> to<00:00:38.960> that<00:00:39.110> diameter

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
can set the calipers to that diameter

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.910 
can set the calipers to that diameter
carefully<00:00:40.610> test<00:00:40.909> as<00:00:41.120> I<00:00:41.269> go<00:00:41.650> I'm<00:00:42.650> going<00:00:42.860> to

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
carefully test as I go I'm going to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.500 
carefully test as I go I'm going to
demand<00:00:43.040> a<00:00:43.309> little<00:00:43.519> bit<00:00:43.640> more<00:00:43.790> accuracy<00:00:44.269> on

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
demand a little bit more accuracy on

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.969 
demand a little bit more accuracy on
this<00:00:44.720> I<00:00:44.839> want<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.049> make<00:00:45.110> sure<00:00:45.260> I<00:00:45.409> have<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.650> great

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:45.979 
this I want to make sure I have a great

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.219 
this I want to make sure I have a great
fit<00:00:46.280> so<00:00:46.909> the<00:00:47.330> way<00:00:47.449> I'm<00:00:47.570> going<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:47.750> do<00:00:47.900> it<00:00:48.049> is

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:48.229 
fit so the way I'm going to do it is

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.860 
fit so the way I'm going to do it is
using<00:00:49.129> this<00:00:49.250> block<00:00:49.549> wood<00:00:49.879> what<00:00:50.510> I've<00:00:50.659> done

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
using this block wood what I've done

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.560 
using this block wood what I've done
here<00:00:51.140> is<00:00:51.320> took<00:00:51.680> a<00:00:51.769> full<00:00:51.979> size<00:00:52.220> block<00:00:52.570> drilled

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
here is took a full size block drilled

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.020 
here is took a full size block drilled
into<00:00:53.809> it<00:00:53.930> a<00:00:54.140> one-inch<00:00:54.530> hole<00:00:54.739> then<00:00:55.580> I<00:00:55.699> cut<00:00:55.909> the

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
into it a one-inch hole then I cut the

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.930 
into it a one-inch hole then I cut the
block<00:00:56.239> in<00:00:56.479> half<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.559> now<00:00:57.830> I've<00:00:58.250> got<00:00:58.519> kind<00:00:58.729> of<00:00:58.850> a

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
block in half so now I've got kind of a

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.390 
block in half so now I've got kind of a
go/no-go<00:00:59.449> gage<00:00:59.960> for<00:01:00.650> my<00:01:00.769> tenon<00:01:01.190> that<00:01:01.220> I'm

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
go/no-go gage for my tenon that I'm

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.520 
go/no-go gage for my tenon that I'm
working<00:01:01.610> on<00:01:01.909> here<00:01:02.360> I've<00:01:02.780> labeled<00:01:03.260> it<00:01:03.379> as

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
working on here I've labeled it as

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.200 
working on here I've labeled it as
one-inch<00:01:04.190> so<00:01:04.549> when<00:01:04.670> I<00:01:04.729> use<00:01:04.879> it<00:01:05.030> for<00:01:05.119> other

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
one-inch so when I use it for other

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.850 
one-inch so when I use it for other
projects<00:01:05.780> I<00:01:05.869> already<00:01:06.080> know<00:01:06.170> what<00:01:06.320> size<00:01:06.530> it<00:01:06.770> is

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
projects I already know what size it is

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.609 
projects I already know what size it is
the<00:01:07.100> way<00:01:07.580> I'll<00:01:07.700> use<00:01:07.850> it<00:01:08.060> here<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.540> make<00:01:09.290> cuts

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
the way I'll use it here is make cuts

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.400 
the way I'll use it here is make cuts
test<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.700> fit<00:01:10.910> make<00:01:11.300> cuts<00:01:11.630> test<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.200> fit

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
test the fit make cuts test the fit

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.190 
test the fit make cuts test the fit
until<00:01:13.040> I<00:01:13.190> get<00:01:13.370> this<00:01:13.670> diameter<00:01:14.090> on<00:01:14.510> my<00:01:14.870> spindle

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
until I get this diameter on my spindle

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.830 
until I get this diameter on my spindle
down<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:15.740> point<00:01:16.040> where<00:01:16.670> this<00:01:16.910> perfectly

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
down to a point where this perfectly

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.840 
down to a point where this perfectly
straddles<00:01:18.440> that<00:01:18.590> material<00:01:19.130> here's<00:01:19.610> how<00:01:19.760> it

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
straddles that material here's how it

00:01:19.850 --> 00:02:32.880 
straddles that material here's how it
works

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.640 

that's<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.099> perfect<00:02:34.400> fit<00:02:34.939> I<00:02:35.239> know<00:02:35.569> that<00:02:36.379> that

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
that's the perfect fit I know that that

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.319 
that's the perfect fit I know that that
end<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.220> going<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.400> go<00:02:37.489> right<00:02:37.879> into<00:02:38.090> the

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
end is going to go right into the

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.030 
end is going to go right into the
one-inch<00:02:38.659> hole<00:02:38.840> I'm<00:02:39.110> gonna<00:02:39.349> drill<00:02:39.650> on<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.860> leg

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
one-inch hole I'm gonna drill on the leg

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.920 
one-inch hole I'm gonna drill on the leg
it's<00:02:40.640> going<00:02:40.849> to<00:02:40.909> be<00:02:41.000> very<00:02:41.180> very<00:02:41.420> strong

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
it's going to be very very strong

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.149 
it's going to be very very strong
because<00:02:42.110> I'm<00:02:42.290> going<00:02:42.409> to<00:02:42.470> have<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.590> great<00:02:42.829> mate

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
because I'm going to have a great mate

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.640 
because I'm going to have a great mate
between<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.790> tenon<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.599> hole<00:02:44.780> remember

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
between the tenon and the hole remember

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.589 
between the tenon and the hole remember
as<00:02:45.769> you're<00:02:45.920> dialing<00:02:46.340> into<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:46.760> final<00:02:47.269> final

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
size that when you cut you're taking off

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.420 
size that when you cut you're taking off
twice<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.439> amount<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.739> wood<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:52.040> might<00:02:52.189> think

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
twice the amount of wood you might think

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.160 
twice the amount of wood you might think
you<00:02:52.549> are<00:02:52.579> in<00:02:52.790> other<00:02:52.879> words<00:02:53.120> if<00:02:53.720> I'm<00:02:53.870> peeling

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
you are in other words if I'm peeling

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.610 
you are in other words if I'm peeling
off<00:02:54.500> 1/32<00:02:55.489> from<00:02:55.879> this<00:02:56.090> side<00:02:56.390> I'm<00:02:57.019> affecting

off 1/32 from this side I'm affecting

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.470 
off 1/32 from this side I'm affecting
the<00:02:57.709> overall<00:02:57.829> diameter<00:02:58.310> by<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.760> sixteenth<00:02:59.329> of
