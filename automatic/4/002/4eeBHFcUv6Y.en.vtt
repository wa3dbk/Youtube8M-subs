00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.790
 it is winter 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.790
 so there is also the traveling again 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.260
 jacket is the process by which we make the 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.570
 planes just before take-off 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.690
 of some winter contamination and then 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.390
 you should think of ice snow hail 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.910
 everything that disturbed the wing profile 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.380
 we pick up from the plane so that and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.380
 the safe tea cup is guaranteed 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.880
 we meet those requirements with fluid that fluid 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.460
 it is made 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.870
 that is a liquid with greeks in which 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.440
 and we mix that with hot water 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.940
 it is so between 65 and 75 degrees and wet 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.870
 we spray on the wings and on the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.150
 tail of the plane 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.030
 that causes the ice and snow 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.740
 melts and at the same time protects 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.410
 greeks in the fluid the plane 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.840
 against he freezing 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.580
 you do that ayse when it's cold but 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.750
 does not apply to every cold weather type 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.520
 the same 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.350
 so it may be that with plus 2 degrees 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.990
 and wet snow does become that list 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.390
 but at a minus of 10 degrees and clear 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.770
 don't breathe at minus 10 think a lot 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.510
 people that we are very busy we 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.820
 if you have a roller the east wind with 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.510
 mint the air is very dry and then 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.510
 we are not busy 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.380
 You would think that those claimants and long 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.250
 have summer vacation but that is not 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.050
 true 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.000
 in the summer we are fully engaged with 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.430
 training is all our operators and 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.320
 iceman are trained in the summer so that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.560
 we are ready for on 1 October 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.910
 the winter weather by at the ice I can 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.950
 it is that a plane needs a moment 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.080
 wait before it can leave because 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.090
 with snow or ice on the wings 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.930
 a plane not in the air 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.930
 safety before everything
