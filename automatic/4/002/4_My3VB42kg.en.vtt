00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.279 
obviously some redstone right next to
that<00:00:47.460> piston<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.089> redstone<00:00:48.449> repeater<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
that piston with a redstone repeater and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.729 
that piston with a redstone repeater and
redstone<00:00:49.499> attached<00:00:50.339> to<00:00:50.729> a<00:00:50.760> button<00:00:51.710> which<00:00:52.710> is

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
redstone attached to a button which is

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:02.660 
redstone attached to a button which is
right<00:00:53.010> here

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.980
