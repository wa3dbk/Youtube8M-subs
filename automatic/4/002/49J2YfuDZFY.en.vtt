 interesting video review and how you already 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.050
 you see we have such cool models 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.269
 are on our review table and 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.460
 today we talk about them but it is not 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.430
 just toys are not just cars 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.300
 and even this is not just decorative models 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.680
 this 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.670
 typewriters with music features 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.190
 radio with alarm function is ours what 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.370
 we are with you now and see is called 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:55.110
 they are a mini-speaker, well, let's see 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:57.800
 on the example of this model in the form of audi 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.960
 we'll see what they can do 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.660
 but in principle in appearance they are here 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.250
 different there are white and red colors yellow 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.570
 blue black 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.320
 here and even different brands I think lovers 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.049
 machines already choose yourself what you 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.570
 more like their wheels here 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.740
 spinning like real toys 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.280
 thats all we see on but let's get to 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.580
 functions 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.820
 they are suitable here we have the remote control 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.869
 on the trunk is in principle at all 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.060
 typewriters same thing here we have 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.450
 button 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.960
 the network, that is, the inclusion of the column and 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.530
 also play pause here here to the left of us 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.460
 button m this menu using the menu we 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.729
 we can choose different functions in our 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.820
 column and two keys they are responsible for 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:01.920
 turning the channels on the radio and either 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:07.110
 tracks like this here below we see 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.630
 three interfaces here is left here for us 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.099
 micro sd card later 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.670
 and yusbi goes on to enter us 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.890
 responsible for connecting the cable in order 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.569
 so that the car can be charged 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.270
 or rather a column here with us 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.209
 the battery is worth it you see and also 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.360
 here we are the dynamics here and he answers for 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.340
 to charge and connect it to 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.190
 external sources to his 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.410
 use as external column for those 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.780
 same smartphones phones and others 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.600
 turntables but what let's turn on 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:49.260
 let's see what we have to do 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:52.230
 press the button i think you heard 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.239
 how impressive are the bases and low 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.810
 frequencies 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:01.110
 This column issued here and I really 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.450
 I got so much pleasure that she 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.950
 it didn't just rattle there as usual 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:11.370
 produce substandard speakers that's what 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.680
 we are here let's look through but if we 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.840
 here we will leaf through what we see here 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.709
 the alarm clock is blinking now and I donâ€™t know 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.200
 on camera you can see or not further from us 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.709
 turn on off so the clock on the menu 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.709
 push 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.909
 soul song every morning on the road 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.909
 radio 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.189
 which is very convenient and we are on the rear window 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.290
 up in the typewriter we see the menu using 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:50.079
 which we can manage given 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.030
 column here shows how we 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.689
 is controlled by the volume using here 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.810
 these keys 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:59.489
 so I pressed it less volume down here 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.489
 press it over the volume more 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.470
 last sew sure 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.470
 but 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.039
 here you see we have lights 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:31.050
 well so for beauty i think it is very 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:33.930
 looks interesting let's try 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:39.659
 we now put sd cards into it 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:42.199
 how it is played sd cards here we are 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:46.729
 turned on the card she already plays 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.729
 let's see how the sound is made from it 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:26.289
 but actually the sound is very cool on 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:31.270
 really 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:35.270
 basses have these speakers they just give out 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:39.110
 great bass great sound of course u 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:43.550
 them function such that it goes down I go there 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.379
 there is a reflection of sound but even this 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.300
 enough just to 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:50.689
 get good enjoyment from 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.330
 listening music therefore we will be happy
