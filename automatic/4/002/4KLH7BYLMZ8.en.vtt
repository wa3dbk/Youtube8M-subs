00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:05.509 
I think vulture has always had a unique

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.369 
I think vulture has always had a unique
approach<00:00:06.319> to<00:00:06.740> producing<00:00:07.310> tractors<00:00:08.379> the

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:09.379 
approach to producing tractors the

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:11.200 
approach to producing tractors the
Scandinavian<00:00:10.100> roots<00:00:10.340> they're<00:00:10.700> very<00:00:10.879> arduous

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
Scandinavian roots they're very arduous

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.419 
Scandinavian roots they're very arduous
conditions<00:00:11.420> very<00:00:12.290> strong<00:00:12.620> forestry<00:00:13.219> roots

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
conditions very strong forestry roots

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.179 
conditions very strong forestry roots
very<00:00:14.150> strong<00:00:14.509> tradition<00:00:15.200> with<00:00:15.440> livestock

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
very strong tradition with livestock

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.090 
very strong tradition with livestock
farming<00:00:16.820> initially<00:00:17.779> but<00:00:18.349> also<00:00:18.500> a<00:00:18.680> very<00:00:18.919> strong

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
farming initially but also a very strong

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.870 
farming initially but also a very strong
export<00:00:19.760> business<00:00:20.720> so<00:00:21.560> they<00:00:22.220> have<00:00:22.400> to<00:00:22.550> look<00:00:22.730> at

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
export business so they have to look at

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.120 
export business so they have to look at
all<00:00:23.000> the<00:00:23.119> solutions<00:00:23.630> so<00:00:23.960> the<00:00:24.800> best<00:00:25.010> way

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
all the solutions so the best way

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.609 
all the solutions so the best way
they've<00:00:25.279> done<00:00:25.310> this<00:00:25.609> is<00:00:25.960> nearly<00:00:26.960> 20<00:00:27.199> years<00:00:27.320> ago

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
they've done this is nearly 20 years ago

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.040 
they've done this is nearly 20 years ago
they<00:00:27.890> came<00:00:28.039> up<00:00:28.220> with<00:00:28.490> basically<00:00:29.480> a<00:00:29.720> custom

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
they came up with basically a custom

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.920 
they came up with basically a custom
build<00:00:30.260> system<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:30.800> this<00:00:31.550> allows<00:00:31.880> them<00:00:32.269> to<00:00:32.570> to

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
build system and this allows them to to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.509 
build system and this allows them to to
look<00:00:33.080> at<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.379> individual<00:00:33.800> requirements<00:00:34.400> the

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
look at the individual requirements the

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.369 
look at the individual requirements the
markets<00:00:35.030> where<00:00:35.330> the<00:00:35.570> where<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.960> tractors<00:00:36.290> are

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
markets where the where the tractors are

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.860 
markets where the where the tractors are
going<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:36.559> work<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.120> almost<00:00:38.120> make<00:00:38.449> bespoke

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
going to work and almost make bespoke

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.469 
going to work and almost make bespoke
tractors<00:00:39.409> for<00:00:39.799> those<00:00:39.920> customers<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:41.059> then

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:41.479 
tractors for those customers and then

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.899 
tractors for those customers and then
you<00:00:42.320> know<00:00:42.409> that<00:00:42.589> the<00:00:42.769> system<00:00:43.159> is<00:00:43.489> now<00:00:43.640> grown

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:43.909 
you know that the system is now grown

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:45.820 
you know that the system is now grown
and<00:00:43.940> grown<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:44.269> grown<00:00:44.449> and<00:00:44.629> even<00:00:45.530> down<00:00:45.680> to<00:00:45.710> the

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
and grown and grown and even down to the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.350 
and grown and grown and even down to the
choice<00:00:46.070> of<00:00:46.250> colors<00:00:46.519> you<00:00:46.549> know<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:46.940> customer

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
choice of colors you know the customer

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.140 
choice of colors you know the customer
can<00:00:47.540> look<00:00:47.809> exactly<00:00:48.559> what<00:00:48.710> he<00:00:48.890> wants<00:00:49.159> to<00:00:50.000> have

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
can look exactly what he wants to have

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.539 
can look exactly what he wants to have
from<00:00:50.330> a<00:00:50.390> tractor<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.350> I<00:00:51.470> think<00:00:51.799> that<00:00:52.040> if<00:00:52.280> you

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:52.549 
from a tractor and I think that if you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.369 
from a tractor and I think that if you
had<00:00:52.699> to<00:00:52.850> ask<00:00:52.970> me<00:00:53.180> just<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.479> one<00:00:53.659> one<00:00:54.140> thing

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
had to ask me just the one one thing

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.109 
had to ask me just the one one thing
what<00:00:54.559> makes<00:00:54.739> Voucher<00:00:55.339> different<00:00:55.699> you<00:00:55.970> know

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:56.119 
what makes Voucher different you know

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.539 
what makes Voucher different you know
that<00:00:56.299> it<00:00:56.629> is<00:00:56.809> this<00:00:56.930> custom<00:00:57.350> build<00:00:57.559> a<00:00:57.769> la<00:00:57.979> carte

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
that it is this custom build a la carte

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.660 
that it is this custom build a la carte
I<00:00:58.690> found<00:00:59.690> that<00:00:59.780> absolutely<00:01:00.170> superb<00:01:00.650> I<00:01:01.070> think

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
I found that absolutely superb I think

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.759 
I found that absolutely superb I think
that<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:02.420> know<00:01:02.540> you<00:01:02.600> get<00:01:02.809> a<00:01:02.839> very<00:01:03.350> very<00:01:03.589> good

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
that you know you get a very very good

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.109 
that you know you get a very very good
level<00:01:04.070> of<00:01:04.129> spec<00:01:04.460> you're<00:01:04.670> not<00:01:04.790> paying<00:01:05.030> for

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
level of spec you're not paying for

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.150 
level of spec you're not paying for
things<00:01:05.330> that<00:01:05.659> that<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.409> really<00:01:06.439> don't<00:01:06.890> want

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
things that that you really don't want

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.490

we make the tractors it's a relationship
with<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.130> suppliers<00:01:34.520> how<00:01:35.090> we<00:01:35.150> put<00:01:35.450> the

check to court it's like a golf when you

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.570 
check to court it's like a golf when you
shut<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.060> door<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:51.110> shoots<00:01:51.380> properly<00:01:51.920> it's

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
shut the door it shoots properly it's

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.370 
shut the door it shoots properly it's
quiet<00:01:52.880> inside<00:01:53.360> all<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.810> switches<00:01:54.200> work

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
quiet inside all the switches work

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.660 
quiet inside all the switches work
properly<00:01:54.680> you<00:01:55.040> know<00:01:55.729> it's<00:01:56.110> it's<00:01:57.110> top<00:01:57.410> quality

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670
