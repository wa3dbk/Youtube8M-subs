so<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.970> started<00:01:24.409> adding<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.770> ribbon<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640

so I started adding the ribbon but the
pool<00:01:26.850> noodle<00:01:27.180> looked<00:01:27.330> bad<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.840> decided<00:01:28.200> just

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
pool noodle looked bad so I decided just

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.380 
pool noodle looked bad so I decided just
to<00:01:28.530> wrap<00:01:28.740> some<00:01:29.009> brown<00:01:29.280> fabric<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.090> had

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
to wrap some brown fabric that I had

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.300 
to wrap some brown fabric that I had
around<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.619> taught<00:01:31.829> him<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
around it I just taught him to like a

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.090 
around it I just taught him to like a
couple<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.180> strips<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.960> actually<00:01:34.619> pinned<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
couple of strips and actually pinned it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.550 
couple of strips and actually pinned it
wrapped<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.610> around<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.240> pinned<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.200> if

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
wrapped it around and pinned it on to if

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.469 
wrapped it around and pinned it on to if
you<00:01:37.950> don't<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.220> fabric<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:38.970> use<00:01:39.030> an<00:01:39.360> old

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you don't have fabric you can use an old

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.630 
you don't have fabric you can use an old
shirt<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.890> would<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.130> really<00:01:41.460> cool

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
shirt I think it would be really cool

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.069 
shirt I think it would be really cool
even<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.270> maybe<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.600> plaid<00:01:43.049> shirt

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
even to do like maybe a plaid shirt

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.530 
even to do like maybe a plaid shirt
doing<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.250> whole<00:01:44.399> scarecrow<00:01:44.909> theme<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.390> don't

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.570 
around I'm probably gonna go all the way
around<00:02:32.090> twice<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.720> fill<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.049> in<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:35.099> little

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
around twice just to fill it in a little

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.210 
around twice just to fill it in a little
bit<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:37.140> here's<00:02:37.560> what<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.799> looks<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.069> when

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
bit so here's what it looks like when

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.860 
bit so here's what it looks like when
it's<00:02:38.340> all<00:02:38.459> done<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.670> ended<00:02:39.120> up<00:02:39.239> being<00:02:39.510> dry

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
it's all done it ended up being dry

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.309 
it's all done it ended up being dry
freakin<00:02:40.709> enormous<00:02:41.310> but<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.569> went<00:02:42.989> out<00:02:43.079> around

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
freakin enormous but I went out around

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.850 
freakin enormous but I went out around
twice<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:45.540> pins<00:02:45.900> were<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.170> terrible<00:02:46.620> idea

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
twice so I the pins were a terrible idea

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.430 
twice so I the pins were a terrible idea
I<00:02:47.099> kept<00:02:47.370> poking<00:02:47.640> myself<00:02:48.209> don't<00:02:48.540> use<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.170> pins

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
I kept poking myself don't use the pins

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.420 
I kept poking myself don't use the pins
use<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.130> wire<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:51.019> what<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.049> did<00:02:52.319> or<00:02:52.560> like<00:02:53.190> tie

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
use the wire and what I did or like tie

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.860 
use the wire and what I did or like tie
it<00:02:53.489> on<00:02:53.670> with<00:02:53.910> twine<00:02:54.239> or<00:02:54.420> something<00:02:54.690> like<00:02:54.810> that

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
it on with twine or something like that

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.750 
it on with twine or something like that
so<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.200> went<00:02:55.319> around<00:02:55.530> once<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:56.190> just<00:02:56.549> like

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
so I went around once I just like

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.569 
so I went around once I just like
bunched<00:02:57.329> it<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.690> then<00:02:57.900> did<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.620> wire<00:02:58.799> bunched

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
bunched it and then did the wire bunched

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.610 
bunched it and then did the wire bunched
it<00:02:59.760> hit<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.120> wire<00:03:00.269> bunched<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.140> into<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.440> wire

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
it hit the wire bunched it into the wire

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.520 
it hit the wire bunched it into the wire
about<00:03:02.489> every<00:03:02.819> six<00:03:03.090> inches<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.720> then<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:04.170> went

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
about every six inches and then I went

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.410 
about every six inches and then I went
back<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.099> did<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.519> other<00:03:05.700> way<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.030> add

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
back and did it the other way to add

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.650 
back and did it the other way to add
another<00:03:06.840> second<00:03:07.769> bunch<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:09.180> could<00:03:09.360> even<00:03:09.510> go

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
another second bunch you could even go

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.860 
another second bunch you could even go
back<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.079> third<00:03:10.290> time<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.560> had<00:03:10.859> enough<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:12.750> add

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
back the third time I had enough to add

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.840 
back the third time I had enough to add
a<00:03:12.900> third<00:03:13.319> bunch<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.859> make<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.100> even<00:03:14.220> fuller<00:03:14.579> and

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
a third bunch to make it even fuller and

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.910 
a third bunch to make it even fuller and
then<00:03:15.000> what<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.150> did<00:03:15.269> is<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.660> just<00:03:15.690> had<00:03:16.049> dollar
