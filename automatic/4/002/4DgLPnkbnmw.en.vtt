my flourish trihard as promised in the
last<00:00:10.320> video<00:00:10.759> I'm<00:00:11.759> filming<00:00:12.120> outside<00:00:12.240> because

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
last video I'm filming outside because

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.279 
last video I'm filming outside because
it's<00:00:12.809> an<00:00:12.900> awesome<00:00:13.139> sunny<00:00:13.620> day<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:15.289> that's

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
it's an awesome sunny day and that's

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.349 
it's an awesome sunny day and that's
pretty<00:00:16.529> much<00:00:16.650> all<00:00:16.859> there<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.310> it

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
pretty much all there is to it

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.439 
pretty much all there is to it
so<00:00:18.720> I'll<00:00:19.020> just<00:00:19.199> get<00:00:19.410> right<00:00:19.710> with<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.240> main

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
so I'll just get right with it the main

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.230 
so I'll just get right with it the main
grip<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:22.070> it's<00:00:23.070> based<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> mechanic's<00:00:24.090> grip

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
grip is it's based on a mechanic's grip

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.150 
grip is it's based on a mechanic's grip
but<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:24.869> kind<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.199> molecule<00:00:25.590> grip<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
but it's kind of the molecule grip the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.529 
but it's kind of the molecule grip the
Dundee<00:00:26.519> invented<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.060> they<00:00:27.180> use<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.449> their

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
Dundee invented that they use in their

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.429 
Dundee invented that they use in their
molecule<00:00:27.930> flourishes<00:00:28.380> um<00:00:28.640> it's<00:00:29.640> like

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
molecule flourishes um it's like

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.540 
molecule flourishes um it's like
mechanic's<00:00:31.439> grip<00:00:31.590> when<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.040> started<00:00:32.279> humming<00:00:32.489> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
mechanic's grip when I started humming a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.370 
mechanic's grip when I started humming a
middle<00:00:32.730> finger<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> side<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.420> when

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
middle finger to the side like that when

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.370 
middle finger to the side like that when
we<00:00:34.530> ran<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.950> corner<00:00:35.540> like<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.780> okay

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
we ran to the corner like that okay

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.740 
we ran to the corner like that okay
pretty<00:00:37.860> easy<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.340> I'm<00:00:38.460> doing<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.910> really

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
pretty easy to do I'm doing the really

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.840 
pretty easy to do I'm doing the really
new<00:00:39.899> skill<00:00:40.340> involved<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.730> show<00:00:41.910> of

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
new skill involved in that show of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.880 
new skill involved in that show of
unbending<00:00:44.850> fingers<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:45.510> something<00:00:45.870> but<00:00:46.710> yeah

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
unbending fingers or something but yeah

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.479 
unbending fingers or something but yeah
molecule<00:00:47.610> grip<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:49.039> then<00:00:50.039> your<00:00:50.190> camera

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
molecule grip like that then your camera

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.069 
molecule grip like that then your camera
will<00:00:50.640> come<00:00:51.000> over<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.360> your<00:00:51.510> other<00:00:51.690> hand

pull off a card like this and you'll
line<00:02:11.880> up<00:02:11.910> with<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.690> packet<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.440> hand<00:02:14.299> and

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
line up with the packet of this hand and

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.180 
line up with the packet of this hand and
then<00:02:15.810> you're<00:02:16.440> actually<00:02:16.680> going<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.830> use<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
then you're actually going to use the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.030 
then you're actually going to use the
deck<00:02:17.459> as<00:02:18.019> not<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.049> pivot<00:02:19.349> point<00:02:19.380> but<00:02:19.799> something

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
deck as not a pivot point but something

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.160 
deck as not a pivot point but something
to<00:02:20.130> push<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.519> on<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.390> pivot<00:02:21.630> points<00:02:21.959> if<00:02:22.080> you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
to push it on the pivot points if you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.839 
to push it on the pivot points if you
get<00:02:22.319> if<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.620> understand<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.370> don't<00:02:23.760> know

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
get if you understand that I don't know

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.350 
get if you understand that I don't know
I<00:02:23.880> know<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.120> know<00:02:24.299> I<00:02:24.480> mean<00:02:24.870> okay<00:02:25.709> um<00:02:26.780> see<00:02:27.780> here

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
I know I know I mean okay um see here

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.319 
I know I know I mean okay um see here
you<00:02:30.360> kind<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.660> want<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.640> spin<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.760> round<00:02:33.000> but

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
you kind of want to spin it round but

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.449 
you kind of want to spin it round but
then<00:02:33.450> bring<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.870> up<00:02:33.989> you're<00:02:34.860> kind<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.040> reusing

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
then bring it up you're kind of reusing

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.030 
then bring it up you're kind of reusing
the<00:02:35.549> deck<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.880> push<00:02:36.510> back<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.049> down<00:02:37.319> like<00:02:37.560> this

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
the deck to push back it down like this

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.240 
the deck to push back it down like this
I<00:02:38.340> think<00:02:39.269> that's<00:02:39.420> understandable<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:41.190> you

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
I think that's understandable so you

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.550 
I think that's understandable so you
basically<00:02:41.610> just<00:02:41.880> keep<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.569> packet<00:02:43.109> on<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
basically just keep the packet on the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.530 
basically just keep the packet on the
side<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.980> deck<00:02:44.540> like<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.209> bring<00:02:48.480> it

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
side of the deck like that and bring it

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.750 
side of the deck like that and bring it
up<00:02:48.720> like<00:02:49.760> that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
up like that

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.550 
up like that
and<00:02:53.360> then<00:02:53.480> using<00:02:53.750> your<00:02:53.900> thumb<00:02:54.080> again<00:02:54.319> on<00:02:54.409> this

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
and then using your thumb again on this

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.970 
and then using your thumb again on this
corner<00:02:55.659> you<00:02:56.659> want<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.840> kind<00:02:57.019> of<00:02:57.049> push<00:02:57.409> down<00:02:57.709> on

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
corner you want to kind of push down on

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.910 
corner you want to kind of push down on
that<00:02:58.340> corner<00:02:58.760> but<00:02:59.659> you<00:02:59.720> want<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.019> kind<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.230> spin

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
that corner but you want to kind of spin

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.530 
that corner but you want to kind of spin
the<00:03:01.069> packet<00:03:01.430> while<00:03:01.730> giving<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.090> from<00:03:02.299> there

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
the packet while giving you from there

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.369 
the packet while giving you from there
when<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.900> happens<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:04.840> gotta<00:03:05.840> flip<00:03:06.049> over<00:03:06.200> like

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
when that happens I gotta flip over like

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.850 
when that happens I gotta flip over like
that

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
that

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.250 
that

help so slow I look in this angle of

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:56.420 
help so slow I look in this angle of
sign

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.009 

like<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.299> think<00:03:58.360> that<00:03:58.569> three-bagger

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
like that and I think that three-bagger

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.140 
like that and I think that three-bagger
display<00:03:59.379> looks<00:03:59.590> really<00:03:59.799> cool<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:01.120> know

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
display looks really cool and you know

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.210 
display looks really cool and you know
when<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.480> was<00:04:01.629> deciding<00:04:01.840> on<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.140> name<00:04:02.319> I<00:04:02.590> wanted

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
when I was deciding on the name I wanted

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.979 
when I was deciding on the name I wanted
to<00:04:03.310> do<00:04:03.459> with<00:04:03.640> triangles<00:04:04.420> or<00:04:04.629> just<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.870> word

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
to do with triangles or just the word

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.069 
to do with triangles or just the word
tri<00:04:05.769> or<00:04:06.069> triple<00:04:06.640> and<00:04:07.180> then<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:07.569> thought<00:04:07.810> the

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
tri or triple and then I thought the

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.119 
tri or triple and then I thought the
phrase<00:04:08.319> trihard<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:10.680> that's<00:04:11.680> where<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.010> name

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
phrase trihard and that's where the name

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.759 
phrase trihard and that's where the name
comes<00:04:12.340> from<00:04:12.489> little<00:04:13.209> fun<00:04:13.480> fact<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:13.959> that<00:04:14.200> now

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
comes from little fun fact you that now

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.650 
comes from little fun fact you that now
to<00:04:14.829> end<00:04:15.129> the<00:04:15.280> flourish<00:04:15.670> you<00:04:15.879> basically<00:04:16.269> kind

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
to end the flourish you basically kind

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.699 
to end the flourish you basically kind
of<00:04:17.160> launcher<00:04:18.160> in<00:04:18.250> this<00:04:18.400> position<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:20.019> want<00:04:20.650> to

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
of launcher in this position you want to

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.290 
of launcher in this position you want to
bring<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.310> packet<00:04:21.579> up<00:04:21.669> using<00:04:21.880> your<00:04:22.090> index

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
bring the packet up using your index

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.150 
bring the packet up using your index
finger<00:04:22.750> as<00:04:22.900> a<00:04:22.960> pivot<00:04:23.259> point<00:04:23.289> bring<00:04:24.070> this

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
finger as a pivot point bring this

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
itself but you find that isn't working

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.870 
itself but you find that isn't working
for<00:04:34.960> you<00:04:35.050> just<00:04:35.190> kind<00:04:36.190> of<00:04:36.220> just<00:04:36.400> twist<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.729> deck

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
explain especially when there's so many

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.230 
explain especially when there's so many
packets<00:04:43.990> going<00:04:44.260> on<00:04:44.350> at<00:04:44.470> once<00:04:44.820> both<00:04:45.820> of<00:04:46.090> those

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
two packets just here to the bottom of

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.240 
two packets just here to the bottom of
that<00:04:50.199> packet<00:04:50.500> as<00:04:50.620> one<00:04:51.449> put<00:04:52.449> the<00:04:52.510> deck<00:04:52.780> down

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
that packet as one put the deck down

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.710 
that packet as one put the deck down
you'll<00:04:54.250> be<00:04:54.370> left<00:04:54.550> with<00:04:54.669> one<00:04:55.000> card<00:04:55.360> in<00:04:55.599> this

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
you'll be left with one card in this

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.830 
you'll be left with one card in this
hand<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.889> finish<00:04:57.750> simply<00:04:59.669> slide<00:05:00.669> the<00:05:01.389> face<00:05:01.630> of

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
hand to finish simply slide the face of

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
the card right here along the deck let

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.420 
the card right here along the deck let
go<00:05:05.110> with<00:05:05.260> the<00:05:05.380> pinky<00:05:05.770> which<00:05:05.919> will<00:05:06.070> cause<00:05:06.250> like

hard<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.699> flip<00:05:06.940> backwards<00:05:07.349> then<00:05:08.349> put<00:05:08.530> your

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
hard to flip backwards then put your

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.760 
hard to flip backwards then put your
thumb<00:05:08.830> on<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.010> side<00:05:09.130> of<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.340> car<00:05:09.550> here<00:05:09.760> I<00:05:10.770> just

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.270 
took the card oh okay hope I explained
that<00:05:16.330> well<00:05:16.479> enough<00:05:16.659> I'll<00:05:16.960> do<00:05:17.199> one<00:05:17.440> last<00:05:17.650> slope

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
that well enough I'll do one last slope

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.620 
that well enough I'll do one last slope
home<00:05:18.610> to<00:05:18.880> it<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.860> then<00:05:21.099> maybe<00:05:21.550> one<00:05:21.820> fast<00:05:22.389> if
