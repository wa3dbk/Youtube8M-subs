00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
about security until they find out

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.679 
about security until they find out
there's<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.340> lack<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.299> then<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:53.570> was

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
there's a lack of it and then it was

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.390 
there's a lack of it and then it was
things<00:01:53.869> like<00:01:53.960> communication<00:01:54.470> battery<00:01:55.250> life

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
things like communication battery life

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.399 
things like communication battery life
like<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.790> a<00:01:55.820> bat<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.540> phone<00:01:56.869> any<00:01:57.020> good<00:01:57.259> if

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
like is a bat is a phone any good if

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.859 
like is a bat is a phone any good if
it's<00:01:57.530> dead<00:01:57.799> by<00:01:57.979> 12<00:01:58.250> noon<00:01:58.340> not<00:01:59.210> absolutely<00:01:59.659> not

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
it's dead by 12 noon not absolutely not

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.350 
it's dead by 12 noon not absolutely not
particularly<00:02:00.259> good<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.649> really<00:02:01.520> secure<00:02:01.820> but

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
particularly good a really secure but

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.090 
particularly good a really secure but
really<00:02:02.540> secure<00:02:02.810> exactly<00:02:03.320> there<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.770> then<00:02:04.009> at

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
really secure exactly there and then at

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.710 
really secure exactly there and then at
the<00:02:04.250> app<00:02:04.340> at<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.579> top<00:02:04.790> of<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.329> pyramid

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
the app at the top of the the pyramid

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.149 
the app at the top of the the pyramid
you<00:02:05.750> have<00:02:05.990> something<00:02:06.350> like<00:02:06.500> an<00:02:06.710> app<00:02:06.920> for

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
you have something like an app for

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.460 
you have something like an app for
everything<00:02:07.280> which<00:02:08.030> is<00:02:08.299> kind<00:02:08.689> of<00:02:08.750> your<00:02:08.929> utopia

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
everything which is kind of your utopia

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.500 
everything which is kind of your utopia
it's<00:02:09.679> your<00:02:09.799> self<00:02:10.069> actualization<00:02:10.909> you<00:02:11.090> take<00:02:11.329> a

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
it's your self actualization you take a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.149 
it's your self actualization you take a
phone<00:02:12.079> and<00:02:12.379> you<00:02:12.620> can<00:02:12.739> do<00:02:12.889> literally

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
phone and you can do literally

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.440 
phone and you can do literally
everything<00:02:13.579> with<00:02:13.879> it<00:02:14.029> because<00:02:14.150> there's<00:02:14.359> an

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
everything with it because there's an

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.149 
everything with it because there's an
app<00:02:14.599> for<00:02:14.629> everything<00:02:14.930> but<00:02:15.829> if<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
app for everything but if the

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.500 
app for everything but if the
fundamentals<00:02:16.760> aren't<00:02:16.939> there<00:02:17.059> at<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.180> bottom

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
fundamentals aren't there at the bottom

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.070 
fundamentals aren't there at the bottom
you<00:02:17.629> have<00:02:17.659> a<00:02:17.749> nap

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
you have a nap

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.990 
you have a nap
everything<00:02:18.560> but<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.040> have<00:02:19.130> no<00:02:19.250> security<00:02:19.430> is

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
everything but you have no security is

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.210 
everything but you have no security is
that<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.360> good<00:02:20.510> product<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.680> we<00:02:21.800> got<00:02:21.920> into<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.100> lot

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
theory really long hard i call it

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.910 
theory really long hard i call it
because<00:02:32.300> it<00:02:32.420> work<00:02:32.570> kevin's<00:02:33.050> law<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.500> mobile

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290

discussion<00:02:39.830> because<00:02:40.190> several<00:02:40.820> years<00:02:41.120> later

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
discussion because several years later

discussion because several years later
now<00:02:41.720> i<00:02:41.990> think<00:02:42.520> you<00:02:43.520> can<00:02:43.670> arguably<00:02:43.970> say<00:02:44.270> things

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
now i think you can arguably say things

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.690 
now i think you can arguably say things
have<00:02:44.990> changed<00:02:45.380> maybe<00:02:45.680> one<00:02:45.980> device<00:02:46.280> can<00:02:46.520> do

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
have changed maybe one device can do

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.520 
have changed maybe one device can do
almost<00:02:46.970> all<00:02:47.360> of<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.660> or<00:02:47.780> all<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.960> it<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.320> have<00:02:48.470> a

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
almost all of it or all of it you have a

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.040 
almost all of it or all of it you have a
my<00:02:49.100> message<00:02:49.430> exactly<00:02:50.360> we<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.540> multiple<00:02:50.870> ways

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
my message exactly we have multiple ways

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.980 
my message exactly we have multiple ways
of<00:02:51.230> doing<00:02:51.470> things<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.240> the<00:02:53.240> real<00:02:53.480> thing<00:02:53.780> is

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
of doing things and the real thing is

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.720 
of doing things and the real thing is
people<00:02:54.440> should<00:02:54.770> make<00:02:54.920> up<00:02:55.070> their<00:02:55.250> mind<00:02:55.460> for

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
people should make up their mind for

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.430 
people should make up their mind for
themselves<00:02:56.060> because<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.660> lot<00:02:56.959> of<00:02:56.990> consumers

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
themselves because a lot of consumers

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.290 
themselves because a lot of consumers
just<00:02:57.950> look<00:02:58.100> at<00:02:58.220> what<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.430> commercials<00:02:58.880> say<00:02:59.060> or

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
just look at what the commercials say or

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.060 
just look at what the commercials say or
what<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.690> salesman<00:03:00.110> in<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.290> store<00:03:00.500> says<00:03:00.800> and

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
what the salesman in the store says and

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.740 
what the salesman in the store says and
they<00:03:01.610> don't<00:03:01.790> actually<00:03:01.940> think<00:03:02.120> about<00:03:02.480> what's

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
they don't actually think about what's

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.290 
they don't actually think about what's
important<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.290> them<00:03:03.320> so<00:03:03.830> i<00:03:04.130> have<00:03:04.730> my<00:03:04.940> own<00:03:05.090> a

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
important to them so i have my own a

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.000 
important to them so i have my own a
hierarchy<00:03:05.959> of<00:03:05.990> needs<00:03:06.080> i<00:03:06.380> value<00:03:06.800> communication

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
hierarchy of needs i value communication

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.910 
hierarchy of needs i value communication
first<00:03:07.910> i<00:03:08.209> think<00:03:08.570> if<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.900> phone<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.200> slow<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.650> type

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
first i think if a phone is slow to type

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.350 
first i think if a phone is slow to type
on<00:03:10.160> or<00:03:10.340> message<00:03:10.640> on<00:03:10.790> because<00:03:11.000> eighty<00:03:11.180> percent

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
on or message on because eighty percent

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.270 
on or message on because eighty percent
of<00:03:11.570> time<00:03:11.720> i'm<00:03:11.870> doing<00:03:12.050> communication<00:03:12.620> it's<00:03:13.100> not

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
of time i'm doing communication it's not

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.760 
of time i'm doing communication it's not
a<00:03:13.340> phone<00:03:13.550> i<00:03:13.610> want<00:03:13.940> for<00:03:14.570> other<00:03:14.660> people<00:03:15.110> they<00:03:15.320> may

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
a phone i want for other people they may

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.620 
a phone i want for other people they may
be<00:03:15.800> receive<00:03:16.550> a<00:03:16.580> lot<00:03:16.790> more<00:03:16.910> messages<00:03:17.390> than<00:03:17.420> they

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
be receive a lot more messages than they

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.660 
be receive a lot more messages than they
ever<00:03:17.750> send<00:03:18.110> so<00:03:18.770> it's<00:03:18.950> more<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.280> media

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
ever send so it's more of a media

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.400 
ever send so it's more of a media
consumption<00:03:20.030> device<00:03:20.270> i<00:03:20.660> actually<00:03:21.020> really

either<00:06:05.100> I<00:06:05.130> think<00:06:05.430> there's<00:06:05.610> some<00:06:05.730> of<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:05.880> most

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
either I think there's some of the most

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.490 
either I think there's some of the most
beautifully<00:06:06.450> designed<00:06:06.600> applications<00:06:07.350> out

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
beautifully designed applications out

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.690 
beautifully designed applications out
there<00:06:07.590> and<00:06:07.890> I<00:06:07.950> think<00:06:08.130> because<00:06:08.220> we<00:06:08.550> have<00:06:08.640> a

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
there and I think because we have a

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.270 
there and I think because we have a
centralized<00:06:09.240> like<00:06:09.720> design<00:06:10.110> philosophy<00:06:10.890> on

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
centralized like design philosophy on

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.070 
centralized like design philosophy on
our<00:06:11.430> apps<00:06:11.610> that<00:06:12.000> it<00:06:12.240> makes<00:06:12.390> a<00:06:12.510> lot<00:06:12.720> easier<00:06:12.750> for

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
our apps that it makes a lot easier for

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.840 
our apps that it makes a lot easier for
developers<00:06:13.260> and<00:06:13.740> more<00:06:14.430> important<00:06:14.760> that

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
developers and more important that

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.030 
developers and more important that
philosophy<00:06:15.330> isn't<00:06:15.450> forced<00:06:15.990> right<00:06:16.380> google<00:06:16.890> has

creators<00:06:36.180> who<00:06:36.600> are<00:06:36.750> doing<00:06:37.010> text<00:06:38.010> content<00:06:38.669> like

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
creators who are doing text content like

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.290 
creators who are doing text content like
you<00:06:39.120> guys<00:06:39.360> or<00:06:39.840> video<00:06:40.290> content<00:06:40.979> like

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
you guys or video content like

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.659 
you guys or video content like
I<00:06:41.690> think<00:06:42.409> iOS<00:06:42.710> probably<00:06:43.009> wins<00:06:43.159> on<00:06:43.310> that<00:06:43.460> just

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
I think iOS probably wins on that just

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.300 
I think iOS probably wins on that just
because<00:06:44.060> the<00:06:44.470> platform<00:06:45.470> itself<00:06:45.530> is<00:06:45.919> much<00:06:46.129> more

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
because the platform itself is much more

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.580 
because the platform itself is much more
seamless<00:06:46.610> and<00:06:47.479> it's<00:06:47.690> integrated<00:06:48.319> a<00:06:48.409> lot

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
seamless and it's integrated a lot

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.950 
seamless and it's integrated a lot
better<00:06:48.830> at<00:06:49.759> least<00:06:49.940> more<00:06:50.090> so<00:06:50.270> than<00:06:50.419> human<00:06:50.870> it

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
better at least more so than human it

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.779 
better at least more so than human it
doesn't<00:06:51.440> it<00:06:51.500> doesn't<00:06:51.560> like<00:06:52.099> you<00:06:52.220> can<00:06:52.400> create<00:06:52.669> a

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
doesn't it doesn't like you can create a

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:53.950
