areas where it's usually colder so it's

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.030 
areas where it's usually colder so it's
just<00:00:34.290> um<00:00:34.830> it's<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.430> extremely<00:00:36.270> hot<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.350> what

just um it's just extremely hot and what

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.500 
just um it's just extremely hot and what
it<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.520> don't<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:38.820> want<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.090> wear<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
ton of makeup so I thought this would be

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.450 
ton of makeup so I thought this would be
a<00:00:41.909> good<00:00:42.120> opportunity<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:43.140> take<00:00:43.769> advantage<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
a good opportunity to take advantage of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.310 
a good opportunity to take advantage of
that<00:00:44.550> since<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.390> would<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.839> time<00:00:45.870> when

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
that since this would be the time when

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.780 
that since this would be the time when
people<00:00:46.470> would<00:00:46.739> want<00:00:46.979> you<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.339> and<00:00:47.580> hopefully
