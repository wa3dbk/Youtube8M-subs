00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.400
 desire to go from licking how much 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.159

 produce then our tried it goes 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.810
 vote for me then we 'll need 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:29.180
 can be a pants can be a skirt 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.530
 can be a shorts in the skirt for example 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.079
 It's going to be simple, we're just going to have to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.640
 separate the front part with the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.650
 behind the ream site is a skirt if it were 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.170
 a pair of slacks we 'll cut into the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.020
 down very close to that hook 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:52.799
 Horse is here, okay, okay. 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:55.890
 We're going to cut skirt to quote this 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.829
 fabric will be barred which will make the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.009
 pocket for the measure we will have to 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.590
 take the width of the skirt because you can use 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.659
 a bigger or smaller then it will be difficult 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.100
 pass the exact extent're going to depend 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.790
 the size of the skirt 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:16.250
 the height of 15 centimeters then we 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:20.760
 Let's cut the fire and the fabric from above 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:25.500
 we will put so fabric front with 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:31.800
 turned to the fire to pass a seam 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:34.800
 here, and then rebound the seam 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.790
 here he is going to get the fire stuck 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.270
 behind 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.830
 a seamstress to bounce up here 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:48.890
 and let's reserve it 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:52.200
 only then the frill of the skirt 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.420
 We're going to cut a meter of fabric here. 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.250
 There's a little more but we'll cut it. 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:04.920
 a meter of fabric and we'll do 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:07.140
 these deliveries here never have a 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.320
 Base you have to measure the skirt for us. 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.240
 To be able to do the delivery, okay. 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.640
 people are going to do the delivery can do it already 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.640
 straight in the skirt that will stay like this 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.830
 delivery in this area but after 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.610
 they'll get the other cidinho that 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:33.690
 Let's solve the problem or we'll go 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.090
 here on're seeing it has a 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.980
 mark here to make this mark 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.690
 to look pretty cute in the skirt 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:46.920
 We're going to do it under the skirt. 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:50.070
 meet up right on the edge and do 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.110
 the marking and stencil to accompany the 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:57.390
 the curve of the skirt then we cut ourselves 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:00.330
 This is where it's cut because it's already 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.380
 Let's cut up here and there will do 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:07.110
 a seam here in that part will pass 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.880
 sewing here and here will stay 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.860
 open only the pocket 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.860

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.670

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.710

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.190
 We're going to put it here, it's going to be 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.730
 sewn here where her stitching is 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.920
 we'll put the part of the 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.690
 pocket 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.040
 Then we meet here like this to 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.590

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.420
