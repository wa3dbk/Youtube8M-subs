00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.630
 eh 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.690
 It is Tsukmoto Tsukmoto of Kushitani Shimonoseki store 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.380
 I usually drink alcohol during my holidays 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.750
 It is beer and shochu 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.810
 Fish is sweet 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.150
 I have never eaten better fish here than anywhere 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.770
 Honest 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.190
 Recently this um 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.180
 Let's cook it 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.180
 Red is nice 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.940
 Do n't miss garlic in the refrigerator these days 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.500
 22 Kudo olive oil 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.770
 But when I was young I was in a rural house 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.390
 If you 're already okay 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.340
 It is an angry home 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.060
 Really is until you live alone 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:11.069
 I probably never had a knife 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.590
 A man who gets angry even if he goes into the kitchen with a plate down says a woman like that 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.370
 I was home 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:21.140
 I but I think I wanted to opposition 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.450
 Buy what you want to eat yourself, cook yourself and make yourself want to eat 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.879
 It is the best 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:32.019
 It is the most fun when I'm an ingredient mother boy I want to make this 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:34.510
 It seems that if there is something in seasoning, or if it is more like Arisa 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:38.260
 And well when you're thinking is the most 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.770
 Oh , I was supposed to make it with Oh 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.770
 Yup
