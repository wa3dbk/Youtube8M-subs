 hello I'm simon dine muscle maker 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.309
 Today it's about explosive again 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.410
 Training, I show you how you your 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.730
 shoulder neckline trained optimally 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.830
 to lift the whole with front 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.750
 I like to do it all sz 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.789
 because you just have the possibility 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.650
 to find the handle very ergonomic 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.880
 He is also good at doing the joints 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.769
 the whole looks to know me 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.570
 Exceptional because I'm not with 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.800
 all fingers in the dumbbell-go in the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.570
 Of course, that means straight grip 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.820
 moderately, it is also a challenge 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.960
 but I'll show you that first 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.170
 then one or the other too 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.920
 comment 48 should be explosive training 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.920
 have long been known 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.030
 well-known movement scheme five long 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.100
 for a short three the beauty of it is 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.860
 simply one has just one particular 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.600
 long way to work the long way to work 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.729
 Of course, it is possible to work with the four 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.759
 short in the middle according to the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.259
 reduce maximum voltage fields 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.159
 optimal exercise umschulder neckline 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.220
 to train 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.050
 I advise everyone throughout all sz rod 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.649
 and I do not know how good you are 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.250
 saw that 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:47.250
 I'm here with the fingers so renk 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.220
 means the force is with me of three 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.409
 Fingers taken with the thumb go 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.490
 I'm here for safety around 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.899
 but the little finger of the action lay in 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.770
 the function so i have the possibility 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.020
 not exactly this cool mount and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.520
 then it 's the same as us 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.690
 I also pull up relatively body 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.190
 close enough full of radius of movement 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.190

 entire area the exercise pulls up 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.620
 every case 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.870
