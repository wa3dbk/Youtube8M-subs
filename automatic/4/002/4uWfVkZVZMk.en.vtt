themselves change it's got texture and
it's<00:01:51.210> really<00:01:51.479> interesting<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:52.080> not<00:01:52.650> many

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
it's really interesting because not many

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.999 
it's really interesting because not many
other<00:01:52.979> phones<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:54.049> some<00:01:55.049> flip<00:01:55.470> open<00:01:55.650> they

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009

screen<00:03:06.630> it's<00:03:06.990> really<00:03:07.200> bright<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.830> like<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.400> a

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
screen it's really bright I like it a

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.510

lot<00:03:09.680> how<00:03:10.680> they<00:03:10.800> mentioned<00:03:11.130> earlier<00:03:11.370> out<00:03:11.430> of

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
lot how they mentioned earlier out of

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.230 
lot how they mentioned earlier out of
the<00:03:11.610> bluetooth<00:03:12.000> capabilities<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.110> as<00:03:14.240> camera

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
the bluetooth capabilities and as camera

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.140 
the bluetooth capabilities and as camera
and<00:03:15.480> camcorder<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:16.490> think<00:03:17.490> it<00:03:17.580> takes<00:03:17.760> really

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.580 
and camcorder I think it takes really
nice<00:03:18.420> pictures<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:20.070> videos<00:03:20.460> are<00:03:21.440> decent<00:03:22.440> I

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
nice pictures the videos are decent I

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.510 
nice pictures the videos are decent I
would<00:03:23.070> say<00:03:23.330> but<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:25.200> what<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:25.980> get<00:03:26.250> for<00:03:26.459> the

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
would say but it is what you get for the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.120 
would say but it is what you get for the
price<00:03:26.730> which<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.150> about<00:03:27.780> 80<00:03:28.140> bucks<00:03:28.260> with<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.920> new

price which is about 80 bucks with a new
contract<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.970> think<00:03:30.840> or<00:03:31.709> 50<00:03:32.100> something<00:03:32.880> like

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150

contract I think or 50 something like
that<00:03:33.330> I'll<00:03:33.870> check<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.320> I'll<00:03:34.590> put<00:03:34.740> in<00:03:34.860> the
