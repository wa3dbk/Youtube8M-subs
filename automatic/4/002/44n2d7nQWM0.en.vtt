 local eye or to go out 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.099
 we really bet everything on the eyes a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.429
 sparrow the mouth because with 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.599

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.120
 yes just one thing I wanted you 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.620
 to say if I'm just looking up and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.750
 because I changed my camera 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.600
 and as there is the camera back so I 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.969
 just see me at the word so ordered moore 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 isolated then at first I 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.600
 will apply my foundation so 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.129
 it's a small sample of the game is and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.120
 the smell of gaulle where air 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.530
 so this is this one is so here I am 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.910
 come and apply it with my brush 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.910
 at number 187 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.520
 I reds it's horrible I think 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.000
 that I do allergies do not stop 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.920
 to scratch the games this is this background 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.620
 complexion is just great it really does 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.850
 a very sweet ointment too beautiful and he 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.800
 really holds all day so 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.480
 that's what we're looking for in a front-end 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.170
 it will take a lot because it 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.300
 done quickly too thick finally not so beautiful 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.070
 we put slightly and I think I 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.260
 I 'm going for real because he's 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.070
 really too good 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.240
 then I come lightly but from 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.920
 the dark circles so just to cover 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.200
 small imperfections under the eyes 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.280
 this one has the eraser moments that 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.280
 mince home maybelline 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.270
 as always I just dig but 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.150
 play down my mamma home this 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.330
 flight is my brush number 110 from 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.330
 mac 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.910
 then I love you drawing but his 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.530
 style with the adie blog as she at 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.530
 anastasia repentant choral singing 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.430
 now we can pass to the eyes 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.680
 so for that I use in a first 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:33.540
 time a home base max payne post 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:34.740
 painter so at first I 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.230
 a little bit define my eyelid 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.770
 underlined the arcade so with a brown 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.260
 clear a little bit that they caramel one 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.800
 athlete's bar really good at getting 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:56.970
 to deceive is what will do everything 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:57.780
 makeup then applies one day 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.910
 dark purple 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:13.320
 so that's the hearty sheriff of the 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:15.300
 palette recalled bart care so 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.340
 then I apply a matt black very very 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.880
 dark which this one is the carbon of 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.620
 at mac 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.980
 he is really hyper pigmentary 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.980
 watch 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.680
 and so to avoid the effect I just 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.540
 get hit in the east I come and 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.650
 its p this color so between the arcade 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.650
 and my eyelid 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:54.150
 then for the mouse that is this 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:56.400

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.799
 come take my beveled brush and I 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.750
 Come on m shepell fuck so a brown 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.750
 dark just to emphasize my look 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.049
 gesture have good and I go back slightly 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.980
 to make the effect of the eyeliner and 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.359
 to give a little more 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.359
 brightness at this makeup 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.759
 I use the pencil so waterproof of 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.380
 at sephora he is great he is 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.400
 Too beautiful is a little golden 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.300
 really beautiful 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.160
 it's the hue 07 girl i talk and so 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.570
 I come to put under world is a 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.570
 little bit in the inner corner 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.580
 and for a little better fix his 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.610
 glitters i just take hd so the 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.780
 golden palette but team 2 with a 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.909
 little pinch point the short and I 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.909
 come back to the crime 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.250
 I can now a little bit clean up 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.900
 the outside of my eye because there 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.760
 you see it's a little rush 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.110
 red it's not super pretty so with a 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.520
 flat brush and a little bit of background 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.550
 dyes him unfair 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.050
 hop there remove small imperfections 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.090
 then I come to draw my lips 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.160
 with the crime coming out of mc so home to 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.410
 r so I had a lot of trouble 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.910
 to find at mac because it's the one 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.890
 that kylie jenner uses all the 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.620
 world wanted it so here it was in 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.600
 shortage of national stock end very short 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.460
 complicated but I managed to get it 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.440
 I just add a little lipstick 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.970
 nude so this one is the viva glam 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.210
 number two and I just apply it on 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.210
 my lips 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.820
 then I can apply my mascara 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.200
 this one is the colossal go 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.290
 extreme from maybelline 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.490
 in perfecto prank and then I'm going to 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.960
 rest but fossils 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.340
 you do not have to put some but 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.990
 good I thought it was more 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.919
 pretty a more provided look and then 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.570
 like it's a sophisticated makeup 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.880
 to go out I thought it was 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:59.720
 more appropriate so here's intersect 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:03.820
 this is the 43 of schema that are 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.820
 super super well supplied so that's it 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.890
 we see girls there all for this 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.690

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.780
