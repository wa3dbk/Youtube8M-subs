putting<00:00:47.590> tension<00:00:48.130> on<00:00:48.250> them<00:00:48.430> and<00:00:48.610> I<00:00:48.640> didn't

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
putting tension on them and I didn't

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.580 
putting tension on them and I didn't
want<00:00:49.030> them<00:00:49.180> to<00:00:49.210> break<00:00:49.570> so<00:00:49.840> I<00:00:49.870> I<00:00:50.140> really
