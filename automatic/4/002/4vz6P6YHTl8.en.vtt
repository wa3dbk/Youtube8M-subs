00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.640
 for mounting a handlebar and stem 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.680
 From carbon we need one with age 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.619
 a four and a five in the bus as well 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.899
 our torque wrench handlebar and 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.790
 stem are important and 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.099
 safety-related attachments straight 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.910
 here can be a wrong fatal assembly 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.460
 have follow 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.680
 you tighten the screws too tight or too 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.040
 Loose at the end of the assembly error 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.420
 fast with a hospital stay 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.670
 that's why it's so important here 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.100
 to the exact torque specifications 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.989
 to keep the manufacturer 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.940
 start with the four-inch hex key 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.159
 so we past the old hangman 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.069
 unscrew screws and take the handlebar 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.739
 From then we solve the top screw on 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:00.749
 heating system now the lateral clamp 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.870
 unscrew until accuse 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:05.940
 fork pulls off before we can 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.590
 the assembly will start over 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.020
 on the inner contact stand up 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.930
 Contamination checked and if necessary 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.850
 selbergemacht now are before was with 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.890
 a carbon suitable 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.780
 Lubricate lubricant evenly and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.780
 to the fork creates Place 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.289
 Now we take the torque key 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.479
 to hand put the of the area code 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.969
 Manufacturer specified value in jud meter 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.759
 and press the operator into the 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.560
 tool then put the cap on 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.759
 and the cap screw easily 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.829
 screw infor flush with the front wheel 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.979
 align and screw to the 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.479
 set torque to pull now 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.640
 screw the lateral clamps 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.859
 turn evenly and alternately 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.200
 is the desired torque of both 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:55.350
 reached is the stem is 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.549
 now properly assembled before we 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.920
 install the handlebar 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.869
 we would have the stem properly and 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.869
 Carefully push the handlebar in the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.330
 make sure that the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.070
 handlebar is sitting straight in the stem 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.140
 now with the torque wrench the 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.150
 screw the change on until 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.760
 all screw the right torque 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.050
 our tax system is now reached 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.050
 safely assembled 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:39.300
