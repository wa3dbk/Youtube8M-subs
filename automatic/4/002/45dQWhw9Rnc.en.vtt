now<00:01:02.280> what<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> don't<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.600> about<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:04.970> is<00:01:05.970> that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
now what I don't like about it is that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.350 
now what I don't like about it is that
for<00:01:06.540> every<00:01:07.320> pool<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:09.110> pull<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:11.270> lose<00:01:12.270> about<00:01:13.340> an

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
for every pool I pull I lose about an

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.070 
for every pool I pull I lose about an
inch<00:01:15.360> or<00:01:15.570> two<00:01:15.720> before<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.560> hitch<00:01:17.189> grabs<00:01:18.080> even

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
inch or two before the hitch grabs even

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.499 
inch or two before the hitch grabs even
if<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.409> really<00:01:19.710> tight<00:01:19.950> hitch<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:21.240> still

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
if it's a really tight hitch you still

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.940 
if it's a really tight hitch you still
lose<00:01:22.640> this<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:24.720> length<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> braid<00:01:25.590> here

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
lose this the length of the braid here

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.070 
lose this the length of the braid here
then<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.790> length<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> first<00:01:27.509> Bend<00:01:27.810> or

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
then the length to the first Bend or

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.980 
then the length to the first Bend or
braid<00:01:28.549> where<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.670> wears<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> blake<00:01:30.540> as

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
braid where it wears with a blake as

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.550 
braid where it wears with a blake as
soon<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.409> pull<00:01:31.710> down<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.700> lock<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.210> also<00:01:34.170> I

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
soon as you pull down you lock it also I

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.219 
soon as you pull down you lock it also I
don't<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.950> when<00:01:35.579> you're<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.909> up<00:01:36.229> you

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
don't like when you're going up you

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.550 
don't like when you're going up you
usually<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.680> about<00:01:37.950> three<00:01:38.820> pools<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:40.170> so

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
usually do about three pools or so

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.850 
usually do about three pools or so
before<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.430> take<00:01:41.640> out<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:41.970> slack<00:01:42.329> until<00:01:42.990> it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
before you take out your slack until it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.560 
before you take out your slack until it
gets<00:01:44.399> enough<00:01:44.670> rope<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.290> start<00:01:46.290> self<00:01:46.649> tending

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
gets enough rope to start self tending

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.630 
gets enough rope to start self tending
now<00:01:48.570> what<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.079> don't<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.409> about<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.920> when<00:01:50.610> I

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
now what I don't like about that when I

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.920 
now what I don't like about that when I
think<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.229> slightly<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.350> safe<00:01:52.649> as<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.159> if<00:01:54.149> you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
think is slightly on safe as if if you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.380 
think is slightly on safe as if if you
got<00:01:55.079> three<00:01:55.470> pools<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.850> slip<00:01:57.180> for

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
got three pools and you slip for

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.359 
got three pools and you slip for
whatever<00:01:57.540> reason<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.079> get<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.229> leaf<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.340> your

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
whatever reason you get a leaf in your

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.280 
whatever reason you get a leaf in your
hand<00:01:59.700> or<00:01:59.880> something<00:02:00.090> you're<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> fall

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
hand or something you're going to fall

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.639 
hand or something you're going to fall
about<00:02:02.219> three<00:02:02.659> pulls<00:02:03.659> worth<00:02:03.960> before<00:02:04.380> it

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
about three pulls worth before it

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.550 
about three pulls worth before it
catches<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.520> opposed<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.689> blake<00:02:07.110> where

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
catches you as opposed to a blake where

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.300 
catches you as opposed to a blake where
you'd<00:02:07.649> only<00:02:07.799> fall<00:02:08.099> one<00:02:08.879> pool<00:02:09.149> worth

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
you'd only fall one pool worth

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.839 
you'd only fall one pool worth
a<00:02:12.370> little<00:02:13.370> way<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:13.550> can<00:02:13.959> combat<00:02:14.959> that<00:02:15.020> is<00:02:15.849> to

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
a little way you can combat that is to

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.000 
a little way you can combat that is to
extend<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:18.680> distance<00:02:19.130> between<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.800> hitch

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
extend the distance between the hitch

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.430 
extend the distance between the hitch
system<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:23.590> your<00:02:24.590> tie<00:02:24.800> end<00:02:24.980> point<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:27.290> I'll

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
system and your tie end point so I'll

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:35.470 
system and your tie end point so I'll
just<00:02:28.599> use<00:02:29.599> cordage<00:02:30.230> here<00:02:32.590> clip<00:02:33.590> in<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:35.239> now

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
just use cordage here clip in and now

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.270 
just use cordage here clip in and now
I'm<00:02:36.050> completely<00:02:36.730> below<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:39.680> pull<00:02:39.980> down

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.509 

alway<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.790> then<00:02:47.360> when<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:47.480> get<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:48.019> point

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
alway and then when I get to a point

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.500 
alway and then when I get to a point
where<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.549> can<00:02:50.650> lanyard<00:02:51.650> in<00:02:51.799> I<00:02:52.180> can<00:02:53.180> pull<00:02:53.420> it

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
where I can lanyard in I can pull it

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.680 
where I can lanyard in I can pull it
close<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.290> me<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.790> take<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.239> out<00:02:56.299> of<00:02:56.599> the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
close to me and take that out of the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.020 
close to me and take that out of the
equation<00:02:58.090> then<00:02:59.090> clip<00:02:59.450> back<00:02:59.660> in<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:01.370> get<00:03:01.880> to

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
knot and it's far away unless you make

knot and it's far away unless you make
it<00:04:02.630> shorter<00:04:03.340> but<00:04:04.340> if<00:04:04.459> you<00:04:04.549> make<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.819> really

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
it shorter but if you make it really

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.199 
it shorter but if you make it really
short<00:04:05.329> then<00:04:05.930> it's<00:04:06.079> not<00:04:06.230> so<00:04:06.440> good<00:04:06.590> for

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
short then it's not so good for

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.569 
short then it's not so good for
ascending<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.359> tree<00:04:08.889> so<00:04:09.889> you<00:04:09.920> either<00:04:10.130> have<00:04:10.310> to

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
ascending the tree so you either have to

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.140 
ascending the tree so you either have to
change<00:04:10.850> your<00:04:11.000> length<00:04:11.209> or<00:04:11.480> do<00:04:11.569> something<00:04:11.810> else

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150
