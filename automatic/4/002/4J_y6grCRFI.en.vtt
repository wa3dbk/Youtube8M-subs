distributors yes back there the reason

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.469 
distributors yes back there the reason
they<00:01:17.100> did<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.520> read<00:01:17.820> up<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> little

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
they did that I read up on that a little

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.960 
they did that I read up on that a little
bit<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.740> made<00:01:19.950> everything<00:01:20.220> redundant

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
bit was they made everything redundant

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.850 
bit was they made everything redundant
like<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.390> they<00:01:21.689> had<00:01:21.930> more<00:01:22.320> than<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.650> needed

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
like that they had more than they needed

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.740 
like that they had more than they needed
because<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.640> you're<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> fire<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.540> can't

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
because if you're on a fire you can't

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.679 
because if you're on a fire you can't
have<00:01:24.930> something<00:01:25.200> go<00:01:25.439> down<00:01:25.970> generator<00:01:26.970> works<00:01:27.540> a

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
have something go down generator works a

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.230 
have something go down generator works a
pump<00:01:27.960> water<00:01:28.259> pump<00:01:28.549> yeah<00:01:29.549> pump<00:01:29.850> water<00:01:30.119> pump

way<00:01:36.630> they<00:01:37.020> don't<00:01:37.140> fly<00:01:37.350> there<00:01:37.560> -<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.159> generator

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
way they don't fly there - the generator

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.060 
way they don't fly there - the generator
ran<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.450> water<00:01:39.840> pump<00:01:40.610> but<00:01:41.810> yeah<00:01:42.829> some<00:01:43.829> brass
