00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
automatic and not full round burst like

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.710 
automatic and not full round burst like
I<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.729> said<00:01:18.170> xm8<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.409> anyone

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
I just said xm8 or anyone

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.050 
I just said xm8 or anyone
is<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.050> more<00:01:21.620> round<00:01:21.800> burst<00:01:22.100> weapon<00:01:22.790> um<00:01:25.060> but

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
is a more round burst weapon um but

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.260 
is a more round burst weapon um but
friendly<00:01:26.750> UAB<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.410> so<00:01:27.860> from<00:01:28.340> medium<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:28.850> long

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
friendly UAB and so from medium to long

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.760 
friendly UAB and so from medium to long
range<00:01:29.300> I<00:01:29.930> prefer<00:01:30.200> using<00:01:31.780> more<00:01:32.780> adverse<00:01:33.200> just

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
range I prefer using more adverse just

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.950 
range I prefer using more adverse just
so<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.160> you<00:01:34.520> wouldn't<00:01:34.850> have<00:01:34.970> better

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
so that you wouldn't have better

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.610 
so that you wouldn't have better
accuracy<00:01:36.580> less<00:01:37.580> recoil<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.080> can<00:01:39.260> land

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
accuracy less recoil so you can land

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.960 
accuracy less recoil so you can land
every<00:01:39.890> hit<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:40.460> get<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.700> kill<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:43.490> m8a1

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
every hit and get the kill the m8a1

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.020 
every hit and get the kill the m8a1
should<00:01:44.900> probably<00:01:45.470> be<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:46.520> weapon<00:01:46.730> of<00:01:47.000> choice

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
should probably be the weapon of choice

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.000 
should probably be the weapon of choice
for<00:01:47.600> most<00:01:48.670> action<00:01:50.440> particular<00:01:51.440> drone<00:01:51.710> ready

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
for all players enjoy using first fire

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.830 
for all players enjoy using first fire
weapons<00:01:57.250> will<00:01:58.250> lock<00:01:58.490> this<00:01:58.700> weapon<00:01:59.150> at<00:01:59.479> level

49<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.940> damage<00:02:02.390> rate<00:02:02.690> of<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.470> is<00:02:03.670> 20th<00:02:04.670> 35<00:02:05.390> per

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
49 the damage rate of it is 20th 35 per

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.020 
49 the damage rate of it is 20th 35 per
hit<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.490> would<00:02:07.970> really<00:02:08.270> have<00:02:08.570> to<00:02:08.720> land

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
hit so you would really have to land

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.020

about every bullet from the four round

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.880 
about every bullet from the four round
burst<00:02:14.330> or<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.050> would<00:02:15.170> have<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.410> fire<00:02:15.590> on

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
burst or you would have to fire on

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.620 
burst or you would have to fire on
second<00:02:16.730> burst<00:02:16.990> to<00:02:17.990> finally<00:02:18.320> kill<00:02:18.590> Lana<00:02:19.280> me

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
second burst to finally kill Lana me

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.860 
second burst to finally kill Lana me
well<00:02:20.630> unless<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.290> have<00:02:22.000> select<00:02:23.000> fire<00:02:23.270> so<00:02:23.840> that

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
well unless you have select fire so that

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.090 
well unless you have select fire so that
you<00:02:24.170> could<00:02:24.350> just<00:02:24.640> continuously<00:02:25.640> shoot<00:02:26.150> at<00:02:26.650> the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.900 

ammo

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
ammo

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.410 
ammo
this<00:02:32.180> gun<00:02:32.870> holds<00:02:33.350> is<00:02:33.560> 32<00:02:34.160> round<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:36.190> 32<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.490> 96

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
this gun holds is 32 round and 32 and 96

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.370 
this gun holds is 32 round and 32 and 96
as<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:40.040> remainder<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:40.960> technically<00:02:41.960> you<00:02:42.140> have

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
as the remainder so technically you have

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.800 
as the remainder so technically you have
about<00:02:43.090> 128<00:02:44.090> bullets<00:02:44.480> but<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.650> maximum<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.810> 256

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
about 128 bullets but the maximum is 256

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.150 
about 128 bullets but the maximum is 256
so<00:02:48.170> double<00:02:48.650> when<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.460> currently<00:02:50.030> spawn<00:02:50.450> with

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
so double when you currently spawn with

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.910 
so double when you currently spawn with
extended<00:02:52.160> mags<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.760> get<00:02:52.910> 42<00:02:53.450> rounds<00:02:53.930> which<00:02:54.740> is

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
extended mags you get 42 rounds which is

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.950 
extended mags you get 42 rounds which is
actually<00:02:55.130> kind<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.460> weird<00:02:55.700> since<00:02:56.120> doesn't

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
actually kind of weird since doesn't

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.940 
actually kind of weird since doesn't
divide<00:02:57.320> equally<00:02:58.040> with<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.910> four<00:02:59.150> round<00:02:59.390> burst

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
divide equally with the four round burst

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.770 
divide equally with the four round burst
but<00:03:00.950> oh<00:03:01.070> well<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:02.120> then<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:04.010> get<00:03:04.190> 160<00:03:05.090> extra

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
but oh well and then you get 160 extra

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.710 
but oh well and then you get 160 extra
rounds<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:06.890> that's<00:03:07.070> about<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.580> total<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.330> two

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
rounds so that's about a total of two

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.560 
rounds so that's about a total of two
hundred<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.380> two<00:03:10.060> rounds<00:03:11.260> then<00:03:12.370> if<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:14.060> run

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
hundred and two rounds then if you run

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.570 
hundred and two rounds then if you run
around<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.110> you<00:03:15.230> somehow<00:03:15.500> pick<00:03:15.860> up<00:03:16.010> ammo<00:03:16.370> if

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
around and you somehow pick up ammo if

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.250 
around and you somehow pick up ammo if
you<00:03:16.880> have<00:03:17.000> like<00:03:17.150> scavenger<00:03:17.750> or<00:03:17.780> something

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
you have like scavenger or something

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.260 
you have like scavenger or something
