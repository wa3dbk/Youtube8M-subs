00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.730 

welcome<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.730> episode<00:00:15.120> 3<00:00:15.450> from<00:00:15.840> chapter<00:00:16.200> 9<00:00:16.230> and

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
welcome to episode 3 from chapter 9 and

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.290 
welcome to episode 3 from chapter 9 and
in<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.040> episode<00:00:17.220> we're<00:00:17.610> gonna<00:00:17.730> cover<00:00:18.029> the

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
in this episode we're gonna cover the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.090 
in this episode we're gonna cover the
first<00:00:18.689> step<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.260> side<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.619> respiration

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
first step of side of the respiration

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.850 
first step of side of the respiration
called<00:00:20.580> glycolysis<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.840> remember<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.680> is

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
called glycolysis and remember this is

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.010 
called glycolysis and remember this is
the<00:00:22.890> only<00:00:23.040> step<00:00:23.790> that<00:00:24.060> occurs<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
the only step that occurs in the

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.900 
the only step that occurs in the
cytoplasm<00:00:25.349> the<00:00:25.830> other<00:00:25.950> two<00:00:26.130> steps<00:00:26.400> will<00:00:26.610> occur

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
cytoplasm the other two steps will occur

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.240 
cytoplasm the other two steps will occur
inside<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.450> mitochondria<00:00:27.800> all<00:00:28.800> right<00:00:28.919> now<00:00:29.220> I

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
inside the mitochondria all right now I

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.830 
inside the mitochondria all right now I
want<00:00:29.430> you<00:00:29.700> to<00:00:29.790> remember<00:00:30.000> about<00:00:30.149> cellular

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
want you to remember about cellular

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.380 
want you to remember about cellular
respiration<00:00:31.489> this<00:00:32.489> number<00:00:32.910> 2<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:34.489> 2<00:00:35.489> because

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
respiration this number 2 to 2 because

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.700 
respiration this number 2 to 2 because
that's<00:00:36.510> really<00:00:36.780> gonna<00:00:36.899> help<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.260> understand

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
that's really gonna help you understand

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.130 
that's really gonna help you understand
the<00:00:37.860> steps<00:00:38.070> ok<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:39.390> first<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.750> want<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.960> tell

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the steps ok but first I want to tell

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.790 
the steps ok but first I want to tell
you<00:00:40.230> what<00:00:41.180> glycolysis<00:00:42.180> means<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:43.079> plain

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
you what glycolysis means in plain

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.389 
you what glycolysis means in plain
English<00:00:44.160> write<00:00:44.699> this<00:00:45.449> word<00:00:45.660> glyco<00:00:46.399> that

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
English write this word glyco that

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.450 
English write this word glyco that
refers<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.760> glucose<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.160> may<00:00:50.339> have

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
refers to glucose and you may have

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.599 
refers to glucose and you may have
remember<00:00:50.940> from<00:00:51.269> chapter<00:00:52.190> from<00:00:53.190> chapter<00:00:53.489> 2

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
remember from chapter from chapter 2

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.189 
remember from chapter from chapter 2
where<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:53.820> talking<00:00:54.030> about<00:00:54.059> glycogen<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.050> is

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
where we talking about glycogen which is

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.590 
where we talking about glycogen which is
animal<00:00:55.679> starch<00:00:56.089> glycogen<00:00:57.089> is<00:00:57.239> made<00:00:57.420> out<00:00:57.570> of

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
animal starch glycogen is made out of

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.810 
animal starch glycogen is made out of
just<00:00:57.929> a<00:00:58.050> long<00:00:58.350> chain<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.890> glucose<00:00:59.280> molecules

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
just a long chain of glucose molecules

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.779 
just a long chain of glucose molecules
so<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.210> us<00:01:00.329> we're<00:01:00.629> gonna<00:01:00.690> refer<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.550> glyco<00:01:02.550> as

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
so for us we're gonna refer to glyco as

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.600 
so for us we're gonna refer to glyco as
glucose<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.929> we've<00:01:04.620> learned<00:01:04.860> before<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.280> some

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
glucose and we've learned before in some

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.680 
glucose and we've learned before in some
of<00:01:05.730> our<00:01:05.820> screencasts<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.830> lysis<00:01:07.830> means<00:01:08.760> to

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
of our screencasts that lysis means to

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.790 
of our screencasts that lysis means to
break<00:01:10.760> okay<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.300> basically<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:13.020> glycolysis

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
break okay so basically what glycolysis

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.300 
break okay so basically what glycolysis
means<00:01:14.190> is<00:01:15.200> breaking<00:01:16.200> glucose<00:01:16.620> in<00:01:16.830> half<00:01:17.040> now

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
means is breaking glucose in half now

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.610 
means is breaking glucose in half now
when<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.580> break<00:01:17.910> glucose<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.660> half<00:01:18.840> you're

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
when you break glucose and a half you're

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.410 
when you break glucose and a half you're
gonna<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.160> three<00:01:20.670> products<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.300> that's

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
gonna get three products and that's

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.230 
gonna get three products and that's
where<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.660> two<00:01:21.960> two<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.130> two<00:01:23.190> come<00:01:23.970> from

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
where the two two and two come from

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.980 
where the two two and two come from
alright

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
alright

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.870 
alright
the<00:01:25.890> number<00:01:26.160> one<00:01:26.310> thing<00:01:26.340> you're<00:01:26.610> gonna<00:01:26.700> get

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the number one thing you're gonna get

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.060 
the number one thing you're gonna get
out<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.120> this<00:01:27.330> or<00:01:28.050> I'm<00:01:28.200> actually<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.800> of<00:01:28.830> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
out of this or I'm actually one of the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.170 
out of this or I'm actually one of the
main<00:01:29.280> things<00:01:29.550> you're<00:01:29.640> gonna<00:01:29.730> get<00:01:29.820> out<00:01:29.910> of<00:01:29.970> this

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
main things you're gonna get out of this

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.560 
main things you're gonna get out of this
is<00:01:30.530> ATP<00:01:31.530> you're<00:01:31.980> gonna<00:01:32.130> get<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.580> two<00:01:32.880> but

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
is ATP you're gonna get just two but

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.270 
is ATP you're gonna get just two but
that's<00:01:33.750> important<00:01:34.170> because<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.470> ATP<00:01:34.800> can<00:01:35.190> be

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
that's important because that ATP can be

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
that's important because that ATP can be
used<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:36.420> power<00:01:37.050> some<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> cells<00:01:38.300> stuff

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
used to power some of the cells stuff

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.040 
used to power some of the cells stuff
now

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
now

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.110 
now
what<00:01:40.350> you're<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:40.860> here<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.550> this

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
what you're going to get here and this

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.160 
what you're going to get here and this
is<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.480> important<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.400> nadh<00:01:44.400> now<00:01:44.640> remember

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
is really important is nadh now remember

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.410 
is really important is nadh now remember
nadh<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.410> an<00:01:46.650> electron<00:01:47.160> carrier<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:48.210> if<00:01:48.330> you

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
nadh is an electron carrier now if you

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.360 
nadh is an electron carrier now if you
can<00:01:48.540> remember<00:01:48.690> back<00:01:48.870> from<00:01:49.220> photosynthesis<00:01:50.220> we

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
can remember back from photosynthesis we

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.250 
can remember back from photosynthesis we
had<00:01:50.550> an<00:01:50.700> nad<00:01:52.130> pH<00:01:53.300> there's<00:01:54.300> no<00:01:54.510> P<00:01:54.780> here<00:01:55.020> because

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
had an nad pH there's no P here because

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.950 
had an nad pH there's no P here because
it's<00:01:55.410> not<00:01:55.580> photosynthesis<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:56.760> in<00:01:57.540> cellular

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it's not photosynthesis so in cellular

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.010 
it's not photosynthesis so in cellular
respiration<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.650> just<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:59.010> nad<00:01:59.570> nad<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
respiration you just have nad nad and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.820 
respiration you just have nad nad and
NADP

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
NADP

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.800 
NADP
aren't<00:02:02.340> any<00:02:02.850> I'm<00:02:03.120> sorry<00:02:03.420> Murray<00:02:03.570> friends

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
aren't any I'm sorry Murray friends

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.410 
aren't any I'm sorry Murray friends
again<00:02:04.400> NADH<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.790> NADPH<00:02:07.250> they're<00:02:08.250> cousins<00:02:08.550> but

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
again NADH and NADPH they're cousins but

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.420 
again NADH and NADPH they're cousins but
the<00:02:09.569> P<00:02:09.869> one<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.140> only<00:02:10.470> used<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.800> photosynthesis

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the P one is only used in photosynthesis

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.540 
the P one is only used in photosynthesis
so<00:02:11.459> remember<00:02:11.940> P<00:02:12.840> for<00:02:13.170> photosynthesis<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.010> no<00:02:14.370> P

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
so remember P for photosynthesis so no P

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.220 
so remember P for photosynthesis so no P
here<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.269> using<00:02:15.599> photosynthesis

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
here this is not using photosynthesis

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.520 
here this is not using photosynthesis
alright<00:02:16.980> these<00:02:17.780> higher<00:02:18.780> energy<00:02:19.080> electrons

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
alright these higher energy electrons

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.649 
alright these higher energy electrons
that<00:02:19.620> are<00:02:19.709> carried<00:02:19.980> by<00:02:20.010> NADH<00:02:20.609> they're<00:02:21.480> going

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
that are carried by NADH they're going

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.599 
that are carried by NADH they're going
to<00:02:21.719> be<00:02:21.840> used<00:02:22.200> by<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.620> electron<00:02:23.069> transport

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
to be used by the electron transport

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.160 
to be used by the electron transport
system

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
system

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.930 
system
and<00:02:25.350> then<00:02:25.560> finally<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.400> third<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.880> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
and then finally the third of the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.640 
and then finally the third of the
Artoo's<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.470> pyruvic<00:02:29.160> acid<00:02:29.910> molecules<00:02:30.360> now

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
Artoo's is to pyruvic acid molecules now

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.730 
Artoo's is to pyruvic acid molecules now
pyruvic<00:02:31.650> acid<00:02:32.220> can<00:02:32.940> also<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.510> called<00:02:33.950> pyruvate

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
pyruvic acid can also be called pyruvate

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.430 
pyruvic acid can also be called pyruvate
so<00:02:37.740> pyruvate<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.850> pyruvate<00:02:39.230> acid<00:02:40.230> they're

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
so pyruvate and pyruvate acid they're

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.770 
so pyruvate and pyruvate acid they're
the<00:02:40.590> same<00:02:40.800> thing<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.190> like<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.940> say<00:02:41.970> pyruvate

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
the same thing I like to say pyruvate

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.110 
the same thing I like to say pyruvate
because<00:02:43.170> that's<00:02:43.380> one<00:02:43.650> less<00:02:43.890> word<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.340> say<00:02:44.550> okay

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
because that's one less word to say okay

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.190 
because that's one less word to say okay
and<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.840> will<00:02:46.020> move<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:47.550> Krebs<00:02:47.880> cycle

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
and this will move on to the Krebs cycle

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.130 
and this will move on to the Krebs cycle
all<00:02:49.200> right<00:02:49.320> now<00:02:49.890> make<00:02:50.280> sure<00:02:50.780> that<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.959> make<00:02:52.110> a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
all right now make sure that you make a

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.810 
all right now make sure that you make a
note<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.620> need<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.950> know<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.340> graphic

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
note that I need to know this graphic

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.729 
note that I need to know this graphic
and<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.300> I'm<00:02:54.450> going<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.810> study<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.260> all<00:02:55.590> right

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
and that I'm going to study it all right

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.979 
and that I'm going to study it all right
and<00:02:55.920> really<00:02:56.280> if<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.610> can<00:02:56.790> count<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.330> six<00:02:57.660> and

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
and really if you can count to six and

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.020 
and really if you can count to six and
divide<00:02:58.650> by<00:02:58.800> two<00:02:58.860> you're<00:02:59.459> going<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.670> get<00:02:59.850> this

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
divide by two you're going to get this

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.680 
divide by two you're going to get this
process

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
process

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.150 
process
alright<00:03:01.140> glucose<00:03:01.620> see<00:03:01.770> if<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.890> can<00:03:02.010> remember

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
alright glucose see if you can remember

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.940 
alright glucose see if you can remember
it's<00:03:02.630> c6<00:03:04.100> h-12<00:03:05.100> o-6<00:03:06.080> so<00:03:07.080> we<00:03:07.170> have<00:03:07.290> one<00:03:07.500> two

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
it's c6 h-12 o-6 so we have one two

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.540 
it's c6 h-12 o-6 so we have one two
three<00:03:08.340> four<00:03:08.910> five<00:03:09.660> six<00:03:10.110> carbons<00:03:10.380> here<00:03:10.769> in<00:03:10.950> the

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
three four five six carbons here in the

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.620 
three four five six carbons here in the
first<00:03:11.820> step<00:03:12.060> you're<00:03:12.150> going<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.360> do<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.540> you're

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
first step you're going to do is you're

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.150 
first step you're going to do is you're
going<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.780> break<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.080> in<00:03:13.290> half<00:03:13.350> into<00:03:13.950> two

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
going to break it in half into two

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.479 
going to break it in half into two
3-carbon<00:03:14.580> compounds<00:03:14.970> 1<00:03:15.570> 2<00:03:15.720> 3<00:03:15.870> 1<00:03:16.650> 2<00:03:16.680> 3<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.190> when

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
3-carbon compounds 1 2 3 1 2 3 and when

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.040 
3-carbon compounds 1 2 3 1 2 3 and when
you<00:03:17.610> do<00:03:17.820> that<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:18.390> takes<00:03:19.290> 2<00:03:19.860> ATP<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.570> here<00:03:21.900> we

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
you do that that takes 2 ATP so here we

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.810 
you do that that takes 2 ATP so here we
have<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.500> spend<00:03:24.170> 2<00:03:25.170> ATP<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.160> break<00:03:26.370> this<00:03:26.580> guy

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
have to spend 2 ATP to break this guy

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.880 
have to spend 2 ATP to break this guy
now<00:03:27.360> what<00:03:28.019> we're<00:03:28.170> going<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.320> do<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.680> next

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
now what we're going to do in the next

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.580 
now what we're going to do in the next
step<00:03:29.100> is<00:03:29.489> we're<00:03:29.700> going<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.910> take<00:03:30.090> these

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
step is we're going to take these

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.199 
step is we're going to take these
compounds<00:03:31.590> we're<00:03:32.070> gonna<00:03:32.220> rearrange<00:03:32.610> them

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
compounds we're gonna rearrange them

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.030 
compounds we're gonna rearrange them
your<00:03:33.690> more<00:03:34.110> move<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.350> carbons<00:03:34.709> around<00:03:34.920> and

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
your more move the carbons around and

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.140 
your more move the carbons around and
put<00:03:35.130> them<00:03:35.250> in<00:03:35.310> different<00:03:35.400> places<00:03:35.700> think<00:03:36.060> of

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
put them in different places think of

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.240 
put them in different places think of
kind<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.360> like<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.510> shell<00:03:36.810> game<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.260> when<00:03:37.860> we<00:03:38.010> do

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
kind of like a shell game and when we do

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.960 
kind of like a shell game and when we do
that<00:03:38.489> we're<00:03:39.090> gonna<00:03:39.269> get<00:03:39.450> 4<00:03:39.870> ATP<00:03:40.350> all<00:03:41.100> right<00:03:41.310> so

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
that we're gonna get 4 ATP all right so

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.539 
that we're gonna get 4 ATP all right so
this<00:03:42.570> will<00:03:42.780> be<00:03:42.930> our<00:03:43.070> revenue<00:03:44.070> we're<00:03:44.400> using

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
this will be our revenue we're using

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.690 
this will be our revenue we're using
like<00:03:44.820> business<00:03:45.299> terms<00:03:45.570> ok<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.829> one<00:03:47.489> of<00:03:47.579> the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
like business terms ok and one of the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.270 
like business terms ok and one of the
things<00:03:48.180> we<00:03:48.299> get<00:03:48.420> out<00:03:48.570> of<00:03:48.600> here<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.260> ADH<00:03:49.799> now

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
things we get out of here is in ADH now

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.660 
things we get out of here is in ADH now
remember<00:03:51.470> these<00:03:52.470> are<00:03:52.530> high-energy<00:03:53.010> electrons

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
remember these are high-energy electrons

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.060 
remember these are high-energy electrons
and<00:03:53.940> they're<00:03:54.570> gonna<00:03:54.780> go<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.350> electron

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
and they're gonna go to the electron

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.710 
and they're gonna go to the electron
transport<00:03:56.160> chain<00:03:56.610> where<00:03:57.299> it's<00:03:57.480> going<00:03:57.660> to

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
transport chain where it's going to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.620 
transport chain where it's going to
produce<00:03:57.840> even<00:03:58.170> more<00:03:58.320> ATP<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.519> then<00:04:00.360> this

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
produce even more ATP and then this

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.690 
produce even more ATP and then this
pyruvic<00:04:01.140> acid<00:04:01.560> also<00:04:01.769> knows<00:04:01.890> pyruvate<00:04:02.459> is

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
pyruvic acid also knows pyruvate is

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:10.880 
pyruvic acid also knows pyruvate is
going<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.829> go<00:04:04.829> to<00:04:06.079> The<00:04:07.079> Cribs<00:04:09.170> all<00:04:10.170> right<00:04:10.290> let's

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
going to go to The Cribs all right let's

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.180 
going to go to The Cribs all right let's
go<00:04:10.980> back<00:04:11.130> here<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:12.620> spending<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.860> then

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
go back here to spending and then

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.490 
go back here to spending and then
getting<00:04:14.519> some<00:04:14.670> revenue<00:04:15.090> alright<00:04:15.570> so<00:04:16.200> if<00:04:16.320> we

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
getting some revenue alright so if we

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.789 
getting some revenue alright so if we
take<00:04:16.739> our<00:04:17.010> revenue<00:04:18.320> this<00:04:19.320> is<00:04:19.470> just<00:04:19.620> business

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
take our revenue this is just business

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.860 
take our revenue this is just business
terms<00:04:20.160> again<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:21.030> we're<00:04:21.180> going<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.390> subtract

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
terms again and we're going to subtract

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.550 
terms again and we're going to subtract
our<00:04:22.079> costs<00:04:22.830> or<00:04:23.960> overhead<00:04:24.960> that's<00:04:25.229> what<00:04:25.410> this

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
our costs or overhead that's what this

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.520 
our costs or overhead that's what this
would<00:04:25.770> be<00:04:26.000> that's<00:04:27.000> going<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.240> equal<00:04:27.530> your

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
would be that's going to equal your

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.279 
would be that's going to equal your
profit<00:04:29.220> or<00:04:29.539> sometimes<00:04:30.539> it's<00:04:30.720> referred<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:31.110> as

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
profit or sometimes it's referred to as

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.130 
profit or sometimes it's referred to as
net<00:04:31.950> income<00:04:32.220> all<00:04:33.030> right<00:04:33.150> so<00:04:33.750> our<00:04:33.780> revenue

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
net income all right so our revenue

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.930 
net income all right so our revenue
let's<00:04:34.919> pick<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.160> different<00:04:35.220> color<00:04:35.610> here<00:04:35.760> let's

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
let's pick a different color here let's

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.810 
let's pick a different color here let's
go<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.120> blue

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
go to blue

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.760 
go to blue
revenue<00:04:38.330> was<00:04:38.920> 480p<00:04:41.560> subtracting<00:04:42.560> our

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
revenue was 480p subtracting our

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.290 
revenue was 480p subtracting our
overhead<00:04:43.280> cost<00:04:43.580> which<00:04:43.940> was<00:04:44.180> 2<00:04:44.570> ATP<00:04:45.290> and<00:04:46.120> so<00:04:47.120> our

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
overhead cost which was 2 ATP and so our

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.190 
overhead cost which was 2 ATP and so our
profit<00:04:47.900> would<00:04:48.590> be<00:04:48.650> 2<00:04:49.390> ATP<00:04:50.390> molecules<00:04:50.960> and

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
profit would be 2 ATP molecules and

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.290 
profit would be 2 ATP molecules and
that's<00:04:51.800> where<00:04:51.980> this<00:04:52.100> comes<00:04:52.370> from<00:04:52.460> we<00:04:52.850> have<00:04:53.060> a

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
that's where this comes from we have a

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.080 
that's where this comes from we have a
net<00:04:53.780> gain<00:04:54.620> of<00:04:54.950> 2<00:04:55.700> ATP<00:04:56.510> all<00:04:57.110> right<00:04:57.260> so<00:04:57.890> this<00:04:58.880> will

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
net gain of 2 ATP all right so this will

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.090 
net gain of 2 ATP all right so this will
