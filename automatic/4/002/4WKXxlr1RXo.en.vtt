00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.319 
in itself when you take your vitamins

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
so what it starts off with is

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.360 
so what it starts off with is
multivitamin<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.739> wanted<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.040> have<00:02:17.219> it

I had a b12 vitamin that I would stick

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.330 
I had a b12 vitamin that I would stick
under<00:04:18.870> my<00:04:18.959> tongue<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.440> let<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.650> dissolve<00:04:19.829> it

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
under my tongue and let it dissolve it

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
be a little bit deficient in b12 so

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.140 
be a little bit deficient in b12 so
you're<00:04:24.090> gonna<00:04:24.210> want<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.630> take<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.080> um

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
you're gonna want to take that um

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.760 
you're gonna want to take that um
calcium<00:04:27.810> you're<00:04:28.080> gonna<00:04:28.169> want<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.440> take<00:04:28.590> some

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
calcium you're gonna want to take some

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.640 
calcium you're gonna want to take some
calcium<00:04:29.330> now<00:04:30.330> there<00:04:30.570> is<00:04:30.690> a<00:04:30.720> rule<00:04:30.990> if<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.380> have

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
calcium now there is a rule if you have

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.460 
calcium now there is a rule if you have
to<00:04:32.040> take<00:04:32.509> iron<00:04:33.509> and<00:04:34.190> calcium<00:04:35.449> you<00:04:36.449> cannot<00:04:37.080> take

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
to take iron and calcium you cannot take

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.790 
to take iron and calcium you cannot take
them<00:04:37.650> together<00:04:37.979> and<00:04:38.810> I<00:04:39.810> don't<00:04:40.259> know<00:04:40.380> if<00:04:40.500> you

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
them together and I don't know if you

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.379 
them together and I don't know if you
were<00:04:40.979> taught<00:04:41.250> this<00:04:41.430> by<00:04:41.639> your<00:04:41.789> doctor<00:04:41.940> or<00:04:42.240> not

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
were taught this by your doctor or not

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.730 
were taught this by your doctor or not
but<00:04:42.570> if<00:04:42.690> you<00:04:42.870> take<00:04:43.110> iron<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.620> calcium

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
but if you take iron and calcium

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.520 
but if you take iron and calcium
together<00:04:44.400> they<00:04:45.030> are<00:04:45.060> both<00:04:45.449> taken<00:04:46.169> into<00:04:46.410> your

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
together they are both taken into your

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.270 
together they are both taken into your
body<00:04:46.710> with<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.070> same<00:04:47.340> receptor<00:04:48.030> so<00:04:49.100> if<00:04:50.100> you've

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
body with the same receptor so if you've

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.820 
body with the same receptor so if you've
taken<00:04:50.460> them<00:04:50.639> both<00:04:50.820> I<00:04:50.940> think<00:04:50.970> it's<00:04:51.270> calcium<00:04:51.830> or

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
taken them both I think it's calcium or

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.640 
taken them both I think it's calcium or
iron<00:04:53.160> one<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.120> them<00:04:54.330> will<00:04:54.990> block<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.530> other

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
iron one of them will block the other

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.560 
iron one of them will block the other
one<00:04:55.830> from<00:04:56.039> getting<00:04:56.310> absorbed<00:04:56.759> and<00:04:56.970> it's<00:04:57.300> like

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
one from getting absorbed and it's like

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.370 
one from getting absorbed and it's like
not<00:04:57.840> even<00:04:57.990> taking<00:04:58.530> iron<00:04:58.770> or<00:04:59.610> calcium<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.720> don't

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
not even taking iron or calcium I don't

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.100 
not even taking iron or calcium I don't
remember<00:05:01.560> which<00:05:01.860> one<00:05:01.919> it<00:05:02.220> is<00:05:02.250> anyways<00:05:03.150> don't

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
remember which one it is anyways don't

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.409 
remember which one it is anyways don't
take<00:05:04.410> them<00:05:04.590> together<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:05.070> take<00:05:06.000> them<00:05:06.210> at

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
take them together and take them at

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.750 
take them together and take them at
separate<00:05:06.780> times<00:05:06.930> during<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.440> day<00:05:07.590> or<00:05:07.919> I<00:05:08.340> think

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
separate times during the day or I think

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.409 
separate times during the day or I think
it's<00:05:08.850> like<00:05:08.970> an<00:05:09.060> hour<00:05:09.210> apart<00:05:09.660> or<00:05:09.840> something<00:05:10.229> but

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
it's like an hour apart or something but

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.860 
it's like an hour apart or something but
calcium<00:05:12.419> you<00:05:13.350> can<00:05:13.620> take<00:05:14.240> there's<00:05:15.240> chewable

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
calcium you can take there's chewable

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.469 
calcium you can take there's chewable
ones<00:05:16.139> that<00:05:16.530> are<00:05:16.650> like<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:17.220> had<00:05:18.030> some<00:05:18.300> that<00:05:18.419> were

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
ones that are like I had some that were

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:19.790 
ones that are like I had some that were
really<00:05:18.750> good<00:05:18.960> from<00:05:19.229> bariatric<00:05:19.740> advantage

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
really good from bariatric advantage

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.520 
really good from bariatric advantage
they<00:05:20.310> were<00:05:20.370> like<00:05:20.580> chocolate<00:05:21.180> shoes<00:05:21.599> it<00:05:22.410> was
