like<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.730> talk<00:00:08.940> about<00:00:09.000> pre-soaking<00:00:09.870> versus<00:00:10.500> no

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
like to talk about pre-soaking versus no

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.470 
like to talk about pre-soaking versus no
pre-soaking<00:00:11.129> when<00:00:11.730> you're<00:00:11.849> processing<00:00:12.330> your

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
pre-soaking when you're processing your

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.240 
pre-soaking when you're processing your
film<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.320> goes<00:00:13.500> for<00:00:13.679> scene<00:00:13.860> film<00:00:14.099> or

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
film and that goes for scene film or

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.280 
film and that goes for scene film or
roll<00:00:14.490> films<00:00:14.849> now<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.420> only<00:00:15.840> method<00:00:16.200> I'd

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
roll films now the only method I'd

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.410 
roll films now the only method I'd
recommend<00:00:16.770> when<00:00:16.920> no<00:00:17.130> pre-soaking<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.970> when

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
recommend when no pre-soaking is when

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.300 
recommend when no pre-soaking is when
you<00:00:18.509> use<00:00:18.689> the<00:00:18.840> BTS<00:00:19.170> tubes<00:00:19.680> they<00:00:20.250> were

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
you use the BTS tubes they were

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.359 
you use the BTS tubes they were
described<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.149> a<00:00:21.239> previous<00:00:21.689> video<00:00:22.310> did<00:00:23.310> a

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
described in a previous video did a

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.190 
described in a previous video did a
couple<00:00:23.520> of<00:00:23.640> years<00:00:23.849> ago<00:00:24.000> now<00:00:24.599> with<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> BTS

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
couple of years ago now with the BTS

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.049 
couple of years ago now with the BTS
tubes<00:00:25.619> what<00:00:25.829> you<00:00:25.919> do<00:00:26.040> is<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.579> two<00:00:26.759> ounces

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:27.059 
tubes what you do is you have two ounces

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.060 
tubes what you do is you have two ounces
of<00:00:27.119> developer<00:00:27.509> for<00:00:27.689> each<00:00:27.809> tube<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.649> when<00:00:28.980> you

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
of developer for each tube and when you

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.010 
of developer for each tube and when you
start<00:00:29.309> the<00:00:29.430> developing<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.390> actually<00:00:30.779> shake

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
start the developing you actually shake

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.630 
start the developing you actually shake
the<00:00:31.169> tubes<00:00:31.410> vigorously<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.220> about<00:00:32.399> 10

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the tubes vigorously for about 10

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.490 
the tubes vigorously for about 10
seconds<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.480> emotion<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.020> immediately

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
seconds the emotion is immediately

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.920 
seconds the emotion is immediately
coated<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.190> there's<00:00:36.120> really<00:00:36.360> no<00:00:36.600> need<00:00:36.630> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
coated and there's really no need to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.270 
coated and there's really no need to
pre-soak<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.590> you're<00:00:37.740> continuously

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
pre-soak and you're continuously

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.880 
pre-soak and you're continuously
agitating<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.060> tube<00:00:39.240> by<00:00:39.450> spinning<00:00:39.900> and<00:00:40.230> this

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
agitating the tube by spinning and this

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.830 
agitating the tube by spinning and this
is<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> test<00:00:41.460> basically<00:00:42.390> well<00:00:42.600> how<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
is what the test basically well how the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.400 
is what the test basically well how the
results<00:00:43.260> look<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.980> we're<00:00:44.160> doing<00:00:44.280> 400<00:00:44.910> T<00:00:45.060> max

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
results look so we're doing 400 T max

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
results look so we're doing 400 T max
that's<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.710> new<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:47.040> number<00:00:47.250> two<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.850> four<00:00:48.180> by

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
that's the new one number two in four by

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.050 
that's the new one number two in four by
five<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.260> speed<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.620> 400<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.310> developer<00:00:50.730> uses

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
five the speed is 400 the developer uses

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.780

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
people know I'm in Arizona and we've got

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.590 
people know I'm in Arizona and we've got
85<00:00:58.800> 90<00:00:59.160> degree<00:00:59.400> cold<00:00:59.640> water<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.030> summer<00:01:00.300> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
85 90 degree cold water in the summer so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.990 
85 90 degree cold water in the summer so
we<00:01:00.810> don't<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> lot<00:01:01.200> of<00:01:01.230> choices<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.000> these

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
we don't have a lot of choices and these

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
we don't have a lot of choices and these
were<00:01:03.120> done<00:01:03.239> again<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.810> BTS<00:01:04.110> tubes<00:01:04.589> so

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
were done again with the BTS tubes so

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.180 
were done again with the BTS tubes so
there's<00:01:05.309> actually<00:01:05.970> no<00:01:06.180> pre<00:01:06.420> soaked<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.190> the

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
there's actually no pre soaked and the

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.550 
there's actually no pre soaked and the
results<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:09.030> are<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.380> let<00:01:10.530> me

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
results you get are right here let me

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.690 
results you get are right here let me
just<00:01:10.770> show<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.070> easier<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.400> understand

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
just show you it's easier to understand

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.100 
just show you it's easier to understand
the<00:01:11.850> subject<00:01:12.060> brightness<00:01:12.570> range<00:01:12.810> curve

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the subject brightness range curve

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.950 
the subject brightness range curve
because<00:01:13.920> we're<00:01:14.130> looking<00:01:14.400> year's<00:01:14.610> leaf<00:01:14.820> or<00:01:15.030> if

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
because we're looking year's leaf or if

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.870 
because we're looking year's leaf or if
seven<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.740> our<00:01:16.920> normal<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.700> solid

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
seven is our normal you see the solid

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.000 
seven is our normal you see the solid
line<00:01:18.210> right<00:01:18.510> here<00:01:18.810> we're<00:01:19.350> usually<00:01:19.530> looking<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
line right here we're usually looking to

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.130 
line right here we're usually looking to
get<00:01:20.159> at<00:01:20.280> least<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.909> nine<00:01:21.180> which<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.780> subject

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
get at least out to nine which a subject

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.840 
get at least out to nine which a subject
price<00:01:22.290> range<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.650> nine<00:01:22.799> which<00:01:22.979> would<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.190> two

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
price range of nine which would be two

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.000 
price range of nine which would be two
stops<00:01:24.120> more<00:01:24.450> contrast<00:01:24.990> than<00:01:25.080> normal<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.710> at

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
stops more contrast than normal and at

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.710 
stops more contrast than normal and at
least<00:01:26.159> down<00:01:26.400> over<00:01:26.580> five<00:01:26.850> which<00:01:27.120> is<00:01:27.299> 2<00:01:27.450> stops

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
least down over five which is 2 stops

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.870 
least down over five which is 2 stops
less<00:01:27.960> contrast<00:01:28.409> than<00:01:28.590> normal<00:01:28.890> most<00:01:29.490> film<00:01:29.729> end

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
less contrast than normal most film end

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.370 
less contrast than normal most film end
developers<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.229> may<00:01:31.350> have

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
developers can do that but you may have

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.080 
developers can do that but you may have
to<00:01:31.530> adjust<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:32.010> dilution<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.549> order<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.940> do

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
to adjust the dilution in order to do

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.420 
to adjust the dilution in order to do
that<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.960> with<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.260> film<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.710> was<00:01:34.890> no<00:01:35.250> problem

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
that so with this film it was no problem

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.740 
that so with this film it was no problem
to<00:01:35.670> get<00:01:35.820> all<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.180> here<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:38.510> let's<00:01:39.510> see<00:01:39.630> how

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
to get all this here so let's see how

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.539 
to get all this here so let's see how
the<00:01:39.810> film<00:01:40.049> speeds<00:01:40.350> look<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.369> nice<00:01:41.520> thing

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the film speeds look and the nice thing

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.330 
the film speeds look and the nice thing
I<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.940> about<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.470> 4d<00:01:43.470> DX<00:01:43.830> you<00:01:44.190> get

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
I like about the 4d DX you get

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.980 
I like about the 4d DX you get
incredible<00:01:44.850> film<00:01:45.060> speeds<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.510> you<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.780> see

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
incredible film speeds as you can see

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.020 
incredible film speeds as you can see
we're<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:46.680> bit<00:01:46.890> past<00:01:46.920> 400<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.880> when

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
we're a little bit past 400 so when

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.510 
we're a little bit past 400 so when
people<00:01:48.210> say<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:49.500> cutting<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> film<00:01:50.130> speed<00:01:50.400> in

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
people say I'm cutting the film speed in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.010 
people say I'm cutting the film speed in
half<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:50.970> depends<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.659> film<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
half it all depends on the film and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.390 
half it all depends on the film and
developer<00:01:52.439> combination<00:01:52.979> you're<00:01:53.070> working

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
developer combination you're working

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.609 
developer combination you're working
with<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:54.240> elfrid<00:01:54.600> DDX<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.229> tend<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.470> get

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
with with elfrid DDX you tend to get

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.219 
with with elfrid DDX you tend to get
incredible<00:01:56.130> film<00:01:56.340> speeds<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.990> it's<00:01:57.990> just

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
incredible film speeds and it's just

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.109 
incredible film speeds and it's just
even<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.619> little<00:01:58.799> bit<00:01:58.979> more<00:01:59.220> than<00:01:59.369> your<00:01:59.850> normal

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
even a little bit more than your normal

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.850 
even a little bit more than your normal
400<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:00.869> that's<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> reasons<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.680> like

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
400 so that's one of the reasons I like

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.320 
400 so that's one of the reasons I like
it<00:02:02.070> especially<00:02:02.610> when<00:02:02.909> you're<00:02:03.030> doing<00:02:03.090> night

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
it especially when you're doing night

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.609 
it especially when you're doing night
photography<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:04.049> gives<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.470> little

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
photography it gives you that little

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.999 
photography it gives you that little
extra<00:02:04.770> edge<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:06.259> this<00:02:07.259> was<00:02:07.409> done<00:02:07.560> at<00:02:07.680> 1:00<00:02:07.860> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
extra edge so this was done at 1:00 to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.770 
extra edge so this was done at 1:00 to
9:00<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> tubes<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.209> next<00:02:09.479> test<00:02:09.629> I'm

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
9:00 with the tubes the next test I'm

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.509 
9:00 with the tubes the next test I'm
going<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.959> go<00:02:10.049> over<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:11.280> same

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
going to go over with you is the same

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.589 
going to go over with you is the same
exact<00:02:11.909> film<00:02:12.180> combination<00:02:13.909> 400<00:02:14.909> T<00:02:15.060> Max<00:02:15.329> and

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
exact film combination 400 T Max and

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.420 
exact film combination 400 T Max and
this<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.109> done<00:02:16.260> an<00:02:16.379> enjoyable<00:02:16.680> process<00:02:16.950> of

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
this is done an enjoyable process of

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.550 
this is done an enjoyable process of
five<00:02:17.670> minute<00:02:17.939> pre<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.299> now<00:02:18.870> pre-soaking<00:02:19.319> you

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
five minute pre so now pre-soaking you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.589 
five minute pre so now pre-soaking you
will<00:02:20.069> want<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.370> do<00:02:20.549> with<00:02:20.849> processors<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:21.540> a

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
will want to do with processors like a

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.979 
will want to do with processors like a
Jobo<00:02:22.579> because<00:02:23.579> the<00:02:23.700> chemical<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.480> developer

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
Jobo because the chemical the developer

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.289 
Jobo because the chemical the developer
Etta's<00:02:25.260> comes<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.159> slowly<00:02:26.549> as<00:02:26.849> you're<00:02:27.060> pouring

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
Etta's comes in slowly as you're pouring

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.420 
Etta's comes in slowly as you're pouring
it<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:27.689> and<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.290> slowly<00:02:28.530> coats<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.129> you<00:02:29.189> do

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
it in and it's slowly coats so you do

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.339 
it in and it's slowly coats so you do
want<00:02:29.579> to<00:02:29.609> do<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> five<00:02:30.060> minute<00:02:30.090> pre<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:30.689> the<00:02:31.109> same

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
want to do a five minute pre so the same

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.780 
want to do a five minute pre so the same
way<00:02:31.500> if<00:02:31.590> you're<00:02:31.709> doing<00:02:31.739> like<00:02:32.010> roll<00:02:32.280> films<00:02:32.640> and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
way if you're doing like roll films and

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
way if you're doing like roll films and
a<00:02:32.819> hand<00:02:33.030> tank<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:33.510> you're<00:02:33.599> doing

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
a hand tank and you're doing

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.720 
a hand tank and you're doing
intermittent<00:02:34.290> agitation<00:02:34.889> and<00:02:35.579> with

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
intermittent agitation and with

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.759 
intermittent agitation and with
inversions<00:02:36.389> when<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:36.989> pour<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.230> developer

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
inversions when you pour the developer

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.679 
inversions when you pour the developer
into<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.040> hand<00:02:38.280> tank<00:02:38.579> it<00:02:39.060> takes<00:02:39.359> a<00:02:39.450> little<00:02:39.569> bit

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
into the hand tank it takes a little bit

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.929 
into the hand tank it takes a little bit
of<00:02:39.750> time<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.200> get<00:02:40.319> into<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.799> tank<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.189> you<00:02:41.549> do

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
of time to get into the tank so you do

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.399 
of time to get into the tank so you do
want<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.269> five<00:02:42.540> minute<00:02:42.569> pre<00:02:42.959> soaked<00:02:43.200> with

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
want to do a five minute pre soaked with

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.259 
want to do a five minute pre soaked with
these<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.859> I<00:02:44.280> remember<00:02:44.579> conversation<00:02:45.150> with

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
these and I remember conversation with

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.910 
these and I remember conversation with
Phil<00:02:45.450> Davis<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.870> long<00:02:46.019> time<00:02:46.260> ago<00:02:46.500> about<00:02:46.769> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
Phil Davis a long time ago about the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.339 
Phil Davis a long time ago about the
fact<00:02:47.129> that<00:02:47.219> when<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.150> do<00:02:48.299> pre<00:02:48.569> soap<00:02:48.780> versus<00:02:49.170> no

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
fact that when you do pre soap versus no

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.319 
fact that when you do pre soap versus no
pre<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:49.829> you<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.459> get<00:02:50.609> changes<00:02:50.939> in<00:02:51.000> film

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
pre so you can get changes in film

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.300 
pre so you can get changes in film
speeds<00:02:51.659> changes<00:02:52.169> in<00:02:52.260> developing<00:02:52.680> times<00:02:52.950> and

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
speeds changes in developing times and

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.030 
speeds changes in developing times and
you'll<00:02:53.730> see<00:02:53.879> what<00:02:54.000> happened<00:02:54.269> when<00:02:54.359> I<00:02:54.389> went<00:02:54.659> to

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
you'll see what happened when I went to

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.589 
you'll see what happened when I went to
doing<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.129> same<00:02:56.340> exact<00:02:56.700> film<00:02:56.909> combination

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
doing the same exact film combination

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.780 
doing the same exact film combination
and<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:58.379> had<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.620> change<00:02:58.859> my<00:02:59.040> dilution<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.639> I'll

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
and I had to change my dilution and I'll

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.000 
and I had to change my dilution and I'll
show<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.180> few<00:03:00.329> minutes

hi I'm back again now with the second
part<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.709> video<00:03:04.799> here<00:03:05.189> we're<00:03:05.400> doing<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
part of the video here we're doing the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.899 
part of the video here we're doing the
same<00:03:06.419> film<00:03:06.810> same<00:03:07.680> developer<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.790> what

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
same film same developer but what

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.490 
same film same developer but what
happens<00:03:09.269> was<00:03:09.450> when<00:03:09.629> I<00:03:09.659> went<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.959> one<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.319> nine

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
happens was when I went to one to nine

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.709 
happens was when I went to one to nine
dilution<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.370> contrast<00:03:11.879> was<00:03:12.000> way<00:03:12.239> too<00:03:12.299> great

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
dilution the contrast was way too great

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.080 
dilution the contrast was way too great
so<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:13.019> just<00:03:13.469> bumped<00:03:14.129> up<00:03:14.219> the<00:03:14.250> loot<00:03:14.549> dilution

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
so I just bumped up the loot dilution

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.610 
so I just bumped up the loot dilution

range of five no problem with either of
these<00:03:44.879> developers<00:03:45.449> the<00:03:45.900> only<00:03:46.169> thing<00:03:46.349> I<00:03:46.470> did<00:03:46.650> do

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
these developers the only thing I did do

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.490 
these developers the only thing I did do
was<00:03:47.069> increase<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.759> amount<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.269> developer<00:03:48.840> per

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
was increase the amount of developer per

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.890 
was increase the amount of developer per
area<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.579> film<00:03:50.849> so<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.030> went<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.329> four<00:03:51.569> ounces

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
area of film so I went to four ounces

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.629 
area of film so I went to four ounces
per<00:03:52.079> area<00:03:52.439> so<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.709> just<00:03:52.949> doubled<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> amount<00:03:53.400> of

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
per area so I just doubled the amount of

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.759 
per area so I just doubled the amount of
developer<00:03:54.090> because<00:03:54.509> elfrid<00:03:54.959> DDX<00:03:55.349> when<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.650> go

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
developer because elfrid DDX when you go

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.379 
developer because elfrid DDX when you go
beyond<00:03:56.040> one<00:03:56.250> past<00:03:56.489> nine<00:03:56.759> you<00:03:56.909> really<00:03:57.150> got<00:03:57.299> to

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
beyond one past nine you really got to

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.449 
beyond one past nine you really got to
increase<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.900> because<00:03:58.079> it<00:03:58.199> loses<00:03:58.319> strength<00:03:58.680> so

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
increase it because it loses strength so

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.339 
increase it because it loses strength so
one<00:04:00.449> of<00:04:00.479> the<00:04:00.629> things<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:00.959> said<00:04:01.139> I<00:04:01.169> had<00:04:01.319> a

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
one of the things that said I had a

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.409 
one of the things that said I had a
conversation<00:04:01.650> with<00:04:01.979> Phil<00:04:02.189> Davis<00:04:02.519> along<00:04:02.639> many

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
conversation with Phil Davis along many

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.420 
conversation with Phil Davis along many
years<00:04:03.659> ago<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.169> one<00:04:04.949> of<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.129> things<00:04:05.310> you

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
years ago and one of the things you

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.819 
years ago and one of the things you
could<00:04:05.549> find<00:04:05.819> is<00:04:06.030> when<00:04:06.479> you're<00:04:06.599> doing<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:07.590> same

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
could find is when you're doing the same

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.640 
could find is when you're doing the same
film<00:04:08.159> the<00:04:08.549> same<00:04:08.759> developer<00:04:09.449> pre-soak<00:04:10.290> versus

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
film the same developer pre-soak versus

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.619 
film the same developer pre-soak versus
no<00:04:10.799> pre-soaked<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:11.669> could<00:04:11.879> change<00:04:12.120> your<00:04:12.239> I

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
no pre-soaked you could change your I

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.240 
no pre-soaked you could change your I
had<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:12.959> change<00:04:13.199> the<00:04:13.259> dilution<00:04:13.650> here<00:04:13.949> in<00:04:14.040> order

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
had to change the dilution here in order

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.770 
had to change the dilution here in order
to<00:04:14.370> do<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:14.669> let's<00:04:15.090> take<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.269> look<00:04:15.419> at<00:04:15.479> the<00:04:15.569> film

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
to do it let's take a look at the film

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.629 
to do it let's take a look at the film
speeds<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.500> film<00:04:16.739> speeds<00:04:16.979> are<00:04:17.130> quite<00:04:17.159> similar

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
speeds the film speeds are quite similar

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.189 
speeds the film speeds are quite similar
but<00:04:17.940> not<00:04:18.030> exactly<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:18.630> same<00:04:18.810> as<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.049> last

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
but not exactly the same as the last

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.490 
but not exactly the same as the last
time

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
time

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.649 
time
we're<00:04:19.949> still<00:04:20.190> getting<00:04:20.909> pretty<00:04:21.269> close<00:04:21.479> for

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
we're still getting pretty close for

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.570 
we're still getting pretty close for
normal<00:04:22.019> in<00:04:22.139> the<00:04:22.320> 400<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.039> little<00:04:23.310> bit<00:04:23.430> more

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
normal in the 400 and a little bit more

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.129 
normal in the 400 and a little bit more
range<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.300> film<00:04:24.509> street<00:04:24.690> was<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.840> little<00:04:25.050> bit

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
range the film street was a little bit

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.680 
range the film street was a little bit
closer<00:04:25.380> here<00:04:25.620> before<00:04:25.979> so<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:27.180> quickest<00:04:27.570> way

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
closer here before so the quickest way

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.719 
closer here before so the quickest way
to<00:04:27.719> find<00:04:28.020> out<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.529> information<00:04:29.159> is<00:04:29.340> just<00:04:29.370> to

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
to find out the information is just to

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.020 
to find out the information is just to
do<00:04:29.849> a<00:04:29.880> BTS<00:04:30.510> film

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
do a BTS film

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.780 
do a BTS film
to<00:04:31.150> get<00:04:31.660> you<00:04:31.810> all<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.020> information<00:04:32.170> and<00:04:32.980> just

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
to get you all the information and just

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.540 
to get you all the information and just
because<00:04:34.120> they<00:04:34.300> say<00:04:34.540> you<00:04:34.570> can't<00:04:35.020> do<00:04:35.230> it<00:04:35.550> it

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
because they say you can't do it it

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.460 
because they say you can't do it it
doesn't<00:04:36.820> mean<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.270> can't<00:04:37.570> in<00:04:38.080> other<00:04:38.200> words<00:04:38.380> if

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
doesn't mean you can't in other words if

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.650 
doesn't mean you can't in other words if
they<00:04:38.590> say<00:04:38.770> no<00:04:38.950> priest<00:04:39.220> so<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.610> would<00:04:40.270> just<00:04:40.420> try

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
they say no priest so I would just try

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.730 
they say no priest so I would just try
it<00:04:40.720> I<00:04:40.960> mean<00:04:41.110> what<00:04:41.260> do<00:04:41.320> you<00:04:41.350> got<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.590> lose<00:04:41.620> a

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
it I mean what do you got to lose a

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.560 
it I mean what do you got to lose a
couple<00:04:41.980> of<00:04:42.100> sheets<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.430> film<00:04:42.610> but<00:04:43.180> basically

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
couple of sheets of film but basically

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.420 
couple of sheets of film but basically
that<00:04:43.960> doesn't<00:04:44.620> matter<00:04:44.770> whether<00:04:44.980> you're<00:04:45.160> doing

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
that doesn't matter whether you're doing

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.430 
that doesn't matter whether you're doing
it<00:04:45.580> one<00:04:45.910> way<00:04:46.060> or<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.210> other<00:04:46.300> but<00:04:46.960> depending<00:04:47.350> on

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
it one way or the other but depending on

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.740 
it one way or the other but depending on
the<00:04:47.530> method<00:04:47.770> that<00:04:48.040> you're<00:04:48.220> doing<00:04:48.580> if<00:04:49.240> it's<00:04:49.570> the

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
the method that you're doing if it's the

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.200 
the method that you're doing if it's the
two<00:04:49.960> bgs<00:04:50.740> tubes<00:04:50.980> you<00:04:51.340> definitely<00:04:51.820> don't<00:04:51.970> need

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
two bgs tubes you definitely don't need

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.020 
two bgs tubes you definitely don't need
a<00:04:52.270> pre-soak<00:04:52.810> but<00:04:53.290> if<00:04:53.380> you're<00:04:53.500> doing<00:04:53.710> Jobos<00:04:54.160> you

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
a pre-soak but if you're doing Jobos you

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.500 
a pre-soak but if you're doing Jobos you
know<00:04:55.120> in<00:04:55.270> a<00:04:55.540> tray<00:04:55.840> or<00:04:55.890> any<00:04:56.890> kind<00:04:57.160> of<00:04:57.220> other

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
know in a tray or any kind of other

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.580 
know in a tray or any kind of other
developing<00:04:58.510> methods<00:04:58.870> I<00:04:59.050> definitely

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
developing methods I definitely

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.410 
developing methods I definitely
recommend<00:04:59.890> a<00:05:00.190> 5-minute<00:05:00.790> pre-soaked<00:05:01.240> and

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
recommend a 5-minute pre-soaked and

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.600 
recommend a 5-minute pre-soaked and
that'll<00:05:01.960> get<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.230> the<00:05:02.320> best<00:05:02.440> results<00:05:02.980> because

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
that'll get you the best results because

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.690 
that'll get you the best results because
the<00:05:03.900> developer<00:05:04.900> comes<00:05:05.140> down<00:05:05.320> too<00:05:05.950> slowly<00:05:06.310> and

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
the developer comes down too slowly and

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.010 
the developer comes down too slowly and
you<00:05:06.880> could<00:05:07.090> get<00:05:07.240> a<00:05:07.270> little<00:05:07.360> streaking<00:05:07.900> or

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
you could get a little streaking or

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.440 
you could get a little streaking or
other<00:05:08.140> problems<00:05:08.590> so<00:05:08.830> it's<00:05:09.490> what<00:05:10.240> I<00:05:10.270> would

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
other problems so it's what I would

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.720 
other problems so it's what I would
recommend<00:05:10.600> I<00:05:11.110> hope<00:05:11.680> this<00:05:11.830> helps<00:05:12.160> understand<00:05:12.640> a

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
recommend I hope this helps understand a

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.340 
recommend I hope this helps understand a
little<00:05:12.880> bit<00:05:13.030> better<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:13.570> again<00:05:14.110> if<00:05:14.230> you

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.930 
little bit better and again if you
really<00:05:14.530> want<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.890> get<00:05:15.010> the<00:05:15.190> best<00:05:15.340> results<00:05:15.790> a
