00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.290

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.270
 Woodruff I have friendly wise 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.760
 get this knife here is that 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:14.200
 yes kit karl v 3 and I will now 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.200
 test times and take it really hard 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.020
 look at the technical first 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.310
 Of course, you can find data on them all 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.380
 again down in the infobox 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.140
 it is the hunting and outdoor 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.900
 fair hunting knv three marcus golling 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.830
 since a total length of about 20 cm 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.660
 and the blade length is 84 mm the 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.350
 Sound is thick, after all 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.489
 Four and a half mm the blade is made of one 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.820
 stainless steel made gb 19 r18 mv 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.739
 with at least 59 rockwell for one 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.720
 Stainless steel is not bad 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.780
 Of course it's a fullhd hang steel 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.110
 So he's really got through 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.240
 upper section a flat cut and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.720
 Below is balked at the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.210
 cutting edge 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.650
 the grip is gummed and that's why 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.740
 The knife is also great in the hand 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.250
 so do not slip anything it weighs 156 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.440
 Gram without divorce and 202 came with the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.229
 Kalkscheune 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.820
 apropos skalik this is a pity fashion and 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.650
 techno compatible that means if you can do that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.479
 Velcro strip off here makes that is namely 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.100
 screwed on then you can 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.950
 for example, a day off 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.939
 could relate to the knife 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.189
 shop vom lasse www waldlÃ¤ufer shop.de 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.329
 I then have the link displayed and 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.950
 you can find that again in the 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.570
 infobox for currently 79 eur 99 to all this 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.710
 Knife has made such a beautiful oeser 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.710
 We also equal to a hand loop purely 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.979
 still 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.840
 the city good for chopping eg 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:43.149
 after the whole tour is still the 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:57.429
 paper test times look like creates 

00:06:43.149 --> 00:07:00.009
 knife is still great shaaf always 

00:06:57.429 --> 00:07:01.779
 still a small conclusion I think 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.300
 the better was great 

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:06.849
 when carving it was perfect at 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.649
 The fans worked great when 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:10.029
 hack okay there is the low weight 

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:13.089
 after particle as well is the 

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:14.349
 I attacked very far back 

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:15.849
 hope you can see the Sun here 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:17.409
 that means you do not get it right 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:18.429
 swinging on it you have to take any 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:20.589
 help out 

00:07:18.429 --> 00:07:21.729
 When emphasizing, the blade is clear 

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:23.409
 not so bad long and that means for 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:25.330
 that works great pieces of wood too 

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:26.769
 not so good but you know that before 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.889
 you get the knife force so no 

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:31.300
 the topic of minor disadvantage may be 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:33.069
 the handle if it is really rough 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.169
 approaching and it suggests that maybe 

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:36.699
 accidentally somehow wrong then 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:38.050
 it can break pretty easily 

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:40.330
 go as rubber of the hero not as 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.829
 a lot of crazy but I guess 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.899
 that it knows the matter of taste, too 

00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:46.329
 one before 

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:46.930
 Overall, I have to say the steel of 

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:49.180
 the blade 

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.860
 he has been really great 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.779
 The knife really plagued by 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.339
 no longer works 

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:55.749
 but I did not make it 

00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:58.809
 somehow to bend or a jerk 

00:07:55.749 --> 00:08:00.519
 to clean up properly so far as to 

00:07:58.809 --> 00:08:02.349
 test thank you class that you give me that 

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:03.579
 I let you have a knife 

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:04.569
 just take a new turn and there 

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:07.329
 I will certainly one more 

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:08.860
 have fun with thank you for 

00:08:07.329 --> 00:08:11.279
 watching is good and until the 

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.279
 next time
