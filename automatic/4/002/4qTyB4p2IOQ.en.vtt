because<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.819> cube<00:03:22.120> takes<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.900> cast<00:03:23.110> animation

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
because the cube takes a cast animation

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.110 
because the cube takes a cast animation
and<00:03:23.920> cast<00:03:24.159> animations<00:03:24.640> will<00:03:24.760> slow<00:03:25.000> your

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
and cast animations will slow your

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.119 
and cast animations will slow your
character<00:03:25.540> down<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:26.019> it's<00:03:26.140> like<00:03:26.260> if<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:26.890> flash

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
character down so it's like if I flash

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.740 
character down so it's like if I flash
queued<00:03:27.489> before<00:03:27.909> he<00:03:28.030> cute<00:03:28.299> I<00:03:28.450> wouldn't<00:03:28.659> have

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
queued before he cute I wouldn't have

queued before he cute I wouldn't have
reached<00:03:28.930> him<00:03:29.110> but<00:03:29.260> since<00:03:29.409> he<00:03:29.500> started<00:03:30.069> his<00:03:30.310> Q

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
reached him but since he started his Q

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.460 
reached him but since he started his Q
animation<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.090> had<00:03:31.239> enough<00:03:31.450> distance

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
animation I had enough distance
