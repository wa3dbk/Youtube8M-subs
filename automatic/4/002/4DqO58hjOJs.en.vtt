also<00:01:44.729> prevents<00:01:45.210> tangles<00:01:46.880> we<00:01:47.880> know<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.060> when

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
also prevents tangles we know that when

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.770 
also prevents tangles we know that when
our<00:01:48.360> hair<00:01:48.780> shed<00:01:49.970> oftentimes<00:01:50.970> those

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
our hair shed oftentimes those

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.109 
our hair shed oftentimes those
hairs<00:01:52.079> don't<00:01:52.320> fall<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.399> our<00:01:53.820> head

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
hairs don't fall out of our head

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.630 
hairs don't fall out of our head
immediately<00:01:55.130> therefore<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.310> end<00:01:56.490> up

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
immediately therefore they end up

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.380 
immediately therefore they end up
getting<00:01:57.630> caught<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.110> our<00:01:58.259> other<00:01:58.439> curled<00:01:58.950> and

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
getting caught on our other curled and

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.469 
getting caught on our other curled and
that<00:02:00.390> cause<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:01.969> which<00:02:02.969> are<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.390> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
that cause it's not which are just a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.370 
that cause it's not which are just a
half<00:02:03.659> okay<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.969> it<00:02:05.969> prevents<00:02:06.390> those<00:02:06.810> types<00:02:07.229> of

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
half okay so it prevents those types of

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.990 
half okay so it prevents those types of
thing

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
thing

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.850 
thing
happening<00:02:08.330> in<00:02:08.539> our<00:02:08.720> hair<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:11.420> my<00:02:11.930> next<00:02:12.170> topic

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
happening in our hair so my next topic

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.100 
happening in our hair so my next topic
or<00:02:13.850> question<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:15.940> wet<00:02:16.940> they<00:02:17.240> share<00:02:17.510> hair<00:02:17.840> being

or question is wet they share hair being
moved<00:02:19.070> trim<00:02:19.960> this<00:02:20.960> is<00:02:21.170> my<00:02:21.350> opinion<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:22.280> think

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
moved trim this is my opinion I think

moved trim this is my opinion I think
their<00:02:22.880> hair<00:02:23.090> should<00:02:23.300> be<00:02:23.360> dry<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.700> slightly

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
their hair should be dry and slightly

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.220 
their hair should be dry and slightly
straightened<00:02:27.320> um<00:02:28.600> when<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:29.630> got<00:02:29.870> my<00:02:30.020> hair

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230

think for a loser curls may be okay to
do<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.010> because<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.730> can<00:03:29.030> see<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.540> end<00:03:29.750> but

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
I thought that was the point that they

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.730 
I thought that was the point that they
made<00:05:14.139> on<00:05:14.259> that<00:05:14.320> website<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:15.190> check<00:05:15.490> it<00:05:15.910> out<00:05:16.090> Oh

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
made on that website so check it out Oh

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.969 
made on that website so check it out Oh

ends are looking you have to be aware of
how<00:06:01.750> it's<00:06:02.370> filling<00:06:03.479> um<00:06:04.479> and<00:06:05.909> you<00:06:06.909> know<00:06:06.940> if<00:06:07.419> you

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
how it's filling um and you know if you

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.159 
how it's filling um and you know if you
have<00:06:07.870> to<00:06:07.990> get<00:06:08.139> your<00:06:08.289> cut<00:06:08.919> every<00:06:09.340> two<00:06:09.550> months
