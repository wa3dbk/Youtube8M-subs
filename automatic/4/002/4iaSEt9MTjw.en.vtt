00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.989
 Hi all 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.380
 247 of tomorrow with a very chapter 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.920
 expected and very good so 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.920
 let's start 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:53.829
 well we started we had already passed 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.059
 They do not listen then and it will 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.829
 Mark the fault by understanding four faults 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.190
 the truth I thought we were going to see a 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.159
 little flight in the game that was going to have 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.960
 very careful in your play to not 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.259
 commit a fifth phase and that he no longer 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.110
 can go back to the games however not 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.509
 this happens this immediately what 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.200
 he sent to the bank he got that this 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.600
 it was to have it as we say an exit 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.149
 of emergency but they need to have three 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.860
 points or more play again singer and 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.869
 that still does not have its five faults and 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.360
 has no other state can enter 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.179
 can still enter later when 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.800
 it is returns to the bench many when 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.680
 absolutely all be overdue 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.690
 that we were asking to finish 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.410
 they have given up completely 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.240
 with the sudden this remembers everything that 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.010
 he said it 's fine until finally 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.590
 asks the coach to please 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.390
 do not let go even though you no longer have 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.479
 so much pressure to make matches 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.400
 who can do practically nothing asks 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.010
 and pray that they have their favor between the 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.300
 game and so is this surprising not only 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.130
 is clean all of us have the 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.440
 party like this one Europe enters 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.649
 supplant hitler trick enters the game 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.479
 finally and so here also tutor 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.730
 good to finally have passed that 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.520
 many of us were already waiting for finally group 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.930
 come back to play the whole question is 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.120
 who can not be you now if you 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.010
 narrowly lost for its nesting and 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.230
 which is perfectly and not if the only 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.110
 option you could have written what 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.959
 it was good to play basketball without zinc 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.340
 to be invisible but not to be 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.500
 completely visible placed is 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.160
 completely useless in a game of 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.040
 football 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.020
 so what can you do can 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.210
 exist the fact that seeing so many 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.640
 Sometimes this recorded game already knows which 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.870
 it's the weakness of the group but 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.880
 I honestly believe that this will not happen 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.030
 I think one is very aware that 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.580
 the group does not have this weaknesses and what 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.330
 only thing they can do is be better 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.280
 be better than them and play better and 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.040
 how is this ernesto now I put myself not 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.830
 it is invisible you need to do something else 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.600
 there maybe be completely different 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.340
 you just have to be good at playing 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.160
 and this we have not seen cameras and that 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.350
 it may surprise us all to have 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.620
 some plays that we have not seen 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.210
 never and I lean the internet for the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.040
 which I lean on the first and writer 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.300
 and is that product is going to enter the area 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.490
 and in august the skills 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.170
 communicants we have seen and it is all 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.850
 cause the one who does show me his 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.400
 true weakness we know that your 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.080
 ability is not what others are 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.330
 disequilibrate is not another that gives you no 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.040
 know for that pure that you need to be 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.710
 something incredibly good there is to enter 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.530
 to the area you can imagine entering 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.080
 it would be something epic and great as he is he 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.120
 the and loading are responsible for 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.770
 this year winning in the graphics when 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.110
 something when it is to come pure with 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.110
 playing so good we go 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.460
 goodbye
