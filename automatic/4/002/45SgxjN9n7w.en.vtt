00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:34.960
 the idea of ​​in it despair passion this is an idea family the state outside of 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.990
 United States going down to iberia 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.810
 i from my brother and my poor parents 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.210
 they had the idea of ​​sustaining despite making a 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.580
 right this space 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.680
 similar will happen two of two locals for the sake of Buenos Aires where there haiti 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.710
 it was liberia restaurant we took the name of a novel and mother that is the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.330
 first 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.760
 and also the thesis is the omega-3 payment which also 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.150
 double motive and also has to do with the nature of the noble space a 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.100
 the first part of the debate the water is not seen comparsas that highlights fronts 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.149
 in the second part from liberia delegates a bit then the omm bib 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 meaning there is no access to the premises is a type of torture more 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.700
 background is not an environment that should now be 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.760
 of old in the sense of staying 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.610
 is found is to try to have a logic a coherence in the way of 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.240
 to look for the titles one in we are not far away from what is pride 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.670
 of the novelty 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.990
 the reader of him 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.430
 the bandit the truth that that guy guaca make up the bookstore of 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.420
 bandit I had no idea of ​​making a bookstore a bit alternative but my 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.100
 clients that you mention being 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.720
 even more attractive 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.560
 paramés of the merit has not had neither proposals and not to the merit has been of 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.590
 those of the client type 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.750
 i good are also a place where book presentations will be held 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.510
 we make a prayer in your predisposition heras 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.430
 even so we have sat down on weekends the customer of the 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.550
 local now that's pretty 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.729
 diverse as the country and some clients that only or with his death in the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.340
 jungle 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.160
 and then to the clients that is only about books then the inti could 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160
 dedicate to lead it, there's no reason to think 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.929
 I hunt both things 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.200
 I learn more than between the previous tests 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.750
 the problem of the book industry has to do with the people who 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.489
 what generates 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.840
 Now I think that also exonerated little of the publishing industry 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.109
 in homs in that perspective puig d 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.230
 and you can favor the large spaces 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.370
 because if they only think big it's likely that bp broke down 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.849
 come true 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.849
 and the background book that you're trying to show here 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.809
 where it is enough if small sites are not enough because the members only 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:53.929
 the last thing that has come out will prevail 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:58.929
 are the copales of dykes that we are in a kind of never in a market 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.559
 that are published so much 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:04.009
 that does not let see what is seen what does not present mind what is 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.009
 producing but I think it did not make the writer is the last 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:11.809
 as in other sports he blamed the sector since his book was expected 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:14.809
 a project 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.779
 as I think the editors when I was a leader and the other what these do 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:25.719
 advertisements 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.229
 because today is the latest news 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.899
 because you have not replaced this other 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:32.849
 despite the fact that the measures are territories 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.939
 it was an hour belongs to them 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.959
 could before the region part much more interesting in the sense of 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.419
 then promote doing presentations but I think they should 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.419
 take care of a little more joys 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:55.699
 maybe I do not think there's a crisis problem natra ture masters 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:00.729
 a kamen mode of pressure of basically human communication not 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:02.349
 try 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.309
 through language then communicate 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:09.879
 and it's very difficult to think chivas end something more comfortable a book 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.919
 test some non-logical things will always have a vision that goes to 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.599
 be a screen sasha formula screen 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.119
 does not have the sensation of stopping you, it belongs to that your book can be your 

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:20.719
 book 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:24.009
 it may be that the ua to do that which opened fire 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.289
 they can tolerate a book 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.189
 and you will like it in all the Iberian 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:32.689
 not all libya there is no frustrated writer I believe that all people 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.159
 orestito state 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.790
 what would it take? 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.340
 to the human condition 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.569
 live as a bookseller that is an adventure you communicate you have a sailing ship not 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.809
 is a life of dedication and that you have to like a lot was talked about 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:45.939
 no sense 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:49.809
 the passion for the Iraqi adventure is the passion for vocations
