00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.610
 good afternoon friends today i will tell 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.769
 how to measure the angle of sharpening a knife to someone 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.990
 it is perhaps necessary to determine for 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.910
 yourself of some properties clicking and someone 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.640
 to set the angle on sharpeners 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.320
 but before moving on to the topic video I 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.350
 I'll call the captain obvious 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.449
 I will say that in general such a sharpening angle 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.840
 in order to avoid misunderstanding so to speak 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.090
 Sharpening Angle Terminology is the angle 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.610
 between the edges of the knife carriage which 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.440
 form the cutting edge of the knife from 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.469
 geometry descents from the butt to zero and 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.980
 classic scandi angle descents and will 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.110
 sharpening angle can sharpen 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.289
 referred to as full angle or 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.969
 half on hold or exhibiting 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.879
 Angle sharpeners usually mean 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.160
 half angle and if say 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.820
 about knife sharpening in general then it is about 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.800
 full angle this as for obviously we 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.890
 not obvious talk at the end of the video 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.890
 can heat output measure the angle we 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.500
 will be using a laser goniometer this 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.570
 joke humor such 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.740
 I have no such devices of 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.920
 you probably too 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.030
 although they are not according to the nation if the carts 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.100
 sharpened in the lens 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.920
 what will they show science 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.159
 unknown in our case is the angle we 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.509
 we measure so take a knife on which 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.229
 we want to know the angle of sharpening scissors and 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.869
 we apply scissors to knife carts as 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.040
 can be closer to the corner that 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.159
 It is on the knife that is holding 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.700
 look for 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.770
 need angle to make sure that angle 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.829
 The right scissors shows you need 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.470
 look at the light that is so that there is not 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.479
 it was gleam means we hit a corner 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.150
 take the protractor put conan 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:03.010
 Sparta Ru and find the desired angle 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:06.620
 which we were looking for knife sharpening angle 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.200
 it was also possible to tighten the bolt on 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.170
 scissors attach scissors to paper 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.160
 circle a pencil or pen and 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.020
 later measure with protractor 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.800
 the second method which we will measure 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.080
 knife sharpening angle here is such such 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.390
 terrible calculations we have to make 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.410
 although in fact there is nothing 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.470
 complex 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.709
 we take a knife, we need a flat 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.590
 the surface is applied under the waters 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.300
 on this surface, who determines how 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.980
 who are active in the top and under the shadow of supply 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.900
 measure the distance between this 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.340
 the plane and the middle butt of the knife 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.200
 write down remember to whom more 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.650
 conveniently then in the exact same place exactly 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.510
 same place where we measured the height 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.430
 measure the width of the knife all this data to us 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.470
 are known 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.650
 Now, by the following formula: 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.380
 circled in red we calculate the angle 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.800
 knife sharpening 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.019
 half angle alpha we find so 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.510
 arcsine z divided by x 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.709
 that is, the height from the stone to the middle 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.940
 butt divided by the width of the blade at 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.630
 correspondingly full damage will be 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.700
 equal to 2 and that is just half 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:39.260
 multiply the angle by 2 as a result we will find 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:43.340
 the desired angle of sharpening the knife arcsine number 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.459
 we can easily count on engineering 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.390
 calculator or now almost everyone 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.490
 have smartphones we can install 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.090
 dji application nervous what 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.660
 Inter but if neither one nor the other we 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.420
 we can use google 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.270
 write arcsine number which we already 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:09.550
 counted 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:12.340
 by dividing and writing in all google degrees 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.420
 he will calculate and show you the result 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.459
 here so easily and simply can not 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.500
 Mathematically calculate the sharpening angle 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.990
 the knife 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.850
 thank you for watching the video to the end 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:28.350
 put your thumbs up subscribe to
