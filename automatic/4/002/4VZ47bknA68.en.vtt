00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.140 

well<00:00:35.770> we<00:00:35.890> think<00:00:36.130> of<00:00:36.340> it<00:00:36.460> as<00:00:36.579> kind<00:00:36.790> of<00:00:36.910> whole

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
well we think of it as kind of whole

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.200 
well we think of it as kind of whole
person<00:00:38.110> learning<00:00:38.440> really<00:00:39.100> so<00:00:39.310> what<00:00:39.489> we<00:00:39.700> do<00:00:39.970> is

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
person learning really so what we do is

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.650 
person learning really so what we do is
is<00:00:40.510> work<00:00:40.900> on<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.890> brain<00:00:42.130> the<00:00:42.940> heart<00:00:43.150> and<00:00:43.510> the

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
is work on the brain the heart and the

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.590 
is work on the brain the heart and the
body<00:00:43.780> in<00:00:44.680> any<00:00:45.160> of<00:00:45.309> the<00:00:45.430> longer<00:00:45.820> program<00:00:46.300> so

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
body in any of the longer program so

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.630 
body in any of the longer program so
that<00:00:46.750> people<00:00:47.020> get<00:00:47.650> a<00:00:47.710> way<00:00:47.950> of<00:00:48.160> thinking

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
that people get a way of thinking

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.810 
that people get a way of thinking
differently<00:00:49.470> feeling<00:00:50.470> differently<00:00:51.220> and<00:00:51.550> then

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
differently feeling differently and then

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.910 
differently feeling differently and then
acting<00:00:52.420> differently<00:00:52.960> which<00:00:53.110> of<00:00:53.230> course<00:00:53.260> is

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
acting differently which of course is

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.189 
acting differently which of course is
crucial<00:00:54.370> in<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.610> workplace<00:00:55.030> that<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.480> the

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
crucial in the workplace that the the

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.579 
crucial in the workplace that the the
difference<00:00:56.710> is<00:00:57.510> enhanced<00:00:58.510> in<00:00:58.629> a<00:00:58.750> development

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
difference is enhanced in a development

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.229 
difference is enhanced in a development
program<00:01:00.010> is<00:01:00.190> actually<00:01:00.519> visible<00:01:00.970> to<00:01:01.120> those

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
program is actually visible to those

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.749 
program is actually visible to those
around<00:01:01.600> them<00:01:01.780> when<00:01:01.900> they<00:01:02.019> go<00:01:02.170> back

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.170 

yes<00:01:07.829> based<00:01:08.829> on<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.219> theory<00:01:09.430> of<00:01:09.490> indirect

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
yes based on the theory of indirect

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.060 
yes based on the theory of indirect
learning<00:01:10.630> which<00:01:10.840> says<00:01:11.140> that<00:01:11.380> human<00:01:11.740> beings

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
learning which says that human beings

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.550 
learning which says that human beings
are<00:01:12.310> coded<00:01:12.939> to<00:01:13.149> remember<00:01:13.570> images<00:01:14.049> pictures

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
are coded to remember images pictures

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.919 
are coded to remember images pictures
and<00:01:14.740> symbols<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.610> lot<00:01:15.880> more<00:01:16.060> clearly<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:16.689> for<00:01:16.869> a

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
and symbols a lot more clearly and for a

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:18.990 
and symbols a lot more clearly and for a
lot<00:01:17.049> longer<00:01:17.320> than<00:01:17.770> they<00:01:17.979> will<00:01:18.130> remember<00:01:18.490> facts

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
lot longer than they will remember facts

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.840 
lot longer than they will remember facts
figures<00:01:19.179> numbers<00:01:19.869> and<00:01:20.289> so<00:01:20.829> we<00:01:20.979> we<00:01:21.219> draw<00:01:21.520> on

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
figures numbers and so we we draw on

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.059 
figures numbers and so we we draw on
that<00:01:22.060> with<00:01:22.270> studied<00:01:22.630> archetypal<00:01:23.439> psychology

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:24.069 
that with studied archetypal psychology

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.749 
that with studied archetypal psychology
which<00:01:24.250> looks<00:01:24.549> back<00:01:24.819> at<00:01:25.060> some<00:01:25.720> of<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.899> ancient

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
which looks back at some of the ancient

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.010 
which looks back at some of the ancient
pictures<00:01:27.759> and<00:01:28.000> symbols<00:01:28.509> that<00:01:28.600> were<00:01:28.810> around

them<00:01:29.289> in<00:01:29.500> all<00:01:29.770> cultures<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:31.420> use<00:01:31.869> those<00:01:32.140> as

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
them in all cultures and use those as

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.010 
them in all cultures and use those as
characters<00:01:33.189> if<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.789> like<00:01:34.000> for<00:01:34.390> people<00:01:34.630> to
