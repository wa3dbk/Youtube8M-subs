00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.990 
again this is a quick fix way the
laziest<00:01:14.060> way<00:01:14.650> it's<00:01:15.650> not<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.070> permanent<00:01:16.759> fix

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
laziest way it's not the permanent fix

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.850 
laziest way it's not the permanent fix
the<00:01:17.450> permanent<00:01:17.780> fix<00:01:17.960> is<00:01:18.110> actually<00:01:18.470> buying<00:01:18.680> the

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
the permanent fix is actually buying the

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.950 
the permanent fix is actually buying the
port<00:01:19.160> and<00:01:19.369> taking<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.090> whole<00:01:20.210> laptop<00:01:20.390> apart

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
port and taking the whole laptop apart

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.490 
port and taking the whole laptop apart
and<00:01:21.380> fixing<00:01:21.770> it<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.009> right<00:01:22.159> way<00:01:23.229> you<00:01:24.229> want<00:01:24.409> to

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
and fixing it the right way you want to

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.480 
and fixing it the right way you want to
put<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:25.039> little<00:01:25.960> hot<00:01:26.960> glue<00:01:26.990> right<00:01:27.560> in<00:01:27.770> there<00:01:30.490> so

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
put a little hot glue right in there so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.920 
put a little hot glue right in there so
it<00:01:31.700> prevents<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:32.450> from<00:01:32.600> being<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.080> like<00:01:33.320> loose

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
it prevents it from being so like loose

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.570 
it prevents it from being so like loose
and<00:01:35.930> then<00:01:36.500> see<00:01:36.740> where<00:01:36.890> it's<00:01:37.009> cracked<00:01:37.310> right

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
and then see where it's cracked right

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.470 
and then see where it's cracked right
there

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
there

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.660 
there
you<00:01:40.320> want<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.560> dab<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> little<00:01:41.100> glue<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.880> there

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
you want to dab a little glue in there

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.820 
you want to dab a little glue in there
so<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> would<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.480> is<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.660> break<00:01:46.080> since<00:01:46.560> it's

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
so I would do is just break since it's

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.410 
so I would do is just break since it's
already<00:01:47.220> broke<00:01:47.490> off<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:47.910> there<00:01:48.120> just

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
already broke off right there just

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.850 
already broke off right there just
finish<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.930> job<00:01:49.140> off<00:01:49.350> because<00:01:49.530> that's<00:01:49.680> gonna

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
finish that job off because that's gonna

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.400 
finish that job off because that's gonna
fall<00:01:50.250> apart<00:01:50.340> anyway<00:01:50.850> later<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.240> now<00:01:51.930> what<00:01:52.320> you

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
fall apart anyway later on now what you

00:01:52.410 --> 00:02:04.580 
fall apart anyway later on now what you
want<00:01:52.620> to<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:52.800> is<00:01:53.010> glue<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.910> to<00:01:56.720> right<00:01:57.720> there

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.719 

all<00:02:05.340> right<00:02:06.890> she<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.129> have<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> battery

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
all right she really have the battery

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.020 
all right she really have the battery
out<00:02:08.819> when<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:09.269> this<00:02:09.450> by<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.690> way

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.899 

once<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.209> glue<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:15.519> outside<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:16.849> want

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
once you glue that outside and you want

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.300 
once you glue that outside and you want
to<00:02:17.030> glue<00:02:17.530> there's<00:02:18.530> another<00:02:18.709> broken<00:02:19.010> piece

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
to glue there's another broken piece

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.020 
to glue there's another broken piece
right<00:02:19.519> there<00:02:19.689> you<00:02:20.689> want<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.900> glue<00:02:21.049> that<00:02:25.030> okay

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
right there you want to glue that okay

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.089 
right there you want to glue that okay
now<00:02:26.689> it's<00:02:26.989> not<00:02:27.140> going<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.379> move<00:02:27.530> as<00:02:27.680> much<00:02:27.829> now

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
now it's not going to move as much now

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.259 
now it's not going to move as much now
because<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:28.640> glued<00:02:28.909> the<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.590> port<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.549> the

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
because you glued the the port to the

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.349 
because you glued the the port to the
frame<00:02:32.629> of<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.109> laptop<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.090> not<00:02:35.209> going

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
frame of the laptop so this is not going

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.089 
frame of the laptop so this is not going
to<00:02:35.420> be<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:35.629> much<00:02:35.810> play<00:02:36.079> room<00:02:36.349> for<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.799> to<00:02:36.829> do

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
to be that much play room for it to do

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.920 
to be that much play room for it to do
for<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:37.969> move<00:02:38.120> back<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:38.329> forth<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.780> lose

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
for it to move back and forth to lose

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.199 
for it to move back and forth to lose
that<00:02:39.049> connection<00:02:39.319> again<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.489> now<00:02:40.790> when<00:02:41.150> you

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
that connection again and now when you

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.750 
that connection again and now when you
plug<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:41.689> back<00:02:41.750> in<00:02:42.200> then<00:02:43.069> you<00:02:43.189> got<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.489> charge

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
plug that back in then you got to charge

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.990 
plug that back in then you got to charge
now<00:02:44.060> preventing<00:02:44.959> that<00:02:45.769> happen<00:02:46.159> again<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.849> is

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
now preventing that happen again this is

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.250 
now preventing that happen again this is
why<00:02:47.239> I'd<00:02:47.329> done<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:49.780> got<00:02:50.780> on<00:02:50.930> one<00:02:51.049> of<00:02:51.109> those

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
why I'd done and I got on one of those

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.089 
why I'd done and I got on one of those
cable<00:02:51.889> holders<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.599> I<00:02:53.599> just<00:02:53.870> basically

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
cable holders and I just basically

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.599 
cable holders and I just basically
attached<00:02:55.099> it<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.700> laptop<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:58.250> this<00:02:58.430> one<00:02:58.579> I

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
attached it to the laptop and this one I

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.789 
attached it to the laptop and this one I
glued<00:02:58.909> to<00:02:59.120> because<00:02:59.750> this<00:03:00.379> HAP

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
glued to because this HAP

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.470 
glued to because this HAP
I<00:03:00.829> have<00:03:01.040> kids<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.549> they<00:03:01.669> trip<00:03:01.879> on<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.150> cord

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
I have kids and they trip on the cord

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.740 
I have kids and they trip on the cord
all<00:03:02.689> the<00:03:02.750> time<00:03:03.310> because<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.969> see<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.299> cords

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
all the time because you see the cords

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.750 
all the time because you see the cords
like<00:03:06.379> that<00:03:06.909> so<00:03:07.959> this<00:03:08.959> helps<00:03:09.349> if<00:03:10.129> the<00:03:10.340> kids<00:03:10.549> trip

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
like that so this helps if the kids trip

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.909 
like that so this helps if the kids trip
on<00:03:10.879> the<00:03:10.969> cord<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:11.780> know<00:03:12.049> it's<00:03:12.739> like<00:03:12.889> a

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:12.919 
on the cord you know it's like a

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:13.899 
on the cord you know it's like a
breakaway

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
breakaway

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.780 
breakaway
I<00:03:14.319> guess<00:03:15.319> the<00:03:15.560> holds<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:16.010> tension<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:16.579> it's

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
I guess the holds the tension so it's

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.649 
I guess the holds the tension so it's
not<00:03:17.060> all<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.329> stress<00:03:17.690> is<00:03:17.870> on<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.139> port<00:03:18.440> and

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
not all the stress is on the port and

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.659 
not all the stress is on the port and
yeah<00:03:20.659> it<00:03:20.780> looks<00:03:20.989> a<00:03:21.019> little<00:03:21.079> bit<00:03:21.290> messy<00:03:21.639> but<00:03:22.639> I

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
yeah it looks a little bit messy but I

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.339 
yeah it looks a little bit messy but I
mean<00:03:22.879> you<00:03:23.150> go<00:03:23.239> clean<00:03:23.690> up<00:03:23.720> some<00:03:23.989> of<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.139> glue

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
mean you go clean up some of the glue

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.039 
mean you go clean up some of the glue
just<00:03:24.650> peel<00:03:24.889> it<00:03:24.919> off<00:03:25.159> wherever<00:03:25.879> it's<00:03:26.690> missing

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
just peel it off wherever it's missing

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.399 
just peel it off wherever it's missing
but<00:03:27.709> anyway<00:03:27.979> it<00:03:28.189> works<00:03:28.400> great<00:03:28.819> and<00:03:29.199> how<00:03:30.199> long's

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
but anyway it works great and how long's

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.469 
but anyway it works great and how long's
this<00:03:30.530> one<00:03:30.709> lasted<00:03:31.069> for<00:03:31.310> after<00:03:31.790> I'd<00:03:31.909> done<00:03:31.939> after

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:32.479 
this one lasted for after I'd done after

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:36.219 
this one lasted for after I'd done after
I'd<00:03:32.569> done<00:03:32.599> that<00:03:33.370> fix<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.459> port<00:03:34.989> how<00:03:35.989> long<00:03:36.139> it

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:36.229 
I'd done that fix the port how long it

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:39.630 
I'd done that fix the port how long it
lasts<00:03:36.470> like

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.410 

Oh<00:03:39.670> No
