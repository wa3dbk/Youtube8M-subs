00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.240
 hello everyone senate alone 83 and 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.420
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.970
 new video so of the fishing session 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.840
 so this is episode 1 so 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.610
 today I will introduce you so 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.320
 fishing tackle equipment 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.020
 to say a little bit about how this is practiced 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.440
 that it is and some techniques and 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.809
 after we go on episode 2 then 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.710
 so that's the catch fishing 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.840
 what is it senna fishing 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.629
 so that is practiced with one with a 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.760
 cane so with a simple frame so 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.760
 who does not have a ring so 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.230
 so ceded pieces actually 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.310
 pieces of calm that unfolds a 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.880
 only cane and there we will come there 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:07.450
 hang line will have a line that that 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:11.230
 so still in line with those precisely 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:16.000
 a justin float than the lead sender 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.410
 and then waiting then for fishing at 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.520
 blow it is practiced in your drawings 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.000
 can be practiced in the river by being or 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.100
 in big lakes so 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.420
 so there are several types of fish 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.720
 that we can search 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.000
 so we are looking for white fish 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.710
 general so all that is keeping 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.160
 bleak then the bream the chub 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.290
 is sometimes full whitefish 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.770
 other drinks when cyprinids in 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.119
 general so I'm going to introduce a 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.040
 little material you need so 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.220
 already to start a little fishing at the 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.350
 blow so then you have to see 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.960
 a carrying bag to carry a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.700
 your hardware leaps and 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.570
 basins to prepare the north of 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.319
 compressed clamart so it's actually 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.620
 So flour yielded mixtures of 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.530
 flour and different seeds all that 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:17.920
 so that's from the special to bhl is 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.480
 clogged dudule so my yanhong kg so he 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.130
 there is about a part of fishing 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.410
 whole so we can mix it with 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.780
 land or with the beings 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.970
 attractors all that or even maggots 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.760
 or sometimes so that's it then 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.800
 as the main bait today we're going 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:42.120
 so use maggots of all 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.120
 the colors so I show you a little 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.600
 so 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.930
 that's how it looks so it's 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.360
 maggots it's fly larvae 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.900
 So here we are coming the dive on 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.380
 the hook and then as a secondary 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.540
 we will use so finally not secondary 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.340
 we are going to use mysticism 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.200
 so it's something really 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.790
 very very very useful that really works 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.980
 very well so it's a little paw 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.430
 Red fact it makes little balls 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.730
 red 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.410
 here are others it's all red and that 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.720
 imitate a small vase worm or a small 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.510
 tear is here so it's really very 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.970
 useful in case of if we can not reach me 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.860
 hitting with maggots from others 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.420
 so after there are many other dates 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.750
 rappaz for catch fishing so there is 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.100
 clutter so ceded to mud there is 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.990
 plains that so it's maggots 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.300
 but which are slightly smaller 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:39.100
 robust and so here's for the painted 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.570
 so for the canes so we will need 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.850
 So much for which many zi 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.740
 but not their tits cynthia 5 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.860
 meters and that one there is three 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.230
 matches it depends to where is located 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.290
 to the fish so that's the line 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:01.270
 mount on 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:03.580
 So then here you have to go 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.490
 so a stronger seat because the 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.810
 fishing is a sketch that fishing 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.600
 we do not move so we stay seated 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.030
 and we watch his cap and then 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.410
 so you will need a noise so a 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.480
 what is it so if 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.609
 empathy a man with long lines and 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.820
 so they can go from 2 meters 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.680
 up to 5.6m so they will serve you 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.840
 to keep the fish throughout 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.410
 your party to be able in the end the 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.380
 accounts and so we see there I think 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.920
 I did the trick we will not do without 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.920
 dauba the practice
