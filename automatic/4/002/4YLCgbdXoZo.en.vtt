00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello my name is makar light and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.550
 you are watching the site show our theme 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.219
 Today's show singing nature singing 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.290
 one of the most amazing abilities 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.990
 which man has and many 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.170
 animals using singing can be raised 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.869
 mood or drive crazy but it turned out 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.949
 what's the greatest boiling ability have 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 not only animals but also plants and mushrooms 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.269
 about this ability i would like to 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.399
 tell you the question of whether publishes for 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.680
 plants sounds have long been considered 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.110
 absurd and mainly because 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.239
 previously did not exist enough 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.370
 sensitive instrumentation ability 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.590
 register so weak and sound 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.020
 hesitations of honor to make such a discovery 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.420
 dropped by a group of British and Australian 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.190
 biologists headed by monica 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.430
 galliano from the university of the north 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.100
 australia in perth scientists used 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.559
 their highly sensitive experiments 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.320
 sensors that are commonly used for 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.750
 studying acoustic features 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.210
 scientists have studied insene insects 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.409
 pretty trite plant object 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.930
 young copy 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.450
 ordinary corn plant roots along with 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.850
 equipment emptied water and laser 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.250
 vibrometer recorded regularly 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.560
 repeating and sitting sounds with 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.020
 about 220 hertz 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.729
 biologists have put a series of control 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.009
 experiments in order to 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.680
 make sure the sound 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.729
 comes from the roots they are something else in 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.549
 fluids and 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.770
 dispelled all doubts obvious roots 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.439
 made sounds however despite 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.200
 the frequency of the experiments the researchers themselves 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.610
 recognize that their results are too cheeses 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.399
 and ambiguous 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.520
 to immediately declare them the scientific truth 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.720
 multiple checks needed 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.810
 experiments by independent 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.670
 groups besides sometimes feather beds of nature 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.159
 can be heard without special 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.799
 equipment in bamboo groves in vietnam 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.530
 in the warm wet morning you can hear 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.560
 screeching and crying locals 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.680
 claim that these sounds make young 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.509
 fast growing bamboo shoots 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.360
 making its way through the leaves 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.140
 bamboo grows very fast and because 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.450
 arose 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.580
 to guide the friction sounds appear in 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.459
 malay and ivan sky classic 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.190
 literature often mentioned singing 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.740
 bamboo some plants make sounds 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.620
 during the growth of flowers on the island 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.900
 bougainvillea in the swampy ocean 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.990
 growing sobbing tree or 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.720
 for the Ural I opened his flowers 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.500
 generate characteristic sobbing sounds and 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.690
 still 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.480
 it turned out that separate threads of proteins 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.360
 plants make sounds and which merging 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.870
 form real music yet succeeded 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.400
 listen only parsley mustard white 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.800
 clover and laconos 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.540
 it took a special 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.800
 equipment 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.650
 transforming elements of genetic 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.870
 code proteins in the sound turned out that 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.030
 plant emit not just a set 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.180
 a variety of musical chords a 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.120
 whole melodies and every plant she 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.760
 different notes of individual protein molecules 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.730
 unite specifically for each 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.350
 plants musical row a group of scientists 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.860
 under the guidance of a senior scientific 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.890
 employee Nikolai Naumova from the Institute 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.049
 applied mathematics named Keldysh 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.900
 managed to record the voices of fruits and vegetables 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.480
 they were placed a special case which 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.930
 caught the photons emitted by the fruits 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.250
 the fact is that any animal cages 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.010
 ability to lower the so-called 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.019
 over weak glow all readings 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.930
 recorded special sensitive 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.799
 The device is amazing but for the first time the glow 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.620
 plants are not noticed and biologists 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:51.959
 astronomers of the early 1950s 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.110
 astrophysicists ahead of experts 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.540
 far from them the science of biologists as it is 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.269
 strange but astrologers turned 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.310
 focus on growing pea 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.290
 small sprout placed in front 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.019
 the device used to catch at night 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.690
 twinkling distant stars 1 register 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.120
 flinch means the spine glowed 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.090
 after much research it was discovered 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.789
 that everything can glow and emit 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.489
 light is a universal property of life 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.740
 extra weak glow accompanies a range 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.110
 biochemical processes mainly 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.730
 oxidizing and its capable 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.850
 emit not only the goal 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.950
 on and tissue and but also individual cells and their 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.910
 parts of great importance while 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.580
 belongs 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.460
 the so-called free radical 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.980
 the very oxidation of lipid compounds 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.470
 nature of the incoming composition of all living 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.420
 cell mechanism of occurrence over 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.210
 weak glow based on 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.920
 free radical interactions friend 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.950
 with a different recombination 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.480
 at which energy is released 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.910
 sufficient to excite the glow 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.100
 the visible part of the spectrum however 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.560
 a small part of the energy goes on 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.470
 the formation of light and the likelihood of this 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.870
 process is very small about one 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.750
 quantum of many billions of acts 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.090
 recombination this explains the excessive 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.100
 low and the intensity of the glow and 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.460
 fundamental impossibility of his 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.380
 amplification to visible eyes of magnitudes and 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:23.220
 since each wave corresponds to 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.570
 sound but that kind of bio music is born 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.030
 for example an apple 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.880
 while it hangs on a tree squeaks very 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:37.250
 plaintively and monotonously like a siskin 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:40.410
 Fawn and the voice of a cucumber on the garden 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.010
 optimistic and weighed like a Turkish march 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.010
 Mozart 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.790
 also sounds can make her mushrooms 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:06:03.830
 I wonder what sound 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:06:06.530
 he would probably publish sometimes 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.930
 wonder how amazing can 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.300
 be nature she can always us 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.669
 surprise it will stay in long 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.040
 memory in conclusion i would like you 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:21.490
 wish happiness and proportional 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.490
 masses and yes yes yes see you soon
