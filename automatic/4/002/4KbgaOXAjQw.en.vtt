okay<00:00:00.780> let's<00:00:00.960> take<00:00:01.079> a<00:00:01.140> look<00:00:01.199> at<00:00:01.380> the<00:00:01.439> arm<00:00:01.589> basket

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
okay let's take a look at the arm basket

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.590 
okay let's take a look at the arm basket
with<00:00:02.159> your<00:00:02.310> then<00:00:02.429> from<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.760> muscle<00:00:03.060> arm<00:00:03.240> model

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
with your then from the muscle arm model

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.289 
with your then from the muscle arm model
that<00:00:03.720> we<00:00:03.810> have<00:00:03.990> in<00:00:04.020> lab<00:00:04.350> okay<00:00:04.879> we'll<00:00:05.879> start<00:00:06.150> up

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
that we have in lab okay we'll start up

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.140 
that we have in lab okay we'll start up
approximately<00:00:07.109> on<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.529> upper<00:00:07.740> extremity<00:00:08.220> and

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
approximately on the upper extremity and

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.600 
approximately on the upper extremity and
you<00:00:09.240> can<00:00:09.360> see<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:09.630> have<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.530> clavicle<00:00:11.460> that's

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
you can see we have the clavicle that's

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.490 
you can see we have the clavicle that's
cut<00:00:11.820> off<00:00:11.940> here<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.420> then<00:00:12.900> back<00:00:13.110> here<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
cut off here and then back here is a

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.530 
cut off here and then back here is a
spine<00:00:13.860> at<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.070> scapula<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.849> wraps<00:00:15.059> around<00:00:15.210> to

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
spine at a scapula that wraps around to

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.769 
spine at a scapula that wraps around to
the<00:00:15.660> acromion<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.920> big<00:00:17.100> giant<00:00:17.779> triangle

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
the acromion so the big giant triangle

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.179 
the acromion so the big giant triangle
shaped<00:00:19.140> muscle<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.619> shoulder<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
shaped muscle the shoulder is the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.250 
shaped muscle the shoulder is the
deltoid<00:00:20.670> muscle<00:00:21.150> if<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.390> recall<00:00:21.689> from<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
deltoid muscle if you recall from the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.320 
deltoid muscle if you recall from the
bone<00:00:22.680> unit<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> deltoid<00:00:23.609> muscle<00:00:23.939> inserts

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
bone unit the deltoid muscle inserts

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.269 
bone unit the deltoid muscle inserts
into<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.840> deltoid<00:00:25.470> tuberosity<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
into the deltoid tuberosity of the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.009 
into the deltoid tuberosity of the
humerus<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:27.330> when<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.480> go<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.720> take<00:00:27.869> this

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
humerus so when I go and take this

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.220 
humerus so when I go and take this
deltoid<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.800> pull<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.519> off<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.300> can

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
deltoid and pull it off of here I can

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.930 
deltoid and pull it off of here I can
get<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> better<00:00:31.529> look<00:00:31.800> at<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.949> scapula<00:00:32.520> itself

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
get a better look at the scapula itself

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.560 
get a better look at the scapula itself
so<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> spine<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.620> scapula<00:00:35.010> and

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
so this is the spine of the scapula and

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.270 
so this is the spine of the scapula and
above<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.809> below<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.380> spine<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> scapula

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
above and below the spine of the scapula

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250 
above and below the spine of the scapula
we<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.579> two<00:00:38.760> muscles<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.360> contribute<00:00:40.200> to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
we have two muscles that contribute to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.479 
we have two muscles that contribute to
the<00:00:40.440> rotator<00:00:40.860> cuff<00:00:41.160> muscle<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.239> top<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.750> my

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
the rotator cuff muscle up top is my

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.100 
the rotator cuff muscle up top is my
supraspinatus<00:00:44.489> muscle<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.510> muscle<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
supraspinatus muscle the muscle on the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.310 
supraspinatus muscle the muscle on the
bottom<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.649> my<00:00:47.390> infraspinatus<00:00:48.390> muscle<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
bottom is my infraspinatus muscle and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.100 
bottom is my infraspinatus muscle and
then<00:00:49.950> running<00:00:50.250> with<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> infraspinatus<00:00:51.360> I

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
then running with the infraspinatus I

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.200 
then running with the infraspinatus I
have<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> small<00:00:53.160> muscle<00:00:53.520> down<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> we

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
have a small muscle down there that we

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.459 
have a small muscle down there that we
call<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.600> teres<00:00:54.989> minor

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
call the teres minor

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.670 
call the teres minor
okay<00:00:55.949> now<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> teres<00:00:57.120> minor<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.809> third<00:00:58.410> of

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
okay now the teres minor is the third of

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.799 
okay now the teres minor is the third of
four<00:00:58.800> muscles<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.940> make<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> rotator

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
four muscles that make up the rotator

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.590 
four muscles that make up the rotator
cuff<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:02.039> right<00:01:02.309> below<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.730> teres<00:01:03.059> minor<00:01:03.270> you

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
cuff but right below the teres minor you

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.329 
cuff but right below the teres minor you
have<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> muscle<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.170> parallels<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.920> one

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
have a muscle that parallels that one

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.149 
have a muscle that parallels that one
that's<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.150> terry's<00:01:06.570> major<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.799> terry's

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that's the terry's major the terry's

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.700 
that's the terry's major the terry's
major<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.270> part<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> cuff<00:01:10.020> okay<00:01:10.500> I

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
major now is not part of the cuff okay I

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.010 
major now is not part of the cuff okay I
can<00:01:11.159> find<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> teres<00:01:11.850> major<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.689> teres

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
can find the teres major and the teres

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.859 
can find the teres major and the teres
minor<00:01:13.250> because<00:01:14.250> those<00:01:14.460> two<00:01:14.670> bellies<00:01:15.090> get

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
minor because those two bellies get

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.289 
minor because those two bellies get
pierced<00:01:16.320> or<00:01:16.500> separated<00:01:17.250> by<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.520> long<00:01:17.790> head<00:01:18.090> of

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
epicondyle of the humerus and we'll find

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.870 
epicondyle of the humerus and we'll find
most<00:02:40.140> muscles<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:41.070> are<00:02:41.190> responsible<00:02:41.730> for

finger extension and wrist extension

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.530 
finger extension and wrist extension
they're<00:02:44.280> going<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.550> come<00:02:44.700> off<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.060> lateral

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
they're going to come off the lateral

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.450 
they're going to come off the lateral
epicondyle<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.770> that's<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.040> good<00:02:47.190> place<00:02:47.340> to

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
epicondyle so that's a good place to

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.730 
epicondyle so that's a good place to
start

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
start

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.440 
start
so<00:02:49.740> when<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.890> come<00:02:50.130> off<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.610> medial<00:02:51.270> epicondyle

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
so when I come off the medial epicondyle

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.140 
so when I come off the medial epicondyle
of<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.350> humerus<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:53.070> first<00:02:53.610> muscle<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.120> I

of the humerus the first muscle that I

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.940 
of the humerus the first muscle that I
see<00:02:54.420> here<00:02:54.570> is<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:54.840> little<00:02:54.990> skinny<00:02:55.380> one<00:02:55.590> that

see here is this little skinny one that

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.920 
see here is this little skinny one that
wraps<00:02:56.190> its<00:02:56.400> way<00:02:56.520> over<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.030> radius<00:02:57.510> that's

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
wraps its way over to the radius that's

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.550 
wraps its way over to the radius that's
my<00:02:58.140> pronator<00:02:58.710> terry's<00:02:59.990> then<00:03:00.990> I<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.380> some
