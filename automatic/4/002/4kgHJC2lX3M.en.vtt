00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.970
 no this is not the video that you 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.340
 expect 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.380
 indeed it is just the opposite we are not 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.330
 here today to speak ill of the graphics 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.880
 nor to throw mud on pixel vertices 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.200
 shader parallax or other similar amenities 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.910
 we are here instead to discuss 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.230
 seriously on the graphic component of 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.660
 a game and its real importance 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.010
 in the totality of the production that the 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.290
 gameplay is the most important parameter 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.170
 in the evaluation of a game it is obvious 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.790
 and a title with a graphic engine is trivial 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.680
 portentous boringly cumbersome mechanics 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.120
 it can't be a good game because like 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.130
 says the word itself what matters 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.720
 play then interact but you do 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.910
 limits itself to observing as in the case of 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.710
 movies depending on the genre of 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.869
 membership then come into the picture too 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.729
 other parameters needed as a good one 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.710
 narrative background in the case of games 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.420
 role playing or a soul and multiplayer game 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.210
 populated in the case of the fighting game 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.890
 and so on but why all this should 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.140
 necessarily detract from the importance 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.860
 of the graphic aspect in the totality of 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.290
 a masterpiece 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.030
 if the cause of this hatred 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.250
 they are the bimbiminkia that they can't see 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.450
 in addition to the resolution it is like saying that 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.130
 playstation 2 was a bad one 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.930
 console only because he based his 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.430
 monopoly on the shoulders of gamers cases 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.990
 ignorant 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.340
 despite this reality he did 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.350
 of the sony console a real one 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.790
 fashion you certainly can not deny a park 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.430
 titles complete and full of rare pearls 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.930
 like okami from writer 4 ico shadow of 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.659
 the colossus who made it a 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.130
 system to have absolutely at home 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.330
 for the graphic it is more or less the same 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.950
 speech 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.390
 the most superficial players are 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.460
 attracted because the graphics are found 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.560
 right on the surface of gaming and the 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.090
 first thing you see that only affects 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.830
 to follow with the pad to the hand you go to 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.210
 deepen the rest 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.310
 but really only for this must 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.900
 becoming evil was better if we didn't 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.909
 had been evolution we were 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.290
 still to the parallax I wonder however a 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.119
 bit of intellectual honesty before 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.049
 reply 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.149
 meanwhile let's start from a prerequisite 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.040
 when it comes to graphics, they are not mentioned 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.390
 only the technical aspects of the engine but 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.250
 this argument also includes one 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.110
 stylistic question the graphic style 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.989
 in fact it can make the difference 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.610
 even more than a polygon too many 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.440
 take the co on playstation 2 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.030
 had a very low resolution and 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.220
 classic defects of old hardware 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.440
 sony were all beautifully displayed textures 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.480
 ridiculous aliasing in profusion cali di 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.270
 framerate but the visual spectacle that 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.550
 he gave was still very few equals 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.530
 the playful experience would not have been the 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.570
 itself without that evocative panorama e 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.220
 that muffled image and sport 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.740
 a perfect example of importance 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.690
 of graphics intended as style but 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.430
 then we want to talk about shumov in the 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.500
 the masterpiece is its graphic appearance 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.140
 an integral part of the offered experience 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.210
 wandering around yokosuka hardly 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.000
 you could hold the bib one 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.950
 such amount of vertices in 1999 did not occur 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.930
 He was never seen anywhere even 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.490
 in the precalculated films that they had to 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.380
 deceive the mass on the alleged 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.660
 amazing playstation 2 capabilities 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.340
 but despite a number of polygons 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.630
 really scary 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.910
 the thing that struck most were 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.190
 undoubtedly the textures their quality 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.900
 never was a palette smear 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.190
 of very high colors and applied filters 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.140
 beautifully 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.150
 but it is on the quantity we owe 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.430
 dwell not so much on quality 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.810
 thanks to the capacity of the dreamcast 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.180
 world around via zucchi was 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.500
 amazing for both the engine itself and 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.200
 for the feeling of being alive 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.450
 he transmitted he didn't do it for choices 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.880
 particular colors or style 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.950
 photorealistic but moving towards meeting 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.140
 all different people was from 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.180
 for itself an indescribable emotion 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.360
 we are talking about 500 non-player characters 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.970
 all different from one another the world 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.950
 of fool was really populated and sufficient 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.450
 think of the mannequins glued copies that 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.400
 they are still seen today in almost all of them 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.690
 games to realize how much the 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.400
 graphics have influenced the 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.430
 involvement offered by the game of 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.900
 suzuki shen mue absolute warning of how 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.880
 we must exploit the power of a 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.380
 system not so much to insert the river 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.480
 of parallax but ping on a pole of the 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.220
 useless light and an end in itself must 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.870
 harness the power to make a 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.750
 engine that knows how to involve who knows 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.850
 sbalordire beyond the polygons used 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.230
 in metal gear solid one of the titles that 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.390
 has benefited most from evolution 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.250
 video game technique proposing 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.440
 chapter after chapter sequences always 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.120
 cinematic and engaging 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.490
 to underline the gene of kojima and a 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.710
 Oscar-winning narrative background 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.510
 and then again jazz and radio than in his 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.160
 debut was not only a playful earthquake 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.570
 for an excellent gameplay but also in 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.669
 especially for a graphic style 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.290
 all new based on a new one 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.270
 rendering technique or cell shading 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.770
 today used and abused in many others 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.230
 titles that want to bet on one 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.660
 particular style 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.880
 in short , there are many examples in 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.350
 defense against graphics and this hatred in 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.240
 against what is nothing but 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.860
 a very useful parameter and purposes of 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.290
 Videogame masterpiece is totally 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.970
 unfounded the problem is as always 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.350
 the average user what he could 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.880
 even prefer a game to a 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.170
 other only because the first one does not have one 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.660
 graphics in step with the times 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.770
 but some individuals have also done 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.870
 worse in our history 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.550
 passion while we define ourselves 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.650
 fans we will have to get off theirs 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.940
 behavior from what instead integrates 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.340
 and complete the concept of video game 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.740
 where the term video below means 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.240
 something that should be displayed 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.730
 so the graphic evolution is welcome 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.710
 aesthetic improvements are welcome and 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.720
 especially the stylistic ones well 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.160
 they are developers like am2 who have 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.960
 maximized the power of a 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.420
 system to give us a world like that 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.950
 beautiful living has ever seen so be it 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.570
 all this is even more 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.000
 provided it is always gameplay anyway 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.400
 focal hell of production 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.740
 we are here to play not to watch 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.820
 but how is it that said that ah already but 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.820
 even the eye wants its part
