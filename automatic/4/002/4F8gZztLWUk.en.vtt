first<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.300> all<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.690> would<00:00:33.899> avoid<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
first of all I would avoid going in the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.010 
first of all I would avoid going in the
middle<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> map<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.329> try<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.780> stay<00:00:36.989> on

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
middle of the map and try and stay on

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.389 
middle of the map and try and stay on
the<00:00:37.110> outside<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.530> map<00:00:37.680> because<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.219> go<00:00:38.340> in

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the outside the map because if you go in

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.920 
the outside the map because if you go in
the<00:00:38.460> middle<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:39.480> go<00:00:39.540> get<00:00:39.660> slaughtered

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the middle you just go get slaughtered

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.450 
the middle you just go get slaughtered
because<00:00:40.200> people<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.680> stay<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:40.980> buildings

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
because people just stay in buildings

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.750 
because people just stay in buildings
and<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.719> game<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and in this game I do do that I just and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.670 
and in this game I do do that I just and
building<00:00:45.210> because<00:00:45.480> I'll<00:00:45.629> get<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.260> behind<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
building because I'll get in behind the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.910 
building because I'll get in behind the
enemy<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.190> move<00:00:47.399> their<00:00:47.579> spawn<00:00:48.590> to<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> point

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
enemy and I move their spawn to a point

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.680 
enemy and I move their spawn to a point
where<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.250> just<00:00:50.280> sit<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.000> one<00:00:51.030> building<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
where I can just sit in one building and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.680 
where I can just sit in one building and

son<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> ACR<00:01:00.899> because<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> very

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
son like the ACR because that is a very

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.880 
son like the ACR because that is a very
good<00:01:02.579> sort<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.910> short<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> long<00:01:03.510> range<00:01:04.199> gun<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
quite a long range gun but because I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.789 
quite a long range gun but because I
mean<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.369> level<00:01:11.760> 20<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.689> something<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.560> best

mean like level 20 or something the best
gonna<00:01:14.010> possibly<00:01:14.250> got<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.790> probably<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> sky

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
gonna possibly got is probably the sky

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.039 
gonna possibly got is probably the sky
HD<00:01:15.780> use<00:01:16.700> as<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.240> by<00:01:18.509> sticking<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> my

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
HD use as you can see by sticking to my

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.260 
HD use as you can see by sticking to my
strategy<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.920> stay<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> SL<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> map<00:01:21.030> I've

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
strategy to stay on the SL the map I've

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.499 
strategy to stay on the SL the map I've
already<00:01:21.450> got<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:21.900> set<00:01:22.110> Harris<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:24.150> preachers

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
already got one set Harris and preachers

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.390 
already got one set Harris and preachers
first<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.960> harwich<00:01:25.290> gets<00:01:25.470> me<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.799> or<00:01:25.950> nine<00:01:26.100> kills

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
first I harwich gets me a or nine kills

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.100 
first I harwich gets me a or nine kills
so<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> shame<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.240> die<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> probably

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
so it's a shame I die so I probably

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.590 
so it's a shame I die so I probably
could've<00:01:28.409> gone<00:01:28.470> easy<00:01:28.680> nuke<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.390> game

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
could've gone easy nuke and in this game

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.929 
could've gone easy nuke and in this game
I<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:31.049> something<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.380> 36<00:01:31.860> Harry's<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
I get something like 36 Harry's so the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.200 
I get something like 36 Harry's so the
way<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> play<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.930> guns<00:01:34.320> i<00:01:34.500> use<00:01:34.770> is

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
way I play it and the guns i use is

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.130 
way I play it and the guns i use is
pretty<00:01:36.210> good<00:01:36.360> for<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.600> map<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:36.990> does

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
pretty good for this map and it does

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.760 
pretty good for this map and it does
work<00:01:37.170> well<00:01:38.509> my<00:01:39.509> third<00:01:39.780> piece<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.110> advice<00:01:40.320> if

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770

you<00:01:41.070> haven't<00:01:41.640> got<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> new<00:01:42.180> ever<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:44.820> on

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
you haven't got a new ever to get on

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.310 
you haven't got a new ever to get on
strike<00:01:45.390> you're<00:01:45.689> probably<00:01:45.930> going<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.259> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
strike you're probably going to have to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.580 
strike you're probably going to have to
camp<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.159> do<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.430> game<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.590> because

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
camp like I do in this game and because

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.840 
camp like I do in this game and because
if<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.950> haven't<00:01:50.189> already<00:01:50.220> got<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> nuke<00:01:50.670> you're

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
if you haven't already got a nuke you're

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.830 
if you haven't already got a nuke you're
not<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.149> stand<00:01:51.270> much<00:01:51.450> chance<00:01:51.479> getting

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
not going to stand much chance getting

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.120 
not going to stand much chance getting

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
towards the end of the game I managed to

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.530

because most I've got cold blood on and
that<00:02:36.150> was<00:02:36.210> probably<00:02:36.600> because<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:37.290> Harry<00:02:37.590> I

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
that was probably because that Harry I

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.460 
that was probably because that Harry I
had<00:02:38.130> just<00:02:38.880> slaught<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.480> enemy<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.020> most<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.410> my

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
there and it's born to the right as well

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.480 
there and it's born to the right as well
and<00:03:58.690> there's<00:03:59.440> no<00:03:59.590> need<00:03:59.800> can<00:03:59.950> even<00:04:00.190> move<00:04:00.340> from

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
and there's no need can even move from

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.590 
and there's no need can even move from
the<00:04:00.610> spot<00:04:00.640> because<00:04:01.000> they're<00:04:01.240> basically<00:04:01.510> just

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
the spot because they're basically just

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.810 
the spot because they're basically just
running<00:04:01.990> towards<00:04:02.380> us<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.740> I'm<00:04:03.490> just<00:04:03.610> picking

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
them off one by one so that's basically

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.770
