controlled<00:00:28.890> by<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.099> keyboard<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.359> have

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
controlled by the keyboard but you have

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.540 
controlled by the keyboard but you have
to<00:00:30.599> use<00:00:30.689> your<00:00:30.840> mouse<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.410> certain<00:00:31.830> stuff<00:00:32.219> like

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
to use your mouse for certain stuff like

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.780 
to use your mouse for certain stuff like
mostly<00:00:33.090> menus<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:34.590> not<00:00:35.100> quite<00:00:35.309> keyboard

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
mostly menus so it's not quite keyboard

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.310 
mostly menus so it's not quite keyboard
only<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.239> hate<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:36.510> stuff<00:00:36.750> does<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.140> it's

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
only I hate what stuff does that it's

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.680 
only I hate what stuff does that it's
like<00:00:37.440> all<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.190> gameplay<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:39.320> fricking<00:00:41.690> using

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
like all the gameplay is fricking using

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.380 
like all the gameplay is fricking using
just<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> keyboard<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.890> then<00:00:44.180> you<00:00:45.180> introduce

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
just the keyboard and then you introduce

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.340 
just the keyboard and then you introduce
the<00:00:45.719> mouse<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:46.200> no<00:00:46.289> reason

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
the mouse for no reason

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.350 
the mouse for no reason
like<00:00:47.890> Mouse<00:00:48.130> is<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.400> supplement<00:00:48.910> that's<00:00:49.000> fine

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
like Mouse is a supplement that's fine

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.620 
like Mouse is a supplement that's fine
but<00:00:50.730> also<00:00:51.730> if<00:00:51.880> you<00:00:51.910> haven't<00:00:52.059> noticed<00:00:52.390> you<00:00:52.480> can

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
but also if you haven't noticed you can

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.729 
but also if you haven't noticed you can
glide<00:00:52.840> a<00:00:53.260> little<00:00:54.220> bit<00:00:55.379> kind<00:00:56.379> of<00:00:56.410> makes<00:00:56.559> this<00:00:56.680> a

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
glide a little bit kind of makes this a

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.049 
glide a little bit kind of makes this a
lot<00:00:56.980> easier<00:00:57.309> than<00:00:57.430> when<00:00:57.520> I<00:00:57.610> was<00:00:57.730> just<00:00:57.820> trying

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
lot easier than when I was just trying

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.110 
lot easier than when I was just trying
to<00:00:58.379> cross<00:00:59.379> in<00:00:59.650> and<00:00:59.829> out<00:00:59.920> of<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.220> ground

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.450 

fun<00:01:03.720> fact<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.830> first<00:01:05.070> time<00:01:05.190> I<00:01:05.250> tried<00:01:05.430> to

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
fun fact the first time I tried to

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.700 
fun fact the first time I tried to
record<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.880> video<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.510> had<00:01:07.230> forgotten<00:01:07.620> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
record this video I had forgotten to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.370 
record this video I had forgotten to
select<00:01:08.160> a<00:01:08.960> codec<00:01:10.400> to<00:01:11.400> record<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.660> so<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
select a codec to record with and so it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.260 
select a codec to record with and so it
was<00:01:13.680> recording<00:01:14.400> uncompressed

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
was recording uncompressed

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.180 
was recording uncompressed
and<00:01:16.130> rather<00:01:17.130> than<00:01:17.490> try<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.450> compress<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.440> 31

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
and rather than try and compress that 31

gigabyte<00:01:20.760> single<00:01:21.300> file<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:21.960> decided

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
gigabyte single file I just decided

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.830 
gigabyte single file I just decided
screw<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.070> I'll<00:01:23.190> record<00:01:23.550> again<00:01:26.090> I'm<00:01:27.090> not<00:01:27.600> sure

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
screw it I'll record again I'm not sure

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.320 
screw it I'll record again I'm not sure
if<00:01:28.020> my<00:01:28.200> last<00:01:28.440> Camtasia<00:01:29.369> recording<00:01:29.880> did<00:01:30.119> that

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
if my last Camtasia recording did that

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.859 
if my last Camtasia recording did that
on<00:01:30.600> me<00:01:30.780> or<00:01:30.869> not<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:32.090> quite<00:01:33.090> setup<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.570> use<00:01:33.690> my

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
on me or not but I quite setup to use my

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.830 
on me or not but I quite setup to use my
new<00:01:33.990> PC<00:01:34.440> quite<00:01:34.770> yet<00:01:38.479> though

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
new PC quite yet though

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.260 
new PC quite yet though
I<00:01:39.869> was<00:01:40.619> wondering<00:01:40.890> why<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.070> heck<00:01:41.310> saving<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
I was wondering why the heck saving the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.430 
I was wondering why the heck saving the
file<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.720> taking<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.229> long<00:01:44.869> especially<00:01:45.869> for

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
file was taking so long especially for

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.790 
file was taking so long especially for
an<00:01:46.500> SSD<00:01:46.890> but

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
an SSD but

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.900 
an SSD but
apparently<00:01:49.640> it<00:01:51.070> decided<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:52.370> needed<00:01:52.400> to<00:01:52.730> make

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
apparently it decided it needed to make

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.460 
apparently it decided it needed to make
a<00:01:52.940> 31<00:01:53.390> gigabyte<00:01:53.810> file

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470

yeah not using uncompress anymore I was

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.490 
yeah not using uncompress anymore I was
using<00:02:02.909> DivX<00:02:03.600> that's<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.170> used<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.439> my

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
using DivX that's what I used on my

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.399 
using DivX that's what I used on my
laptop<00:02:05.070> but<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.090> was<00:02:06.420> giving<00:02:06.630> me<00:02:06.720> some<00:02:06.840> major

lag<00:02:08.239> which<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.360> weird<00:02:09.630> because<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.140> CPU<00:02:10.349> usage

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
lag which is weird because the CPU usage

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.290 
lag which is weird because the CPU usage
wasn't<00:02:11.459> at<00:02:11.940> 100%<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.780> any<00:02:13.019> of<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.230> cores<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:14.880> I

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
wasn't at 100% for any of the cores so I

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.729 
wasn't at 100% for any of the cores so I
don't<00:02:15.720> know<00:02:16.530> why<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.890> was<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.340> at<00:02:17.640> all<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:18.739> it

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
don't know why I was like at all but it

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.150 
don't know why I was like at all but it

found<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.660> trick<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.260> got<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:36.770> go<00:02:36.920> in

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
found the trick is you got to just go in

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.490 
found the trick is you got to just go in
a<00:02:37.069> straight<00:02:37.190> line<00:02:37.430> on<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.670> ground<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:39.380> you

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
a straight line on the ground and you

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.570 
a straight line on the ground and you
pretty<00:02:39.650> much<00:02:39.709> win<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:41.510> got<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.750> avoid<00:02:41.959> mines

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
pretty much win you got to avoid mines

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.009 
pretty much win you got to avoid mines

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
but in actuality they don't help because

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.719 
but in actuality they don't help because
as<00:04:15.650> long<00:04:15.739> as<00:04:15.799> you're<00:04:15.950> on<00:04:16.039> the<00:04:16.070> rampage<00:04:16.519> it

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
as long as you're on the rampage it

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:17.830 
as long as you're on the rampage it
doesn't<00:04:16.940> matter<00:04:17.090> anyway

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
doesn't matter anyway

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.719 
doesn't matter anyway
I'd<00:04:18.109> read<00:04:18.350> of<00:04:18.440> eating<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:18.859> lot<00:04:19.070> of<00:04:19.190> mutton<00:04:19.400> and

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
I'd read of eating a lot of mutton and

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.009 
I'd read of eating a lot of mutton and
the<00:04:19.940> harder<00:04:20.269> levels<00:04:21.169> and

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
the harder levels and

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.020 
the harder levels and
if<00:04:22.860> you're<00:04:23.099> not<00:04:23.220> gonna<00:04:23.340> guilt<00:04:23.639> by<00:04:23.819> it<00:04:23.880> like

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
if you're not gonna guilt by it like

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.719 
if you're not gonna guilt by it like
this<00:04:24.419> you<00:04:25.380> take<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.740> lot<00:04:25.919> more<00:04:26.130> if<00:04:26.190> you

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
this you take a lot more if you

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.909 
this you take a lot more if you
well<00:04:27.449> you<00:04:27.630> die<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:27.840> lot<00:04:28.080> faster<00:04:28.500> which<00:04:28.650> is<00:04:28.770> not

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
well you die a lot faster which is not

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.640 
well you die a lot faster which is not
cool<00:04:29.389> so<00:04:30.389> I<00:04:30.419> definitely<00:04:30.660> recommend<00:04:30.870> the

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
cool so I definitely recommend the

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.249 
cool so I definitely recommend the
current<00:04:31.949> build<00:04:32.160> I've<00:04:32.340> got<00:04:32.520> so<00:04:32.759> far<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:34.050> might

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
current build I've got so far you might

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:35.749 
current build I've got so far you might
want<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.620> go<00:04:34.770> for<00:04:34.979> the<00:04:35.039> health<00:04:35.220> instead<00:04:35.610> of

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
want to go for the health instead of

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.100 
want to go for the health instead of
speed<00:04:36.030> at<00:04:36.240> one

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
speed at one

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.180 
speed at one
I<00:04:38.230> don't<00:04:38.650> know<00:04:38.710> if<00:04:38.770> that's<00:04:38.920> a<00:04:38.980> good<00:04:39.100> idea

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
I don't know if that's a good idea

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.470 
I don't know if that's a good idea
because<00:04:39.460> I'm<00:04:39.640> not<00:04:39.730> sure<00:04:39.880> if<00:04:39.970> you<00:04:40.030> can<00:04:40.150> collide

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
because I'm not sure if you can collide

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:55.800 
because I'm not sure if you can collide
quite<00:04:40.840> like<00:04:40.960> this<00:04:41.110> here<00:04:41.470> slower<00:04:54.450> now<00:04:55.450> this<00:04:55.630> one

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
quite like this here slower now this one

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.530 
quite like this here slower now this one
I'm<00:04:56.050> just<00:04:56.080> not<00:04:56.410> sure<00:04:56.440> about<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.970> mega<00:04:58.180> jump<00:04:58.450> is

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
I'm just not sure about the mega jump is

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.690 
I'm just not sure about the mega jump is
really<00:04:58.810> fun<00:04:59.050> I<00:04:59.320> think<00:04:59.830> mega<00:05:00.070> vacuum<00:05:00.460> is<00:05:00.550> gonna

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
really fun I think mega vacuum is gonna

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.800 
extra chunk basically
I<00:05:24.849> prefer<00:05:25.849> that<00:05:25.970> they<00:05:26.090> could<00:05:26.210> jump<00:05:26.419> to<00:05:26.659> this

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
I prefer that they could jump to this

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.910 
I prefer that they could jump to this
vacuum

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.710 

the<00:05:31.920> mega<00:05:32.130> jump<00:05:32.490> you<00:05:32.760> could<00:05:32.910> go<00:05:33.060> way<00:05:33.360> up<00:05:33.390> in<00:05:33.600> the

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
the mega jump you could go way up in the

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.300 
the mega jump you could go way up in the
sky<00:05:33.780> and<00:05:34.530> you<00:05:34.770> could<00:05:34.950> freakin

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
sky and you could freakin

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.280 
sky and you could freakin
you<00:05:37.760> could<00:05:37.940> go<00:05:38.060> up<00:05:38.090> if<00:05:38.360> there's<00:05:38.660> flying

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
you could go up if there's flying

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.310 
you could go up if there's flying
saucers<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:39.980> could<00:05:40.130> eat<00:05:40.220> was<00:05:40.490> pretty<00:05:40.670> awesome

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
saucers you could eat was pretty awesome

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.450

this

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.800 

it's<00:05:46.460> just<00:05:46.670> so<00:05:46.820> hard<00:05:47.060> to<00:05:47.150> use<00:05:47.270> I<00:05:47.420> think<00:05:47.660> it

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
it's just so hard to use I think it

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.350 
it's just so hard to use I think it
would<00:05:47.900> be<00:05:47.990> a<00:05:48.020> constant<00:05:48.560> back<00:05:48.920> you<00:05:49.910> know

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
would be a constant back you know

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.999 
would be a constant back you know
but<00:05:51.689> with<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:51.930> blood<00:05:52.169> banks<00:05:52.560> this<00:05:52.740> doesn't

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
but with the blood banks this doesn't

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:54.870 
but with the blood banks this doesn't
even<00:05:53.099> do<00:05:53.250> anything

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
even do anything

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.000 
even do anything
this<00:05:55.150> is<00:05:55.300> actually<00:05:55.660> pretty<00:05:55.810> lame<00:05:58.980> as<00:05:59.980> you

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
this is actually pretty lame as you

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.740 
this is actually pretty lame as you
noticed<00:06:00.370> we<00:06:00.460> just<00:06:00.640> keep<00:06:00.760> your<00:06:00.970> owing<00:06:01.270> as<00:06:01.510> heat

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
noticed we just keep your owing as heat

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.230

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
- just to see the the different

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.120 
- just to see the the different
mutations<00:06:40.669> are<00:06:40.850> pretty<00:06:41.060> one

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
mutations are pretty one

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.360 
mutations are pretty one
though<00:06:42.550> I<00:06:42.580> prefer<00:06:43.000> the<00:06:43.150> all<00:06:43.420> speed<00:06:43.870> big<00:06:44.440> mouth

though I prefer the all speed big mouth

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.159 
though I prefer the all speed big mouth
and<00:06:45.669> the<00:06:45.940> Begich<00:06:46.270> jump<00:06:46.510> is<00:06:46.660> definitely<00:06:47.050> better

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
and the Begich jump is definitely better

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.529 
and the Begich jump is definitely better
than<00:06:47.290> the<00:06:47.440> stupid<00:06:47.800> back

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:49.539 
than the stupid back

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:51.459 
than the stupid back
look<00:06:50.539> at<00:06:50.659> that<00:06:50.809> and<00:06:50.929> so<00:06:51.019> you've<00:06:51.139> been<00:06:51.199> doing

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:51.469 
look at that and so you've been doing

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:56.060 
look at that and so you've been doing
anything

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.999 

shoulda<00:06:56.580> got<00:06:56.790> in<00:06:56.850> the<00:06:56.910> vacuum

00:06:57.999 --> 00:06:58.009 
shoulda got in the vacuum

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.869 
shoulda got in the vacuum
the<00:06:58.189> larger<00:06:58.759> not<00:06:59.029> the<00:06:59.180> vacuum

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 
the larger not the vacuum

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:05.440 
the larger not the vacuum
let's<00:07:01.240> go<00:07:01.419> to<00:07:01.479> the<00:07:01.629> sky

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.230 

but<00:07:05.930> yeah<00:07:06.050> being<00:07:06.320> able<00:07:06.440> to<00:07:06.830> stay<00:07:07.130> level<00:07:07.850> like

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 
but yeah being able to stay level like

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.800 
but yeah being able to stay level like
this<00:07:08.450> due<00:07:08.660> to<00:07:08.690> glide<00:07:08.990> it<00:07:09.910> makes<00:07:10.910> the<00:07:11.120> game<00:07:11.300> get

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810 
this due to glide it makes the game get

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.999 
this due to glide it makes the game get
ridiculously<00:07:12.470> easy

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:17.009 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:22.040 

I<00:07:20.059> think<00:07:21.059> you<00:07:21.119> can<00:07:21.240> just<00:07:21.389> keep<00:07:21.569> growing<00:07:21.809> until

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
I think you can just keep growing until

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.290 
I think you can just keep growing until
you<00:07:22.349> are<00:07:22.409> like<00:07:22.619> the<00:07:22.800> size<00:07:22.979> of<00:07:23.159> my<00:07:23.219> screen<00:07:23.610> or

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 
you are like the size of my screen or

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.420 
you are like the size of my screen or
larger

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430 
larger

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.940 
larger
especially<00:07:27.300> if<00:07:27.360> you<00:07:27.419> get<00:07:27.570> the<00:07:27.630> longer

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:29.950 
especially if you get the longer

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.820 
especially if you get the longer
my<00:07:30.640> worms<00:07:30.850> actually<00:07:31.240> shorter

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:32.830 
my worms actually shorter

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.990 
my worms actually shorter
it's<00:07:33.490> ridiculous<00:07:35.190> where<00:07:36.190> to<00:07:36.280> see<00:07:36.400> is<00:07:36.520> how<00:07:36.729> high

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 
it's ridiculous where to see is how high

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.689 
it's ridiculous where to see is how high
of<00:07:37.180> a<00:07:37.270> combo<00:07:37.629> it<00:07:37.780> gets<00:07:38.199> and<00:07:39.069> then<00:07:39.400> I'm<00:07:39.550> gonna

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:39.699 
of a combo it gets and then I'm gonna

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:41.439 
of a combo it gets and then I'm gonna
