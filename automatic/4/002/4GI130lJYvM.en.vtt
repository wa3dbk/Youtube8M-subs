00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
six it's the end 55 engine the same one

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.040 
six it's the end 55 engine the same one
found<00:00:32.200> in<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.500> previous<00:00:33.040> iteration<00:00:33.250> of<00:00:34.050> the

found in the previous iteration of the

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.069 
found in the previous iteration of the
what<00:00:35.559> is<00:00:35.679> 335

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
what is 335

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.529 
what is 335
the<00:00:38.079> renard<00:00:38.350> horsepower<00:00:39.120> 300<00:00:40.120> pound<00:00:40.269> feet<00:00:40.449> of

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
the renard horsepower 300 pound feet of

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.770 
the renard horsepower 300 pound feet of
torque<00:00:41.159> so<00:00:42.159> this<00:00:42.519> is<00:00:42.879> actually<00:00:43.480> like<00:00:43.629> the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
torque so this is actually like the

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.180 
torque so this is actually like the
production<00:00:44.230> model<00:00:44.499> this<00:00:44.589> is<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.829> model<00:00:45.100> I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
production model this is the model I

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.840 
production model this is the model I
think<00:00:45.219> they<00:00:45.460> toured<00:00:45.789> around<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.800> there's<00:00:48.699> not

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
think they toured around so there's not

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.529 
think they toured around so there's not
a<00:00:48.909> ton<00:00:49.239> of<00:00:49.300> stock<00:00:49.600> so<00:00:50.940> surprisingly<00:00:51.940> it<00:00:52.300> does

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
a ton of stock so surprisingly it does

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.630 
a ton of stock so surprisingly it does
not<00:00:52.749> have<00:00:53.109> a<00:00:53.469> rear<00:00:53.679> view<00:00:53.800> camera<00:00:53.890> and<00:00:54.460> it

not have a rear view camera and it

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.059 
not have a rear view camera and it
doesn't<00:00:54.879> have<00:00:54.999> GPS<00:00:55.179> and<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:56.260> doesn't<00:00:56.589> have<00:00:56.769> the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:57.069 
doesn't have GPS and it doesn't have the

the<00:01:00.460> M<00:01:00.639> package<00:01:00.879> which<00:01:01.569> is<00:01:01.719> largely<00:01:02.019> aesthetic

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
the M package which is largely aesthetic

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.899 
the M package which is largely aesthetic
with<00:01:03.370> that<00:01:03.579> you<00:01:03.760> get<00:01:03.940> 20<00:01:04.269> inch<00:01:04.420> rims<00:01:04.720> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
with that you get 20 inch rims and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.280 
with that you get 20 inch rims and
badging<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.439> more<00:01:08.439> aggressive<00:01:08.799> body<00:01:08.979> panels

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
badging and more aggressive body panels

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.870 
badging and more aggressive body panels
right<00:01:11.290> it's<00:01:11.500> not<00:01:11.680> like<00:01:11.740> it's<00:01:12.219> not<00:01:12.340> too<00:01:12.579> hard

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
right it's not like it's not too hard

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.480 
right it's not like it's not too hard
but<00:01:13.659> it's<00:01:13.780> not<00:01:13.810> like<00:01:13.990> really<00:01:14.140> soft<00:01:14.619> you<00:01:15.009> know

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
but it's not like really soft you know

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.730 
but it's not like really soft you know
so<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:15.700> still<00:01:15.909> kind<00:01:16.090> of<00:01:16.180> feel<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.390> road<00:01:16.740> but

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
so you still kind of feel the road but

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.190 
so you still kind of feel the road but
it's<00:01:18.009> not<00:01:18.219> it's<00:01:18.640> not<00:01:18.759> like<00:01:18.850> are<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.090> part<00:01:19.689> where

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
it's not it's not like are a part where

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.319 
it's not it's not like are a part where
it's<00:01:20.320> just<00:01:20.409> like<00:01:20.560> set<00:01:20.979> Springs<00:01:21.399> so<00:01:22.060> you've<00:01:22.180> got

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
it's just like set Springs so you've got

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.120 
it's just like set Springs so you've got
the<00:01:22.479> driver<00:01:22.750> select<00:01:22.990> modes<00:01:23.469> that<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:23.860> can<00:01:23.979> go

sensitive

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.620

the 335 dual exhaust 435 same thing
according<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:09.860> BMW<00:02:10.150> it<00:02:11.150> has<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.690> lowest

got the wider air intakes bigger mouth

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.150 
got the wider air intakes bigger mouth
and<00:02:19.459> then<00:02:20.420> as<00:02:20.540> we<00:02:20.660> saw<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.049> 335<00:02:21.680> you've<00:02:22.040> got

you've got your aux and USB in although

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.520 
you've got your aux and USB in although
the<00:03:22.760> USB<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.239> purely<00:03:23.569> for<00:03:23.810> power<00:03:24.049> since<00:03:24.380> it

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
the USB is purely for power since it

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.259 
the USB is purely for power since it
doesn't<00:03:24.709> work<00:03:25.010> with<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.489> system<00:03:26.030> doesn't

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
have the connected app stuff oh when

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.539 
have the connected app stuff oh when
this<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.359> I<00:03:29.569> guess<00:03:29.810> default<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:31.040> side<00:03:31.250> mirrors

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
this is I guess default the side mirrors

trim<00:03:41.350> which<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:42.550> would<00:03:42.670> assume<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:43.360> if<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:44.290> have

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
trim which I would assume is if you have

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.860 
trim which I would assume is if you have
a<00:03:44.830> red<00:03:45.190> car<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.910> would<00:03:46.060> extend<00:03:46.270> to<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.570> inside

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
a red car it would extend to the inside

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.580 
a red car it would extend to the inside
but<00:03:47.280> again<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.310> don't<00:03:48.430> know<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.850> for<00:03:49.090> sure

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
but again I don't know that for sure

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.710 
but again I don't know that for sure
maybe<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.800> better<00:03:50.950> question<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.580> is<00:03:52.360> it<00:03:52.630> worth

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
maybe the better question is is it worth

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.680 
maybe the better question is is it worth
the<00:03:52.870> money<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.790> resounding<00:03:55.090> complaint

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
the money and the resounding complaint

the money and the resounding complaint
or<00:03:56.590> comments<00:03:57.070> will<00:03:57.250> be<00:03:57.360> why<00:03:58.360> is<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:58.630> so

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
or comments will be why is it so

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.270 
or comments will be why is it so
expensive<00:03:58.900> why<00:03:59.470> is<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.740> that<00:03:59.890> much<00:04:00.100> more

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
expensive why is it that much more

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.699

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
why because it looks a hell of a lot

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.740 
why because it looks a hell of a lot
better<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.550> arguably<00:04:06.940> although<00:04:07.720> I

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
better and it arguably although I

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.810 
better and it arguably although I
haven't<00:04:07.989> driven<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.560> 3-series<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.610> much

drives<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.900> lot<00:04:11.050> better<00:04:11.850> but<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:12.910> will<00:04:13.120> tell<00:04:13.300> you

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
drives a lot better but I will tell you

that<00:04:41.620> sounds<00:04:41.919> kind<00:04:42.100> of<00:04:42.130> cliche<00:04:42.220> and

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
that sounds kind of cliche and

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.700 
that sounds kind of cliche and
everything<00:04:42.880> but<00:04:43.030> honestly<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:43.840> just<00:04:43.870> looks<00:04:44.410> I

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
everything but honestly it just looks I

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.460 
everything but honestly it just looks I
mean<00:04:45.100> it's<00:04:45.340> more<00:04:45.490> in<00:04:45.640> tune<00:04:45.850> with<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.210> time

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.680 

and<00:04:53.230> just<00:04:53.530> it<00:04:53.770> better<00:04:54.310> represents<00:04:55.120> perhaps

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
and just it better represents perhaps

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.770
