add-on<00:03:51.190> teleporter<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.230> yeah<00:03:53.230> my<00:03:54.810> my<00:03:55.810> shaders

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
add-on teleporter and yeah my my shaders

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.390 
add-on teleporter and yeah my my shaders
doesn't<00:03:56.530> show<00:03:56.650> up<00:03:56.739> in<00:03:56.859> there<00:03:56.980> because<00:03:57.250> it's

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
doesn't show up in there because it's

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.309 
doesn't show up in there because it's
like<00:03:57.579> an<00:03:57.669> in<00:03:57.760> hand<00:03:58.180> it's<00:03:58.569> like<00:03:58.690> an<00:03:58.870> enhancement

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
like an in hand it's like an enhancement

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.229 
like an in hand it's like an enhancement
so<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.680> really<00:03:59.829> doesn't<00:04:00.040> count<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.609> guess<00:04:00.819> it

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
so it really doesn't count I guess it

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.550 
so it really doesn't count I guess it
shows<00:04:01.419> up<00:04:01.599> in<00:04:01.720> here<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.109> shaders<00:04:02.380> thing

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
shows up in here and the shaders thing

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.440 
shows up in here and the shaders thing
but<00:04:02.769> yeah<00:04:03.340> that's<00:04:03.430> basically<00:04:03.549> all<00:04:04.000> there<00:04:04.329> is

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450
