00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.719 
attributes to that and so I think you
see<00:01:51.560> that<00:01:51.590> in<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.950> new<00:01:52.040> products<00:01:52.399> that<00:01:52.460> we've

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
see that in the new products that we've

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.170 
see that in the new products that we've
recently<00:01:53.390> introduced

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.550 

the<00:01:57.180> person<00:01:57.509> who<00:01:57.600> buys<00:01:57.780> Alexis<00:01:58.439> has

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the person who buys Alexis has

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.380 
the person who buys Alexis has
historically<00:01:59.070> been<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.340> baby<00:01:59.610> boomer<00:01:59.970> right<00:02:00.360> I

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
historically been a baby boomer right I

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.999 
historically been a baby boomer right I
mean<00:02:00.600> we've<00:02:00.720> really<00:02:01.080> grown<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.799> baby

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
mean we've really grown with baby

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.469 
mean we've really grown with baby
boomers<00:02:02.400> since<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.790> were<00:02:02.850> introduced<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.450> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
boomers since we were introduced as a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.410 
boomers since we were introduced as a
1990<00:02:04.290> model<00:02:04.590> year<00:02:04.770> lineup<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.490> cars<00:02:05.759> we've

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
1990 model year lineup of cars we've

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.639 
1990 model year lineup of cars we've
grown<00:02:06.570> with<00:02:06.750> baby<00:02:06.930> boomers<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.440> think

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
grown with baby boomers and I think

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.960 
grown with baby boomers and I think
we've<00:02:07.740> done<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.890> great<00:02:08.009> job<00:02:08.130> of<00:02:08.310> satisfying

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
we've done a great job of satisfying

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.100 
we've done a great job of satisfying
their<00:02:09.179> desire<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.479> kind<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.929> just

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
their desire for kind of just

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.350 
their desire for kind of just
reliability<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:10.890> comfort<00:02:11.069> as<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:12.090> look<00:02:12.330> now

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
reliability and comfort as we look now

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.660 
reliability and comfort as we look now

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
at the market as its evolving as younger

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.150 
at the market as its evolving as younger
people<00:02:14.790> are<00:02:15.180> entering<00:02:15.540> luxury<00:02:16.020> at<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.590> faster

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
pace than ever before it's time for us

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.930 
pace than ever before it's time for us
to<00:02:19.560> add<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.709> little<00:02:19.860> bit<00:02:20.040> more<00:02:20.069> emotion<00:02:20.760> into

to add a little bit more emotion into

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.729 
to add a little bit more emotion into
the<00:02:20.970> cars<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.900> think<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.350> see<00:02:22.590> the

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
the cars and so I think you see the

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.740 
the cars and so I think you see the
emotion<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.220> cars<00:02:23.459> visually<00:02:23.970> but<00:02:24.480> more

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
emotion in the cars visually but more

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.000 
emotion in the cars visually but more

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
emotion in all of our new products the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.740 
emotion in all of our new products the
brand<00:02:31.830> has<00:02:32.040> always<00:02:32.280> had<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.610> commitment<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
environment a commitment to doing what's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.770 
environment a commitment to doing what's
best<00:02:35.370> for<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.880> globe<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.390> think<00:02:36.600> that's

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
best for the globe and I think that's

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.420
