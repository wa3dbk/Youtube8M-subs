00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.730

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.269
 attend to us but let's move forward and 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.340
 I do not want to imagine what excuse is going to 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.019
 why not come here today to 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.390

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.980

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.160

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.970
 each face muamar kadhafi resigns 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.380
 resign if you have eggs 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.680
 and blame the rest excuse me 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.320
 instead of this mister this and 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.100
 respectful worth to know why 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.060
 no wine is going to occupy Mr. Rafa 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.060
 Dominican delight 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.270
 they think that fuck 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.640
 well not today's photography subject 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.820
 the photography industry the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.920
 wonderful art of photography is 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.250
 evolving is involving one 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.630
 active with the roll to reveal the 32 8 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.030
 Photos 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.640
 nowadays I do not know why I got a thousand 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.640
 digital media how is this 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.409
 so I was swimming and getting shipwrecked 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.259
 what photography is 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.229
 it's a big business a huge business that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.109
 is made from the man of the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.899
 nostalgia of the human being of love 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.759
 Honey of being all the time trying 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.430
 to freeze it from staying in that 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.890
 moment at birth will 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.810
 plugged in a photo the moment when 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.940
 it hurts other photos of the 15 to the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.019
 18 and we are always wanting to capture 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.019
 moments that cute 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.150
 the moment one dies there is a 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.519
 sort of quick flashback like a 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.290
 summary of all the photos that one took 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.420
 in your life 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.910
 so if a movie is a set 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.890
 of photos taken simultaneously deals 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.569
 so many per minute that it looks so fast 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.790
 when he has an album of his life since 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.200
 bb to the end and it happens so fast 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.180
 how the cartoons originated 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.250
 they have the movie of their life the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.840
 biography of his life and when one dies 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.799
 that's what happens all the pictures 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.799
 that one took out in his life 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.239
 before dying to enter the morgue 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:03.300
 none really goes inside but 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.430
 especially of a young 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.690
 have this degree of sensitivity and 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.690
 have realized are the chants 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.670
 this young man who puts this phenomenon of 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:21.370
 relate life and death to the 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.450
 photography had already been explained by the 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.549
 greeks with the mysteries of eleusis the 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.160
 Mystery of Eleusis explained how the 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.049
 trans soul liked during death 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.930
 at the same time, however, life is one thing 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.410
 the red eyes the red eyes had them 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.260
 because they used hallucinogenic substances 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.819
 and then the photo was taken without flash and 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.819
 they had red eyes 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.370
 they impose on me 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.150
 they also put schools of 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.150
 Photography 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.790
 I have been to learn to take pictures 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.790
 but but they put 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:10.050
 put to be able to take the photos white 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.260
 and black that the photo won and no longer 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.720
 uses more in reason or in days 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.489
 it is also no such duality that 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.530
 present the photograph as if they were 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.970
 here you are at the master do not talk about that one 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.670
 can make the movie of his life 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.410
 reviewing photography to the point that we have 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.780
 come today that is what I want 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.210
 to arrive is that one be worried 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.100
 because with that damn photograph that 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.320
 can take out of a cell phone in a bowling 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.270
 you do not scratch it by sucking on them 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.830
 mine what also miss is not 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.230
 caressing nobly the bulk 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.740
 us how can it be like it can be 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.740
 real weird 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.750
 that's a paparazzi that would go from the 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.729
 private video photos 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:56.789
 private photos of videos 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.789
 those who steal the moon 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.680
 He has seen them looked at each other 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.729
 in the vineyard that has honey 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.729
 which takes the peak 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.119
 this has been another deep treatment 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.439
 What has happened that we do not speak without knowing 

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:22.999
 the subject of photography in which I 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:24.529
 I think we came to the conclusion between 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.710
 all that if the lumière brothers 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:31.699
 they said live if the lumière brothers 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.710
 live then until here has arrived 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:38.020
 another installment of let's talk without knowing today 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.020
 with this table of notables and the young
