00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.480
 google android is how they are today with 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.610
 second video of the best 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.650
 applications because you see that he shared 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.780
 the same sources as the previous video 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.879
 with another youtube so the content 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.049
 Well, it was not entirely original, so 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.730
 I make this video as for 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.400
 compensate and discover you 4 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.860
 applications that will not know the first 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.500
 of all is a kind of bounce in that 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.090
 what you do for example this here 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.880
 we have four applications that we 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.040
 that we see now I will teach you since other 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.200
 four and we can have one that those 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.260
 We want this we will do it thanks to a 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.249
 application that is called flip launcher in 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.460
 philly browser 

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:41.770
 now I show you is a series 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.040
 of these as strips that are in the 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.629
 laterals from which if 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.430
 we want to the right or when 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.260
 we left the application itself we 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.690
 deploys four applications point 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.129
 that we created then by 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.470
 example now has all been activated 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.290
 then and now that post 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.870
 without opacity with which it is seen so that 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.879
 you see it prologue I take it off and you do like that and 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.740
 the four icons appear and if you 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.770
 we give the set and we give it an application 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.229
 we can continue to choose the application that 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.750
 we want to go and have to 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.080
 start from the east on the sidelines and here to 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.539
 from now on we will have then this 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.160
 application is very good is very 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.350
 configurable let's see it fripp 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.679
 launcher around here as you can see 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.390
 divided into six and if we give aaron that 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.750
 past space and I for example have 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.640
 activated these two here where to put them 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.990
 we can choose if we get out of the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.810
 left or right and if we give it 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.610
 here we can choose the background of the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.159
 icons for example if we choose red 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.319
 Well now it's going to be red 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.469
 then the most interesting thing of all is 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:53.109
 to be transparent or closer to 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.579
 so it's not that ugly then 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.929
 we can also configure how wide 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.939
 is to configure our sensitivity 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.490
 of the screen so now I what 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.310
 put here to right and as you see 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.750
 the free browser is really useful and here 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.640
 It allows us to access 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.739
 direct and our applications in 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.739
 whatever context we are where we are 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.890
 and we can activate or deactivate it 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.590
 is the browser now we go with this 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.450
 paranoia of wallpaper is very 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.579
 configurable and there are many themes so 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.849
 I show you this application is called 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.769
 bestial and has this icon then it is 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.049
 very complicated to configure but the 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.000
 result is very optimal and now you will see 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.920
 which can be of any type so 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.870
 once downloaded or see funds from 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.840
 screen and select the animated 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.400
 and we will choose bestiari then as 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.140
 you see here we are just establish as 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.819
 no wallpaper settings 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.760
 typical 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.499
 completed because you have to choose 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.719
 going to the right or to the 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:52.299
 left and it has as a kind of 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:55.450
 submenus then here as you see they go 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:58.090
 leaving the series of animals and backgrounds 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.250
 that we can select as the fund of 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.459
 screen then there are ones that are 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.129
 free and some that are paid there is a 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.719
 free pay version in the store 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.250
 example let's imagine that we like this and 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:12.189
 We give to establish as fund of 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.469
 screen then we happened to have this 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.120
 so there are many issues and people 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.219
 so you can hang them online so 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.379
 every day there is more and it is 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:22.840
 choose the ones you like best then 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.120
 everything is like a little psychedelic though 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.409
 for me for example the effect this 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.379
 He loves and looks great on plan 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:32.139
 paranoia to surprise friends 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:34.409
 come on with the third application this 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:37.090
 will be an application with which we can 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.489
 choose what will be the tone of our 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.500
 mobile based on a song that we have 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.590
 on our phone then once the 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.049
 open we get the list of songs and 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.609
 for example is that we choose one that we 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.480
 like to have the background of 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.940
 screen 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.799
 then here we will come out what is all 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.200
 the song I do not know if you have seen it 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.799
 sometime in plan so in waves mode 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.750
 of the sound then we have two modes of 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.849
 comfort the one above and the one below the one 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.000
 above control where it starts and the 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.860
 second the duration then of the tone 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.120
 so if for example we put it here to 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.120
 see how a muscle 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.359
 well the thing is in this line 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.980
 yellow here is a bit white is 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.410
 the progress of the song we give to 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.470
 pause then once we imagine that 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:30.100
 we wanted this part as a tone of 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.139
 our calls we give when saving and 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.770
 here we can choose that if the tone 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.030
 notification alarm call 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.960
 so for example this is we would take 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.760
 Ringtone and we give to save 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.680
 so here we can make it through 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.110
 defect for all or even for a 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.820
 contact is to say that each contact 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.610
 have your personalized ringtone 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.120
 for example we will give him I did not want to give 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.130
 there would have been good by default and now 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.260
 would be for all calls that 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.610
 receive my phone 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.760
 now we continue with a game that 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.370
 It really is fun 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.360
 wait under the volume this is called 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.630
 smugglers now you will see then funk and 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.310
 schmucler then the fun of this 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.560
 game is for example we are like a 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.860
 airport control then we have 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.890
 that around here is like a X-ray and 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.830
 they pass a series of characters that can 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:30.250
 carry weapons or you see it then the 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.050
 red are the dangerous ones and the green ones 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.880
 Well, they have to be maintained then 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.900
 we have to drag the finger 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.090
 screen catching all the red ones and then 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.430
 taking them out of the yellow margin 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.010
 if we make combos then in plan fruit 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.230
 ninja also tells us as more points 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.330
 and if we take some green then we 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.130
 subtract points at the beginning it seems very 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.110
 easy so I pass one at the beginning 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.550
 It seems very easy very easy but 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.920
 really then as you go forward 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.510
 the eye is becoming more complicated and 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.890
 you have to do pretty movements 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:07.120
 complexes to remove all the 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:08.800
 souls to tourists then this is a 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.289
 very recommended game 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.629
 then we can get coins and 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.580
 you can get other advantages that do not 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:17.669
 they will be very useful and we would have to go 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.919
 advancing then the people as it goes as 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:23.349
 employee more arms dealer this 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.360
 game is called funk les muyeres this is 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:28.349
 Droid plan have liked to subscribe 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.349
 until the next androids
