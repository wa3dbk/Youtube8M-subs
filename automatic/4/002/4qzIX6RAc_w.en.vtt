00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:11.179
 [Music] 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.179
 [Applause] 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.310
 [Music] 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.740
 hello how about jota space friends 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.580
 gonzÃ¡lez and today I present this 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.990
 new series of 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.720
 episodes that I'm going to talk about all 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.380
 the characteristics that nikon meets 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.050
 d7000 100 the truth is that there are not many 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.610
 tutorials in Spanish that's why I 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.230
 I want to give the task of power 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.760
 convey a bit of what I've 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.090
 learned through these tutorials 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.990
 in English and explain what it's for 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.410
 each of the buttons that make up 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.490
 camera and well then let's start the 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.460
 Today I am going to talk about the 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:54.140
 dials with the dial specifically the 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:57.800
 tomÃ¡s control dial that would be this 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.600
 it's special yes very well today I'm going to 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.960
 Commonly explain the camera always 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.690
 comes in the s that is a simple photo I'm going 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.860
 to try to focus on an object we are going to 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.160
 grab 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.210
 in automatic for practical purposes 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.409
 so what is it that makes me is this 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.799
 [Music] 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.399
 it takes then the function that has this is 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:26.200
 only a single photograph no more if 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:28.840
 then we have a cl the cl 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.939
 it's just a little more speed 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.070
 fast photography very well I'm going to 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.070
 press the shutter button 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:43.270
 there is the sequence of photos very well 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.160
 Now, I'm going to wait 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.390
 I recommend for sports photography or 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.250
 of a lot of movement 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.910
 and here is 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.550
 If you look is much faster 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.070
 Shooting 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.800
 the camera has shoots up to 7 front 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.690
 of photographs per second and the truth 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.430
 is that it varies depending on the functions 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.400
 that you have it also later on 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.649
 save these more advanced functions 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.390
 next comes the cv cube what does 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.170
 is that the shutter is quieter 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.170
 I'm going to do a test 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.790
 again I press the trigger and 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.000
 until it's loose, it shoots 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:29.430
 I want you to hear the sound 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.549
 Well, here I am going to put it 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.549
 here we already have it in the sound 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.000
 perspective this listen to the sound 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.140
 because again so that they can locate 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.140
 the difference 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.989
 q 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.970
 so as I repeat, is the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.800
 photography does not want to do much 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.010
 noise maybe even a child who is 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.980
 want to take 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.439
 asleep this is depending on the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.540
 situation in which you find yourself few 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.120
 words 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.209
 the noise and then we have what is the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.810
 programming button that is to say that 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.299
 You can take pictures every two seconds each 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.920
 five seconds every ten seconds and 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.080
 Well obviously wait 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.720
 to take photos this 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:32.140
 every so often also timelapse 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.960
 we also have what is the sea is what 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.890
 it leaves the mirror up I will 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.890
 press trigger 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.380
 I can let go of my hand without problem and 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.600
 until you return to print runs 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.430
 the photograph 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.870
 same way it also has a function 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.870
 similar what is this 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:59.240
 also in some way to avoid 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:01.910
 make noise also capture what happens 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.700
 is that what it does is that the mirror 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.440
 up and this really prevents it from 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.440
 generate more noise again 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.070
 then better here we can have a 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.320
 raised and focused and the moment that 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.990
 we want to shoot 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.150
 so then those are the functions of 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.949
 this style 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.710
 our cove that this can serve you 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:32.050
 this is something very small already in the 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.650
 next episode we explained the dial of 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.650
 up thank you
