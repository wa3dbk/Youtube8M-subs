00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
done with this video so let's take a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.360 
done with this video so let's take a
quick<00:00:32.279> look<00:00:32.429> here<00:00:32.489> at<00:00:32.730> drift<00:00:33.149> he<00:00:33.929> is<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.769> drift

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
quick look here at drift he is a drift

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.130 
quick look here at drift he is a drift
car<00:00:37.429> and<00:00:38.429> the<00:00:38.789> ankle<00:00:39.089> I'm<00:00:39.179> taking<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.780> he<00:00:39.989> looks

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
car and the ankle I'm taking it he looks

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.950 
car and the ankle I'm taking it he looks
a<00:00:40.230> little<00:00:40.440> flatter<00:00:40.739> than<00:00:40.980> he<00:00:41.159> is<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.719> not<00:00:42.719> sure

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
a little flatter than he is but not sure

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.529 
a little flatter than he is but not sure
why<00:00:43.109> that<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.379> must<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.039> HD<00:00:44.940> wide-angle

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
why that is must be the HD wide-angle

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.860 
why that is must be the HD wide-angle
camera<00:00:45.719> here<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:48.120> also<00:00:48.359> the<00:00:48.480> front<00:00:48.719> looks

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
camera here so and also the front looks

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.599 
camera here so and also the front looks
a<00:00:48.989> lot<00:00:49.140> bigger<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.859> really<00:00:50.190> isn't

a lot bigger but it really isn't
anyway<00:00:50.940> strange<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> drift<00:00:53.579> here<00:00:53.909> is<00:00:54.179> an

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
anyway strange so drift here is an

well let's just get him out of the way

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.870 
well let's just get him out of the way
for<00:01:30.509> now

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
for now

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.920 
for now
so<00:01:32.880> transformation<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.859> little

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
so transformation it's a little

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.569 
so transformation it's a little
complicated<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.320> would<00:01:37.469> say<00:01:37.710> compared<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
complicated I would say compared to the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.830 
complicated I would say compared to the
to<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:40.520> well<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.729> some<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.240> my<00:01:42.299> other<00:01:42.390> farmers

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
to the well to some of my other farmers

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
to the well to some of my other farmers
but<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.530> very<00:01:43.740> interesting<00:01:43.950> you'll<00:01:44.250> see<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
but it's very interesting you'll see the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.810 
but it's very interesting you'll see the
final<00:01:44.789> product<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.149> really<00:01:45.450> cool<00:01:46.579> so<00:01:47.579> let's

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
final product is really cool so let's

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.399 
final product is really cool so let's
get<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.240> transformation<00:01:48.689> transformation

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
get to transformation transformation

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.830 
get to transformation transformation
we'll<00:01:49.920> start<00:01:50.189> with<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> top<00:01:50.549> first<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.659> what

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
we'll start with the top first so what

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.080 
we'll start with the top first so what
we<00:01:51.929> want<00:01:52.109> to<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.289> first<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.859> we<00:01:53.340> want<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.789> pull

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
we want to do first is we want to pull

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.169 
we want to do first is we want to pull
out<00:01:54.299> these<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.770> front<00:01:56.070> sections<00:01:56.549> here<00:01:56.880> which

back 180 okay so you can see what these

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.369 
back 180 okay so you can see what these
are<00:03:23.189> becoming<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.790> legs<00:03:24.000> these<00:03:24.870> sections

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
are becoming the legs these sections

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.589 
are becoming the legs these sections
here<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.799> can<00:03:25.950> move<00:03:26.129> them<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.370> bit<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.790> get

the legs you have the side panels you

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.150 
the legs you have the side panels you
can<00:06:05.570> move<00:06:05.780> back<00:06:06.020> out<00:06:06.200> of<00:06:06.230> the<00:06:06.410> way<00:06:06.590> I<00:06:06.830> want<00:06:07.130> to

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
can move back out of the way I want to

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.280 
can move back out of the way I want to
take<00:06:07.370> this<00:06:07.580> and<00:06:08.450> move<00:06:08.630> that<00:06:08.870> in<00:06:09.050> like<00:06:09.260> that

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
take this and move that in like that

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.140 
take this and move that in like that
which<00:06:09.890> is<00:06:10.100> the<00:06:12.100> the<00:06:13.100> windshield<00:06:13.580> and<00:06:13.700> so<00:06:13.880> forth

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
which is the the windshield and so forth

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.230 
which is the the windshield and so forth
and<00:06:14.420> then<00:06:14.540> you<00:06:14.660> want<00:06:14.810> to<00:06:14.870> move<00:06:15.020> these<00:06:15.320> guys

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
and then you want to move these guys

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.940 
and then you want to move these guys
however<00:06:17.240> you<00:06:17.480> like<00:06:17.660> so<00:06:18.170> again<00:06:18.440> you<00:06:18.560> have<00:06:18.590> a<00:06:18.740> lot

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
however you like so again you have a lot

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.010 
however you like so again you have a lot
of<00:06:18.980> plausibility<00:06:19.460> here<00:06:19.820> if<00:06:19.880> you<00:06:20.000> want<00:06:20.210> it<00:06:20.330> and

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
of plausibility here if you want it and

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.900 
of plausibility here if you want it and
you<00:06:21.950> can<00:06:22.130> hold<00:06:23.680> weapons<00:06:24.680> and<00:06:25.160> all<00:06:25.580> that<00:06:25.730> kind

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
you can hold weapons and all that kind

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.910 
you can hold weapons and all that kind
of<00:06:25.940> stuff<00:06:26.230> they're<00:06:27.230> gonna<00:06:27.320> have<00:06:27.500> to<00:06:27.530> give<00:06:27.710> up<00:06:27.800> a

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
of stuff they're gonna have to give up a

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.300 
of stuff they're gonna have to give up a
little<00:06:28.220> bit<00:06:28.490> of<00:06:28.610> detail<00:06:29.030> for<00:06:29.330> poseability<00:06:29.810> I

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
little bit of detail for poseability I

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.630 
little bit of detail for poseability I
think<00:06:31.310> the<00:06:31.430> end<00:06:31.580> product<00:06:32.030> is<00:06:32.180> pretty<00:06:32.480> cool<00:06:32.780> so

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:33.640 
think the end product is pretty cool so

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.220 
think the end product is pretty cool so
again<00:06:34.640> you<00:06:34.760> can<00:06:34.850> move<00:06:35.030> that<00:06:35.210> up<00:06:35.390> like<00:06:35.690> so<00:06:35.990> and

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
again you can move that up like so and

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.750 
again you can move that up like so and
I'm<00:06:36.830> just<00:06:36.980> going<00:06:37.130> to<00:06:37.160> put<00:06:37.310> them<00:06:37.370> on<00:06:37.550> that

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
I'm just going to put them on that

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.240 
I'm just going to put them on that
turntable<00:06:38.420> so<00:06:38.960> we<00:06:39.080> can<00:06:39.230> move<00:06:39.350> them<00:06:39.530> around<00:06:39.650> and

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
turntable so we can move them around and

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.590 
turntable so we can move them around and
take<00:06:40.490> a<00:06:40.520> look<00:06:40.900> so<00:06:42.400> here<00:06:43.400> he<00:06:43.550> is<00:06:43.580> you<00:06:44.210> can<00:06:44.360> see
