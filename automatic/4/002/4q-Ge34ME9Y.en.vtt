no no no respiration and breathing are

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.919 
no no no respiration and breathing are
not<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.980> same<00:00:11.190> thing<00:00:11.519> as<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> matter<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.719> fact

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
not the same thing as a matter of fact

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.849 
not the same thing as a matter of fact
most<00:00:13.320> organisms<00:00:13.769> don't<00:00:14.130> even<00:00:14.490> have<00:00:14.670> lungs

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
most organisms don't even have lungs

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.470 
most organisms don't even have lungs
respiration<00:00:16.859> requires<00:00:17.119> carbohydrates<00:00:18.119> to

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
respiration requires carbohydrates to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.550 
respiration requires carbohydrates to
react<00:00:18.750> with<00:00:18.869> oxygen<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.650> release<00:00:19.710> energy

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
react with oxygen and release energy

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.840 
react with oxygen and release energy
cellular<00:00:22.560> respiration<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> lot<00:00:23.490> like<00:00:23.699> when

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
cellular respiration is a lot like when

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.750 
cellular respiration is a lot like when
you<00:00:23.939> light<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> fire<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:26.070> fuel<00:00:26.310> reacts<00:00:26.640> with

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
you light a fire the fuel reacts with

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.730 
you light a fire the fuel reacts with
oxygen<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.510> gives<00:00:27.869> off<00:00:27.960> energy<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> form

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
oxygen and gives off energy in the form

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.429 
oxygen and gives off energy in the form
of<00:00:28.949> light<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.519> heat<00:00:29.840> it<00:00:30.840> also<00:00:31.019> gives<00:00:31.320> off

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
of light and heat it also gives off

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.830 
of light and heat it also gives off
waste<00:00:31.740> products<00:00:32.309> such<00:00:32.489> as<00:00:32.520> carbon<00:00:32.969> dioxide<00:00:33.000> of

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
waste products such as carbon dioxide of

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.420 
waste products such as carbon dioxide of
course<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:34.920> can't<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:35.399> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
course we can't just have a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.310 
course we can't just have a
crack-a-lackin'<00:00:36.180> fire<00:00:36.390> down<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.750> your<00:00:37.020> cells

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
crack-a-lackin' fire down in your cells

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.410 
crack-a-lackin' fire down in your cells
so<00:00:37.620> instead<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.489> living<00:00:38.670> organisms<00:00:38.910> take

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
so instead of living organisms take

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.389 
so instead of living organisms take
carbohydrates<00:00:40.170> they<00:00:40.320> oxidize<00:00:40.860> them<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.280> use

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
carbohydrates they oxidize them and use

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.970 
carbohydrates they oxidize them and use
the<00:00:41.520> energy<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.090> make<00:00:42.270> ATP<00:00:42.980> adenosine

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the energy to make ATP adenosine

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.630 
the energy to make ATP adenosine
triphosphate

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.480 

so<00:00:53.240> first<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.630> all<00:00:53.750> an<00:00:53.870> organism<00:00:54.440> eats<00:00:55.070> food

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
so first of all an organism eats food

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.610 
so first of all an organism eats food
and<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:55.970> digestive<00:00:56.150> system<00:00:56.510> converts<00:00:57.170> most

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
and the digestive system converts most

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.890 
and the digestive system converts most
of<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:57.830> carbohydrates<00:00:58.580> to<00:00:59.330> a<00:00:59.360> sugar<00:00:59.810> are

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
of the carbohydrates to a sugar are

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.920 
of the carbohydrates to a sugar are
usually<00:01:00.350> glucose<00:01:00.860> now<00:01:01.760> glucose<00:01:02.240> has<00:01:02.480> six

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
usually glucose now glucose has six

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.290 
usually glucose now glucose has six
atoms<00:01:03.440> of<00:01:03.680> carbon<00:01:04.400> as<00:01:04.520> you<00:01:04.640> can<00:01:04.820> see<00:01:05.030> here<00:01:05.270> that

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
atoms of carbon as you can see here that

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.640 
atoms of carbon as you can see here that
means<00:01:05.660> we<00:01:05.930> use<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.230> subscript<00:01:06.860> C<00:01:07.190> six<00:01:07.580> and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
means we use the subscript C six and

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.350 
means we use the subscript C six and
it's<00:01:09.650> combined<00:01:10.160> as<00:01:10.370> a<00:01:10.400> carbohydrates<00:01:11.210> which

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
it's combined as a carbohydrates which

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.810 
it's combined as a carbohydrates which
combined<00:01:11.720> with<00:01:11.750> hydrogen's<00:01:12.350> have<00:01:12.650> c6<00:01:13.280> h-12

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
combined with hydrogen's have c6 h-12

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.790 
combined with hydrogen's have c6 h-12
and<00:01:14.090> there's<00:01:14.300> also<00:01:14.420> oxygen<00:01:14.990> in<00:01:15.229> it<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:15.590> the

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
and there's also oxygen in it so the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.000 
and there's also oxygen in it so the
whole<00:01:16.210> glucose<00:01:17.210> molecule<00:01:18.080> looks<00:01:18.290> like<00:01:18.470> c6

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
whole glucose molecule looks like c6

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.240 
whole glucose molecule looks like c6
h-12<00:01:19.580> o-6<00:01:20.260> now<00:01:21.260> when<00:01:21.470> it<00:01:21.590> gets<00:01:21.710> inside<00:01:21.979> your

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
h-12 o-6 now when it gets inside your

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.840 
h-12 o-6 now when it gets inside your
system

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
system

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.600 
system
we<00:01:23.360> then<00:01:23.570> oxidize<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:24.590> through<00:01:25.009> respiration

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
we then oxidize it through respiration

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.550 
we then oxidize it through respiration
to<00:01:26.000> talk<00:01:26.240> about<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:26.690> you're<00:01:26.840> adding<00:01:27.140> six

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
to talk about so you're adding six

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.030 
to talk about so you're adding six
molecules<00:01:28.130> of<00:01:28.610> free<00:01:28.910> oxygen<00:01:29.060> at<00:01:29.770> 6:02<00:01:30.770> and

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
molecules of free oxygen at 6:02 and

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.490 
molecules of free oxygen at 6:02 and
here's<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.150> health<00:01:32.390> formula<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.290> goes

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
here's the health formula it goes

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.890 
here's the health formula it goes
through<00:01:33.710> many<00:01:33.860> processes<00:01:34.550> inside<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.630> cell

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
through many processes inside the cell

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.710 
through many processes inside the cell
but<00:01:36.170> basically<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:36.770> start<00:01:37.009> with<00:01:37.130> glucose<00:01:37.850> you

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
but basically you start with glucose you

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.660 
but basically you start with glucose you
add<00:01:38.869> oxygen<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.680> reacts<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.100> oxygen<00:01:40.520> and

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
add oxygen and reacts the oxygen and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.359 
add oxygen and reacts the oxygen and
gives<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:40.970> six<00:01:41.930> molecules<00:01:42.830> of<00:01:43.190> carbon

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
gives you six molecules of carbon

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.990 
gives you six molecules of carbon
dioxide<00:01:44.050> six<00:01:45.050> molecules<00:01:45.800> of<00:01:46.160> water<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:46.820> of

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
dioxide six molecules of water and of

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.930

you turn back into ATP and you need more

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.670 
you turn back into ATP and you need more

then<00:02:40.709> all<00:02:40.859> you<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.099> do<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.459> exhale<00:02:41.969> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
then all you have to do is exhale the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:54.630 
then all you have to do is exhale the
carbon<00:02:42.180> dioxide<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:43.620> eliminate<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:44.310> h2o

nothing is for free you probably noticed
that<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:57.770> order<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.010> release<00:02:58.400> all<00:02:58.700> this<00:02:58.940> energy

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
that in order to release all this energy

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.200 
that in order to release all this energy
when<00:03:00.260> we<00:03:00.410> oxidize<00:03:00.740> carbohydrates<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.970> means

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
when we oxidize carbohydrates that means

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.480 
when we oxidize carbohydrates that means
that<00:03:02.570> energy<00:03:02.750> had<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.260> get<00:03:03.410> used<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:04.100> produce

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
that energy had to get used to produce

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.390 
that energy had to get used to produce
the<00:03:04.790> carbohydrates<00:03:05.570> first<00:03:05.930> place<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:07.220> where

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
the carbohydrates first place so where

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.040 
the carbohydrates first place so where
does<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.580> energy<00:03:07.670> come<00:03:07.910> from<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.600> make<00:03:08.840> these

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
does the energy come from to make these

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.710 
does the energy come from to make these
carbohydrates<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:11.180> answer<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.600> that

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
carbohydrates the answer is that

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.440 
carbohydrates the answer is that
ultimately<00:03:12.230> all<00:03:12.500> life<00:03:12.920> on<00:03:13.310> Earth<00:03:13.790> gets<00:03:14.090> power

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
ultimately all life on Earth gets power

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.040 
ultimately all life on Earth gets power
from<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.080> Sun<00:03:16.570> sunlight<00:03:17.570> through<00:03:17.960> the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
from the Sun sunlight through the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.900 
from the Sun sunlight through the
process<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.530> photosynthesis<00:03:19.280> does

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
process of photosynthesis does

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.020 
process of photosynthesis does
essentially<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.750> reverse<00:03:21.110> of<00:03:21.410> what

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
essentially the reverse of what

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.820 
essentially the reverse of what
respiration<00:03:23.030> does<00:03:23.270> so<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.320> start<00:03:24.740> with

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
respiration does so you start with

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.860 
respiration does so you start with
energy<00:03:25.460> from<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.790> Sun<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.270> combine<00:03:26.690> it<00:03:26.720> with

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
energy from the Sun you combine it with

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.670 
energy from the Sun you combine it with
water<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.650> co2<00:03:28.430> carbon<00:03:29.000> dioxide<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.870> this

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
water and co2 carbon dioxide and this

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.370 
water and co2 carbon dioxide and this
whole<00:03:30.890> process<00:03:31.220> gets<00:03:31.730> reversed<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:33.290> you

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
whole process gets reversed and so you

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.910 
whole process gets reversed and so you
end<00:03:33.560> up<00:03:33.680> creating<00:03:34.840> art<00:03:35.920> creating
