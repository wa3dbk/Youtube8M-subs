00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
smoke was a smoke color so what I did is

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.320 
smoke was a smoke color so what I did is
I<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.770> sanded<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> down<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.909> hit<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.150> with

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
I just sanded it down and I hit it with

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.590 
I just sanded it down and I hit it with
some<00:01:15.540> primer<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.830> was<00:01:17.610> gonna<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> gloss<00:01:18.570> black

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
some primer I was gonna do a gloss black

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.080 
some primer I was gonna do a gloss black
on<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.740> match<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.310> paint<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.700> much<00:01:20.909> as

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
on it to match the paint as much as

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.469 
on it to match the paint as much as
possible<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:22.710> honest<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:24.180> real

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
possible but to be honest it's it's real

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.230 
possible but to be honest it's it's real
if<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.900> would<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.170> been<00:01:25.290> hard<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:26.460> get<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> nice

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
if it would have been hard to get a nice

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.550 
if it would have been hard to get a nice
finish<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.329> figure<00:01:30.869> rather<00:01:31.110> than<00:01:31.409> it

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
finish on it so I figure rather than it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.969 
finish on it so I figure rather than it
looked<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> crappy<00:01:32.490> gloss<00:01:32.790> paint<00:01:33.180> job<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
looked like a crappy gloss paint job I

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.469 
looked like a crappy gloss paint job I
just<00:01:34.979> make<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.189> look<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> primer<00:01:36.150> paint

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
just make it look like a primer paint

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.179 
just make it look like a primer paint
job<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.170> primed<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> time

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
job so I just primed it for the time

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.520

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
piece of grill some mesh or something

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.520 
piece of grill some mesh or something
and<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.210> zip<00:02:03.780> tie<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.259> there<00:02:04.500> for

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and just zip tie it in there for

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.039 
and just zip tie it in there for
protection<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:06.180> plate<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.630> obviously

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
protection the plate is obviously

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.930 
protection the plate is obviously
covering<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.590> other<00:02:07.710> side

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940

racing line springs KY BG are two shocks

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.430 
racing line springs KY BG are two shocks
and<00:03:14.160> struts<00:03:14.490> so<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.940> ride<00:03:15.210> is<00:03:15.840> not

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
and struts so the ride is not

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.580 
and struts so the ride is not
particularly<00:03:17.250> low<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.120> back<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:19.230> front

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
particularly low in the back the front

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.250

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.170 
front of that bumper is not far from the
ground<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.170> this<00:03:26.130> bumper<00:03:26.550> is<00:03:26.610> just<00:03:26.820> gonna<00:03:26.970> be<00:03:27.150> a

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
ground so this bumper is just gonna be a

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.020 
ground so this bumper is just gonna be a
little<00:03:27.480> bit<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.690> peace<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:28.050> mind<00:03:28.290> for<00:03:28.500> me<00:03:29.030> it's
