00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
did not think we could take a chance of

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.240 
did not think we could take a chance of
whether<00:02:30.780> we<00:02:30.930> got<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.260> dart<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.130> we

whether we got the dart in it and we

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.650 
whether we got the dart in it and we
could<00:02:32.370> not<00:02:32.520> take<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> chance<00:02:32.819> on<00:02:33.180> whether<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
could not take a chance on whether the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.840 
could not take a chance on whether the
thing<00:02:33.870> would<00:02:34.020> get<00:02:34.140> loose<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:35.130> get<00:02:35.310> out<00:02:35.459> into

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
thing would get loose and get out into

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.760 
thing would get loose and get out into
the<00:02:35.970> neighborhoods<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.750> that's<00:02:36.930> why<00:02:37.080> that's

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
the neighborhoods so that's why that's

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.290
