00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:27.380
 or co god went or c maria 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.720
 all right 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.720
 the 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.040
 jim 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.510
 Peugeot gave birth in the 1980s 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.489
 look up with the 205 gti 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.219
 that name gave that monkey and show up to that 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:49.390
 Currently you have never conducted and think in 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:52.839
 his first a 1.6 liter 115 hp and something 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.329
 let's just 1.9 liters of cautious horsepower 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.100
 preferably that does not sound much now but we 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.130
 may not forget that that car 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.820
 860 kilograms of bows 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.930
 the 206 followed somewhat in the footsteps 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.680
 but could do it with a heavier one 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.230
 body 2 liters 136 hp 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.130
 not save against the violence what with that 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.680
 205 was down to the 207 hit Peugeot 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.830
 the gti phenomenon all over but now 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.830
 is Peugeot back with a 208 14 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.909
 I see them 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.909
 my job 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.750
 yes 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.149
 in a bank 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.219
 you summer that 208 gti are out and about 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.399
 actually shows that it is in the middle of one 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:47.649
 piece goes back to its origin 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.850
 the 208 is a bit smaller 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:54.909
 then the 207 weighs considerably less and 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.630
 has an engine that has serious power 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.630
 delivers 200 hp from a 1.6 liter turbo 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.530
 the like 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.040
 what stands out so behind the wheel is the 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.330
 quality of the materials but also the 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.160
 dare from peugeot 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.560
 under what color we add 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.320
 Here are some panels that are red 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.550
 slowly oh believe in black that is fun 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.280
 and done originally 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.590
 the 208 also this yeti has one 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.110
 remarkably small steering wheel and the secret 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.540
 bears fault that you are over the wheel 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.820
 look over the instruments 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.460
 tachometer and speedometer 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.440
 therefore dashboard has a bit of a 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.880
 mishmash of traits of a 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.880
 ordinary dashboard and a head-up display 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.680
 you have one here 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.010
 there is a lot of appearance 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.660
 nowadays no longer necessary to 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.970
 expressing the sportiness of a car 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.840
 and Peugeot knows in that regard 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.790
 good to touch with sprayed edges 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.350
 nice gti entry on the flanks of 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.470
 the bodywork 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.650
 nice wheels exactly those little things 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.490
 true core and respect hey that 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.490
 is the fastest version 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.129
 but as always it's about it 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.110
 total package 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.430
 what concerns Peugeot with that 208 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.180
 gti 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.769
 and car with first a high fun factor 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.170
 but also a model that 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.989
 very versatile even if 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.860
 family car on certain longer with 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.860
 sufficient luggage space 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.050
 a clear we calmly state that the 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.160
 gti 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.160
 back is my peugeot 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.270
 a 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.270
 a job 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.370
 it is 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.050
 I
