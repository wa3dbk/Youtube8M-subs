00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.370 
scrimmage they're keeping score what was
part<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> learning<00:00:24.750> experience<00:00:24.840> here

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.849 
part of the learning experience here
today<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:26.570> think<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.660> just<00:00:27.869> we<00:00:28.140> came<00:00:28.320> out<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.800> we

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
today I think we just we came out and we

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.990 
today I think we just we came out and we
jumped<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.460> them<00:00:29.670> got<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> big<00:00:30.869> lead<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.969> yeah<00:00:32.969> I

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
jumped on them got a big lead and yeah I

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.370 
jumped on them got a big lead and yeah I
think<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.420> might<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:33.780> lost<00:00:34.020> our<00:00:34.230> edge<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
think we might have just lost our edge a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.299 
think we might have just lost our edge a
little<00:00:34.590> bit<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:34.860> just<00:00:34.890> got<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> little

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
little bit we just got a little

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.860 
little bit we just got a little
comfortable<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:35.969> we're<00:00:36.149> not<00:00:36.570> playing

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
comfortable and we're not playing

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.049

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
together as a team what it's gotten us

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.930 
together as a team what it's gotten us
where<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.020> were<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.950> was<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.910> were

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
playing well because we were playing

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.290 
playing well because we were playing
together<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.789> we'll<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:44.940> get<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.180> right

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300

tomorrow<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:45.989> shows<00:00:46.200> us<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.680> can't

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
tomorrow it just shows us that we can't

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.740 
tomorrow it just shows us that we can't
move<00:00:47.160> away<00:00:47.309> from<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:47.760> we've<00:00:47.940> been<00:00:48.329> doing<00:00:48.600> so

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
move away from what we've been doing so

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.560 
move away from what we've been doing so
far<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.829> kind<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.280> hit<00:00:50.579> Game<00:00:50.879> three<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.510> do
