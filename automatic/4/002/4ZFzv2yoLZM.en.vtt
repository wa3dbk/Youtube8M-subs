 I am a hypolite illusion I presented them 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.240
 a really spectacular photograph 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.269
 entitled not to bother whose author is the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.949
 mister ernesto res besides the mention 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.199
 I would normally make a criticism 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.210
 constructive on the photo with the best 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.949
 to help them improve but in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.780
 this opportunity I do not have much that 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.930
 criticize since I consider it 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.340
 practically perfect the photo does not meet 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.040
 completely with some rules of 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.750
 composition but in this opportunity 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.059
 this is not important simply 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.219
 because photography is beautiful ernest
