00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:07.800 
all right so getting started is just

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.960 
all right so getting started is just
like<00:00:08.010> you<00:00:08.189> would<00:00:08.309> do<00:00:08.429> when<00:00:08.580> you're<00:00:08.700> going<00:00:08.790> to

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
like you would do when you're going to

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.650 
like you would do when you're going to
kick-start<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.230> ignition<00:00:10.440> on

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
kick-start it and the ignition on

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.390 
kick-start it and the ignition on
don't<00:00:12.660> touch<00:00:12.839> the<00:00:13.110> decompression<00:00:13.650> yet<00:00:14.129> and

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
don't touch the decompression yet and

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.820 
don't touch the decompression yet and
kick<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.509> kicker<00:00:15.749> over<00:00:18.470> until<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.590> see<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
kick the kicker over until you see the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.570 
kick the kicker over until you see the
AB<00:00:19.980> meter<00:00:20.220> deflect<00:00:21.080> then<00:00:22.310> push<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
AB meter deflect then push the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.620 
AB meter deflect then push the
compression<00:00:24.119> release<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.830> just<00:00:25.830> go<00:00:26.099> until

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
compression release and just go until

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.540 
compression release and just go until
just<00:00:27.630> give<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> little<00:00:28.140> push<00:00:28.500> until<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:29.160> have

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
just give it a little push until I have

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.550 
just give it a little push until I have
meter<00:00:29.730> hits<00:00:29.880> Center<00:00:30.449> again<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.230> that'll<00:00:31.349> put

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
meter hits Center again and that'll put

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.560 
meter hits Center again and that'll put
you<00:00:31.769> at<00:00:31.919> top<00:00:32.130> dead<00:00:32.310> center<00:00:32.700> which<00:00:33.240> means<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
you at top dead center which means the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.880 
you at top dead center which means the
valves<00:00:33.870> are<00:00:33.990> closed<00:00:34.230> which<00:00:34.410> means<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.770> can

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
valves are closed which means we can

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.979 
valves are closed which means we can
adjust<00:00:35.340> them<00:00:35.520> now<00:00:38.210> okay<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> side<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
adjust them now okay on the side of the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.979 
adjust them now okay on the side of the
engine<00:00:41.000> we've<00:00:42.000> got<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.239> little<00:00:42.420> cover<00:00:42.719> that

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
engine we've got this little cover that

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.560 
engine we've got this little cover that
covers<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.500> push<00:00:43.770> rods<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.390> they<00:00:45.390> are

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
covers up the push rods and they are

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.619 
covers up the push rods and they are
adjustable<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.680> take<00:00:46.949> a<00:00:47.250> wrench<00:00:48.210> on

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
adjustable so you just take a wrench on

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.389 
adjustable so you just take a wrench on
this<00:00:49.559> particular<00:00:50.010> part<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> motorcycle

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399

brilliant and you can see this is a
rubber<00:01:11.800> gasket<00:01:12.070> that<00:01:12.400> I'll<00:01:12.610> be<00:01:12.730> able<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:12.970> use

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
rubber gasket that I'll be able to use

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.850

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
want to make sure that they spin freely

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.370 
want to make sure that they spin freely
which<00:01:22.360> they<00:01:22.570> do<00:01:22.630> but<00:01:23.020> they<00:01:23.140> have<00:01:23.260> no

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
up-and-down play so this one doesn't

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.190 
up-and-down play so this one doesn't
move<00:01:25.420> up<00:01:25.540> and<00:01:25.630> down<00:01:25.720> at<00:01:25.900> all<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:29.170> one<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.990> has

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
a teeny bit of movement so I've got to

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
a teeny bit of movement so I've got to
get<00:01:33.730> in<00:01:33.850> there<00:01:33.910> with<00:01:34.060> some<00:01:34.150> little<00:01:34.270> wrenches

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
the top you just loosen up that bottom

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.060 
the top you just loosen up that bottom
nut<00:01:50.070> which<00:01:51.070> is<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.280> lock<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:52.229> then<00:01:53.229> use<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.500> 13

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
nut which is a lock that then use a 13

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
crank the bottom one clockwise which

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:14.790 
crank the bottom one clockwise which
makes<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.650> pitch<00:02:05.830> rod<00:02:06.040> longer

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.820 

yeah

that's pretty good now there's no

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.350 
that's pretty good now there's no
movement<00:02:20.310> now<00:02:21.310> when<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.460> tighten<00:02:21.850> up<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.150> lock

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
movement now when I tighten up this lock

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.690 
movement now when I tighten up this lock
net<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.810> have<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:23.860> be<00:02:23.980> sure<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.370> haven't

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
net I have to be sure that I haven't

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.420 
net I have to be sure that I haven't
made<00:02:24.820> it<00:02:24.970> longer<00:02:25.240> or<00:02:25.600> shorter<00:02:25.690> in<00:02:26.560> doing<00:02:27.250> that

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
made it longer or shorter in doing that

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.640 
made it longer or shorter in doing that
and<00:02:27.700> make<00:02:28.060> sure<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.570> still<00:02:28.780> spins<00:02:29.410> freely

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
and make sure that it still spins freely

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.970 
and make sure that it still spins freely
like<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.100> one<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.780> will<00:02:31.780> not<00:02:32.080> move<00:02:32.560> up<00:02:32.830> and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
like this one and will not move up and

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.170 
like this one and will not move up and
down<00:02:33.130> when<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.370> try<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.610> move<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.880> up<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.150> down

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
down when I try to move it up and down

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.850 
down when I try to move it up and down
if<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.750> doesn't<00:02:35.020> spin<00:02:35.200> freely<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.680> means

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
if it doesn't spin freely that means

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.600 
if it doesn't spin freely that means
it's<00:02:35.980> too<00:02:36.160> tight<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:37.060> have<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.300> loosen<00:02:37.600> it

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
it's too tight and you have to loosen it

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.590 
it's too tight and you have to loosen it
alright<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.640> can<00:02:39.850> see<00:02:40.030> I've<00:02:40.240> gotten<00:02:40.480> it

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
alright you can see I've gotten it

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.040 
alright you can see I've gotten it
adjusted<00:02:41.050> it's<00:02:41.710> a<00:02:42.570> thirteen<00:02:43.570> millimeter<00:02:43.750> on

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
adjusted it's a thirteen millimeter on

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.600 
adjusted it's a thirteen millimeter on
the<00:02:44.140> top<00:02:44.350> ranch<00:02:44.650> thirteen<00:02:45.100> millimeter<00:02:45.250> on<00:02:45.550> the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
the top ranch thirteen millimeter on the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.990 
the top ranch thirteen millimeter on the
bottom<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.420> twelve<00:02:46.750> in<00:02:46.960> the<00:02:47.050> middle<00:02:48.000> now

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
bottom and a twelve in the middle now

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.280 
bottom and a twelve in the middle now
it's<00:02:49.180> best<00:02:49.420> if<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:49.660> have<00:02:49.750> two<00:02:49.900> thirteen

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
it's best if you have two thirteen

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.390 
it's best if you have two thirteen
millimeter<00:02:50.440> wrenches<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.130> can<00:02:51.250> work

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
millimeter wrenches so you can work

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.190 
millimeter wrenches so you can work
these<00:02:51.580> two<00:02:51.820> at<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.060> same<00:02:52.210> time<00:02:52.480> this<00:02:52.900> one<00:02:53.080> you

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
these two at the same time this one you

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.330 
these two at the same time this one you
can<00:02:53.320> pretty<00:02:53.440> much<00:02:53.530> spin<00:02:53.860> with<00:02:54.010> your<00:02:54.040> finger

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
can pretty much spin with your finger

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.060 
can pretty much spin with your finger
most<00:02:54.550> of<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.790> time<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.240> I<00:02:56.170> didn't<00:02:56.470> have<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.740> 13

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
most of the time and I didn't have to 13

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.860 
most of the time and I didn't have to 13
millimeter<00:02:57.400> inches<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:57.850> I've<00:02:57.970> used<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.300> 14<00:02:58.690> on

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
millimeter inches so I've used a 14 on

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.630 
millimeter inches so I've used a 14 on
the<00:02:58.960> top<00:02:59.140> just<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.440> hold<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.680> still<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.220> then

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
the top just to hold it still and then

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.460 
the top just to hold it still and then
when<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.880> came<00:03:01.000> time<00:03:01.210> to<00:03:01.270> torque<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.690> down<00:03:01.750> then

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
when it came time to torque it down then

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.550 
when it came time to torque it down then
I<00:03:02.620> used<00:03:02.800> a<00:03:02.920> 13<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.520> a<00:03:03.610> 12<00:03:03.960> so<00:03:04.960> now<00:03:05.080> it's<00:03:05.260> time<00:03:05.440> to

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
I used a 13 and a 12 so now it's time to

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.530 
I used a 13 and a 12 so now it's time to
put<00:03:05.740> this<00:03:05.950> cover<00:03:06.310> back<00:03:06.610> on<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.420> only

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
put this cover back on and the only

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.840 
put this cover back on and the only
trick<00:03:10.840> here<00:03:11.110> is<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:11.290> this<00:03:11.980> rubber<00:03:12.340> piece<00:03:12.640> on

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
trick here is that this rubber piece on

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.550 
trick here is that this rubber piece on
the<00:03:13.330> back<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.750> cover<00:03:13.900> has<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.140> little<00:03:14.410> hole

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
the back of the cover has a little hole

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.890 
the back of the cover has a little hole
in<00:03:14.710> it<00:03:14.830> that<00:03:15.010> needs<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.730> go<00:03:15.850> down<00:03:16.150> pointing

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
in it that needs to go down pointing

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.010 
in it that needs to go down pointing
down<00:03:17.080> so<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.710> put<00:03:17.890> that<00:03:17.920> on<00:03:18.750> there<00:03:19.750> with<00:03:19.900> that

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
down so I put that on there with that

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.970 
down so I put that on there with that
thing<00:03:20.500> pointing<00:03:20.860> down<00:03:25.350> washes<00:03:26.350> built-in<00:03:26.770> to

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
thing pointing down washes built-in to

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.250 
thing pointing down washes built-in to
it

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:49.589 

spin<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.099> back<00:03:35.280> on

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.370 

and<00:03:50.200> go<00:03:50.469> for<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.709> ride

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
and go for a ride

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.500 
and go for a ride
