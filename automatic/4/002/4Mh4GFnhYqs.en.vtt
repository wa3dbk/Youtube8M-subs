00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.770
 the art of cinquecento is the art of 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.419
 16th century is when the Renaissance 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.000
 emerged in Italy in the previous century 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.970
 in the quattrocento it is expanded by all 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.919
 the European courts but we're not going to 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.320
 talk about the European renaissance of what 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.320
 what we are going to talk about is some features 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.170
 generals of this Italian art of 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.230
 Cinquecento remember that the same thing 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.430
 the quattrocento was talking about 480 because 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.650
 It was the century 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:53.760
 15 now 5 80 is the 16th century in this 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.110
 century there are two great artistic centers 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.910
 that they are, above all, 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.070
 influences they had on the art of 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.829
 the next centuries that are rome and 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.860
 Venice 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.659
 the branch of the potatoes I begin by román 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.060
 the branch of the popes replaces 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.299
 Florence as the great creator center 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.040
 of the art that spreads throughout Europe 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.189
 the papacy and the great families 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.380
 continue that important function that in 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.380
 the history of art and the history of 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.110
 the rulers had already in the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.810
 Italian courts of the 480 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.660
 in architecture the construction of the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.440
 basilica of san pedro of the vaticano that 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.380
 can see in the picture marks a 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.110
 model to follow is a plant in its 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.390
 origin although then it was transformed is 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.880
 a centralized plant with a Greek cross 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.380
 that is, with the four sides of the cross 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.260
 of the same extension equal 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.979
 and covered with domes the first 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.509
 project was the twining architect and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.729
 then it was modified by others 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.430
 architects especially by miguel angel 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.340
 which is the one that made the great project 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.149
 central dome 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.900
 in painting inside what was this 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.140
 branch of the popes of the 16th century 580 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.430
 we must also consider the work of 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.310
 same angel miguel with this magnificent 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.989
 production that is the Sistine Chapel in 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.989
 the vault of the Sistine Chapel 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.239
 you can see the whole history of the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.660
 creation until the 10 commandments by 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.030
 in this case, you can see here 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.610
 since the creation of bbva coming out of the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.830
 rib of adam to the creation of adam 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.430
 in one of the best known images that 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.090
 then we will see again is a painting in 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.599
 the one that there are some architectural supports 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.410
 faked but that hold the 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.680
 naked to those called and judy and that 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.409
 kind of 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.049
 in a way to de-structure that is to say 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.579
 fake-break what space is 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.370
 architectural through these 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.900
 architectures and these paintings is something 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.049
 that then will have many 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.780
 consequences in the future is to break the 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.000
 architectural framework in the final judgment 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.840
 in the background what is it painted by miguelángel 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.180
 years later here that everything supports 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.780
 architectural has disappeared and Christ 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.849
 in the center like a god jupiter 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.919
 justiciero because they do not forget that 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.639
 we continue in the rebirth of that 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:39.239
 recovery of the classical world this god 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:42.510
 justiciero unchains a movement that 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.150
 throws some men to glory and 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.669
 other men to hell in a 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.280
 solitude isolation that obeys from 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:53.020
 some way to the tragic of fate 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.360
 that everyone has chosen 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.200
 within what is the branch of the popes 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.270
 between the milestones let's say it's the only thing 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.870
 of what I am dealing with in this 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:08.260
 small class is the work of rafael 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.780
 whose job for dad July second 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.420
 it was reflected in the decoration of the 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.270
 Vatican stays and among these 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.330
 decoration of the Vatican rooms 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:22.930
 we can highlight the school of Athens 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:25.210
 here we see the harmony between the world of 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.060
 classical antiquity and the great 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:32.350
 renaissance figures of 16 by 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.030
 example this figure of euclid euclides 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.400
 for he earned a metra of antiquity 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.730
 classic that leans on a 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.460
 tablet is the twine figure of the 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.680
 twining architect this figure we have 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.560
 here that represents platón is the 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.200
 figure of leonardo davinci this figure 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.770
 what we see here as heraclitus is 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.230
 miguelángel the same architecture of 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.110
 this school of Athens remembers what 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.900
 It was the first twine project 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.260
 the basilica of san pedro of the vaticano is 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:10.870
 say it presents a harmony between what 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:14.500
 It is the world of antiquity and the world 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.410
 of rebirth a world of birth 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.310
 that merges with this present and a 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:24.190
 world before the antiquity that is overcome 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.230
 and from there new paths are opened 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.330
 and new possibilities in history 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.680
 of art that will end up in the 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.979
 baroque 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.009
 the influence of miguelángel and rafael 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:39.850
 it's so big that artists end up 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:44.259
 working the way that is to say 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:48.520
 style of these great artists and there 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:50.500
 born in this 16th century a stream every 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.889
 once more delimited there is no need 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.840
 generalize but it is what is called 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.540
 mannerism 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.760
 why paint in the way of s 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.300
 Mannerism is disseminated in the courts 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.400
 European examples such signal is 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.419
 I bring it because you will know it 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:12.840
 very good as is the painting of the 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:15.660
 greco with some figures in which the 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.490
 model of nature has been lost and 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.760
 the models of the big ones are used 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.500
 teachers for example is important the 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.320
 anatomical study in this worship of 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.330
 the shepherds but really here the 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.210
 greco is not copying reality 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:33.180
 is based on models miguelángel 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.479
 Escós the other is overreacting is 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.310
 lengthening the figures with very bright lights 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:41.940
 intellectualized is to say that really 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:44.940
 it is very different from what was the 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:48.450
 model of nature that was followed in 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:51.360
 the origin in the rebirth but that 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:54.690
 paint the way to give origin to this to 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.530
 this trend within 16 which is in 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.530
 Mannerism
