some of the features that were initially
on<00:00:18.660> iOS<00:00:19.230> 7<00:00:19.560> may<00:00:19.680> not<00:00:19.890> be<00:00:20.010> here<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.430> I'm<00:00:20.520> gonna

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
actually this is probably the latest

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.009 
actually this is probably the latest
firmer<00:00:25.289> until<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.369> final<00:00:27.240> version<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.900> is

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
firmer until the final version that is

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.560 
firmer until the final version that is
released<00:00:28.410> by<00:00:28.710> Apple<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.699> developers<00:00:30.359> which

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
released by Apple to developers which

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.179 
released by Apple to developers which
are<00:00:30.779> which<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> golden<00:00:31.560> master<00:00:31.769> version

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
are which is the golden master version

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.430 
are which is the golden master version
so<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:33.390> keep<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.600> mind<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
so just keep in mind this is the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.680 
so just keep in mind this is the
probably<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.130> latest<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.850> less<00:00:36.360> buggy

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
probably the latest and less buggy

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.270 
probably the latest and less buggy
version<00:00:36.809> you're<00:00:37.230> gonna<00:00:37.380> get<00:00:37.559> until<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
version you're gonna get until the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.450 
version you're gonna get until the
official<00:00:38.670> release<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:40.100> let's<00:00:41.100> go<00:00:41.250> ahead<00:00:41.340> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
official release so let's go ahead and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.430 
official release so let's go ahead and
get<00:00:41.640> started<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.390> first<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:42.899> actually

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
get started so the first one actually

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.900 
get started so the first one actually
these<00:00:43.559> features<00:00:43.920> were<00:00:44.040> not<00:00:44.190> shown<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
these features were not shown on the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.069 
these features were not shown on the
keynotes<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.510> that's<00:00:45.719> why<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:45.960> called

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
keynotes so that's why it's called

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.260 
keynotes so that's why it's called
hidden<00:00:46.350> features<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.309> probably<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.120> have

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
hidden features so probably you have

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.240 
hidden features so probably you have
never<00:00:48.450> seen<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.809> before<00:00:48.899> or<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.680> seen<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.070> in

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
never seen it before or have seen it in

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.360 
never seen it before or have seen it in
other<00:00:50.430> videos<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.420> if<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.379> go<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.340> first

other videos so if you go here the first

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.709

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
updates itself and matches the time on

now next one I'm gonna show you guys is
an<00:01:14.130> hidden<00:01:15.060> feature<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.729> complex

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
an hidden feature on the complex

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.420 
an hidden feature on the complex
application<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.439> level<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
application which is a level so that

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.969 
application which is a level so that
actually<00:01:20.970> kills<00:01:21.270> some<00:01:22.229> other<00:01:22.409> applications

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
actually kills some other applications

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.160 
actually kills some other applications
that<00:01:23.009> were<00:01:23.310> built<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.990> you

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that were built just for that so if you

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.609 
that were built just for that so if you
see<00:01:25.619> here<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> compass<00:01:27.000> and

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
see here we have we have a compass and

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.289 
see here we have we have a compass and
if<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.799> swipe<00:01:29.009> left<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.520> stop<00:01:29.729> right<00:01:30.030> you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
if you swipe left they stop right you

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.090 
if you swipe left they stop right you
have<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> level<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.439> see<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:31.740> table<00:01:32.009> is

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
have a level as you can see my table is

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.590 
have a level as you can see my table is
like<00:01:32.220> 100<00:01:32.579> percent<00:01:32.640> level<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:35.299> you<00:01:36.299> if

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
like 100 percent level but if if you if

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.020 
like 100 percent level but if if you if
it<00:01:36.930> were<00:01:37.200> 100<00:01:37.920> percent<00:01:37.979> level<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.640> would<00:01:38.729> see

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
it were 100 percent level you would see

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.630 
it were 100 percent level you would see
this<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.320> second<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.340> get<00:01:41.490> it

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
this with just second if I can get it

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.219 
this with just second if I can get it
yeah<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.000> green<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.840> shows<00:01:43.020> it's

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
yeah it's green so it shows it's

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.370 
yeah it's green so it shows it's
completely<00:01:43.799> leveled<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.729> does<00:01:44.939> that

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
completely leveled and it does that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.039 
completely leveled and it does that
horizontally<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.530> vertically<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.670> well

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
horizontally and vertically as well

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.649 
horizontally and vertically as well
unless<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.240> can<00:01:51.240> see<00:01:51.450> that

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
unless I can get this you can see that

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.700 
unless I can get this you can see that
just<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.280> second<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:55.320> as<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.560> guys

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
just just for a second and as you guys

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.230 
just just for a second and as you guys
can<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.700> leveled<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:57.719> Cle<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:58.380> well<00:01:59.240> so

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
can see it is leveled for Cle as well so

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.420 
can see it is leveled for Cle as well so
that's<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.930> second<00:02:01.469> feature<00:02:01.829> right

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
that's it for this second feature right

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.359 
that's it for this second feature right
now<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:03.780> let's<00:02:03.960> go<00:02:04.110> ahead<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.619> go<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.070> next

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
now so let's go ahead and go to the next

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.600 
now so let's go ahead and go to the next
hidden<00:02:05.759> feature<00:02:05.969> which<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:07.020> QR<00:02:07.680> code<00:02:07.920> they

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
hidden feature which is QR code they

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.089 
hidden feature which is QR code they
have<00:02:08.640> built<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.330> QR<00:02:09.780> code<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
have built in QR code on the the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.720 
have built in QR code on the the
passbook

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
passbook

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.180 
passbook
so<00:02:12.239> if<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.629> some<00:02:12.900> key<00:02:13.110> look<00:02:13.290> or<00:02:13.470> QR<00:02:13.920> code

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
so if you have some key look or QR code

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.290 
so if you have some key look or QR code
didn't<00:02:14.430> want<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.640> take<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.790> look<00:02:14.970> at<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.150> or

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
didn't want to take a look at it or

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.809 
didn't want to take a look at it or
store<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.440> application<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.099> can<00:02:17.550> just

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
store on the application you can just

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.600 
store on the application you can just
hit<00:02:18.120> here<00:02:18.420> scan<00:02:18.900> cold<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:20.040> gonna<00:02:20.190> scan

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
hit here scan cold and it's gonna scan

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.259 
hit here scan cold and it's gonna scan
your<00:02:21.450> barcode<00:02:21.750> your<00:02:22.500> barcode<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.250> QR<00:02:23.790> code<00:02:24.000> as

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
your barcode your barcode and QR code as

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.960 
your barcode your barcode and QR code as
well<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:25.110> that's<00:02:25.290> pretty<00:02:25.470> neat<00:02:25.709> for<00:02:26.040> people

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
well so that's pretty neat for people

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.550 
well so that's pretty neat for people
who<00:02:27.120> use<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:28.080> don't<00:02:28.260> have<00:02:28.319> to

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
who use it and you don't have to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.470 
who use it and you don't have to
download<00:02:29.069> another<00:02:29.730> application<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.420> just

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
download another application you just

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.040 
download another application you just
have<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:31.019> built<00:02:31.709> in<00:02:31.860> iOS<00:02:32.430> 7<00:02:32.780> next<00:02:33.780> one<00:02:33.959> I'm

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
have that built in iOS 7 next one I'm

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.300 
have that built in iOS 7 next one I'm
gonna<00:02:34.200> show<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.500> that's<00:02:34.650> just<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:34.980> little

gonna show you that's just a little
thing<00:02:35.550> but<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:36.300> may<00:02:36.450> change<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.500> lot<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.040> things

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
thing but it may change a lot of things

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.160 
thing but it may change a lot of things
because<00:02:38.519> some<00:02:39.030> people<00:02:39.360> really<00:02:39.870> hate

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
because some people really hate

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.720 
because some people really hate
newsstand<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.920> really<00:02:41.280> hate<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.549> way<00:02:41.580> you

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
can't put it in a folder so actually I

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.979 
can't put it in a folder so actually I
have<00:02:44.430> there<00:02:45.060> are<00:02:45.180> several<00:02:45.510> ways<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.930> doing

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
have there are several ways of doing

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.539 
have there are several ways of doing
that<00:02:46.319> by<00:02:46.500> jailbreaking<00:02:47.040> our<00:02:47.250> advice<00:02:47.519> and

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
that by jailbreaking our advice and

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.850 
that by jailbreaking our advice and
hacking<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.750> have<00:02:49.049> actually<00:02:49.590> done<00:02:49.829> a

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
hacking it and have actually done a

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.850 
hacking it and have actually done a
video<00:02:50.069> before<00:02:50.430> showing<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.819> guys<00:02:50.940> this<00:02:51.180> so
