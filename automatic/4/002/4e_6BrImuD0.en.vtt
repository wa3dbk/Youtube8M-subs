stalled we've opened up like lots of

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.830 
stalled we've opened up like lots of
apps<00:05:55.470> all<00:05:55.740> at<00:05:55.860> once<00:05:56.070> we've<00:05:56.460> tried<00:05:56.820> to<00:05:57.030> slow<00:05:57.690> it

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
apps all at once we've tried to slow it

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.290 
apps all at once we've tried to slow it
down<00:05:57.870> and<00:05:58.320> open<00:05:59.010> many<00:05:59.190> things<00:05:59.520> and<00:05:59.850> you<00:06:00.180> know

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
down and open many things and you know

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.930 
down and open many things and you know
rush<00:06:00.600> it<00:06:00.810> it<00:06:00.990> seems<00:06:01.440> to<00:06:01.680> be<00:06:01.710> running<00:06:02.610> very

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
rush it it seems to be running very

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.820 
rush it it seems to be running very
smoothly<00:06:03.270> it's<00:06:03.630> got<00:06:03.780> a<00:06:03.810> quad-core<00:06:04.080> processor

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
smoothly it's got a quad-core processor

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.920 
smoothly it's got a quad-core processor
so<00:06:05.150> we<00:06:06.150> don't<00:06:06.300> think<00:06:06.419> anything<00:06:06.690> is<00:06:06.720> going<00:06:06.870> to

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
so we don't think anything is going to

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.450 
so we don't think anything is going to
slow<00:06:07.110> this<00:06:07.229> down<00:06:07.290> we<00:06:07.919> really<00:06:08.130> want<00:06:08.310> to<00:06:08.340> get

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
slow this down we really want to get

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.130 
slow this down we really want to get
into<00:06:08.640> some<00:06:08.880> audio<00:06:09.120> tests<00:06:09.479> and<00:06:09.600> video<00:06:09.780> tests

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140
