00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.980 

this<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.120> how<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.270> copy<00:00:06.480> appearance

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
this is how to copy appearance

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.780 
this is how to copy appearance
attributes<00:00:07.500> in<00:00:07.680> Adobe<00:00:08.250> Illustrator<00:00:09.110> so

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
attributes in Adobe Illustrator so

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.150 
attributes in Adobe Illustrator so
sometimes<00:00:11.790> we<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.000> shapes<00:00:12.480> or<00:00:12.809> artwork<00:00:13.679> that

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
sometimes we have shapes or artwork that

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.700 
sometimes we have shapes or artwork that
has<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.849> certain<00:00:15.660> characteristic<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:16.650> we

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
has a certain characteristic that we

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.620 
has a certain characteristic that we
want<00:00:17.070> another<00:00:17.400> piece<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.910> work<00:00:18.060> that's<00:00:18.300> on

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
want another piece of the work that's on

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.590 
want another piece of the work that's on
the<00:00:18.810> actual<00:00:19.109> board<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.740> have<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.820> right<00:00:21.390> now<00:00:21.539> we

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
the actual board to have so right now we

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.740 
the actual board to have so right now we
have<00:00:22.130> two<00:00:23.130> squares<00:00:23.460> although<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.449> doesn't

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
have two squares although it doesn't

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.420 
have two squares although it doesn't
look<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:24.900> we<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.170> two<00:00:25.439> squares<00:00:25.740> we<00:00:26.279> have

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
look like we have two squares we have

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.859 
look like we have two squares we have
two<00:00:26.609> squares<00:00:27.140> this<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.590> actually<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> square

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
two squares this is actually a square

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.260 
two squares this is actually a square
with<00:00:30.869> an<00:00:31.140> effect<00:00:31.890> called<00:00:31.980> rounded<00:00:32.730> corners<00:00:33.120> on

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
with an effect called rounded corners on

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.040 
with an effect called rounded corners on
it<00:00:33.500> now<00:00:35.180> you<00:00:36.180> don't<00:00:36.329> necessarily<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it now you don't necessarily have to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.569 
it now you don't necessarily have to
worry<00:00:37.260> about<00:00:37.380> how<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> rounded

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
worry about how to do the rounded

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.010 
worry about how to do the rounded
corners<00:00:38.910> aspect<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
corners aspect this is just going to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.040 
corners aspect this is just going to
work<00:00:40.230> universally<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:41.040> anything<00:00:41.629> but<00:00:42.629> right

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
work universally for anything but right

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.279 
work universally for anything but right
now<00:00:43.230> let's<00:00:43.559> say<00:00:44.510> we<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.719> our<00:00:45.750> rounded

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
now let's say we have our rounded

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.170 
now let's say we have our rounded
corners<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.860> makes<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.309> look<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:47.910> an

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
corners and it makes this look like an

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.180 
corners and it makes this look like an
oval

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
oval

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.950 
oval
let's<00:00:50.190> say<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.520> want<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.000> Square<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.840> have

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
let's say we want this Square to have

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.520 
let's say we want this Square to have
the<00:00:52.140> same<00:00:52.410> attribute<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.260> Square<00:00:55.260> has

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the same attribute that this Square has

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.340 
the same attribute that this Square has
now<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.520> looks<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> circle<00:00:57.270> well<00:00:58.109> if

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
now that it looks like a circle well if

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.299 
now that it looks like a circle well if
you<00:00:58.649> head<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.859> over<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.280> your<00:00:59.520> layers<00:00:59.760> panel<00:01:00.059> if

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
you head on over to your layers panel if

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.280 
you head on over to your layers panel if
they're<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.430> two<00:01:02.609> separate<00:01:02.969> layers<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:03.840> if

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
they're on two separate layers or if

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.780 
they're on two separate layers or if
they're<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.979> sub<00:01:05.159> layer<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.640> to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
they're in a sub layer you have to

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.850 
they're in a sub layer you have to
expand<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.450> layer<00:01:06.810> by<00:01:07.380> clicking<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
expand that layer by clicking the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.789 
expand that layer by clicking the
drop-down<00:01:08.130> arrow<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.140> then<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.290> look<00:01:10.560> for

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
drop-down arrow and then you look for

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.320 
drop-down arrow and then you look for
the<00:01:10.860> layer<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.250> has<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.610> attribute<00:01:12.150> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the layer that has the attribute that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.050 
the layer that has the attribute that
you<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.159> what<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.909> can

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
you want and what you can do is you can

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.760 
you want and what you can do is you can
click<00:01:16.040> alt<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.759> your<00:01:17.790> keyboard<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:19.560> would

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
click alt on your keyboard and you would

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.460 
click alt on your keyboard and you would
drag<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.750> circle<00:01:22.020> that's<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
drag that little circle that's on the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.410 
drag that little circle that's on the
right<00:01:22.619> hand<00:01:22.860> side<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
right hand side because that's the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.480 
right hand side because that's the
appearance<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> item<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:26.100> soon<00:01:26.340> as

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
appearance of the item and as soon as

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
appearance of the item and as soon as
you<00:01:26.580> release<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:27.030> over<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> circle<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you release it over the circle of the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.789 
you release it over the circle of the
other<00:01:28.439> item<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:31.259> adopt<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
other item it will adopt all the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.929 
other item it will adopt all the
attributes<00:01:32.400> from<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.759> item<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:34.640> let's<00:01:35.640> just

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
attributes from that item so let's just

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.740 
attributes from that item so let's just
supply<00:01:36.900> another<00:01:37.229> quick<00:01:37.590> effect<00:01:38.090> let's<00:01:39.090> say<00:01:39.329> we

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
supply another quick effect let's say we

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.830 
supply another quick effect let's say we
delete<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.939> give<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.060> another<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.780> we

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
delete that give you another one and we

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:51.109 
delete that give you another one and we
go<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> effect<00:01:44.450> warp<00:01:46.220> arc<00:01:47.220> upper<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:49.939> this<00:01:50.939> is

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
go to effect warp arc upper and this is

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.630 
go to effect warp arc upper and this is
what<00:01:51.380> we're<00:01:52.380> looking<00:01:52.680> at<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.070> terms<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
what we're looking at in terms of the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.510 
what we're looking at in terms of the
upper<00:01:54.240> arc<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.409> let's<00:01:55.979> say<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.280> want

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
upper arc of this and let's say we want

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.399 
upper arc of this and let's say we want
our<00:01:56.670> other<00:01:57.060> item<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.570> have<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.110> would<00:01:58.259> head

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
our other item to have it we would head

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.429 
our other item to have it we would head
on<00:01:58.560> over<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.829> our<00:01:59.070> layers<00:01:59.219> panel<00:02:00.409> we're<00:02:01.409> going

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
on over to our layers panel we're going

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.249 
on over to our layers panel we're going
to<00:02:01.619> alter<00:02:02.310> option<00:02:02.759> click<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.240> drag<00:02:04.229> that

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
to alter option click and drag that

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.830 
to alter option click and drag that
option<00:02:05.009> down<00:02:05.369> into<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.420> element<00:02:06.750> that

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
option down into the element that

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.449 
option down into the element that
doesn't<00:02:07.049> have<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.590> now<00:02:09.950> they<00:02:10.950> both<00:02:11.099> have<00:02:11.310> it

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
doesn't have it in now they both have it

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.059 
doesn't have it in now they both have it
and<00:02:12.110> that's<00:02:13.110> how<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.319> copy<00:02:13.620> appearance

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
and that's how you copy appearance

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.660 
and that's how you copy appearance
attributes<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.730> Adobe<00:02:15.270> Illustrator
