00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hi everyone this is league cry 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.400
 so today I'm in the company of 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.350
 dz kraft go hi 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.599
 so today we find ourselves for 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.480
 a new video so this video 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.990
 so this is a trap already a 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.250
 foot I have a trick at the same time so 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.039
 so already I will introduce you 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.230
 so let's admit it's a cena the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.849
 here is an alley with a turning point there 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:31.439
 so I'm going to show you the person 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.780
 advance up and she falls down so that's 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.850
 funnels because if you dig 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.760
 in fact must you to dig 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.920
 deep and with how you put a 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.989
 chest with a funnel for you 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.230
 retrieve the stuff in fact so that the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.890
 stuff goes into the funnel and then 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.390
 in the trunk 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.629
 like that you got you back the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.410
 stage of the person gold the principle of 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.360
 this trap it is very simple so already 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.680
 you then we will destroy his theo not in 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.300
 destroyed the sarkozy go had the features 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.140
 with me I like you could be faster 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:13.020
 that's how it looks much destroyed 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.610
 just here it's good so in fact 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.080
 it's very simple so you put some 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.770
 sticky pistons so like that with 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.110
 why I put rock 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.140
 here you put rock or whatever 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.860
 you want then you put the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.290
 red stone behind hop you put a 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.920
 block so in the corner with a plate 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.659
 pressure then well you do by 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.130
 is here you continue so do you but 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.079
 keep going with the blog you put 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.420
 so me it's rock with a 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.390
 sticky piston behind and behind the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.369
 piston stop stone so actually what 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.220
 will activate the trap it's very simple if 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.280
 you take the blog that you want and 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.360
 you throw it on the pressure plate 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.450
 Well, that's for sure if Jean's side 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.050
 is here so you throw it on and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:05.430
 saw that the block is on it activates 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.290
 the pistols and when the person is going 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.229
 to get to the turn it'll make him 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.960
 pick up the block and suddenly it's okay 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.560
 make the pistons turn off and 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.840
 so the person will fall into the hole 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.430
 and it's impossible but it's 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.090
 inevitable we can not avoid it 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.790
 impossible 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.320
 and in addition he does not see himself because if 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.650
 you put it for example in a mine 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.370
 or anywhere oh well it's doing 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.250
 detectable and suddenly but yes it takes 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.010
 that you dig deep anyway and 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.530
 you put funnels with that 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.830
 funnels with a chest below 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.780
 for the funnel hebei and recovers 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.580
 the stuff and that sai in the in the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.340
 chest 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.520
 so here I hope you have 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:57.090
 enjoyed this little tutorial to recover 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.600
 stocks so put comments 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.260
 like and subscribe you go hi to the 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.250
