00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.319
 Beauty ideal of Young Republic of coquettes and backs full 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.230
 retractable top and the elegant two-tone paint finish in the 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.170
 predominantly Müller to the luxury managed significantly down-to-earth 4 25 to 4 2 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.149

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:49.289
 how much money he is much better for me 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.249
 Wasserburg 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:57.099
 Only two new cars came demolished in 1949 on the German market 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.519
 different fungicide Müller convertible are the splashes of color of their time 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.829

 light 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:11.029
 and he is just so beautiful there were people back then 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:15.149
 Loved extravagant but did not always want to put the initiative out of clown 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:19.629
 and so I got to build my tasks 2000 of these beautiful cadres 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:23.590
 but then only 696 TEUR were 90 and 49 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.110
 the production facility burned down 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.169
 these days too 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.610

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.650
 wants to go straight 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.999
 No exits 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:00.439

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.439
 from zero to a hundred, its six seconds go, and a sports car is that 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:10.779
 reasonable 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:15.739
 the top speed wonders 5 3 times but was not important until the wind around 

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:19.179

 Hanse-Carré 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:33.189
 If I now have a very noble paint he himself has a casual faith 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:37.919
 for the cardholder because it becomes easier in the form of 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.979
 Exceptionally, the man is so one 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.800
 all this, the station and Vanessa not to expect the different if 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.349
