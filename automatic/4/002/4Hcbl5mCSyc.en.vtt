00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 we're going to start being 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:11.420
 mobiles that are little fish on tape 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:14.740
 the materials are a mattress a scissor 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.830
 sequins of different colors 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.490
 and two ribbons of different colors 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.570
 well we grabbed the tape we put it in 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.570
 two fingers like that 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.679
 to the death 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.430
 we match here at the two ends 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.430
 same 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:43.180
 then why not the second tape the 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.180
 we went through the first 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.790
 where we spent all the first 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.579
 it's something like this 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.079
 let's do as a fabric and the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.750
 we turn around here 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.590
 that comes out the other side 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.590
 back 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.380
 try not to crease the tape 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:20.340
 then we passed this tape 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:23.689
 We had above it 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.689
 and below this one 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:37.810
 like a fabric then it's flipped over and 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.810
 we went through here because it 's the first 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.750
 then we pull out the fingers with enough 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.750
 watch out 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.340
 and we are arming here now yes 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.010
 here we are leaving the head of the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.260
 fish we are always accommodating by the 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.360
 soft hand 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:06.010
 wrinkling the tape my sings 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.530
 here we have the head of the little fish 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.720
 then now let's make the body the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.140
 body would be 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.120
 we put the little head here on the table 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.470
 then we count 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.850
 1 2 3 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.950
 the third one we pass below the 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.950
 second and ride the first 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.710
 at first 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.440
 well then the first one we had 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.990
 for the second one and we grabbed it with these 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.890
 crimes from here back 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:51.400
 then there is that is here the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.880
 we went through the third without going to play the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.880
 tape 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.599
 we put it by the first 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.599
 then now we go down smoothly 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.600
 without wrinkling the tape 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.600
 we are putting together the little fish 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.860
 no no 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:25.110
 the tape the tape that goes arming 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.410
 and the fish is almost armed 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.490
 huecco 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.310
 we flipped it on the other side 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:37.599
 and we do the same operation 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.349
 we place this tape below 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.349
 is 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.320
 and we talk and we put it 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.320
 For this 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.209
 a kind of fabric and we start there 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.209
 as an action request 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:05.940
 always gently with soft hands 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.940
 come without wrinkling the sindica 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.189
 always giving the figurine to the fish 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:20.440
 then when it is almost armed the 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:23.440
 body of the little fish we take the scissors 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.420
 and we are going to cut the allergic ones always 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.420
 how are the ethical salt of the little fish 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.589
 here goes the 2 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.039
 here are the 3 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.770
 activate the key 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.770
 They are four contact lenses 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.280
 we always press the right thing so that it stays 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.280
 all right 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:02.550
 then we see that the body was now 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.550
 let's see the fin from behind 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.630
 we take 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.830
 we do not make a cut here 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:18.850
 and we cut here you can throw 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.660
 then a little bit of colbún here yes already 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.660
 comes the high 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.200
 ojito 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.010
 on this side and on the other side why 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:48.340
 then 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.340
 we catch the fish and not 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.760
 diabetic that is being white 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.650
 we cut the same 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.770
 we fuck him when we cut so mom 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.650
 almost equal to the other time and we miss your 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.650
 powder 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.860
 here 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.860
 and here 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.569
 when the dust is already 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:32.940
 we place 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:37.260
 the water for the other side 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:39.969
 if we observe that the fish is left 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.689
 now we are going to 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:48.289
 we go with the eyes 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:52.309
 when the eyes would be here in the red 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:54.590
 we make an audience with the mattress and 

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:57.310
 we take out 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.430
 sequin 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:02.930
 we place here 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.710
 the same thing on the other side 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.710
 we place 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.150
 so that it is more or less in distance 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.150
 what 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:20.740
 another point with dust 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:20.740
 another the spangle and we place it to you 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:29.150
 it is reviewed that the pescaíto 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:29.150
 it's ready 

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:37.870
 in the eyes 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.870
 always squaring his eyes 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.930
 Well, I hope you learn at home 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:50.080
 do that this serves for children to 

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:53.050
 mobile so that children learn to 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:57.300
 distinguish the white color of rock and 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.300
 It has been a pleasure to have taught them
