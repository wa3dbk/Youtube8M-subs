00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.299
 the human genetic alphabet is 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.940
 gigantic each of the cells of the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.010
 body contains about 23 thousand genes and in 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.269
 one of those could hide the base 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.910
 of the success of an elite footballer when 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.869
 we talk about generality we talk about 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.519
 physical features that have a component 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.650
 hereditary 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.140
 many of these traits are very complex 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.219
 when we think about muscle strength 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.350
 or resistance we talk about tissues that 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.270
 they go from the brain the heart to the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.510
 muscles to bones and tendons 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.579
 each one is governed by different 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.190
 genes that genetic complexity present 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.780
 in all human beings the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.059
 task of identifying the responsible gene 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.920
 for exceptional performance in the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.920
 football in something not easy 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.250
 often we find ourselves as a 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.989
 value that says 99.9 of beings 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.330
 humans are identical that we 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.600
 we differentiate by only 0.1 percent 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.439
 which is very little 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.270
 s 0.1 means that of the 3000 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.850
 millions of letters that make up our 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.740
 genetic code there are 3 million 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.810
 different combinations that generate 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.960
 different physical characteristics and 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.960
 mental 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.840
 a group of young athletes from 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.940
 12 and 24 years is called to perform 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.310
 a series of genetic tests and 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.670
 physical and so evaluate your potential to 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.670
 football 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.170
 one of the things we're going to do today 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.819
 It is a genetic test to determine 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.700
 the type of muscle that they have in their 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:54.000
 body is not good in your whole mouth 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.000
 A) Yes 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.260
 will first DNA analysis 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.900
 the output samples of this test 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.830
 Genetics examines a particular gene 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.560
 which is called acting 3 or actn3 we look for 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.570
 the ability of the body to produce a 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.570
 specific type of muscle 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.900
 is gene actn3 helps synthesize a 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.000
 protein in the muscles that is 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.000
 important for muscle contraction 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.640
 but there are two different scripts 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:38.080
 for actn3 and the scientists what 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.710
 they call r or x1 gets a copy of 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.820
 this actn3 gene of mother and father 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:51.010
 it is possible then to have two R's a 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.830
 ry an X or 2x apparently only the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.210
 genotype xx that amin the protein of the 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.990
 muscle makes one have less 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.160
 probability of being a sprinter 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:06.330
 electric that an athlete would need 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.160
 have a rr combination in their actn3 gene 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.720
 to excel in modern football that 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.720
 it demands a lot of explosiveness and speed 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.400
 football coaches think that 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.760
 it's the resistance but it's not 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.439
 that strength and power are themes 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.810
 that should worry a coach 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:34.360
 football is a sport of power not of 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:39.609
 resistances like many trainers 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:42.010
 believe the analysis of DNA takes three 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.510
 weeks now they will be practiced 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.970
 series of physical tests 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.200
 we had coaches knocking down our 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.379
 door to find out how 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.000
 we selected the best athletes 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.159
 how we ended who were the 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.579
 better players and this index what 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.579
 allowed 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.460
 the first test is the jump 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.950
 vertical the vertical jump is 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.260
 probably the best indicator of 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.210
 talent for sports power 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.070
 done if only one were to practice a 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.590
 of the tests would be the jump 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.319
 vertical identifies the power 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.299
 explosive 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.509
 and that is what most of the 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.509
 athletes 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.160
 for the vertical jump that you are going to 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.500
 locate here so we measure your 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.900
 reach first based on how high 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.270
 jump we'll measure up to the markers in 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.550
 the post understood if one wants 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.790
 jump up must apply force 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.710
 on the floor is Newton's third law 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.639
 for every action there is an equal reaction 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.639
 in the opposite direction 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.979
 according to the tables of him and an athlete 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.210
 elite over the age of 22 must have a 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:01.880
 vertical jump of more than 109 centimeters 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.780
 an average athlete reaches about 85 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.780
 centimeters tall 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:11.259
 the six young athletes try 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.460
 jump to the maximum of your abilities but 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.379
 the two remaining tests for 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.749
 complete the diagnosis one of 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:19.919
 acceleration and another one of agility will be 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.919
 much more demanding 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.889
 many experts agree that football 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.669
 modern is highlighted by its requirement in 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.669
 speed and power 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.250
 football today compared to football 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.220
 30 years ago I think that the 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.220
 main difference that there is in day is 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.950
 that the players are stronger more 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.920
 fast not better 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.050
 the level of competition requirement 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.540
 requires that you have more athletes players 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.280
 if you analyze the players are better 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.280
 athletes that those of 40 years ago 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.059
 if one looks at the characteristics of 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.680
 had nine in the 80s for example 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:03.089
 they are not the same as they have now 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.490
 because soccer has become much more 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:07.619
 quick much more physical then the 9 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.759
 traditional for example from before the type 

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:10.800
 that could stand in the area and 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.809
 he only finished the play every day 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.610
 it looks much less because you need to have 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:17.749
 much more speed is a reaction 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.749
 much more skills 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.889
 I am a player of fast fibers and 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:29.160
 this makes me have speed I do not have 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:32.520
 perhaps the ability to sense the play 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.889
 as others have it, I have it maybe 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.319
 technique like others have but 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.660
 thanks to the speed I maintained today 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.870
 for today speed is very important 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.440
 If your life every game is played a lot 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.720
 speed 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.670
 combine speed and technique is very 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.350
 difficult that's why there are 34 players in the 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.930
 world that you know are the best because 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.290
 only they can combine these 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.290
 things
