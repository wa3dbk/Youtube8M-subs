00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
dream matte powder i got another one

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.840 
dream matte powder i got another one
because<00:00:49.860> my<00:00:50.190> other<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.460> has<00:00:50.610> hit<00:00:51.030> pan<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.690> lot

because my other one has hit pan a lot

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.790 
because my other one has hit pan a lot
so<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.840> pan<00:00:55.170> one<00:00:55.410> looks<00:00:55.620> like

so i decided i'll just get a new one now

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.420 
so i decided i'll just get a new one now
because<00:00:58.020> they<00:00:58.350> had<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> fifty<00:00:58.920> percent<00:00:59.190> off

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
because they had a fifty percent off

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.790

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
had I liked it but it clumped because it

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.600 
had I liked it but it clumped because it
was<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.290> lot<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.650> proof<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.040> it's<00:02:27.190> just<00:02:27.340> kind<00:02:27.550> of

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
was a lot of proof and it's just kind of

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.010 
was a lot of proof and it's just kind of
hard<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.910> get<00:02:28.030> off<00:02:28.150> himself<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.750> kind<00:02:28.930> of

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
hard to get off himself and it kind of

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.000 
hard to get off himself and it kind of
yeah<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:30.100> I<00:02:30.570> decided<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:32.200> get<00:02:32.350> our<00:02:32.590> proof<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:32.980> I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
yeah so I decided to get our proof and I

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.650 
yeah so I decided to get our proof and I
was<00:02:33.160> really<00:02:33.400> hesitant<00:02:33.760> on<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.360> because<00:02:34.600> of

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
was really hesitant on it because of

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.630 
was really hesitant on it because of
that<00:02:34.810> one<00:02:35.110> but<00:02:35.380> this<00:02:35.590> one<00:02:35.650> does<00:02:35.980> work<00:02:36.190> good<00:02:36.430> the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
that one but this one does work good the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.550 
that one but this one does work good the
waterproof<00:02:37.000> one<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:37.810> um<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.260> works<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.530> same

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
waterproof one so um it works the same

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
waterproof one so um it works the same
as<00:02:38.740> exciting<00:02:39.640> guy<00:02:40.140> well<00:02:41.140> I've<00:02:41.230> never<00:02:41.350> used<00:02:41.680> the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
as exciting guy well I've never used the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.800 
as exciting guy well I've never used the
other<00:02:42.670> one<00:02:42.910> that's<00:02:43.030> not<00:02:43.180> water<00:02:43.330> proof<00:02:43.480> but

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
other one that's not water proof but

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.160 
other one that's not water proof but
just<00:02:44.770> normal<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.280> mean<00:02:45.490> it's<00:02:46.390> not<00:02:46.600> comfy<00:02:46.990> at<00:02:47.080> all

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
just normal I mean it's not comfy at all

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.810

yeah<00:04:15.940> non<00:04:16.660> acne<00:04:17.380> genic<00:04:17.890> I've<00:04:18.489> never<00:04:18.910> even

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
yeah non acne genic I've never even

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.789 
yeah non acne genic I've never even
heard<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.510> word<00:04:19.630> before<00:04:19.660> but<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.109> guess<00:04:20.650> I

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
heard that word before but I guess I

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:21.890 
heard that word before but I guess I
mean<00:04:20.979> doesn't<00:04:21.250> cause<00:04:21.489> act

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
mean doesn't cause act

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.780 
mean doesn't cause act
I'm<00:04:22.410> guessing<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.400> yeah<00:04:23.669> this<00:04:24.270> is<00:04:25.639> just<00:04:26.639> one<00:04:26.759> of

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
I'm guessing so yeah this is just one of

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.700 
I'm guessing so yeah this is just one of
them<00:04:26.970> I<00:04:27.120> really<00:04:27.330> like<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:27.750> packaging<00:04:28.199> of<00:04:28.530> it

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
them I really like the packaging of it

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.170 
them I really like the packaging of it
because<00:04:28.949> it's<00:04:29.130> just<00:04:29.220> grew<00:04:29.610> off<00:04:29.699> even<00:04:30.060> though

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
because it's just grew off even though

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.249 
because it's just grew off even though
it's<00:04:30.300> really<00:04:30.690> small<00:04:31.940> but<00:04:32.940> it's<00:04:33.539> like<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:33.960> and

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
it's really small but it's like this and

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.080 
it's really small but it's like this and
then<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.590> just<00:04:34.770> comes<00:04:35.009> out<00:04:35.130> like<00:04:35.310> that<00:04:35.580> and

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
then it just comes out like that and

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.090 
then it just comes out like that and
just<00:04:36.210> going<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.229> do<00:04:37.289> a<00:04:37.320> little<00:04:37.380> bit<00:04:37.770> I<00:04:37.800> don't

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
just going to do a little bit I don't

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.510 
just going to do a little bit I don't
waste<00:04:38.340> any<00:04:38.550> of<00:04:38.639> it<00:04:38.759> and<00:04:39.000> then<00:04:39.750> there<00:04:40.650> it<00:04:40.860> is<00:04:41.009> and

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
waste any of it and then there it is and

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.870 
waste any of it and then there it is and
so<00:04:42.380> that's<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.590> color<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.190> it<00:04:44.370> goes<00:04:44.550> really

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
so that's the color and it goes really

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.810 
so that's the color and it goes really
well<00:04:45.180> on<00:04:45.479> my<00:04:45.660> skin<00:04:46.080> very<00:04:46.620> matte<00:04:47.070> like<00:04:47.460> it<00:04:47.610> says

it is and that's what I rubbed in it's
nice<00:04:52.530> you<00:04:53.220> probably<00:04:53.430> can't<00:04:53.669> even<00:04:53.699> tell<00:04:54.000> but<00:04:54.870> it

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960
