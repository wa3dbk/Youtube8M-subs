00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.299
 hello good everyone I want to share 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.250
 this always with android and good does 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:10.210
 I told you how to install the recovery 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.910
 in a custom recovery the tw rp and good 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.260
 missing big hands like me to me in a day 1 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.110
 of May I got exactly the 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.910
 Android update via ota and good 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.710
 I'm a big hand 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.320
 As I am an apple tree, I came up with another 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.490
 great idea to fool around giving him that if 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.180
 knowing that he did not have to do what 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.210
 I had a taste in recovery 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.680
 I gave him install I gave him thinking that I 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.230
 I would say that I could not because I had the 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.060
 Rooted phone told me yes now what 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.500
 we do now I do it and what happened was 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.810
 that all the time entering mode 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.600
 recovery as you see I have been left 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:47.649
 half shined to see rebut 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.480
 exist I should now restart in 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.920
 normal mode but what happens is that it says 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.320
 so torrado in the recovery I can not 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.630
 access download mode 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.829
 and is thus trying to dump a 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.290
 security layer that I had made with 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.470
 this recovery has not worked either 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.510
 Whites fact if not worked 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.330
 it happens to you I recommend you if 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.680
 You have a cable USB On-The-Go for it 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.680
 far usb or tg 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.170
 what is this as you see that it has for this 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.760
 normal usb female connector side and 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.750
 for this other the micro is the micro usb 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.930
 and a pendrive 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:32.540
 we take a click here the cable 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.540
 and the female connector the pendrive 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.120
 I advise you for safety though it is 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.580
 possible that we do not lose the data of what 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.160
 which it is the memory card or 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.290
 internal storage I advise you 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.140
 that you go to mount monteys the usb 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.620
 on-the-go the usb or tg 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.390
 we go back and in advanced 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.750
 file manager we can access 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.310
 this sdk and here we can access everything 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:06.640
 what we had what are the photos in 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.990
 of cdc fm ccm in camera for example 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.810
 we want all the photos from the camera and 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.560
 we are going to copy him and 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.680
 we would say that we want it in usb or tg and 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.409
 in the folder that you want 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.000
 now what to do is install a 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.549
 file that exposes the description 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.950
 suppose that fixes this failure I'm going to 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.410
 try with you will give install me 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.630
 I'm going 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.630
 to the usb host 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.750
 it's so internal storage we give it 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.720
 We mark observing because I left it 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.020
 I have the terror of recovering brick 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.610
 update I give it and if it tells you right what 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.610
 is going to flash we are going to give 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.260
 so it's a file that weighs nothing 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.180
 so it should take a little 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.220
 in principle doing this now should 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.230
 reboot be normal I'll give it and 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.849
 let's cross our fingers this tells us 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.910
 that is that is not rooted tell you 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.460
 you have to install the router 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.250
 and so with luck now it starts normal and 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.160
 a part that we have saved 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.440
 This file is taken from the cc forum 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.490
 mania as you see the LEDs turn on and 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.920
 it seems that they are starting 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.170
 normal 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.000
 If I had read the forum before, I would have 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.520
 saved a lot of simple steps and 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.830
 I made them how to make the cool delete 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.200
 data and delete stories 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.640
 I will copy this file in the 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.400
 internal storage then server me 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.380
 will happen I do not know if you have the recovery 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.560
 modified you have leather stock the 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.520
 original do not ever update via 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.630
 let's say from the phone update 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.020
 this jumps on the phone there is a 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.630
 new version 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.950
 as it is already starting it seems 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.950
 doing to put the leds since 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.110
 before indicated directly to the recovery and 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.510
 as I made a white indeed about 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.820
 some parts and I have loaded everything but 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.650
 of internal storage is but 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.240
 it cost so much to boot but for now 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.650
 I would already be in recovery mode before 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.110
 it is supposed that there is already fixed this 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.540
 semibrick 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.220
 or restarting the time in the recovery mode 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.950
 is to happen to be done all the time 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.260
 not in the recovery but a jump the axis 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.609
 it restarts it has never just started 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.430
 you can also do this would be 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.979
 leave on cotton to let squeeze 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.120
 the power button until you see that 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.289
 the black screen is set as it has been 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.930
 restarted then press the button 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.340
 volume down when they leave then leave 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.439
 Skip and re-tighten the 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.660
 on and you will enter the recovery of 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:35.360
 forever 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.160
 you give him twice you will enter the 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.230
 recovery, what have you done? 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.480
 modified as I have done 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.889
 you will put the pendrive with the file that 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.930
 that it exists in the description 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.099
 and as I have done for it installs and it 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.099
 will fix what is the start
