00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.509
 before we talk more about the law of israel 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.459
 which is basically formed by some 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.500
 math problems what do i want 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:12.040
 do is get an intuitive understanding 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.200
 about why this straw remains 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.519
 folded in this figure here to achieve 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.710
 I'll draw a version 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.560
 simplified of this figure so let's just 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.470
 draw and this is the cup right here we go 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.750
 draw the side profile of the cup then 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.710
 this is the lateral profile of this well 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.660
 on here 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.359
 well this is the best you got 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.430
 draw then I'll draw the straw so 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.460
 I'll first draw the straw where 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.860
 he really is so he comes out of the 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.440
 side of the glass and the straw in the truth 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.809
 is not doubling it goes to the bottom of the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.260
 cup exactly like this 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.480
 there under that way there is only one 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.820
 a little above him, hence the straw and 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.300
 effectively folds up here well 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.579
 on here 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.320
 so it really doubles but that's 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.390
 irrelevant to what we want 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.059
 find out what I want to do in this 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.340
 video is talking because when we look here 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.370
 because it looks like the straw is bent 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.620
 and all this arises from the refraction of light already 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.140
 that the light from the straw down here changes 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.210
 as it passes from one medium to another and 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.730
 we knew from the indexes of 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.010
 refraction or only in general that the light 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.980
 spreads more slowly in the water than in the 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.480
 air in the water and 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.610
 faster in the air 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.470
 So let's think about what's going on. 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.440
 Let's think about what really 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.200
 I'll draw two points. 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.960
 to draw two rays that are 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.510
 coming from that point in the straw right here 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.690
 so if I draw a lightning bolt 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.580
 Right here, I'm going to choose a direction. 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.190
 arbitrary then if I choose a radius 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.530
 like this when it goes from a more 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.150
 slow to the middle faster what 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.550
 will happen to him 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.820
 so this small angle here the side 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.770
 left of the thunderbolt will arrive in the air before 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.250
 on the right I'm just using 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.770
 this as as a way'm using 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.740
 example of the car to some extent 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.259
 think about how the light will bend 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.160
 so if you visualize or in the form of 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.930
 a car 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.420
 just to have a metaphor for what is 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.080
 happening here the left side goes 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.330
 leave 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.190
 before the right side and will start to 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.200
 move faster 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.180
 then this will turn to the right and 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.760
 now I'm going to draw another ray 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.400
 so I'll make another ray come from 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.310
 same point I want him to go through the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.830
 extension of the straw then another ray 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.870
 exactly so it will turn to the 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.030
 right will also turn right now 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.150
 if someone's eye if the eye of a 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.840
 person is right there so that the eye of 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.420
 someone 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.970
 those are your eyelashes that 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.520
 person's nose and all the rest if you 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.650
 they are looking down from where 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.660
 it seems that the rays of light 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.120
 let's say the person's eyes are 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.060
 large enough to capture both 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.580
 rays from where it seems that these two 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.870
 rays are coming up so if you 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.300
 are to identify 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.090
 both rays in the beginning you 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.520
 presume that there is a line that this is 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.430
 what our eyes and brains do 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.410
 if you consider that any direction 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.320
 that this ray is really following 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.870
 direction from which it came and if you 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.450
 consider the same for this pink ray and 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.820
 that pink ray right here would go 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.220
 appear what the observer who 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.769
 this point of the straw is actually 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.980
 right there and if you continue to do the 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.170
 even for a lot of points in the straw 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.870
 would realize that this point in the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.300
 true, it's okay here we can do this 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.910
 to that point in the straw and it was going to look like 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.519
 that this point in a straw is right here 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.019
 then for this observer the straw 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.019
 would look like this 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.730
 looked like one looked like 11 something like this 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.790
 seemed doubled 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.850
 this part even though the light here 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.070
 is going up then up 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.470
 then out because it is folded to the 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.420
 to converge back it would converge 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.090
 same as what we saw in that 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.280
 first point in the light of that point when 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.170
 goes out is folded 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.510
 if you were out then 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.950
 extrapolated to light from their 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.620
 new directions 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.549
 You arrive at that point then for that 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.830
 observer 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.700
 this point of the straw will appear to be 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.830
 right here 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.900
 even if the light has been emitted well 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.540
 here and that's why the straw actually 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.520
 looks bent really looks folded 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.860
 so it's all because of refraction 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.870
 which goes from a slower means to the 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.880
 way faster then I hope you guys 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.620
 have encountered this issue until 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.570
 interesting and in the next video we'll 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.060
 treat a little more of the law of israel 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.510
 just to be more comfortable 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.510
 with math
