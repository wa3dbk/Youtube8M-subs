 Attach this to the front of my bicycle 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:42.700
 Though protection is divided, it becomes front bag of bicycle

 8 Rutteyuu tied that this of the tie in a standard Tris-based method hey belt is is 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.850

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.269
 Well, though the installation itself doesn't matter at all 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:59.480
 When I left the bike for a while and left

 I'd like to take it off so it won't be stolen 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.270

 There are good things to deal with such 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.520

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.150
 A land battle curl is out 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:38.530
 By using such adapters 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:42.250
 So that can be removed is Toka bag with one touch

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:51.070
 It's an adapter and it's a plate here 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.340
 If you stick this to a rabbit and rub it 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.969
 8 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.490
 If you can put on and take off the high bag simply by pressing the button 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:04.930
 It is something like 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:08.789
 Well then a little bit this Ricksen cowl face 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.469
 I think that I want to go first 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.469
 Click Fix 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:24.790
 It is a plate for an adapter I think that I would like to attach this to a bag 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.810
 It is two plates that say this is what came out Yes Well 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.620
 This is the outside 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.430
 Wonder if the light-induced 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.730
 this 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.220
 This way to the back of the bag 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.260
 It is attached 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.180
 It this it is here you are on the inside of the 8 cover and pushing the set screw 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.090
 In this plane 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.880
 The previous adapter is high 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.880
 It will be something that is gobbled 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.760
 Let's open the adapter a little further 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.150
 Hey 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:07.780
 8 I 'm cutter size is this 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:11.510
 The older brother of the handle of the bicycle is oversized 31.8mm 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.799
 We bought size corresponding to 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.799
 Well there 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:23.620
 The better the thickness of that their handles are thinking of buying the future because how much a what 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.660
 I think it would be better to investigate 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.610
 Say this 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.610
 There's a guy on the handle 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:38.550
 This is a click school 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:42.390
 Handle people or chat Kedomo I put here 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.660
 This plate is the bag is in with the 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.660
 8 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:57.000
 Yeah pretty sturdy 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:58.250
 Variety and Well to some extent of it that vibration is not that at all come off even if there is vibration Te bicycle departure 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.840
 Everyone 's 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.069
 It is written in the report 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.989
 Buckwheat and Pochitsu the heart button when removing 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.670
 When it comes off easily 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.720
 I mean 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.860
 Then I think that I want to put a plate on my bag 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:21.880
 8 in this 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.630
 I'm screwed, but do not to be a hole at the front surface and a back surface of 8 bag 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.280
 is not it 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:31.120
 In order to pass the positive screw, let 's just say that most people go through a thousand houses or something 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.849
 But also to go to muzzles Fishing I like a is through open force full 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.520
 The fallen tree is for that electric bird and electric drill 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:40.150
 I would like a joke would in 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.070
 Maa's 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.070
 Hey, do let's just on first glance 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.990
 I wonder what it was 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:05:02.539
 These were in the form shift goods hat in the bag cormorant It is the ticker 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.539
 There is a plastic board of this shape prevention 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.350
 I thought it would be easier to open at once with a drill or something 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.300
 You do not might want to widen the hole in the Toka these mother rust 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.910
 The plastic inside of this insole is quite fine 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:48.449
 After drilling a hole in the forest, open a small hole like this with scissors 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:54.259
 Go 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:54.259
 I think that good tightening 3 o'clock use a hex wrench 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.620
 The first installation was done 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:11.900
 It looks like a genuine product 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.900
 I can not say it ten times 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:22.840
 It was possible 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.840
 Next I would like to attach this adapter to my bicycle 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:48.149
 It is a good likely about upward angle of 30 degrees 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.149
 If it is in the manual 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.620
 I wonder 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.620
 Let's screw it on 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:09.470
 Right 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:12.370
 In Well 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.370

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:17.939
 9 from above 

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:17.939
 While pressing the button 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.610
 When installation is complete 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.610
 It is good relationship 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:39.680
 What is it in the front bag ? 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:43.020

 9 things that did not enter the saddle bag 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:00.299
 Sweat towel or something 

00:07:56.969 --> 00:08:06.820
