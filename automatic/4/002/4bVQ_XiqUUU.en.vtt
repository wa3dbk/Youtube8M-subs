00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:12.090
 Today we also show Bendern 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:16.260
 bracelets have already the buttons and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.410
 my sidewalls once the color green 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.369
 and black 1 I already have so far 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.369
 ready 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.390
 and what do you make beautiful buttons 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:45.469
 Big little what she has so much 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.469
 He would soon have his first on the joint 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:56.329
 with a loop around 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.329
 could bind 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:08.520
 Of course you do that when you have a lot 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.760
 had luck 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:18.810
 There are also almost 2 holes here 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:25.020
 that there is something more difficult for this with 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:28.920
 foursome something pointed tries that 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.880
 lace from the silk ribbon through the buttonhole 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.880
 for embossing 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.770
 and the other piece opposite 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.310
 pierce and pull through 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.050
 I have a page for you 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.800
 and the other side 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.980
 and through 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.500
 pulled the ribbons 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.820
 one still the same 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.300
 so you can be the next scarce 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.130
 turn distracted 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.250
 because a beautiful band with a button 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:05.760
 This could be with different wrist 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:10.310
 make side bands and several new ones 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.310
 turn it on
