00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
racing at your local track I always

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.850 
racing at your local track I always
recommend<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:43.020> one-piece<00:00:43.350> suit<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.710> think

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
recommend a one-piece suit but I think

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.170 
recommend a one-piece suit but I think
it's<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.160> light<00:00:44.309> weight<00:00:44.489> for<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.820> so

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
it's a little light weight for that so

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.279 
it's a little light weight for that so
looking<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.750> you're<00:00:45.809> looking<00:00:46.020> at<00:00:46.110> just
