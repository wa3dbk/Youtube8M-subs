00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
take the putty and I use it as sticky

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.860

and look at that

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.050 
and look at that
stuck<00:02:32.080> right<00:02:32.290> back<00:02:32.500> in<00:02:32.709> there<00:02:32.890> don't<00:02:33.730> do<00:02:33.850> that

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
think because this is so textured all

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.360 
think because this is so textured all
the<00:02:42.400> ridges<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:42.940> indentations<00:02:44.070> are<00:02:45.070> all

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
the ridges and indentations are all

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.780 
the ridges and indentations are all
walking<00:02:45.760> into<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.300> putty

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
it's not smooth that's why this is

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:01.229 
it's not smooth that's why this is
happening<00:02:59.700> usually<00:03:00.700> doesn't<00:03:00.850> take<00:03:00.940> me<00:03:01.150> this

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
happening usually doesn't take me this

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.370

little<00:03:27.760> piece<00:03:28.000> here<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.390> there<00:03:30.780> it's<00:03:31.780> getting

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
little piece here and there it's getting

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.370 
little piece here and there it's getting
cloudy<00:03:32.470> now<00:03:32.829> me<00:03:33.760> touching<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.269> already<00:03:34.540> look

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
cloudy now me touching it already look

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.220 
cloudy now me touching it already look
at<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:36.630> blue<00:03:39.510> now<00:03:40.510> you're<00:03:40.690> seeing<00:03:40.959> through

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
at that blue now you're seeing through

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:50.150 
at that blue now you're seeing through
the<00:03:41.470> putty

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.890 

and<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.370> think<00:03:51.730> I'm<00:03:51.880> not<00:03:52.000> seeing<00:03:52.300> too<00:03:52.480> much<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.690> a

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
and I think I'm not seeing too much of a

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.410 
and I think I'm not seeing too much of a
bounce<00:03:53.170> here<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.930> does<00:03:58.200> but<00:03:59.200> if<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.410> little

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
bounce here it does but if a little

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.530 
bounce here it does but if a little
softer<00:04:01.420> than<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:01.630> thought<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.080> would<00:04:02.200> be<00:04:03.450> let<00:04:04.450> me

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
softer than I thought it would be let me

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:16.729 
softer than I thought it would be let me
stretch<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.960> again<00:04:05.050> here<00:04:05.490> stretch<00:04:06.490> it

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.939 

let<00:04:17.400> me<00:04:17.489> zoom<00:04:17.519> right<00:04:18.000> in<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.590> don't<00:04:19.650> have<00:04:19.829> to

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
let me zoom right in so I don't have to

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.270 
let me zoom right in so I don't have to
hold<00:04:20.100> it<00:04:20.220> in<00:04:20.340> my<00:04:20.430> hand<00:04:20.699> and<00:04:20.819> you<00:04:20.940> sorry<00:04:22.280> there

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.260 

it<00:04:32.370> has<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.580> certain<00:04:32.879> stickiness<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:35.240> like<00:04:36.240> I

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
it has a certain stickiness to it like I

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:54.250 
it has a certain stickiness to it like I
said<00:04:36.509> I<00:04:36.569> wasn't<00:04:36.720> expecting<00:04:37.440> that

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.350 

like<00:04:55.260> I<00:04:55.350> said<00:04:55.410> this<00:04:55.650> is<00:04:55.860> uh<00:04:55.890> I<00:04:56.490> believe<00:04:56.940> it<00:04:57.300> was

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
like I said this is uh I believe it was

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.950 
like I said this is uh I believe it was
target<00:04:57.870> I'm<00:04:58.430> 89%<00:04:59.430> sure<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.060> was<00:05:00.180> target<00:05:00.690> and

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
target I'm 89% sure it was target and

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.810

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
stand up wall area where there's just

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.360 
stand up wall area where there's just
bins<00:05:07.920> of<00:05:08.220> smaller<00:05:08.810> more<00:05:09.810> novelty<00:05:10.470> type<00:05:11.040> stuff

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
like this I know this was hanging from a

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.110 
like this I know this was hanging from a
peg<00:05:13.500> there's<00:05:13.770> only<00:05:13.860> two<00:05:14.100> left<00:05:14.130> this<00:05:14.610> one<00:05:14.880> in<00:05:15.090> a

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
peg there's only two left this one in a

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.790 
peg there's only two left this one in a
My<00:05:15.420> Little<00:05:15.450> Pony<00:05:15.750> one<00:05:16.170> so<00:05:16.380> we<00:05:16.500> grab<00:05:16.680> them<00:05:16.830> all

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.650 

it's<00:05:22.800> like<00:05:23.040> the<00:05:23.220> smaller<00:05:23.730> toy<00:05:24.060> section<00:05:24.360> if<00:05:24.570> you

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
it's like the smaller toy section if you

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.560 
it's like the smaller toy section if you
just<00:05:24.810> want<00:05:24.990> to<00:05:25.050> give<00:05:25.200> someone<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:25.530> small<00:05:26.570> less

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
just want to give someone a small less

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.480 
just want to give someone a small less
expensive<00:05:28.230> item<00:05:28.530> that's<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:29.040> section<00:05:29.430> you

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
expensive item that's the section you

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:44.860 
expensive item that's the section you
going

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:58.900 

that's<00:05:45.470> cool<00:05:45.710> to<00:05:45.830> look<00:05:45.949> at

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.490 

it's<00:05:59.910> cool<00:06:00.150> with<00:06:00.240> my<00:06:00.420> hand<00:06:00.780> as<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:01.290> backdrop

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
it's cool with my hand as the backdrop

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.240 
it's cool with my hand as the backdrop
because<00:06:02.100> it<00:06:02.220> darkens<00:06:02.670> it<00:06:02.820> up<00:06:02.940> down<00:06:03.510> here<00:06:04.250> it'll

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
because it darkens it up down here it'll

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.740 
because it darkens it up down here it'll
probably<00:06:05.460> lighten<00:06:05.940> up<00:06:06.090> especially<00:06:06.570> when<00:06:06.720> I

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
probably lighten up especially when I

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:30.220 
probably lighten up especially when I
stretch<00:06:07.110> it<00:06:23.960> that's<00:06:24.960> just<00:06:25.050> giving<00:06:25.410> a<00:06:25.470> weird<00:06:25.710> so

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:36.950 

well<00:06:34.610> for<00:06:35.610> the<00:06:35.730> budget<00:06:36.210> I'll<00:06:36.360> I<00:06:36.630> would<00:06:36.780> say

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
well for the budget I'll I would say

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.610 
well for the budget I'll I would say
it's<00:06:37.080> nice<00:06:37.350> little<00:06:37.650> putty<00:06:37.860> I<00:06:39.350> would<00:06:40.350> probably

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
it's nice little putty I would probably

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.320 
it's nice little putty I would probably
have<00:06:40.740> to<00:06:40.860> move<00:06:41.040> this<00:06:41.190> to<00:06:41.400> a<00:06:41.430> little<00:06:41.700> bag<00:06:41.970> or<00:06:42.300> a

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
have to move this to a little bag or a

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.460 
have to move this to a little bag or a
different<00:06:42.630> container<00:06:42.870> because<00:06:43.200> there's<00:06:43.380> no

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
different container because there's no

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.560 
different container because there's no
way<00:06:43.590> you<00:06:43.650> can<00:06:43.890> save<00:06:44.220> it<00:06:44.400> in<00:06:44.490> this<00:06:44.670> easily

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
way you can save it in this easily

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.430 
way you can save it in this easily
without<00:06:45.840> a<00:06:46.610> sticking<00:06:48.020> and<00:06:49.020> like<00:06:49.140> when<00:06:49.260> I<00:06:49.290> let

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
without a sticking and like when I let

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.530 
without a sticking and like when I let
it<00:06:49.530> sit<00:06:49.710> in<00:06:49.740> my<00:06:49.920> hand<00:06:50.190> I<00:06:50.460> was<00:06:51.120> just<00:06:51.270> holding

that look
feels<00:06:53.700> like<00:06:53.880> it's<00:06:54.650> sticky<00:06:55.650> as<00:06:56.070> it<00:06:56.220> heats<00:06:56.400> up

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
feels like it's sticky as it heats up

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.710 
feels like it's sticky as it heats up
