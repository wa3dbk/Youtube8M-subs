 obviously here behind the cons of 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.560
 foxsports you know it is the house of 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.900
 the tuzos of the pachuca that are going to 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.370
 face the cougars and with don raúl 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.100
 Orvañanos and the entire football team 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.330
 Mexico we learned exactly that 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.330
 wait on day 5 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.750
 and it's worth seeing 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.750
 there are many thanks guys yesterday started the 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.519
 preseason of the nfl many we are 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.079
 very happy indeed today they play my 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.350
 riders high do well against 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.449
 rams I say do not go see it because the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.420
 I miss a lot but people that we saw yesterday 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.030
 a great great tackle in the match 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.330
 the patriots against green bay that by 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.009
 true won green bay who knows how 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.810
 are going to start the patriots with 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.110
 all this story 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.149
 yes but it comes that on the www page 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.880
 for it was pointed out how you can see this 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.820
 It's clear because it's time for the forum 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.060
 usual notice that the sale does not work if you can 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.060
 see there 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.979
 but have you ever fallen from such 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.840
 way you fall and you become gauged 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.340
 obviously you have to keep it 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.080
 always nothing happened to escape you get a 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.540
 complete marometa and was practically 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.850
 stand the poor little colon 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.530
 today is when he paid for the broken dishes 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.060
 because imagine that everything in the cash 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.550
 case with the team that they have 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.320
 obviously the referees of the nfl like 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.940
 are exposed to this they also have a 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.450
 contest they have force that is they are not 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.590
 skinny of my fight no no 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.000
 yes, but everyone has to have 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.260
 good condition because you saw in the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.450
 race that was throwing was going 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.240
 practically to the part of the corridor 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.890
 runner talking about on another occasion 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.770
 I'm also going to talk to a poor referee 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.170
 of box that touched him 22 times they knocked him out 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.820
 before the fight the poor thing is that usually 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.380
 move also to the double double and I guess 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.540
 that sailing around also suddenly happens 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.190
 that a track is given and they hit the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.540
 I'm a good referee, that's why you have to 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.860
 keep that distance but I'm going to 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.840
 take advantage of what you mentioned about the actor 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.120
