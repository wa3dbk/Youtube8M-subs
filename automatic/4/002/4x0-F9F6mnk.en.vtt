00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 cinnamon the television more environment than 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.220
 never then these constant errors 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.960
 Much was said, Mr. Beranza , 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.880
 He wanted to bring more people to the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.400
 football stadiums that are intended to put 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.560
 of seats that are intended therefore many 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.779
 things to improve the show but 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.119
 as long as an essential issue does not improve 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.949
 arbitration and entertainment within the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.590
 pitch there will be no way to 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.500
 call more people in the stadiums and 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.150
 it is really painful the way in which 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.130
 the arbitration is being directed 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.989
 Mexican there I took rafael blemish 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.690
 that never statements that is 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.809
 hidden that stick your head in one in 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.070
 a hole like an ostrich and well in 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.710
 the times of Aaron Padilla the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.030
 Mexican arbitration was wrong but for 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.559
 it has not improved backwards I think it's going 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.329
 backwards doing at least Aaron 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.579
 padilla faced off defending 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.860
 indefensible but it is but I knew out there 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.940
 I think that this is a big problem and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.260
 I will not tire of saying it and we have 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.180
 talked many times Pablo the problem 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.949
 is that you think in Mexico who are 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.719
 involved in the arbitration that is 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.370
 has the best arbitration in the world and not 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.329
 there is logic if we do not have the best football 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.220
 of the world we do not have the best 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.810
 sports organization of the world that we 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.700
 It makes us think that we are special for 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.409
 in the arbitration issue without being very 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.329
 good because they have had referees 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.250
 pitan the finals of world matches 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.360
 important that is to live from the past and 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.710
 Today, the reality is that the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.170
 supposed best referees of mexico 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.210
 chacón at roberto garcía orozco scored 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.399
 Rodriguez earn lower than the new 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.049
 they do not work we had warned care 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.000
 with Mr. Peñalosa and I think that the most 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.409
 sad is that the pebble arbitration in 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.479
 how about the weekend macros 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.450
 they are far from the worst what happened 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.130
 with the angels in Monterrey with 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.509
 Mr. Ortega what happened in the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.579
 Blue Cross match with two failures 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.929
 terrible what happens in toluca what 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.770
 happened also in the saints against 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.390
 querétaro 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.799
 if we are adding good and you 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.149
 forgot the lion against pachuca in the 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.100
 who also stabbed in once again to 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.789
 lion but while they still think that 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.590
 everything is fine 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.909
 well, little by little, people 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.189
 mission effectively to stop 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.549
 some way I do not know week flooded 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.619
 is that this is the point they are stupid or 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.990
 they are malicious because they are 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.700
 fools and bad is one thing and the other is 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.220
 that there is a bad intention that they have 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.470
 directed the arbitrations to harm 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.330
 some equipment and this is so big 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.920
 errors that for now because 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.790
 There is now speculation in all 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.610
 the media 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.340
 the subject and lend many claim that 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.129
 there is address and that you activate it 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.569
 stabbed though obviously as 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.849
 they gave things in the game 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.590
 apparently then sooner or later in 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.329
 america would win not because of the injuries that 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.590
 they had things got complicated but 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.030
 what is true Paul is that 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.030
 example talking about america now you 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.530
 touched on the side of the coin the side that 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.450
 it favored him as far as the decision 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.980
 controversy a couple of weeks ago against 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.750
 san luis al america was stabbed 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.370
 also Roberto García Oro with one of 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.049
 the supposed best referees of mexico 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.459
 did not mark a clear penalty in the 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.139
 last minute with two reais of the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.549
 fences the size of the Aztec then 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.389
 that we are talking about that a week 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.489
 you are doing well 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.989
 another week goes wrong for you and this is not about 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.079
 let it be a roulette to see if you have 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.879
 fortune every 15 days should treat the 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.959
 arbitration commission to improve a lot 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.939
 things to do much more 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.220
 professionals to whistle god a lot 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.409
 some who speculated that the lord 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.810
 rafael mancilla who now directs the 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.629
 Mexican arbitration had been before 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.970
 director of the america as well as padilla 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.280
 in his time as director of smoking and 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.470
 There are those who say that Mancilla supports the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.000
 america web we have no proofs nor 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.070
 being sure of them but 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.110
 nothing has to be done by an ex-director 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.150
 be of pumas and america de chivas de 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.490
 who is the head of the commission 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.730
 arbitration put there some ex 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.620
 referee or serious people that there is 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.660
 they know about the subject they know how is the 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.420
 matter and that they do not put anybody 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.610
 be a relative or acquaintance friend in that 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.080
 car is unfortunate that it directs 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.820
 someone who has no idea of 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.300
 arbitration and that also as we have 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.390
