are<00:00:18.990> one<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> puppets<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.369> they<00:00:20.490> use<00:00:20.699> in

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
are one of the puppets that they use in

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.679

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the Vietnamese water puppet artform and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.990 
the Vietnamese water puppet artform and
I<00:00:24.810> think<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.830> neat<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.849> was

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
I think it's it's so neat it was

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.550 
I think it's it's so neat it was
actually<00:00:27.330> started<00:00:27.539> over<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> thousand<00:00:28.470> years

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
actually started over a thousand years

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.550 
actually started over a thousand years
ago<00:00:28.800> by<00:00:29.330> farmers<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:31.080> they<00:00:31.260> basically

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
ago by farmers but they basically

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.590 
ago by farmers but they basically
there's<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.920> pole<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.189> comes<00:00:32.640> from<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> back

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
there's a pole that comes from the back

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.170 
there's a pole that comes from the back
that's<00:00:33.930> attached<00:00:34.370> this<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:36.000> sale

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that's attached this is one for sale

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.280 
that's attached this is one for sale
obviously<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.660> they<00:00:36.750> don't<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> pole

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
obviously so they don't have the pole

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.799 
obviously so they don't have the pole
but<00:00:37.500> then<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.489> whole<00:00:38.790> manoeuvring<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.570> done

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
but then the whole manoeuvring is done

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.030 
but then the whole manoeuvring is done
by<00:00:40.129> farmers<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.910> by<00:00:42.239> performers<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.920> in

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
by farmers or by performers in what in

00:00:44.040 --> 00:01:06.430 
by farmers or by performers in what in
water<00:00:44.309> basically<00:00:45.260> behind<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> screen

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.560
