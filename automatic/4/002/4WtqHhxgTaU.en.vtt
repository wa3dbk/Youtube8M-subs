inside<00:03:33.959> this<00:03:34.959> is<00:03:35.200> in<00:03:35.319> the<00:03:35.410> color<00:03:35.560> in<00:03:36.120> d-ind<00:03:37.120> IE

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
inside this is in the color in d-ind IE

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.680 
inside this is in the color in d-ind IE
and<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.739> says<00:03:39.010> it<00:03:39.190> has<00:03:39.400> for<00:03:39.880> eyeshadows<00:03:40.660> and

and it says it has for eyeshadows and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.080 
and it says it has for eyeshadows and
one<00:03:41.170> powder<00:03:41.590> liner<00:03:42.630> so<00:03:43.859> these<00:03:44.859> are<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.639> five

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
one powder liner so these are the five

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.140 
one powder liner so these are the five
colors<00:03:46.600> i<00:03:47.250> guess<00:03:48.250> they're<00:03:48.519> referring<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:49.030> that

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
colors i guess they're referring to that

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.879 
colors i guess they're referring to that
dark<00:03:49.389> purple<00:03:49.780> color<00:03:49.959> as<00:03:50.139> a<00:03:50.170> liner<00:03:50.470> but<00:03:50.709> it's

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
dark purple color as a liner but it's

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.530 
dark purple color as a liner but it's
shimmery<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:51.579> i'm<00:03:51.639> not<00:03:51.819> sure<00:03:52.090> if<00:03:52.209> that's<00:03:52.329> the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
shimmery so i'm not sure if that's the

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.379 
shimmery so i'm not sure if that's the
case<00:03:52.750> but<00:03:53.069> nonetheless<00:03:54.069> i'm<00:03:54.760> going<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:55.120> swatch

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
case but nonetheless i'm going to swatch

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.770 
case but nonetheless i'm going to swatch
them<00:03:55.420> off<00:03:55.750> for<00:03:56.049> you<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:57.280> this<00:03:57.489> is<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.910> center

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
them off for you so this is the center

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.520 
them off for you so this is the center
shade<00:03:59.350> which<00:03:59.650> is<00:03:59.799> a<00:03:59.829> very<00:04:00.190> nice<00:04:00.840> lid<00:04:01.840> shade<00:04:02.200> it

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
shade which is a very nice lid shade it

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.319 
shade which is a very nice lid shade it
could<00:04:02.709> even<00:04:02.829> be<00:04:02.950> a<00:04:03.040> highlight<00:04:03.489> I<00:04:03.760> would<00:04:04.150> say

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
could even be a highlight I would say

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.050 
could even be a highlight I would say
it's<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.600> satin<00:04:05.049> finish<00:04:05.079> and<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:06.489> is<00:04:06.639> pretty

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
it's a satin finish and it is pretty

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.000 
it's a satin finish and it is pretty
close<00:04:07.389> to<00:04:07.450> my<00:04:07.720> skin<00:04:07.750> tone<00:04:08.109> just<00:04:08.350> a<00:04:08.500> little<00:04:08.859> bit

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
close to my skin tone just a little bit

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.789 
close to my skin tone just a little bit
lighter<00:04:09.220> so<00:04:09.760> that's<00:04:09.910> why<00:04:10.090> it's<00:04:10.120> very<00:04:10.739> hard<00:04:11.739> to

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
lighter so that's why it's very hard to

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.910 
lighter so that's why it's very hard to
see<00:04:12.100> ok<00:04:13.090> so<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.870> next<00:04:13.900> lightest<00:04:14.530> shade<00:04:14.560> is

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
see ok so the next lightest shade is

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.300 
see ok so the next lightest shade is
this<00:04:15.069> bronzy<00:04:15.609> color<00:04:15.819> and<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:17.590> would<00:04:17.859> say<00:04:18.070> that

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
this bronzy color and I would say that

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.240 
this bronzy color and I would say that
this<00:04:19.120> color<00:04:19.419> would<00:04:19.750> be<00:04:19.810> good<00:04:20.140> as<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:20.590> transition

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
this color would be good as a transition

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
this color would be good as a transition
color<00:04:21.459> but

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
color but

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.330 
color but
it<00:04:22.330> does<00:04:22.599> have<00:04:22.870> some<00:04:23.289> shimmer<00:04:23.680> it's<00:04:23.979> not<00:04:24.129> the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
it does have some shimmer it's not the

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.040 
it does have some shimmer it's not the
shimmery<00:04:24.699> eyeshadow<00:04:25.150> I've<00:04:25.330> ever<00:04:25.509> seen<00:04:25.750> but<00:04:25.960> it

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
shimmery eyeshadow I've ever seen but it

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.920 
shimmery eyeshadow I've ever seen but it
does<00:04:26.199> have<00:04:26.379> some<00:04:26.590> shimmer<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.639> I<00:04:28.180> would<00:04:28.479> really

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
does have some shimmer so I would really

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.330 
does have some shimmer so I would really
have<00:04:29.050> liked<00:04:29.289> to<00:04:29.440> have<00:04:29.470> seen<00:04:29.710> like<00:04:29.919> a<00:04:29.949> matte

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
have liked to have seen like a matte

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.550 
have liked to have seen like a matte
brow<00:04:30.610> bone<00:04:30.849> color<00:04:31.090> matte<00:04:31.870> transition<00:04:32.379> color

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
brow bone color matte transition color

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.649 
brow bone color matte transition color
but<00:04:32.800> that's<00:04:33.009> what<00:04:33.280> you<00:04:33.310> get<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.819> then<00:04:34.509> the

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:34.659 
but that's what you get and then the

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.339 
but that's what you get and then the
next<00:04:34.870> darker<00:04:35.440> color<00:04:35.680> this<00:04:36.250> is<00:04:36.310> like<00:04:36.759> a<00:04:36.789> ma<00:04:37.210> vie

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
next darker color this is like a ma vie

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.330 
next darker color this is like a ma vie
purpley<00:04:38.349> color<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:41.080> think<00:04:41.740> that<00:04:41.949> one<00:04:42.159> thing

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
purpley color and I think that one thing

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.339 
purpley color and I think that one thing
they<00:04:42.490> did<00:04:42.729> right<00:04:43.000> with<00:04:43.270> this<00:04:43.389> palette<00:04:43.900> was

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
they did right with this palette was

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.980 
they did right with this palette was
they<00:04:45.099> definitely<00:04:45.610> gave<00:04:46.030> you<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.240> good<00:04:46.569> mix<00:04:46.840> of

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
they definitely gave you a good mix of

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.200 
they definitely gave you a good mix of
warm<00:04:47.289> and<00:04:47.470> cool<00:04:47.620> tones<00:04:47.919> and<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.699> way<00:04:48.819> I<00:04:48.849> say

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
warm and cool tones and the way I say

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.390 
warm and cool tones and the way I say
that<00:04:49.419> is<00:04:49.569> that<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.409> first<00:04:50.650> two<00:04:50.830> colors<00:04:51.159> could

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
that is that the first two colors could

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.790 
that is that the first two colors could
definitely<00:04:51.639> pass<00:04:51.909> is<00:04:52.150> warm<00:04:52.539> and<00:04:52.810> then<00:04:53.650> this

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
definitely pass is warm and then this

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.860 
definitely pass is warm and then this
color<00:04:54.099> I<00:04:54.190> just<00:04:54.550> swatch<00:04:54.819> is<00:04:55.210> more<00:04:55.479> of<00:04:55.539> a<00:04:55.630> cool

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
color I just swatch is more of a cool

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.580 
color I just swatch is more of a cool
tone<00:04:56.080> but<00:04:57.009> they<00:04:57.159> are<00:04:57.250> all<00:04:57.490> shimmery<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.590> then

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
tone but they are all shimmery and then

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.140 
tone but they are all shimmery and then
the<00:04:59.740> fourth<00:05:00.009> color<00:05:00.310> I'm<00:05:00.490> going<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.669> swatch<00:05:00.909> for

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
the fourth color I'm going to swatch for

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.439 
the fourth color I'm going to swatch for
you<00:05:01.270> this<00:05:01.990> is<00:05:02.319> a<00:05:02.740> matte<00:05:03.099> shade<00:05:03.520> I<00:05:03.729> believe<00:05:04.150> and

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
you this is a matte shade I believe and

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.600 
you this is a matte shade I believe and
it<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.840> just<00:05:04.990> a<00:05:05.169> nice<00:05:05.580> can't<00:05:06.580> go<00:05:06.789> wrong<00:05:07.080> brown

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
it is just a nice can't go wrong brown

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.760 
it is just a nice can't go wrong brown
but<00:05:09.610> they<00:05:10.180> did<00:05:10.389> go<00:05:10.630> wrong<00:05:10.659> because<00:05:11.319> i<00:05:11.470> have

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
but they did go wrong because i have

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.469 
but they did go wrong because i have
swatched<00:05:12.069> twice<00:05:12.460> and<00:05:12.819> that's<00:05:12.940> what<00:05:13.120> I<00:05:13.150> can<00:05:13.360> get

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
swatched twice and that's what I can get

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.570 
swatched twice and that's what I can get
out<00:05:13.539> of<00:05:13.630> it<00:05:13.810> so<00:05:14.440> I'm<00:05:14.500> gonna<00:05:14.620> do<00:05:14.830> it<00:05:14.919> again<00:05:14.979> I'm

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
out of it so I'm gonna do it again I'm

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.230 
out of it so I'm gonna do it again I'm
gonna<00:05:15.729> swatch<00:05:15.969> again<00:05:17.789> okay<00:05:18.789> so<00:05:19.539> it<00:05:19.870> does<00:05:20.169> work

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
gonna swatch again okay so it does work

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.180 
gonna swatch again okay so it does work
I<00:05:22.240> think<00:05:22.569> it'll<00:05:22.719> work<00:05:22.810> fine<00:05:23.199> with<00:05:23.409> a<00:05:23.440> brush<00:05:23.740> but

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
I think it'll work fine with a brush but

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.709 
I think it'll work fine with a brush but
I've<00:05:24.460> had<00:05:24.699> a<00:05:24.729> really<00:05:24.879> hard<00:05:25.000> time<00:05:25.180> building<00:05:25.599> it

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:25.719 
I've had a really hard time building it

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:27.930 
I've had a really hard time building it
up<00:05:25.810> to<00:05:26.440> even<00:05:26.710> just<00:05:26.740> that<00:05:26.979> so<00:05:27.520> it<00:05:27.580> looks<00:05:27.639> very

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
up to even just that so it looks very

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.580 
up to even just that so it looks very
dark<00:05:28.210> in<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.419> pan<00:05:28.630> but<00:05:28.840> like<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:29.080> said<00:05:29.139> it's<00:05:29.440> not

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
dark in the pan but like I said it's not

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.309 
dark in the pan but like I said it's not
very<00:05:29.770> dark<00:05:30.039> and<00:05:30.219> the<00:05:30.880> last<00:05:31.120> color<00:05:31.449> is<00:05:31.719> that<00:05:31.750> I

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 
very dark and the last color is that I

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.649 
very dark and the last color is that I
believe<00:05:32.440> what<00:05:33.039> they<00:05:33.190> are<00:05:33.250> considering<00:05:33.849> the

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
believe what they are considering the

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:37.830 
believe what they are considering the
powder<00:05:35.590> liner<00:05:36.270> and<00:05:37.270> I'm<00:05:37.479> just<00:05:37.599> going<00:05:37.750> to<00:05:37.779> put
