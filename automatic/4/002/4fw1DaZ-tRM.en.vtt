00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
systems curve 500 I heard it two minutes

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.900 
systems curve 500 I heard it two minutes
ago<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.840> was<00:00:13.170> really<00:00:13.380> brilliant<00:00:13.980> amazing<00:00:14.519> for

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
ago and was really brilliant amazing for

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.710 
ago and was really brilliant amazing for
such<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> small<00:00:15.780> sized<00:00:16.139> PA<00:00:17.010> system<00:00:17.550> yeah<00:00:18.060> thanks

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
such a small sized PA system yeah thanks

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.840 
such a small sized PA system yeah thanks
yeah<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:18.990> think<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.380> says<00:00:19.590> great<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.699> has<00:00:20.820> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
yeah I think it says great it has a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.040 
yeah I think it says great it has a
great<00:00:21.029> sound<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.619> it's<00:00:22.619> quite<00:00:23.029> well<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.330> mean

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
great sound and it's quite well I mean

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.540 
great sound and it's quite well I mean
there<00:00:25.320> are<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> lot<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.560> column<00:00:25.890> systems<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
there are a lot of column systems in the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.730 
there are a lot of column systems in the
market<00:00:26.849> right<00:00:26.880> now<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.449> we're<00:00:28.260> not<00:00:28.380> trying<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
market right now so we're not trying to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.089 
market right now so we're not trying to
read<00:00:29.099> well<00:00:29.760> reinvent<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.810> column<00:00:31.080> system<00:00:31.260> so

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
read well reinvent the column system so

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.040 
read well reinvent the column system so
we<00:00:32.250> try<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.460> reinvent<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.300> array<00:00:33.600> system

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
we try to reinvent the array system

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.560 
we try to reinvent the array system
itself<00:00:34.380> reinvent<00:00:35.309> yourself<00:00:35.790> again<00:00:36.270> because

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
itself reinvent yourself again because

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.270 
itself reinvent yourself again because
you<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.079> many<00:00:37.350> different<00:00:37.590> products<00:00:38.129> in

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
you have so many different products in

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.010 
you have so many different products in
this<00:00:38.399> range<00:00:38.670> exactly<00:00:39.420> exactly<00:00:39.930> I'm

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
this range exactly exactly I'm

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.970 
this range exactly exactly I'm
specialists

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
specialists

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.030 
specialists
well<00:00:41.579> yeah<00:00:41.760> Alice<00:00:42.000> that's<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
well yeah Alice that's what we are and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.410 
well yeah Alice that's what we are and
well<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.370> actually<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.969> know<00:00:45.000> that's

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
well this is actually you know that's

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.540 
well this is actually you know that's
what<00:00:45.660> what<00:00:46.440> actually<00:00:47.070> everyone<00:00:47.340> knows

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
what what actually everyone knows

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.220 
what what actually everyone knows
there's<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> line<00:00:47.969> array<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.420> know<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.809> big

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
there's a line array you know in big

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.439 
there's a line array you know in big
measurements<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:49.950> big<00:00:50.129> venues<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.300> we

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
measurements at big venues so what we

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.350 
measurements at big venues so what we
thought<00:00:52.199> would<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.800> good<00:00:52.980> idea<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
thought would be a good idea and in the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.299 
thought would be a good idea and in the
end<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.570> was<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> good<00:00:54.989> idea<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.860> shrink<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
end it was a good idea is to shrink it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.119 
end it was a good idea is to shrink it
down<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.260> for<00:00:58.440> other<00:00:58.620> usages

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
down to you know just for other usages

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.400 
down to you know just for other usages
for<00:00:59.370> smaller<00:00:59.609> usages<00:01:00.090> for

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
for smaller usages for

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.869 
for smaller usages for
singer-songwriters<00:01:01.410> small<00:01:01.770> bands<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.489> all

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
singer-songwriters small bands and all

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.939 
singer-songwriters small bands and all
that<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.390> yeah<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.379> that's<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:04.890> all

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that so yeah and that's what it's all

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.520 
that so yeah and that's what it's all
about<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.750> that's<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> product<00:01:07.110> can

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
about so that's that's the product can

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.410 
about so that's that's the product can
we<00:01:07.680> turn<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> little<00:01:08.220> bit<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.760> tops<00:01:09.060> because

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
we turn a little bit the tops because

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.920 
we turn a little bit the tops because
it's<00:01:10.290> called<00:01:10.590> curve<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.939> see<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> curve<00:01:12.600> on

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
it's called curve to see the curve on

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.890 
it's called curve to see the curve on
the<00:01:13.710> screen<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.520> yeah<00:01:14.790> that's<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.600> good<00:01:15.720> way

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the screen so yeah that's a good way

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.289 
the screen so yeah that's a good way
please<00:01:16.290> explain<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.130> little<00:01:17.340> bit<00:01:17.580> why<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.060> in

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
please explain a little bit why it's in

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.710 
please explain a little bit why it's in
that<00:01:19.049> shape<00:01:19.460> well<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.479> shape

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
that shape well it's in that shape

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.390 
that shape well it's in that shape
because<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.049> several<00:01:22.380> reasons<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.280> first

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
because of several reasons the first

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.630 
because of several reasons the first
reason<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:24.030> actually<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> line

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
reason is actually it's it is a line

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.850 
reason is actually it's it is a line
array<00:01:26.909> system<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.960> don't<00:01:28.380> want<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> explain

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
array system so I don't want to explain

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
array system so I don't want to explain
how<00:01:29.070> line<00:01:29.250> arrays<00:01:29.520> work<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.210> know<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.420> detail

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
how line arrays work you know in detail

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.380 
how line arrays work you know in detail
but<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.439> say<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
but what I can say is that that the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.130 
but what I can say is that that the
angle<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.680> speaker<00:01:35.159> has<00:01:35.369> provides<00:01:36.240> quite<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
angle the speaker has provides quite a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.990 
angle the speaker has provides quite a
good

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
good

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.749 
good
well<00:01:39.000> provides<00:01:39.479> quite<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.780> good<00:01:39.990> sound<00:01:40.229> for

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
well provides quite a good sound for

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.100 
well provides quite a good sound for
when<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.880> does<00:01:42.240> met<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.600> if<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.810> stand<00:01:43.049> just

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
when that does met so if you stand just

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.780 
when that does met so if you stand just
in<00:01:43.290> front<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.770> or<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.009> you're<00:01:44.159> 50<00:01:44.460> meters

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
in front of it or if you're 50 meters

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.670 
in front of it or if you're 50 meters
away<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.390> know<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:45.960> always<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> good

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
away you know so you always have a good

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.380 
away you know so you always have a good
sound<00:01:46.829> because<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.549> angle<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.270> know

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
sound because the angle is like you know

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.410 
sound because the angle is like you know
just<00:01:48.890> all<00:01:49.890> through<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> way<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.670> know<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.030> so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
just all through the way you know and so

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.660 
just all through the way you know and so
it's<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> concept<00:01:52.979> behind<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.430> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
it's this is the concept behind it and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.069 
it's this is the concept behind it and
when<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.119> look<00:01:54.240> at<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.630> these<00:01:54.750> cubes

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
when you look at one of these cubes

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.289 
when you look at one of these cubes
before<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.219> into<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.520> detail<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.060> cubes

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
before I go into the detail of the cubes

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.580 
before I go into the detail of the cubes
if<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.540> look<00:01:57.659> at<00:01:57.750> one<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.960> these<00:01:58.049> cubes<00:01:58.350> these

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
if you look at one of these cubes these

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.160 
if you look at one of these cubes these
cubes<00:01:58.860> have

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
cubes have

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.890 
cubes have
every<00:02:00.950> single<00:02:01.190> 12<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:02.000> 12<00:02:02.210> centimeter<00:02:02.630> cube

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
every single 12 to 12 centimeter cube

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.610 
every single 12 to 12 centimeter cube
has<00:02:03.050> three<00:02:04.180> tweeters<00:02:05.180> in<00:02:05.210> it<00:02:05.479> no<00:02:05.960> Bridget<00:02:06.470> of

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
has three tweeters in it no Bridget of

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.340 
has three tweeters in it no Bridget of
amitin<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.310> one<00:02:07.970> mid-tone<00:02:08.330> speaker<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.050> these

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
amitin to one mid-tone speaker and these

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.199 
amitin to one mid-tone speaker and these
three<00:02:09.590> tweeters<00:02:09.979> they<00:02:10.369> support<00:02:10.850> this<00:02:11.000> line

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
three tweeters they support this line

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.270 
three tweeters they support this line
array<00:02:11.450> effect<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.709> we<00:02:12.980> have<00:02:13.130> this

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
array effect and so we have this

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.309 
array effect and so we have this
crystal-clear<00:02:13.790> sound<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.600> you<00:02:14.780> mentioned

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
crystal-clear sound that you mentioned

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.970 
crystal-clear sound that you mentioned
that's<00:02:16.060> for<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.330> know<00:02:17.360> really<00:02:18.080> wide<00:02:18.350> long

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
that's for you know really wide long

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.260 
that's for you know really wide long
range<00:02:19.190> citizens<00:02:19.700> yeah

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
range citizens yeah

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.630 
range citizens yeah
is<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.660> plastic<00:02:21.170> top<00:02:21.650> no<00:02:21.950> no<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.490> solid

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
is it a plastic top no no it's solid

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.150 
is it a plastic top no no it's solid
yeah<00:02:23.180> it's<00:02:23.390> solid<00:02:23.540> it's<00:02:24.080> an<00:02:24.350> it's<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.860> unibody

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
yeah it's solid it's an it's a unibody

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.300 
yeah it's solid it's an it's a unibody
aluminum<00:02:26.440> coverage<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:27.620> it's<00:02:27.770> really<00:02:27.980> salty

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
aluminum coverage so it's really salty

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.220 
aluminum coverage so it's really salty
not<00:02:28.520> only<00:02:28.730> solid<00:02:29.060> but<00:02:29.450> sounding<00:02:29.840> way<00:02:29.989> better

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
not only solid but sounding way better

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.140 
not only solid but sounding way better
than<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.620> would<00:02:30.830> then<00:02:31.370> when<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.730> would<00:02:31.850> be<00:02:32.000> made

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
than it would then when it would be made

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.000 
than it would then when it would be made
out<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.330> plastic<00:02:32.420> or<00:02:32.959> wood<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:33.290> ever<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.890> know

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
out of plastic or wood so ever you know

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.760 
out of plastic or wood so ever you know
so<00:02:34.489> that<00:02:35.360> was<00:02:35.510> one<00:02:35.690> criteria<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.320> really<00:02:36.620> make

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
so that was one criteria to really make

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.860 
so that was one criteria to really make
it<00:02:37.000> solids<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.209> know<00:02:38.330> in<00:02:38.510> really<00:02:38.750> high

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
it solids you know in really high

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.830 
it solids you know in really high
quality<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.850> well<00:02:40.850> alright<00:02:41.209> let's<00:02:41.239> let's

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
quality and well alright let's let's

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.699 
quality and well alright let's let's
start<00:02:41.900> with<00:02:42.200> them<00:02:42.320> these<00:02:43.060> these<00:02:44.060> little<00:02:44.239> boxes

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
start with them these these little boxes

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.050 
start with them these these little boxes
can<00:02:45.709> be<00:02:45.980> well<00:02:46.310> these<00:02:46.400> little<00:02:46.519> boxes<00:02:46.880> have<00:02:47.030> a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
can be well these little boxes have a

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.080 
can be well these little boxes have a
base

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.630 

and<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:54.019> base<00:02:54.200> is<00:02:54.410> call<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:55.040> smart<00:02:55.340> link

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
and the base is call it's a smart link

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.000 
and the base is call it's a smart link
adapter<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.390> it's<00:02:57.379> not<00:02:57.500> it's<00:02:57.800> not<00:02:57.950> the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
adapter and it's not it's not the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.860 
adapter and it's not it's not the
speaker<00:02:58.370> itself<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:59.090> just<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.420> base<00:02:59.569> for

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
speaker itself it's just the base for

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.140 
speaker itself it's just the base for
for<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.650> satellites<00:03:01.099> and<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.760> smart<00:03:02.000> thing

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
for the satellites and the smart thing

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.259 
for the satellites and the smart thing
adapter<00:03:02.599> it<00:03:02.810> has<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:04.580> usage<00:03:04.910> for<00:03:04.940> like

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
adapter it has the usage for like

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.420 
adapter it has the usage for like
carrying<00:03:05.840> these<00:03:06.230> speakers<00:03:06.800> because<00:03:07.190> they're

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
carrying these speakers because they're

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.910 
carrying these speakers because they're
all<00:03:07.580> cable<00:03:08.060> s<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.480> know<00:03:08.599> so<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.379> just<00:03:09.560> connect

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
all cable s you know so you just connect

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.289 
all cable s you know so you just connect
them<00:03:10.069> and<00:03:10.099> then<00:03:10.370> they're<00:03:10.549> already<00:03:10.819> connected

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
them and then they're already connected

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.809 
them and then they're already connected
so<00:03:11.660> what<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.410> just<00:03:12.560> need<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:13.129> do<00:03:13.250> is<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.670> just

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
so what you just need to do is to just

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.059 
so what you just need to do is to just
plug<00:03:14.330> in<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.480> cable<00:03:14.750> down<00:03:14.840> here<00:03:15.140> up<00:03:15.530> into<00:03:15.799> this

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
plug in the cable down here up into this

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.600 
plug in the cable down here up into this
semantic<00:03:16.670> adapter<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.860> then<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:18.980> switch<00:03:19.190> how

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
semantic adapter and then you switch how

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.330 
semantic adapter and then you switch how
many<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:20.299> these<00:03:20.540> satellites<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.500> have<00:03:21.680> yeah

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
many of these satellites you have yeah

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.699 
many of these satellites you have yeah
we<00:03:22.790> can<00:03:22.910> adjust<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.360> on<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.599> subwoofers<00:03:24.260> yes

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
we can adjust it on the subwoofers yes

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.440 
we can adjust it on the subwoofers yes
right<00:03:24.950> yeah<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.370> then<00:03:25.640> I<00:03:25.849> mean<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.209> can<00:03:26.329> take

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
right yeah and then I mean you can take

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.360 
right yeah and then I mean you can take
one<00:03:26.630> two<00:03:26.900> three<00:03:27.140> or<00:03:27.290> four<00:03:27.319> it<00:03:27.650> depends<00:03:28.010> on<00:03:28.099> how

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
one two three or four it depends on how

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.819 
one two three or four it depends on how
big<00:03:28.519> your<00:03:28.610> venue<00:03:28.910> is<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.329> then<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:30.650> know<00:03:30.769> you

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
big your venue is and then you know you

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.460 
big your venue is and then you know you
just<00:03:31.130> install<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:31.700> off<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:31.940> go<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.470> the

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
just install and off you go and the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.800 
just install and off you go and the
point<00:03:33.650> is<00:03:33.799> in<00:03:34.549> addition<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.910> that<00:03:35.120> we<00:03:35.390> have<00:03:35.569> on

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
point is in addition to that we have on

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.250 
point is in addition to that we have on
the<00:03:36.019> back<00:03:36.200> side<00:03:37.030> another<00:03:38.030> input<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.810> know<00:03:38.840> so

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
the back side another input you know so

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.710 
the back side another input you know so
this<00:03:40.010> input<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:40.489> for<00:03:40.700> installation<00:03:41.299> -<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:41.660> you

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
this input is for installation - so you

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.600 
this input is for installation - so you
can<00:03:42.079> insulate<00:03:42.440> you<00:03:43.190> can<00:03:43.310> use<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:43.549> for

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
can insulate you can use it for

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.460 
can insulate you can use it for
installation<00:03:44.030> purposes<00:03:44.060> also<00:03:44.599> but<00:03:45.290> that's

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
installation purposes also but that's

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.170 
installation purposes also but that's
yeah<00:03:46.010> that's<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.280> secondary<00:03:46.579> usage<00:03:46.970> the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
yeah that's a secondary usage the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.199 
yeah that's a secondary usage the
primary<00:03:47.569> usage<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:48.019> really<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:49.129> have<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.400> as<00:03:49.549> as

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
primary usage is really to have it as as

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.150 
primary usage is really to have it as as
a<00:03:50.299> tool<00:03:50.599> for<00:03:50.690> life<00:03:50.959> get<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.379> pole<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:51.980> then

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
a tool for life get the pole and then

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.339 
a tool for life get the pole and then
the<00:03:52.310> tops<00:03:52.549> on<00:03:52.730> exactly<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.390> have<00:03:53.599> two<00:03:53.989> holes

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
the tops on exactly you have two holes

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.680 
the tops on exactly you have two holes
inside<00:03:55.069> to<00:03:55.700> fix<00:03:55.879> two<00:03:56.209> different<00:03:56.540> angles

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
inside to fix two different angles

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.479 
inside to fix two different angles
that's<00:03:57.319> right<00:03:57.590> we<00:03:57.769> have<00:03:57.799> two<00:03:58.069> holes<00:03:58.310> here

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
that's right we have two holes here

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.550 
that's right we have two holes here
depending<00:03:59.269> on<00:03:59.359> how<00:03:59.510> many<00:03:59.569> satellites<00:03:59.930> you<00:04:00.350> use

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
depending on how many satellites you use

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.590 
depending on how many satellites you use
so<00:04:00.920> if<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.100> use<00:04:01.250> four<00:04:01.459> satellites<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.389> take

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
so if you use four satellites you take

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.050 
so if you use four satellites you take
the<00:04:03.019> front<00:04:03.290> hole<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.859> if<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.160> use<00:04:04.549> only<00:04:04.700> two

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
the front hole and if you use only two

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.280 
the front hole and if you use only two
you<00:04:05.450> take<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:05.750> other<00:04:05.870> hole<00:04:06.049> because

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
you take the other hole because

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.930 
you take the other hole because
otherwise<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.980> angle<00:04:07.280> would<00:04:07.370> be<00:04:07.400> wrong<00:04:07.670> you

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
otherwise the angle would be wrong you

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.009 
otherwise the angle would be wrong you
know<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:08.269> would<00:04:08.420> just<00:04:08.450> be<00:04:08.720> like<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:08.989> know

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
know and you would just be like you know

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.199 
know and you would just be like you know
playing<00:04:09.290> in<00:04:09.470> front<00:04:09.620> of<00:04:09.799> your<00:04:10.459> own<00:04:10.579> stage<00:04:10.819> all

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
playing in front of your own stage all

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.319 
playing in front of your own stage all
right<00:04:11.359> so<00:04:12.290> let's<00:04:12.680> have<00:04:12.829> a<00:04:12.889> look<00:04:13.040> on<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.180> so

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
right so let's have a look on the so

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.120 
right so let's have a look on the so
proofer<00:04:14.660> because<00:04:14.900> I<00:04:15.049> I<00:04:15.290> can<00:04:15.590> see<00:04:15.709> so<00:04:15.950> many

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
proofer because I I can see so many

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.129 
proofer because I I can see so many
knobs

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
knobs

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.860 
knobs
well<00:04:18.139> actually<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.829> subwoofer<00:04:19.310> is<00:04:19.630> it's<00:04:20.630> not

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
well actually the subwoofer is it's not

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.610 
well actually the subwoofer is it's not
very<00:04:21.590> unusual<00:04:22.250> it's<00:04:22.430> quite<00:04:23.030> comparable<00:04:23.620> in

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
very unusual it's quite comparable in

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.400 
very unusual it's quite comparable in
essence<00:04:25.340> quite<00:04:25.700> comparable<00:04:26.120> to<00:04:26.780> what<00:04:27.229> we

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
essence quite comparable to what we

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.740 
essence quite comparable to what we
actually<00:04:27.740> built<00:04:28.520> with<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.729> Maui<00:04:28.940> it<00:04:29.270> has

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
actually built with the Maui it has

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.800 
actually built with the Maui it has
integrated<00:04:30.470> mixer<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.370> it<00:04:31.520> has<00:04:32.060> an

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
integrated mixer and it has an

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.750 
integrated mixer and it has an
integrated<00:04:33.229> effect<00:04:33.800> section<00:04:34.070> which<00:04:34.370> really

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
integrated effect section which really

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.270 
integrated effect section which really
sounds<00:04:35.090> great<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:36.020> it's<00:04:36.440> more<00:04:36.889> or<00:04:36.979> less<00:04:37.010> plug

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
sounds great so it's more or less plug

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.620 
sounds great so it's more or less plug
and<00:04:37.400> play<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:37.789> know<00:04:37.880> you<00:04:37.940> can<00:04:38.210> plug<00:04:38.479> in<00:04:38.599> your

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
and play you know you can plug in your

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.290 
and play you know you can plug in your
guitar<00:04:38.810> taking<00:04:39.680> your<00:04:39.800> microphone<00:04:40.280> put<00:04:41.150> in

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
guitar taking your microphone put in

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.510 
guitar taking your microphone put in
some<00:04:41.510> delay<00:04:41.900> or<00:04:42.200> some<00:04:42.500> echo<00:04:42.860> whatever<00:04:43.250> you

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
some delay or some echo whatever you

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.850 
some delay or some echo whatever you
know<00:04:43.639> if<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:43.940> go<00:04:44.060> as<00:04:44.630> I<00:04:44.870> can<00:04:45.050> see<00:04:45.229> the<00:04:45.410> targets

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
know if you go as I can see the targets

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.190 
know if you go as I can see the targets
group<00:04:46.220> will<00:04:46.729> be<00:04:46.880> a<00:04:46.910> musician<00:04:47.570> or<00:04:47.900> two

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
group will be a musician or two

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.010 
group will be a musician or two

musicians guitar a singer or even a DJ
because<00:04:51.349> you<00:04:51.440> can<00:04:51.620> see<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:51.979> input<00:04:52.310> serial

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
because you can see the input serial

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.900 
because you can see the input serial
jack<00:04:53.599> input<00:04:54.080> for<00:04:54.320> for<00:04:54.830> example<00:04:55.190> iphone<00:04:55.610> or

jack input for for example iphone or

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.580 
jack input for for example iphone or
whatever<00:04:56.210> right<00:04:56.389> and<00:04:56.599> in<00:04:57.020> addition<00:04:57.349> to<00:04:57.440> that

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
whatever right and in addition to that

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.850 
whatever right and in addition to that
we<00:04:57.740> have<00:04:57.830> a<00:04:57.860> Bluetooth<00:04:59.020> module<00:05:00.020> integrated<00:05:00.740> as

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
we have a Bluetooth module integrated as

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.100 
we have a Bluetooth module integrated as
well<00:05:00.889> so<00:05:01.550> that's<00:05:01.729> possible<00:05:02.180> so<00:05:02.539> it's<00:05:02.690> really

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
well so that's possible so it's really

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.050 
well so that's possible so it's really
versatile<00:05:03.650> you

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
versatile you

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.120 
versatile you
use<00:05:04.150> it<00:05:04.270> for<00:05:04.450> multiple<00:05:05.410> use<00:05:05.560> area<00:05:05.889> for

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
use it for multiple use area for

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.720 
use it for multiple use area for
multiple<00:05:06.430> purposes<00:05:06.550> but<00:05:07.270> I<00:05:07.600> saw<00:05:08.410> behind<00:05:09.310> of

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
multiple purposes but I saw behind of

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.610 
multiple purposes but I saw behind of
the<00:05:09.850> software<00:05:10.270> for<00:05:10.480> another<00:05:10.990> second<00:05:11.470> output

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
the software for another second output

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.300 
the software for another second output
for<00:05:12.100> second<00:05:12.690> top<00:05:13.690> that's<00:05:14.169> right<00:05:14.380> that's<00:05:14.889> right

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
for second top that's right that's right

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.159 
for second top that's right that's right
so<00:05:15.580> one<00:05:16.450> base<00:05:16.690> is<00:05:17.700> or<00:05:18.700> one<00:05:18.940> amplifier<00:05:19.540> can

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
so one base is or one amplifier can

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.590 
so one base is or one amplifier can
support<00:05:20.590> eight<00:05:21.040> of<00:05:21.310> these<00:05:21.490> satellites<00:05:21.940> so

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
support eight of these satellites so

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.240 
support eight of these satellites so
what<00:05:22.750> you<00:05:22.840> can<00:05:22.960> do<00:05:23.080> is<00:05:23.350> we<00:05:23.950> have<00:05:24.070> a<00:05:24.100> lot<00:05:24.220> of

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
what you can do is we have a lot of

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.220 
what you can do is we have a lot of
stuff<00:05:24.520> you<00:05:24.639> can<00:05:24.790> buy<00:05:24.820> together<00:05:25.510> with<00:05:25.780> this<00:05:25.870> so

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
stuff you can buy together with this so

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.409 
stuff you can buy together with this so
you<00:05:26.320> can<00:05:26.500> just<00:05:26.800> add<00:05:27.040> four<00:05:27.700> satellites<00:05:28.150> in<00:05:28.300> one
