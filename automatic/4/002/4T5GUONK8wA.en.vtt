00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
the game as a fan I don't think the NBA

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.869 
the game as a fan I don't think the NBA
would<00:03:03.359> say<00:03:03.659> that<00:03:03.959> your<00:03:04.109> lifetime<00:03:04.590> suspension

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
would say that your lifetime suspension

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.099 
would say that your lifetime suspension
extends<00:03:05.879> to<00:03:06.030> purchasing<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.599> ticket<00:03:06.810> because

extends to purchasing a ticket because

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.470 
extends to purchasing a ticket because
that's<00:03:07.349> a<00:03:07.439> separate<00:03:07.799> license<00:03:08.220> although<00:03:08.549> the

that's a separate license although the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.720 
that's a separate license although the

Pacers<00:03:16.290> fight<00:03:16.530> where<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.489> fan<00:03:17.730> involved<00:03:18.180> in

that fight was banned from ever

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.039 
that fight was banned from ever
attending<00:03:20.040> another<00:03:20.430> Pistons<00:03:21.329> game<00:03:21.569> and<00:03:21.989> I

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
attending another Pistons game and I

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.319 
attending another Pistons game and I
assume<00:03:22.440> something<00:03:23.340> like<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:23.669> could<00:03:23.879> extend

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
assume something like that could extend

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.550 
assume something like that could extend
to<00:03:24.510> Donald<00:03:24.810> sterling<00:03:25.139> but<00:03:25.260> right<00:03:25.379> now<00:03:25.530> my

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
to Donald sterling but right now my

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.809 
to Donald sterling but right now my
understanding<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.310> lifetime<00:03:26.639> suspension

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
understanding of the lifetime suspension

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.819 
understanding of the lifetime suspension
is<00:03:27.239> that<00:03:27.419> he<00:03:27.900> can't<00:03:28.139> have<00:03:28.260> any<00:03:28.440> involvement

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
is that he can't have any involvement

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.099 
is that he can't have any involvement
with<00:03:29.190> an<00:03:29.340> NBA<00:03:29.639> team<00:03:29.730> but<00:03:30.690> separately

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
with an NBA team but separately

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.349 
with an NBA team but separately
purchasing<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.739> ticket<00:03:31.949> to<00:03:32.310> me<00:03:32.459> maybe<00:03:32.819> maybe

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359

not convicted the legal process and then

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.899 
not convicted the legal process and then
the<00:03:50.909> NFL<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.840> their<00:03:52.169> process<00:03:52.739> here<00:03:53.069> that<00:03:53.609> this

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
the NFL and their process here that this

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.899 
the NFL and their process here that this
separation<00:03:54.540> or<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.290> lines<00:03:55.530> blurred<00:03:56.069> as<00:03:56.400> far

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
separation or the lines blurred as far

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.259 
separation or the lines blurred as far
as<00:03:57.139> you<00:03:58.139> know<00:03:58.260> Ray<00:03:58.560> Rice<00:03:58.799> being<00:03:59.099> charged<00:03:59.669> but

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
as you know Ray Rice being charged but

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.750 
as you know Ray Rice being charged but
then<00:04:00.659> the<00:04:00.959> NFL<00:04:01.349> gets<00:04:01.560> together<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:02.609> almost

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
then the NFL gets together it almost

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.849 
then the NFL gets together it almost
felt<00:04:03.060> like<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.540> legal<00:04:04.049> system<00:04:04.229> said<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.769> the

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
felt like the legal system said to the

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.210 
felt like the legal system said to the
NFL<00:04:05.099> you<00:04:05.579> deal<00:04:05.849> with<00:04:06.030> this<00:04:06.680> yeah<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.919> it<00:04:08.040> could

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
NFL you deal with this yeah and it could

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.740 
NFL you deal with this yeah and it could
be<00:04:08.340> interpreted<00:04:08.579> that<00:04:08.940> way<00:04:09.000> because<00:04:09.359> he<00:04:09.629> was

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
be interpreted that way because he was

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.839 
be interpreted that way because he was
able<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:10.109> get<00:04:10.560> admitted<00:04:10.889> into<00:04:11.280> an

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
able to get admitted into an

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.719 
able to get admitted into an
intervention<00:04:12.449> program<00:04:12.870> which<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:14.099> critic

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729 
intervention program which a critic

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.099 
intervention program which a critic
would<00:04:14.909> say<00:04:15.090> was<00:04:15.269> sort<00:04:15.449> of<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.599> slap<00:04:15.870> on<00:04:15.900> the

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
would say was sort of a slap on the

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.069 
would say was sort of a slap on the
wrist<00:04:16.380> by<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.620> court<00:04:17.039> and<00:04:18.030> then<00:04:18.239> as<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.599> result

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
wrist by a court and then as a result

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.569 
wrist by a court and then as a result
the<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.470> court<00:04:19.709> was<00:04:19.829> telling<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.220> NFL<00:04:20.549> you

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
the the court was telling the NFL you

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.640 
the the court was telling the NFL you
could<00:04:20.849> argue<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.719> take<00:04:21.959> care<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.440> now<00:04:22.620> I

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
could argue you take care of it now I

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.560 
could argue you take care of it now I
think<00:04:23.039> a<00:04:23.340> judge<00:04:23.580> would<00:04:23.849> say<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.240> that's<00:04:24.330> not

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
think a judge would say that that's not

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.610 
think a judge would say that that's not
true<00:04:24.840> that<00:04:24.870> that's<00:04:25.169> not<00:04:25.320> an<00:04:25.469> accurate

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
true that that's not an accurate

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.260 
true that that's not an accurate
interpretation

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
interpretation

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.760 
interpretation
the<00:04:27.360> court<00:04:27.599> system<00:04:27.930> is<00:04:28.020> proceeding<00:04:28.560> on<00:04:28.650> its

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
the court system is proceeding on its

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.550 
the court system is proceeding on its
own<00:04:28.889> process<00:04:29.400> but<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:30.300> NFL<00:04:30.810> really<00:04:31.199> has

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
own process but the NFL really has

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.770 
own process but the NFL really has
broader<00:04:32.340> discretion<00:04:33.120> over<00:04:33.240> punishing

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
broader discretion over punishing

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.779 
broader discretion over punishing
players<00:04:34.020> in<00:04:34.259> any<00:04:34.410> other<00:04:34.560> league<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:35.370> doesn't

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
really a credible appeal right but this

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.309 
really a credible appeal right but this
is<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.449> system<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.080> Players

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
is the system that the Players

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.200 
is the system that the Players

Association assented to through
collective<00:05:12.659> bargaining<00:05:13.080> so<00:05:13.319> they<00:05:13.800> can't

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
collective bargaining so they can't

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.899 
collective bargaining so they can't
complain<00:05:14.400> about<00:05:14.430> it<00:05:14.669> now<00:05:14.880> can<00:05:15.449> you<00:05:16.520> maybe<00:05:17.520> not

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
complain about it now can you maybe not
