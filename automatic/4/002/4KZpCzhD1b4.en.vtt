00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.940
 hi all guys have emerged from 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:11.730
 this doesn't video and guys this is a 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.639
 115 clicks on a yemen map and where though 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.060
 unfortunately, there will only be boys 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.500
 second throw is think what bad luck 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.180
 where, however, I will do most of the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 in fact you go out in the first run I did 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.029
 more or less 30 those who notice the gene and then 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.750
 115 will arrive so now there will be the part 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.010
 better that is, think about the bad guys 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.020
 I usually always record when there is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.460
 I never make the record from the cinema 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.960
 we always say the live in quotation marks and 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.719
 video 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 the only time I forgot to 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.960
 record the game that is 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.110
 records in the second round on in fact 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.480
 see in this second round not mine 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.520
 slut bitch didn't register me on 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.949
 first the match is registered 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.119
 you don't know the cinema is crap but in one 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.170
 absurd way it seems therefore that 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.070
 we can do it 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.140
 oh well i'm very very sorry 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.080
 because really this was a nice one 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.240
 gameplay kobe you see in short you will see the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.400
 most beautiful part, however, to see it all 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.380
 it would have been better and okay guys 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.939
 so I finally managed to do 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.890
 100 more even on this map than me 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.180
 in short , mine was quite difficult 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.740
 I must say that I was lucky to 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.950
 because the end nights made me 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.549
 more more who has it even if you do n't call me 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.470
 it seems 4 or more than something like that 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.680
 but in short it was the most part 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.280
 fortunate of that other we evoke 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.610
 published of the 98 kill works he was 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.189
 much luckier then better this way 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.420
 also i want to advise want more 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.570
 also the trick to play on 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.040
 this app because so much of third time 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.259
 it's not that we have it very much because 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.469
 but just five minutes this video 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.330
 so ok guys on this map 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.630
 as I said in the video 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.770
 98 kill is something a little let's say a little 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.200
 complicated 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.290
 you really don't have to take 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.910
 from the center the enemies nor too sideways 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.650
 I think you have to surprise them by using the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.510
 huts that is being inside prayed 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.500
 target a kind of nuketown ok 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.599
 this map has this town laid 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.630
 back and speed ball of new town is like 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:41.730
 where to test these precisely in these 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.230
 kind of strongholds and try to 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.510
 surprise enemies with a machine gun 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.680
 and this is the tactic must cease if 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.239
 play with a machine gun 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.080
 naturally if played with a rifle 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.180
 assault with a sniper a rifle a 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.680
 pump the tactic the same grip 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.780
 day with an assault rifle instead 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.420
 you have to take enemies a little more with 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.860
 a little more reasoning or not 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.370
 you have to launch right away but you have to 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:15.180
 wait for a jailer you have to wait 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.680
 a second friends in short where a little 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.200
 more playing on the defensive because 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.079
 this map where there are merely 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.769
 really too many campers in my opinion 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:29.310
 so in short it is not that I like it 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.739
 very much like marble but nice from 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.510
 that is, in fact I didn't do it right away 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.299
 center that now I miss the maps 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:45.000
 there are few to make a center 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:48.480
 over so overflow affirmed drone between 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.130
 the largest and ok, oh well then all 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.600
 those in short, those that are not in 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.730
 war the rests because in quaratesi alle 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.329
 there are very few kids parties 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.349
 maps I don't know why we could 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:04.739
 put a map in more 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:08.430
 ask for a water like or a plaza 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.230
 map as it comes so slums I do n't say of 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.770
 put new town because it would be a 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.980
 casino 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.780
 however, slams can do it 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.060
 mine because there isn't so much 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.930
 that is, a map that more or less yes 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.000
 It equals complicity in a magnitude indeed 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.760
 maybe read smaller family 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.210
 okay guys and also this video is 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.960
 finished 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.270
 I hope you enjoyed it and guys this 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.780
 it is my first hundred plus Yemen 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.860
 hopefully not last is short put 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.300
 like commented at 7 mp I gave him a 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.250
 quick charger silencer 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.860
 indeed if you want add this video 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.190
 favorites that in short vary 215 I say 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.510
 yemen and they said quite difficult there 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.920
 see you tomorrow with a 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.700
 other finished a video a day lever 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.110
 the doctor around this my motto is 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.330
 in short then I discovered in the end that 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.610
 rewards that titles on this base 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.650
 these because they are other rewards for 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.440
 do a hundred more are the complexes that 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.530
 they make you more massacres than ever 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.080
 si cruciat khanysha have reappeared 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.640
 millions only because they are really the 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.980
 poletti do for bald strangers of 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.490
 I entrust boys see you tomorrow with a 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:26.840
