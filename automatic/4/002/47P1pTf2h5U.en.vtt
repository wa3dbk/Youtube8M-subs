00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.140
 with this 

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.789
 with a BNN 

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:06.789
 oath 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.609
 all in a good afternoon 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.759
 this is a really nice afternoon because it is the second edition 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.390
 with crysis 2 for tjerk see in him that they already did it once last year 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.660
 was also a resounding success because there is quite a bit at stake 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.490
 I therefore understand very well that all these people have gathered here 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.870
 to draw attention to their charity because there is quite a bit of money too 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.300
 earns and of course a lot of attention comes to the foundation 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.660
 in this way, in cooperation with skype, I am not going off those trees myself 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.269
 of course I can't say anything meaningful about that there 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.690
 we have invited a professional jury if you like schayk and mari 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.310
 of the ven 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.540
 years I'm going to ask you what you will pay attention to that you have 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.260
 experience with Christmas trees 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.550
 well and presumably vido kuipers christmas trees center much for molex 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.600
 customers better can get away with it 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.679
 we're going to pay attention 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.079
 he offered back a good cause a bit processed it seems to me 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.320
 something to see 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.110
 the facts speak that answers b had arisen the creative people sit 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.720
 I don't know exactly when 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.110

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.450
 In addition, it is in the competition was liberated children from the sex industry in

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.749
 in the trees

 two hung under par of â‚¬ 10,000 can free 200 girls 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.890
 foundation on our website the foundation has been in existence for three years 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.139
 the last wishes of two minor not kidney patients 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:27.639
 we have around 700 people a year and have 180 volunteers and we too 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.569
 have a butterfly in our logo no it all goes a bit on a given 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.699
 moment a break with fine pie the freedom that draws us a lot 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:39.459
 Gradually new incorporated into our plans it is the founder of Artis 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.560

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.830
 a sign that the children eventually go home with that they know how 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.720
 nature put together recently I was nobody a child from abroad because 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.680
 they indicate Germany is already a small child he has on it 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.820
 beach sitting on the beach and the little animal and it started to move and that its place 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.750
 wait to be put out power extinct that means enough 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.120
 education and nature from practically earlier kwo 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:05.650
 we are from 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.940
 foundation kamper falcon bos and the foundation from the hague that all children 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.310
 from the hague that financially our body with less endowed its license plate per 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.219
 take a fantastic camp with the imac anp 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:23.399
 the children who come in there stayed on completely from the first day on 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.339
 that is why we have chosen several colors because the pupils are too 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:30.150
 all experience things all colors see them both cases and red chosen 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:33.889
 because we are good at the red balls, but they were not to be found 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:37.839
 6 but on the other side 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.629
 because we want to spread the ball there 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.029
 and the message this year the calf street the the complaints are going to 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:45.729
 the 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.689
 that is possible at tvm we want to make sure that all children are already at the 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.539
 children play and exercise 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.710
 that's how it was made from sites again 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.149
 Thank you very much for your cooperation 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:59.149
 First of all, Karen will explain why 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.489
 one of them is the friends of home care foundation 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.369
 and the Friends of Home Care Foundation is really an organization that 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:13.439
 cooperates with home care to see where people can be helped in the Netherlands 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.299
 that some things cannot pay for ourselves, we stand for 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.479
 edukans foundation in our band is not only a testament to an enormous amount of creativity 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.220
 the logo of the opportunity is in fact one 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.000
 well it is of course difficult it comes a bit creative thinking you already 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.099
 go out quickly 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.340
 blue was very scarce today just looking around 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.400
 and since tooske and bit with her elbow was working we vittek that 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.400
 what a good thing to be in that respect, it is a bit heavy ordinary 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.990
 come naturally 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.110
 it is a bit against it 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.360
 of course 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.249
 it does mean advice why is that shed 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.669
 well that is natural 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:56.910
 weather of art 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.870
 so this is actually 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.930
 for me it is very good to think 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.280
 Incidentally, the Tooske Foundation, what am I supposed to do, what have you done? 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.150
 has 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.530
 did you hit and dressed? 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.460
 the 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.820
 yes he can also compete tough guy i like a little bit of blue and 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.629
 I asked for a very kind one but I didn't get it 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:20.360
 then I took it then you also have to take other measures so it's who 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.789
 yours takes the floor 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.479
 since I already have a system of the rainbow tree foundation 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.270
 rainbow tree 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.770
 we have therefore made 9 come up 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.370
 made it possible for trained volunteers to go to the hospital 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.900
 to go 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.410
 to be there and long-term sick child that we seek to give them children in peace 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.919
 to learn 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.160
 Fail in finding themselves where they feel safe and strong for a few 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.879
 by making it perhaps slightly more bearable to undergo all the misery that comes in 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.840
 hospital has to undergo we have opted for transparency 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.979
 she also needs to look at the classic lights 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.460
 then a classic but above all little 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.830
 bombarie little twitter gets there 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.710
 no peak no is an extremely dangerous 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.860
 then it has to do with foundation its success the foundation after one of the 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.470
 few in terms of stay 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.960
 foundation that spyker full eurofiber free of charge 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.180
 3 coming in 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.389
 actually goes I have the kids in the weekend 2002 or year 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.869
 once again 

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:22.869
 children come neat syndrome 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:24.229
 he 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:28.099
 We then looked at ten of the people who did this 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.099
 that is incurable, we want that very much 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.779
 that these little blue smurfs 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:35.710
 from two and a half years 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.259
 the gold also reached concerned 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.599
 yeah i think this is just the nicest thing she's watching the girl 

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:45.929
 can we come up with something to work with or can we immediately switch to 

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:48.729
 The most exciting moment the prize has been won by 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:49.840
 karin flowers 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.460
 and admit it 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.300
 No 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.849
 there are very happy thanks all for the cooperation that staples beautiful 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:01.849
 tree the second prize has been won by coming 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:06.439
 if you but we are exactly happy with it 

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:09.879
 a ball again I always had for the grand prize 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:12.029
 but i think this is also one 

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:13.559
 the involved is at 

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:15.849
 the jury for turbo lights 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:17.279
 the foundation 7 

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:20.279
 but who did it become? 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:24.460
 was counted by votes 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.430
 gagas 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.390
 the rainbow over which they put this together is so well spent is so incredibly 

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:32.270
 nice 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.569
 but then actually quite a nice end of the dutch very small foundation 

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:41.969
 I'm going to keep it myself m but it is time that that foundation a bit more under the 

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:44.240
 attention comes so that even more children 

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.690
 can learn to help themselves and that is ultimately when you have children 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.949
 you cannot you can take away the misery but if your child can give strength to 

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:53.610
 to deal with that we descent 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.030
 that is the best thing you can do and the then these people the Amsterdam thanks 

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:57.550
 for writing
