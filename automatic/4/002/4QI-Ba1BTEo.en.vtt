thumb and I'm just gonna start breaking
down<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.870> fibers<00:00:46.289> here<00:00:46.700> it<00:00:47.700> doesn't<00:00:47.969> take<00:00:48.149> too

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
down the fibers here it doesn't take too

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.900 
down the fibers here it doesn't take too
long<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> do<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:48.870> you'll<00:00:49.800> start<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> notice<00:00:50.489> the

long to do so you'll start to notice the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.869 
long to do so you'll start to notice the
paper<00:00:51.120> separating<00:00:51.870> slightly<00:00:52.670> but<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.789> you

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
paper separating slightly but what you

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
do want to do is run the bone folder on

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.689 
do want to do is run the bone folder on
both<00:00:57.030> sides<00:00:57.770> you<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:58.920> want<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.160> be<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> little

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
both sides you do want to be a little

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790 
both sides you do want to be a little
bit<00:00:59.850> gentle<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.379> don't<00:01:01.590> rip<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
bit gentle so that you don't rip the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.149 
bit gentle so that you don't rip the
paper<00:01:02.899> but<00:01:03.899> again<00:01:04.140> you'll<00:01:04.320> start<00:01:04.650> seeing<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
paper but again you'll start seeing the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.929 
paper but again you'll start seeing the
paper<00:01:05.369> separate<00:01:07.310> just<00:01:08.310> takes<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.729> bit

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
paper separate just takes a little bit

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.830 
paper separate just takes a little bit
of<00:01:09.000> elbow<00:01:09.360> grease<00:01:11.210> another<00:01:12.210> way<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.659> can

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
of elbow grease another way that you can

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.630 
of elbow grease another way that you can
break<00:01:13.020> down<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> fibers<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.979> using<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
break down the fibers is using the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.289 
break down the fibers is using the
crimper<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.810> crimping<00:01:16.170> tool<00:01:16.970> but<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> find

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
crimper or the crimping tool but I find

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.300 
crimper or the crimping tool but I find
that<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.570> uses<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.110> little<00:01:19.380> bit<00:01:19.500> less<00:01:19.799> elbow

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that this uses a little bit less elbow

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.719 
that this uses a little bit less elbow
grease<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.140> has<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.380> same<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:23.460> similar

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
grease and has the same or similar

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.880 
grease and has the same or similar
effect<00:01:25.009> we're<00:01:26.009> getting<00:01:26.250> close<00:01:27.470> just<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.619> few

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
effect we're getting close just a few

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.980 
effect we're getting close just a few
more<00:01:29.100> times<00:01:29.460> with<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> bone<00:01:30.060> folder

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.270 

all<00:01:36.990> right<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:37.410> I<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.710> kind<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.950> wiggle

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
it just a little bit it sounds like a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.910 
it just a little bit it sounds like a
song<00:01:41.640> doesn't<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.230> and<00:01:43.230> then<00:01:43.500> you'll<00:01:43.620> start<00:01:43.860> to

wrinkle just a little bit and you'll
start<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.519> see<00:03:29.470> as<00:03:30.470> you<00:03:30.680> do<00:03:30.860> each<00:03:31.040> layer<00:03:33.970> that

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
start to see as you do each layer that

start to see as you do each layer that
the<00:03:35.120> flower<00:03:35.360> is<00:03:35.510> going<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.810> start<00:03:36.080> spreading

she's<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:44.890> excited<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.459> figure<00:03:45.760> out<00:03:45.909> how<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.180> do

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
she's so excited to figure out how to do

this<00:03:46.569> flower<00:03:46.870> cuz<00:03:47.319> I<00:03:47.439> can<00:03:47.620> see<00:03:47.890> it<00:03:48.010> using<00:03:48.970> it

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
this flower cuz I can see it using it

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.490 
this flower cuz I can see it using it
for<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.299> lot<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.569> different<00:03:49.870> things<00:03:50.079> whether<00:03:50.349> it

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
for a lot of different things whether it

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.250 
for a lot of different things whether it
be<00:03:50.620> three-dimensional<00:03:51.040> projects<00:03:52.000> or<00:03:53.879> carves

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
be three-dimensional projects or carves

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.059 
be three-dimensional projects or carves
obviously<00:03:56.260> it'd<00:03:56.379> be<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.500> little<00:03:56.680> bit<00:03:56.890> difficult

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
obviously it'd be a little bit difficult

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.520 
obviously it'd be a little bit difficult
to<00:03:57.370> mail<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.909> cards<00:03:58.269> with<00:03:58.569> this<00:03:58.840> flower<00:03:59.140> on<00:03:59.290> it

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
to mail the cards with this flower on it

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.869 
to mail the cards with this flower on it
but<00:03:59.739> they're<00:03:59.890> pretty<00:04:00.069> resilient

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
but they're pretty resilient

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.330 
but they're pretty resilient
I<00:04:01.000> had<00:04:01.659> this<00:04:01.840> back<00:04:02.109> tag<00:04:02.409> on<00:04:02.560> my<00:04:02.680> convention<00:04:02.950> bag

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
I had this back tag on my convention bag

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.080 
I had this back tag on my convention bag
for<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.819> full<00:04:04.030> four<00:04:04.900> days<00:04:05.079> I<00:04:05.290> was<00:04:05.439> there<00:04:05.470> and

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
for the full four days I was there and

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.929 
for the full four days I was there and
that<00:04:07.090> flower<00:04:07.329> held<00:04:07.629> up<00:04:07.780> pretty<00:04:07.900> darn<00:04:08.200> well<00:04:08.260> so

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
that flower held up pretty darn well so

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.129 
that flower held up pretty darn well so
you<00:04:09.939> start<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.269> see<00:04:10.359> it<00:04:10.540> almost<00:04:10.659> looks<00:04:10.959> like<00:04:11.109> a

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
you start to see it almost looks like a

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.509 
you start to see it almost looks like a
rose<00:04:11.409> a<00:04:11.440> little<00:04:11.799> bit<00:04:11.920> I<00:04:11.950> still<00:04:12.220> think<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.489> looks

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
rose a little bit I still think it looks

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.660 
rose a little bit I still think it looks
a<00:04:12.760> little<00:04:12.849> bit<00:04:13.030> like<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.209> carnation<00:04:13.690> but<00:04:14.670> almost

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
a little bit like a carnation but almost

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:25.860 
a little bit like a carnation but almost
there<00:04:21.780> in<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.930> last<00:04:23.169> layer<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:25.419> now<00:04:25.539> the<00:04:25.600> last

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
there in the last layer and now the last

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.740 
there in the last layer and now the last
step<00:04:26.199> I<00:04:26.350> just<00:04:26.560> do<00:04:26.710> is<00:04:26.889> just<00:04:27.039> slightly<00:04:27.750> spread

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
step I just do is just slightly spread

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.520 
step I just do is just slightly spread
it<00:04:28.870> apart<00:04:29.169> a<00:04:29.289> little<00:04:29.320> bit

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.470 

and<00:04:34.040> you'll<00:04:34.220> see<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.640> flower<00:04:37.480> magically

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
and you'll see that the flower magically

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.700 
and you'll see that the flower magically
appears

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.270 

there<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:46.860> go<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.340> beautiful<00:04:48.030> paper<00:04:49.280> carnation

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
there you go a beautiful paper carnation

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.850 
there you go a beautiful paper carnation
or<00:04:50.400> rose<00:04:50.690> this<00:04:51.690> would<00:04:51.870> be<00:04:51.960> real<00:04:52.230> pretty<00:04:52.530> with
