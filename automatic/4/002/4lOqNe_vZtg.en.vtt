00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.350
 Hello everyone, Irina Shmeleva and 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.660
 today we'll talk about the arrow but i know 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.150
 that so many girls love arrows 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.580
 someone can draw someone does not know how to 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.279
 it is difficult for someone 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.100
 drew a beautiful arrow 2 you start 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.980
 Well damn paint and do not receive 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.529
 and so much time wasted 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.710
 afraid of the paint you paint some eyelashes and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.500
 ran cut off my mood ruined everything 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.989
 bad and they get arrows like these 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.989
 people draw them in 2 minutes 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.270
 so today I will tell you how to make 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.850
 the arrows are fast and correct so if you 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.829
 newbie shooter you cause it 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.649
 buy yourself some difficulties 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.989
 flomaster eyeliner she just 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.610
 very cool for beginners and not only 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.520
 for beginners when you need fast 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.280
 draw arrows that is she has 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.320
 such a very , very thin 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210
 neat tip wanna draw your 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.899
 attention that the tip should be 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.789
 wind 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.220
 then your eyeliner is not 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.170
 dries in a week after buying it 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.150
 will serve you for a long time and will help you 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.450
 send your arrows as it happens 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.479
 gel eyeliner mesh find you here 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.600
 such a meybellin for example is very good 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.670
 Budget pathword to and I also have enough to 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.950
 A lot of the classic version is 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.229
 liquid eyeliners and there are several 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.750
 improvised tools that allow 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.750
 us simplify the process exactly norris 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.700
 drawing here this tail first 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.220
 option this here is such an ordinary scotch 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.829
 the second option here is such 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.810
 plastic card someone uses 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.450
 even a teaspoon 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.670
 he doesn't know it seems easier for me to take then 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.250
 so the card and the spoon from the kitchen drag 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.430
 which we generally choose what you want 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.939
 more convenient and the arrow on the upper eyelids should 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.060
 go as if to continue the bottom line 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:04.670
 century that is here we have you not lower eyelid 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:07.020
 and she comes in here like this direction 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.690
 I take an ordinary tape 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:15.350
 I advise you to stick it on first 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.140
 hand so that there is not so sticky 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.630
 because the skin is still near the eyes it 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.900
 very gentle and we need this one 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:30.780
 smooth side stick in continuation 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:34.670
 lines of the lower eyelid under the cilia to 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.130
 don't hook their brain 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.320
 will push 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.320
 do the same with the other eye 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.599
 I will take my favorite matt eyeliner 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.640
 shirts pay attention classic 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.709
 the arrow must not start itself 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.989
 corner of the eye although there are such species 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.359
 shooter like cat's eyes do but 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.599
 the classic arrow reached china where 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.909
 starting you the smallest cilia 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.310
 can peresa table then he will 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:13.000
 draw easier so that the hand does not tremble and 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.379
 just along the lash line we draw 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.379
 our arrow 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.639
 gaps between the cilia should not be 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.260
 everything should be exactly very clear if 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:31.120
 there is something like this below we 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.220
 I paint over our going arrow 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.709
 almost to scotch 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.540
 Straight through the line of the outer corner tape 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.540
 eyes we draw our arrow 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.189
 drew this 3 new strong 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.230
 long line and do and better do 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.840
 his decreases need then my 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.379
 extend the smell coming out from the tip 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.919
 literally a millimeter and hold here 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.919
 such a line 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.770
 so we connected all our lines can 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.130
 some more paint on thicken arrow 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:17.440
 either paint on a longer tip over 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:22.000
 wish it and still paint over our corner 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:28.510
 eyes that's what happened now we 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:35.380
 can you remove the code does not neatly 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:37.570
 here and to the temples a very important point 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.630
 arrows when you look straight ahead 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:44.020
 yourself no breaks and call it 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.990
 folds should not be if you are correct 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.510
 right to do this line then breaks 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.520
 you won't have these if your leg is strong 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.650
 take the tip then this at home 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.680
 formed from a rag we will float 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.210
 we donâ€™t need this at all 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.550
 to the second eye 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:06.580
 recruiting eyeliner we remove a little too much 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:12.720
 not to blot and draw our 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.720
 arrow directly along the lash line and 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.700
 we bring to scotch 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:26.449
 All times we iron the tape and draw our 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.449
 line 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:41.360
 they drew and connect it with 1 or 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:45.710
 our lines and paint well 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.420
 corner and now remove the tape given 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.940
 method of drawing arrows and most importantly 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.910
 what you need to do it right 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.260
 glue tape on both eyes 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.000
 equally in order to create volume 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.040
 before our eyes we have to take 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.010
 brown shade of fluffy shades 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.760
 brush and draw a crease top 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:08.510
 century already talked about this video lesson 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:11.300
 about pedal because our century must 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:15.110
 look voluminous deepen our 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.580
 fold is the fold of the upper eyelid and a 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.160
 I hope that my video drawing lesson 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.350
 shooter was useful to you that you clarified 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.210
 moments that you did not understand 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.660
 see you next video 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.660
 bye Bye
