mind<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.449> believe<00:01:03.629> last<00:01:03.840> year<00:01:04.339> how<00:01:05.339> much<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.700> an

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
mind I believe last year how much of an

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.250 
mind I believe last year how much of an
advantage<00:01:06.060> was<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.630> year<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.080> into

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
advantage was that this year going into

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.219 
advantage was that this year going into
it<00:01:07.590> knowing<00:01:08.189> kind<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.580> how<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> works<00:01:09.229> but

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
it knowing kind of how it works but

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.190 
it knowing kind of how it works but
honestly<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.010> know<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:12.420> deadline<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.840> believe

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
honestly you know the deadline I believe

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.710 
honestly you know the deadline I believe
it<00:01:13.290> was<00:01:13.350> much<00:01:13.560> earlier<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.580> mean<00:01:15.270> last<00:01:15.450> year<00:01:15.540> we
