00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
we've run out of cards and it appears as

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.590 
we've run out of cards and it appears as
though<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.250> knew<00:01:26.490> exactly<00:01:26.820> where<00:01:27.150> you'd<00:01:27.360> run

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
though I knew exactly where you'd run

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.160 
though I knew exactly where you'd run
out<00:01:28.070> you've<00:01:29.070> run<00:01:29.460> out<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.759> cards<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:31.020> let<00:01:31.110> me

out you've run out of cards so let me
show<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.350> how<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.400> really

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
show you how to do that so it's a really

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.190 
show you how to do that so it's a really
simple<00:01:32.880> trick<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.240> only<00:01:33.479> requires<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.990> little

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
simple trick it only requires a little

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.319 
simple trick it only requires a little
bit<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.439> practice<00:01:34.939> you're<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.270> to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
bit of practice you're just going to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.410 
bit of practice you're just going to
need<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> regular<00:01:36.659> deck<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:36.990> cards<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.090> one<00:01:39.090> I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.450 
cards card put that there so it's now in
the<00:02:20.040> 21st<00:02:20.660> position<00:02:21.660> from<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.140> top<00:02:22.320> from<00:02:22.860> here

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
the 21st position from the top from here

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.280 
the 21st position from the top from here
I<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.880> start<00:02:24.030> off<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.330> trick<00:02:24.540> with<00:02:24.750> false

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
I like to start off the trick with false

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.890 
I like to start off the trick with false
shuffles<00:02:25.820> just<00:02:26.820> because<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.540> don't<00:02:27.690> know<00:02:27.870> i

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
shuffles just because I don't know i

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.500 
shuffles just because I don't know i
make<00:02:28.110> guess<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.830> makes<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.130> look<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.580> little

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
make guess it makes it look a little

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.840 
make guess it makes it look a little
more<00:02:30.660> impressive<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.100> certainly<00:02:32.610> don't

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
more impressive but you certainly don't

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.720 
more impressive but you certainly don't
have<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:34.140> could<00:02:34.260> do<00:02:34.410> false<00:02:35.130> cuts<00:02:35.400> or<00:02:35.640> you

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
have to you could do false cuts or you

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.880 
have to you could do false cuts or you
don't<00:02:35.880> have<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.060> do<00:02:36.150> anything<00:02:36.650> once<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.740> have

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
don't have to do anything once you have

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.150 
don't have to do anything once you have
that<00:02:37.920> done<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.970> tell<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.840> spectator<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.680> cut

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
that done you tell the spectator to cut

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.010 
that done you tell the spectator to cut
some<00:02:41.340> cards<00:02:41.610> off<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.880> top<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.690> have<00:02:42.870> to

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
some cards off the top and you have to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.080 
some cards off the top and you have to
be<00:02:43.140> sure<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.590> tell<00:02:43.830> them<00:02:43.860> not<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.520> cut<00:02:44.670> too<00:02:44.880> many

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
be sure to tell them not to cut too many

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.510 
be sure to tell them not to cut too many
if<00:02:45.300> they<00:02:45.780> cut<00:02:45.990> more<00:02:46.200> than<00:02:46.230> 21<00:02:46.740> cards<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.190> the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
if they cut more than 21 cards like the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.240 
if they cut more than 21 cards like the
trick<00:02:47.730> will<00:02:47.940> pretty<00:02:48.420> much<00:02:48.540> be<00:02:48.630> done<00:02:48.930> and

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
trick will pretty much be done and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.310 
trick will pretty much be done and
that's<00:02:50.250> kind<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.090> only<00:02:51.210> real<00:02:51.720> downside<00:02:51.900> to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
that's kind of the only real downside to

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.600 
that's kind of the only real downside to
this<00:02:52.410> trick<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.160> you're<00:02:53.250> going<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.400> tell<00:02:53.550> them

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
this trick so you're going to tell them

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.400 
this trick so you're going to tell them
to<00:02:53.700> cut<00:02:53.850> some<00:02:53.970> cars<00:02:54.180> off<00:02:54.330> top<00:02:54.600> not<00:02:54.870> too<00:02:55.050> many<00:02:55.200> or

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
to cut some cars off top not too many or

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.080 
to cut some cars off top not too many or
we'll<00:02:55.530> be<00:02:55.620> here<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:55.950> too<00:02:56.070> long<00:02:56.280> make<00:02:57.060> sure

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
we'll be here for too long make sure

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.650 
we'll be here for too long make sure
they<00:02:57.540> cut<00:02:57.780> under<00:02:58.200> 21<00:02:58.760> as<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.120> practice<00:03:00.330> this

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
they cut under 21 as you practice this

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
they cut under 21 as you practice this
trick<00:03:00.870> you'll<00:03:01.080> kind<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.320> know<00:03:01.440> what<00:03:01.560> that

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
trick you'll kind of know what that

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.860 
trick you'll kind of know what that
looks<00:03:01.920> like<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:03.330> then<00:03:03.480> you're<00:03:03.630> going<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.780> take

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
looks like and then you're going to take

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.450 
looks like and then you're going to take
the<00:03:04.020> cards<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.650> without<00:03:04.980> making<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.400> too

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
the cards and without making it too

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.830 
the cards and without making it too
obvious<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.940> you're<00:03:06.030> counting<00:03:06.180> you're

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
obvious that you're counting you're

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.840 
obvious that you're counting you're
going<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.200> count<00:03:07.440> off<00:03:07.590> 21<00:03:08.010> cards<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.580> reverse

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
going to count off 21 cards in a reverse

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:18.800 
going to count off 21 cards in a reverse
the<00:03:09.030> order<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.630> 1<00:03:10.320> 2<00:03:10.710> 3<00:03:11.010> 4<00:03:16.489> 1<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:17.730> then<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.660> can

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
the order so 1 2 3 4 1 and then you can

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.840 
the order so 1 2 3 4 1 and then you can
kind<00:03:19.020> of<00:03:19.110> get<00:03:19.260> rid<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.440> this<00:03:19.620> leftover<00:03:20.430> pack<00:03:20.730> of

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
kind of get rid of this leftover pack of

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.110 
kind of get rid of this leftover pack of
cards<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.320> have<00:03:22.739> yours<00:03:23.070> they<00:03:23.610> have<00:03:23.820> theirs

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
cards so you have yours they have theirs

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.510 
cards so you have yours they have theirs
and<00:03:24.480> you're<00:03:25.050> going<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.320> kind<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:25.860> one<00:03:26.070> by<00:03:26.250> one

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
and you're going to kind of one by one

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.310 
and you're going to kind of one by one
deal<00:03:26.790> off<00:03:27.060> making<00:03:27.420> sure<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.930> go<00:03:28.080> first

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
deal off making sure that you go first

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.910 
deal off making sure that you go first
so<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.220> go<00:03:29.610> first<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:33.090> end<00:03:33.270> result<00:03:33.920> of

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
so you go first and the end result of

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:43.650 
so you go first and the end result of
course<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.650> very<00:03:37.650> shocking

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.360 

finale<00:03:44.660> that<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:47.170> have<00:03:48.170> run<00:03:48.920> out<00:03:49.070> of<00:03:49.100> cards

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
finale that you have run out of cards

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.120 
finale that you have run out of cards
and<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:50.660> great<00:03:50.870> variation<00:03:51.470> of<00:03:51.590> this<00:03:51.680> is<00:03:51.860> you<00:03:52.010> can

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
and a great variation of this is you can

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.830 
and a great variation of this is you can
actually<00:03:52.280> have<00:03:52.520> the<00:03:52.610> spectator<00:03:53.030> take<00:03:53.630> their

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
actually have the spectator take their

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.420 
actually have the spectator take their
pack<00:03:54.050> of<00:03:54.200> cards<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:55.060> put<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.210> in<00:03:57.400> like<00:03:58.400> a

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
pack of cards and put it in like a

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.730 
pack of cards and put it in like a
pocket<00:03:58.850> or<00:03:59.240> bigger<00:03:59.810> have<00:03:59.930> a<00:03:59.960> pocket<00:04:00.200> but<00:04:00.530> like

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
pocket or bigger have a pocket but like

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.950 
pocket or bigger have a pocket but like
put<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.460> in<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.640> pocket<00:04:01.820> so<00:04:02.330> when<00:04:02.660> they<00:04:02.780> reach

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
put it in a pocket so when they reach

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.480 
put it in a pocket so when they reach
into<00:04:03.260> their<00:04:03.350> pocket<00:04:03.680> they<00:04:03.710> actually<00:04:04.130> have<00:04:04.280> run

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
into their pocket they actually have run

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.830 
into their pocket they actually have run
out<00:04:04.580> of<00:04:04.640> cards<00:04:04.820> and<00:04:05.090> you<00:04:05.180> kind<00:04:05.450> of<00:04:05.510> predicted

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
out of cards and you kind of predicted

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.660 
out of cards and you kind of predicted
that<00:04:05.960> but<00:04:06.860> there<00:04:07.010> are<00:04:07.070> some<00:04:07.340> different

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
that but there are some different

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.430 
that but there are some different
variations<00:04:08.180> I'd<00:04:08.750> love<00:04:08.960> to<00:04:09.080> see<00:04:09.170> if<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.320> guys

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
variations I'd love to see if you guys

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.949 
variations I'd love to see if you guys
come<00:04:09.620> up<00:04:09.740> with<00:04:09.890> any<00:04:10.040> if<00:04:10.550> you<00:04:10.730> do<00:04:10.970> film<00:04:11.330> it<00:04:11.480> post
