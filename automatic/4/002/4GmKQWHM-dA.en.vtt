 Actually, it has been until morning 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:49.440
 I say that the holy knight of the Yu-Gi-Oh ! 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:55.720
 Men of the cool theme with their first theme 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:58.820
 The deck of the roadbed check with the 10 people I did not come up to the middle Good luck I 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.530
 Also I'd made up to the middle 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.330
 When we will eventually cause the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.730
 That deck is gone 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:12.690

 It takes 5 days and all kinds of roses and things in the room 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.830
 Just 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.539
 I'd been looking for all from the kotatsu from bed 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.490
 I did not 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:33.560
 so 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:39.020
 I forgot my family home and brought it back to my family home, so maybe it's a room from the New Year . 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 I wonder what shops are going to duel and other shops are not included 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.710
 Ne 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.659
 Mistake in the fact that this would be the house that is the uni-Tsu not 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.260
 I wonder if N ï½°ï½°ï½°ï½°you've thrown away in his turn to eat 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.979
 I think that's probably the case 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:58.020
 What 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:04.240
 You may think what kind of shit you are pushing into this great with a few cards 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.990
 In fact, it is a great variety of people to create a blue rare thin separate 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.960
 I was able to support you 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:14.020
 I made it 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:19.350
 I really got an attack car with a junior who I met in the dairy industry, and I borrowed that car for a long time 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:26.000
 I guess because not enter in his hand to buy the card went to family 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:29.580
 The administration Saint Swordsman Holy Knight after all that there are many dog cards 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.500
 Name How to sleep the dog of the card is not unobtainable 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.870
 Junior school student Yueko 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.810
 It says taking in various places 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.250
 I also found a card 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.020
 I would say that is great 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:50.990
 If it is a deck that I made alone I will probably search so much but I will really search 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:54.100
 It was a deck with a slightly different feeling than usual 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:59.040
 What can I that I not alone deck 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.520
 I made it with everyone and if I listened to it I would get sick for a while 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.970
 Well that's right 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:09.090
 Nde was what everyone in Good luck to say sash fit while making was as Holy Knight in Minna 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.090
 A little 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.330
 It's getting hot and I'm desperate to live and what is it? 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.770
 I did my best but I did not find it 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.349
 I can only say sorry to the friend who made me together with the raise regularity 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.860
 Maybe I can't find that I just can't find it 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.420
 What to put in the only some other deck case 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.710
 I think it was difficult to go- 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.960
 Bullish entered 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.610
 About the fabric deck 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:55.260
 Yes it is finished 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.430
 It will match in the feeling that it should be found someday, but basically it's already looking for 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.600
 There is no 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.400
 9 I can not move forward even if I move 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.090
 Receive their feelings too 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.170
 I 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.730
 I think I will be stronger 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.000
 and heart 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.000
 Ten
