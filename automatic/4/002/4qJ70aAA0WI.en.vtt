00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.310
 lower and game tv and cordial 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.980
 welcome to 23 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.139
 episode of our pack road to glory us 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.460
 Take a look at the exchange we made 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.179
 I have sold a lot. I will 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.040
 a little faster now 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.660
 otherwise it will take too long 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.580
 then give directly to the shop and 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.400
 draw our season ticket per month 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.109
 there we were or who was there 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.550
 always this is cam by the player 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.039
 not now it is a ms out of the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.439
 otherwise we still have Russian league 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.149
 a goalkeeper from toulouse contract 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.930
 cards of course we will 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.149
 also a bit faster 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.739
 do not make it too long 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.850
 lasts 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.500
 and then we are done so far 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.210
 we can do the rest with the pack 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.950
 actually take off broken take care of that 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.450
 not all tasci we already have and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.289
 then we start directly with the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.030
 next game 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.520
 we will be with the bundesliga team today 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.050
 I'm curious how the opponent 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.270
 will play and that is called the band ccc 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.500
 no idea what that name is me 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.230
 we would just have a look 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.070
 his team at brindisi means guessing 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.750
 352 series a-team pp palacio pandev 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.820
 cassini many games we have in 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.530
 our team in our series a team and 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.180
 then we start directly into the game 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.460
 He pulls the ball back 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.830
 then there on the left track elia the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.390
 Now make a few faxes here 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.400
 the ball back nicely with the waka waka 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.140
 of 18 opponents then there is still the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.670
 ball moves into the center but purely 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.920
 In the end, unfortunately , you lose the ball 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.420
 good skater from elia and was already in 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.950
 The second scene of the opponent is on the ball 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.810
 montolivo is pretty heavy from there 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.880
 to separate ball into the 16er rows 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.650
 closes then and there it rings 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.259
 the 0 1 by montolivo 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.790
 yes and then we come to the next one 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.979
 scene in the twentieth and then see 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.090
 We, unfortunately, here is the game 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.329
 been canceled 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.130
 yes, and then we see 236 coins here 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.180
 there is and if we are here now 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.070
 further click we also see directly 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.689
 that the game was not counted 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.579
 so no rating for this game 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.170
 We do not find defeat I think 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.189
 Also good as we still have all the chances 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.229
 have had 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.700
 to be able to decide the game for us 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.200
 why also directly with the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.259
 Bundesliga team continue to play 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.659
 our opponents found 442 bpl stands 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.429
 on it is in what is inside 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.959
 yes, many French people I would rather say 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.440
 but indeed actually play all 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.210
 at newcastle ardian to franz 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.310
 and then we start right in the 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.380
 first scene will be he plays freely with 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.970
 The roulette then tries it out 16 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.050
 meters but the ball is just missed 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.580
 just 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.350
 yes and then we are already in the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.030
 next scene elia with his skills 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.710
 pulls the ball back beautiful plays on there 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.630
 on sand of lexi times a bit too 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.230
 far in front of the opponent then has the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.330
 Ball plays down there to pull her and he 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.850
 then looks down there menez then gets 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.750
 and the ball and then responds with 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.540
 our account 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.560
 Unfortunately we did not discuss 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.430
 and then we also see the right here 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.500
 Cancel modification and ik gate is on 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.880
 Yes, the least has been reset 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.120
 that means we get less coins 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.100
 we still sold something and 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.630
 then we will go directly to the next one 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.220
 looking for opponents and all good things are 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.870
 yes, we know that's why we're playing three 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.470
 directly again with our bundesliga 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.240
 team 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.460
 our opponent is found we are looking 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:08.500
 Sometimes his team looks like this 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.960
 43 21 torres nani gb valencia hard in 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.850
 gate and then it starts right in 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.590
 the first scene gets the akura den 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.360
 ball plays with the hoe to elia and 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.820
 The fails on shiny parrying 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.530
 Goalkeeper The corner comes from Kadlec in the 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.690
 16er one does not really know what 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.700
 What a tug there in 16 players 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.080
 can then initiate in counter with nani 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.209
 he pulls the ball back briefly 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.160
 take gb to free himself he gets 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.080
 then there's the ball because elia just 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.720
 the estimates then plays nice to 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.340
 valencia and a bit zloty though 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.040
 what do you want to do there it is then 0 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.570
 to 1 valencia makes the first hit 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.030
 and then I thought I'd turn around 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.530
 on 4-2-3-1 I'll just come in 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.390
 a little better clear now in the backlog 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.250
 you just need that, we need it 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.320
 victory we want to continue to rise 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.780
 so let's try 42 31 now 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.610
 are already in the 28 minute elia 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.380
 get the ball on our asset 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.540
 the left side pulls the ball that 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.700
 beautiful Gündogan to the side then gets there 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.100
 He draws the ball with the sculptures 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.840
 ball back then plays on helmes 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.489
 unfortunately it is in the offside thus is 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.260
 the chance was dashed in the 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.239
 next scene helmes gets the ball 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.940
 then pulls past the defender 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.280
 is on the way in the 16er grossed 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.169
 from no he is not a trekkie player he 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.090
 just has the skill he just has 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.060
 everything in the 40 minute ring 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.270
 then to the 1 1 equalizer through 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.250
 patrick helmes the goalkeeper has only there 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.169
 we get into the second half ya 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.330
 Konan on the ball passes everyone 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.919
 plays so van de velde loses the short 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.020
 ball gets him then but again 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.569
 bring the flank in and there is sam 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.250
 the head ball on the gate but the 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.080
 Goalkeeper can parry again 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.370
 then even the opponent is on 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.050
 ball what a long short 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.490
 deflected but the goalkeeper powerless 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.259
 There was no chance for him 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.960
 and the margin is there but in 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.460
 offside are then already in the 63 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.199
 minute the ball comes under subordinate 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.650
 Tasci um makes the lead 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.180
 two to one by serdar tasci 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.490
 beautiful header rises 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.770

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.210

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.599
 with sidney sam 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.849
 He plays helmets helmes again 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:12.360
 is on the way to the important 3 too 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.099
 1 helmiss fails the keeper would have the 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.650
 just have to clean the ball but still 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:19.590
 gets the ball back then pulls along 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.509
 Simply wash the opponents of the window 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.789
 then brings in the flank again 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.830
 and there is the coming but come 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.719
 not for the header and gündogan makes 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.780
 that's just too weak for us 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:33.030
 are then in the 74 minutes one of the 72 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.190
 minute gates starts by then tries 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.259

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.270

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.340

 he makes the goal cheering from didier drogba 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.909
 his namesake still sees us 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.190
 something for a comfortable graduation 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.990
 how messi did that with that 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.759
 aviation no chance for the goalkeeper 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.469
 and then the game is over 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.830
 referee whistles we win 3 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:12.750

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.639
 Patrick Helmes Rensing also has 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.770
 we are outstanding again 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:21.810
 Tasci will be the player of the day away 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:23.400
 get 528 coins for this victory and 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.590
 in total , we now have nine points there 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.069
 the three of us through this victory to get 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.960
 to have 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.969
 Finally, I would like to return 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.680
 say that we really are me again 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:32.969
 I had two weeks break 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.649
 that bugs me a bit, too 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:36.240
 I have a lot to do, too 

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:37.710
 in school and so on 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.330
 I will try the consequences now 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.650
 continue around the six seven minutes 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.940
 to do about 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.949
 I know that maybe it's not like that 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.419
 great for you but after all, the 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:47.520
 then hopefully follow every second 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.780
 sweating come every fourth day 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.699
 so you also have something to look 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.960
 I then try to do that 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:53.729
 she really has something to look for 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.620
