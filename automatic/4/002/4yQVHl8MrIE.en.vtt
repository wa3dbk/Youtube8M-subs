00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.169 

I<00:00:00.620> love<00:00:01.620> these<00:00:01.890> amazing<00:00:02.399> plants<00:00:02.850> they<00:00:03.149> are

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
I love these amazing plants they are

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.180 
I love these amazing plants they are
collectively<00:00:03.689> known<00:00:03.810> as<00:00:04.020> bromeliads<00:00:04.920> and

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
collectively known as bromeliads and

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.039 
collectively known as bromeliads and
whilst<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:05.700> can<00:00:05.850> find<00:00:06.180> them<00:00:06.359> in<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.629> garden

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
whilst you can find them in a garden

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.140 
whilst you can find them in a garden
you're<00:00:07.560> much<00:00:07.950> more<00:00:08.189> likely<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.639> find<00:00:08.730> them

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
you're much more likely to find them

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.089 
you're much more likely to find them
growing<00:00:09.420> on<00:00:09.599> an<00:00:09.690> old<00:00:09.900> log<00:00:10.200> or<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.650> fork<00:00:10.980> of

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
growing on an old log or in the fork of

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.970 
growing on an old log or in the fork of
a<00:00:11.190> tree<00:00:11.400> trunk<00:00:11.639> in<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.179> wild<00:00:12.570> they're<00:00:13.530> one<00:00:13.830> of

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
a tree trunk in the wild they're one of

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.160 
a tree trunk in the wild they're one of
the<00:00:14.130> great<00:00:14.519> survivors<00:00:15.089> having<00:00:15.420> evolved<00:00:15.929> over

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
the great survivors having evolved over

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.170 
the great survivors having evolved over
millions<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.800> years<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.400> they<00:00:17.820> hold

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
millions of years and they hold

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.900 
millions of years and they hold
rainwater<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.619> well<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.430> heart<00:00:20.730> of

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
rainwater in this well in the heart of

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.970 
rainwater in this well in the heart of
the<00:00:21.029> plant<00:00:21.300> not<00:00:21.779> only<00:00:21.900> does<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.080> hold<00:00:22.529> water

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the plant not only does it hold water

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.040 
the plant not only does it hold water
but<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.279> also<00:00:23.490> captures<00:00:24.390> leaf<00:00:24.630> litter<00:00:24.869> as<00:00:24.960> it

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
but it also captures leaf litter as it

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.359 
but it also captures leaf litter as it
falls<00:00:25.260> down<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.650> provides<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.130> plant

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
falls down and this provides the plant

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.250 
falls down and this provides the plant
the<00:00:26.519> nutrients<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> needs<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.779> grow<00:00:28.019> and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the nutrients it needs to grow and

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.189 
the nutrients it needs to grow and
survive<00:00:28.939> most<00:00:29.939> brahms<00:00:30.330> are<00:00:30.630> purchased<00:00:31.080> in

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
survive most brahms are purchased in

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.840 
survive most brahms are purchased in
pots<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.710> these<00:00:31.890> guys<00:00:32.130> which<00:00:32.489> are<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.700> more

I've picked it up popped it into the
back<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> Ute<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.140> as<00:00:55.230> I've<00:00:55.350> been<00:00:55.500> doing

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
back of the Ute and as I've been doing

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.590 
back of the Ute and as I've been doing
it<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.309> guy<00:00:56.550> who's<00:00:56.789> placed<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.210> taking<00:00:57.539> it

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
it the guy who's placed on taking it

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.209 
it the guy who's placed on taking it
from<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.079> shaking<00:00:58.530> his<00:00:58.620> head<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:58.859> these

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
muttering this is pure gold because I

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.270 
muttering this is pure gold because I
knew<00:01:03.629> what<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.170> good<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.530> I've

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
knew what it's going to be good for I've

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.250 
knew what it's going to be good for I've
brought<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.760> home<00:01:05.939> popped<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.630> into<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.869> pot<00:01:07.049> pop

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
brought it home popped it into a pot pop

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.080 
brought it home popped it into a pot pop
some<00:01:07.439> concrete<00:01:07.770> around<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> base<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.970> it's

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
some concrete around the base so it's

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.980 
some concrete around the base so it's
now<00:01:09.240> nice<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.570> secure<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.350> ready<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.990> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
now nice and secure and ready to go the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.570 
now nice and secure and ready to go the
next<00:01:13.140> stage<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.619> tying<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> plants<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
next stage is tying the plants to the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
next stage is tying the plants to the
tree's<00:01:14.850> bark<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:15.720> there's<00:01:15.900> no<00:01:16.049> adding

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
tree's bark now there's no adding

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.050 
tree's bark now there's no adding
potting<00:01:16.860> mix<00:01:17.040> here<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.790> not

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
potting mix here that's just not

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.910 
potting mix here that's just not
necessary<00:01:18.540> these<00:01:18.689> plants<00:01:19.140> use<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> moisture

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
necessary these plants use the moisture

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.039 
necessary these plants use the moisture
and<00:01:20.040> organics<00:01:20.640> from<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> bark<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.600> sustain

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
and organics from the bark to sustain

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.080 
and organics from the bark to sustain
them<00:01:22.229> initially<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:23.159> they<00:01:23.310> cling<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.820> I'll

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
them initially and as they cling on I'll

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.060 
them initially and as they cling on I'll
add<00:01:24.330> some<00:01:24.630> seaweed<00:01:24.930> extract<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.619> sustain

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
add some seaweed extract to sustain

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.910 
add some seaweed extract to sustain
their<00:01:26.340> growth<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:27.390> time<00:01:27.840> each<00:01:28.140> plant<00:01:28.650> will

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
their growth with time each plant will

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.190 
their growth with time each plant will
throw<00:01:29.159> out<00:01:29.340> pups<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:30.000> runners<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.540> enhance

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
throw out pups on runners and enhance

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.460 
throw out pups on runners and enhance
the<00:01:31.380> overall<00:01:31.500> effect<00:01:33.110> now<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> trick<00:01:34.439> with

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the overall effect now the trick with

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.870 
the overall effect now the trick with
the<00:01:34.740> tree<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> get<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.700> much

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
the tree like this is to get as much
