00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.630
 good morning, my name is accounts 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.559
 stefano or this company in the municipality of 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.109
 candia lomellina a company 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.890
 mainly ridiculously cultivated 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.570
 my company is a company of around 100 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.699
 ha 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.310
 as I said cultivated for 90 per 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.019
 hundred has rice is a 10 percent that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.399
 varies in cultures in dry corn grain 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:38.040
 in recent years mainly wheat 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:41.100
 bread maker from a fleet of 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.550
 all five family tractors 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.860
 john deere to whom I am very attached 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.250
 because over the years we have found in 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.210
 these cars 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.960
 the best for our needs 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.600
 for when it concerns the last purchase 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.030
 we have done in the company I have to say 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.980
 that I am very excited about this 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.070
 machine for what worked 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.030
 this year I was thrilled in all the 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.330
 senses 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.869
 starting from the power consumption that 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.140
 they have been reduced compared to the others 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:21.399
 I can greatly tell you it had done 200 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:26.080
 220 perches with less than one full with a 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:28.899
 5-meter roster then in comparison 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.970
 those I used before also i 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.240
 consumption has been reduced 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.490
 the power as I said is expressed at 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:44.470
 maximum indeed never came to use it 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:47.500
 completely and then another point that 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.820
 me and it really fills me is the way 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.040
 the cockpit was designed with 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.290
 all that is above me 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.350
 lets see even if I'm not 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.040
 a giant from any part of the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:08.319
 Glazing all the controls in place 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:11.410
 of the crops clearly visible and also from the point 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.780
 of view just like a real cabin 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.170
 business and whenever it has this 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.680
 one excites me more and more the fact 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.190
 that the machine is better in all 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.190
 points of view
