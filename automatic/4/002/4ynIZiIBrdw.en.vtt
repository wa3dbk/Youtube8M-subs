going<00:05:00.100> to<00:05:00.220> save<00:05:00.460> your<00:05:00.810> firmware<00:05:02.940> all<00:05:03.940> right<00:05:04.180> so

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
going to save your firmware all right so

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.330 
going to save your firmware all right so
exit<00:05:04.840> out<00:05:04.960> of<00:05:04.990> there<00:05:05.320> then<00:05:06.010> we're<00:05:06.130> going<00:05:06.220> to

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
exit out of there then we're going to

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.740 
exit out of there then we're going to
open<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.699> flash<00:05:06.970> utility<00:05:08.310> exe<00:05:09.310> file<00:05:09.750> make

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
open the flash utility exe file make

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.600 
open the flash utility exe file make
sure<00:05:10.960> we<00:05:11.080> have<00:05:11.229> the<00:05:11.410> highest<00:05:11.500> Rajas<00:05:12.310> drive

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
sure we have the highest Rajas drive

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.760 
sure we have the highest Rajas drive
selected<00:05:13.180> and<00:05:13.419> then<00:05:13.449> we're<00:05:14.050> going<00:05:14.139> to<00:05:14.229> back<00:05:14.590> up

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
selected and then we're going to back up

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.950 
selected and then we're going to back up
this<00:05:15.090> firmware<00:05:16.090> so<00:05:16.600> we'll<00:05:17.080> do<00:05:17.229> read<00:05:17.470> flash<00:05:17.830> and

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
this firmware so we'll do read flash and

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.580 
this firmware so we'll do read flash and
then<00:05:19.960> same<00:05:20.289> thing<00:05:21.150> we<00:05:22.150> will<00:05:22.449> save<00:05:23.199> it<00:05:23.229> in<00:05:23.560> the

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
then same thing we will save it in the

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.860 
then same thing we will save it in the
eeprom<00:05:24.130> back<00:05:24.789> up<00:05:25.000> whatever<00:05:25.270> somewhere<00:05:27.870> and

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
eeprom back up whatever somewhere and

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:35.310 
eeprom back up whatever somewhere and
I'll<00:05:29.020> basically<00:05:30.870> back<00:05:31.870> that<00:05:32.110> up<00:05:32.139> take<00:05:34.229> 10<00:05:35.229> to

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
I'll basically back that up take 10 to

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:43.140 
I'll basically back that up take 10 to
20<00:05:35.650> seconds<00:05:36.100> to<00:05:36.190> do<00:05:36.340> that<00:05:41.100> alright<00:05:42.100> so<00:05:42.729> those

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
20 seconds to do that alright so those

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.730 
20 seconds to do that alright so those
exit<00:05:44.039> you<00:05:45.039> start<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.490> flask<00:05:45.729> utility<00:05:46.740> now

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
exit you start the flask utility now

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.379 
exit you start the flask utility now
we're<00:05:47.860> going<00:05:47.950> to<00:05:48.010> flash<00:05:48.340> with<00:05:48.669> this<00:05:48.880> e<00:05:49.030> forever

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
we're going to flash with this e forever

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.589 
we're going to flash with this e forever
uh<00:05:49.889> firmware<00:05:50.889> so<00:05:51.340> confirm<00:05:51.789> the<00:05:51.910> drives<00:05:52.180> there

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
uh firmware so confirm the drives there

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:56.640 
uh firmware so confirm the drives there
then<00:05:53.590> we're<00:05:53.680> going<00:05:53.770> to<00:05:53.860> do<00:05:54.010> right<00:05:54.460> flash<00:05:55.650> or

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
then we're going to do right flash or

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:03.719 
then we're going to do right flash or
you<00:05:56.919> slip<00:05:57.160> the<00:05:57.280> car<00:05:57.520> drive<00:05:57.849> yes<00:05:59.340> alright<00:06:02.729> so

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
you slip the car drive yes alright so

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.120 
you slip the car drive yes alright so
you<00:06:03.820> want<00:06:03.940> to<00:06:04.000> proceed<00:06:04.330> yeah<00:06:04.889> now<00:06:05.889> we're<00:06:06.039> going

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
you want to proceed yeah now we're going

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.310 
you want to proceed yeah now we're going
to<00:06:06.190> basically<00:06:09.330> pull<00:06:10.330> up<00:06:10.450> that<00:06:10.599> the<00:06:10.840> firmware

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
to basically pull up that the firmware

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.980 
to basically pull up that the firmware
so<00:06:11.650> basically<00:06:12.130> go<00:06:12.310> back<00:06:12.340> into<00:06:12.699> the<00:06:12.990> folder

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
so basically go back into the folder

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.830 
so basically go back into the folder
that<00:06:14.020> it<00:06:14.470> corresponds<00:06:15.370> to<00:06:15.520> your<00:06:15.610> drive<00:06:15.880> so<00:06:15.910> 524

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
that it corresponds to your drive so 524

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.170 
that it corresponds to your drive so 524
be<00:06:17.020> in<00:06:17.650> our<00:06:17.770> case<00:06:18.039> and<00:06:18.310> then<00:06:18.820> we<00:06:18.880> want<00:06:19.090> to

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
be in our case and then we want to

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.480 
be in our case and then we want to
basically<00:06:19.539> select<00:06:20.080> this<00:06:20.289> file<00:06:20.560> this<00:06:20.830> I<00:06:21.039> has<00:06:21.220> 5

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
to flash this drive this is the firmware

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.230 
to flash this drive this is the firmware
i<00:06:31.750> just<00:06:31.990> confirm<00:06:32.380> everything's<00:06:32.740> the<00:06:32.860> same<00:06:33.240> 524

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
then now it's flashing the drive just

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.050 
then now it's flashing the drive just
let<00:06:41.860> it<00:06:41.979> go<00:06:42.010> the<00:06:42.340> completely<00:06:42.760> done<00:06:43.030> with

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
let it go the completely done with

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.180 
let it go the completely done with
flashing<00:06:43.780> you'll<00:06:43.930> want<00:06:44.139> to<00:06:44.229> restart<00:06:44.740> your

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
flashing you'll want to restart your

flashing you'll want to restart your
computer<00:06:45.870> just<00:06:46.870> so<00:06:47.050> the<00:06:47.169> new<00:06:47.289> dr<00:06:47.590> registers

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
computer just so the new dr registers

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.700 
computer just so the new dr registers
properly

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.790 

alright<00:06:52.710> so<00:06:53.160> now<00:06:53.310> it's<00:06:53.550> been<00:06:53.760> it's<00:06:54.150> complete

your computer once just a beach deuces
be<00:07:03.030> safe<00:07:03.300> um<00:07:03.570> and<00:07:04.140> then<00:07:04.380> once<00:07:04.620> you've<00:07:05.570> rebooted

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
be safe um and then once you've rebooted

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.710 
be safe um and then once you've rebooted
the<00:07:06.720> machine<00:07:07.400> you<00:07:08.400> can<00:07:08.580> open<00:07:08.910> up<00:07:09.030> my<00:07:09.480> computer

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 
the machine you can open up my computer

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.770 
the machine you can open up my computer
and<00:07:11.600> throw<00:07:12.600> in<00:07:12.810> a<00:07:14.180> dual-layer<00:07:15.180> discs<00:07:15.510> and

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 
and throw in a dual-layer discs and

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.210 
and throw in a dual-layer discs and
you'll<00:07:15.930> see<00:07:16.140> it<00:07:16.230> come<00:07:16.440> up<00:07:16.620> as<00:07:17.540> DV<00:07:18.540> right<00:07:18.890> 8.1<00:07:19.890> 3

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 
you'll see it come up as DV right 8.1 3

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.190 
you'll see it come up as DV right 8.1 3
gigabytes<00:07:20.550> so<00:07:21.300> that's<00:07:21.540> how<00:07:21.720> you<00:07:21.780> know<00:07:21.990> it's

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.200 
gigabytes so that's how you know it's

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.830 
gigabytes so that's how you know it's
basically<00:07:22.560> flashes<00:07:23.220> is<00:07:23.910> working<00:07:24.390> and<00:07:24.570> the

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 
basically flashes is working and the

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.610 
basically flashes is working and the
drive<00:07:25.170> is<00:07:25.200> now<00:07:25.500> reading<00:07:26.210> correctly<00:07:27.590> so<00:07:28.590> that

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 
drive is now reading correctly so that

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.570 
drive is now reading correctly so that
concludes<00:07:29.220> this<00:07:29.550> tutorial<00:07:29.610> hope<00:07:30.150> you<00:07:30.300> enjoy
