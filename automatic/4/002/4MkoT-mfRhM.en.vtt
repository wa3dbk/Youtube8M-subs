00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
supposed to go around and they missed it

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.150 
supposed to go around and they missed it
pretty<00:00:34.620> good

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
pretty good

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.990 
pretty good
the<00:00:35.520> other<00:00:35.670> ones<00:00:35.880> are<00:00:36.090> okay<00:00:37.370> but<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:40.610> also<00:00:41.610> said

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the other ones are okay but I also said

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.510 
the other ones are okay but I also said
that<00:00:42.030> these<00:00:42.420> fillers<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> neck<00:00:43.620> or<00:00:44.219> there

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
that these fillers on the neck or there

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.590 
that these fillers on the neck or there
was<00:00:44.640> fillers<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:46.559> neck

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
was fillers on the the neck

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.139 
was fillers on the the neck
the<00:00:48.600> closer<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.079> look<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.469> those<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.129> think<00:00:50.700> it's

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the closer I look at those I think it's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.110 
the closer I look at those I think it's
just<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.690> way<00:00:51.809> they<00:00:51.989> cut<00:00:52.289> them<00:00:52.910> it's<00:00:53.910> not

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
just the way they cut them it's not

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.959 
just the way they cut them it's not
actually<00:00:54.629> filler<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:59.670> know<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.789> think

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
actually filler but you know I think

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.959 
actually filler but you know I think
it's<00:01:00.239> pretty<00:01:00.570> good<00:01:00.809> banjo<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> price<00:01:02.579> for

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it's pretty good banjo for the price for

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.810 
it's pretty good banjo for the price for
the<00:01:03.030> money<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:05.760> certainly<00:01:06.150> doesn't<00:01:06.450> sound<00:01:06.810> as

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
the money it certainly doesn't sound as

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
the money it certainly doesn't sound as
chirpy<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:08.850> metallic<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> lot<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.260> I

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
chirpy and metallic is a lot of I

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
chirpy and metallic is a lot of I
shouldn't<00:01:11.520> say<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> lot<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.939> play<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.360> many

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
shouldn't say a lot of play that many
