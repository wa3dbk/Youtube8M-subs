on so we have to give you something that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.530 
on so we have to give you something that
really<00:01:46.979> stands<00:01:47.340> out<00:01:47.580> and<00:01:47.640> makes<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.030> go<00:01:48.060> wow<00:01:48.150> I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.660 
really stands out and makes you go wow I
want<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.810> buy<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.020> when<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> silks<00:01:50.430> start

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
want to buy this when the silks start

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.230 
want to buy this when the silks start
turning<00:01:50.970> brown

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
turning brown

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.330 
turning brown
that<00:01:51.630> means<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.320> starting<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> become<00:01:52.979> time

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
that means it's starting to become time

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.980 
that means it's starting to become time
there<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.790> getting<00:01:53.909> its<00:01:54.119> color<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.659> it's

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
there it's getting its color and it's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.300 
there it's getting its color and it's
probably<00:01:55.409> start<00:01:55.650> getting<00:01:55.740> its<00:01:55.950> flavor<00:01:56.159> so

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
probably start getting its flavor so

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
probably start getting its flavor so
usually<00:01:56.640> every<00:01:56.790> couple<00:01:57.420> days<00:01:57.570> we'll<00:01:57.869> pull<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
usually every couple days we'll pull a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.140 
usually every couple days we'll pull a
couple<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.770> years<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.159> trial<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.700> see<00:01:59.880> we'll

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
couple of years for trial and see we'll

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.359 
couple of years for trial and see we'll
peel<00:02:00.330> it<00:02:00.479> back<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.840> see<00:02:01.530> how<00:02:01.590> far<00:02:01.830> along<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.250> is

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
peel it back and see how far along it is

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.160 
peel it back and see how far along it is
because<00:02:03.000> usually<00:02:03.299> an<00:02:03.420> ear<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.570> corn<00:02:03.659> will<00:02:03.960> fill

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
because usually an ear of corn will fill

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.510 
because usually an ear of corn will fill
out<00:02:04.350> from<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> bottom<00:02:04.920> up

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
out from the bottom up

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.310 
out from the bottom up
so<00:02:05.850> if<00:02:05.970> ear<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.479> corn<00:02:06.659> isn't<00:02:06.930> quite<00:02:07.049> ready<00:02:07.200> yet

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
so if ear of corn isn't quite ready yet

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.859 
so if ear of corn isn't quite ready yet
the<00:02:07.740> color<00:02:08.189> will<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.819> white<00:02:09.000> towards<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.689> top

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
the color will be white towards the top

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.029 
the color will be white towards the top
so<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.110> not<00:02:10.200> quite<00:02:10.379> filled<00:02:10.679> out<00:02:10.799> yet<00:02:10.950> it

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
so it's not quite filled out yet it

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.920 
so it's not quite filled out yet it
still<00:02:11.129> needs<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.400> couple<00:02:11.669> days<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:12.060> go<00:02:12.689> out<00:02:12.840> in

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
still needs a couple days I go out in

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.390 
still needs a couple days I go out in
the<00:02:12.989> field<00:02:13.200> every<00:02:13.499> morning<00:02:13.829> I<00:02:13.919> peel<00:02:14.159> in<00:02:14.279> ear

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
the field every morning I peel in ear

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.099 
the field every morning I peel in ear
back<00:02:14.639> and<00:02:14.909> eat<00:02:15.029> it<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.329> want<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.569> see<00:02:15.779> how<00:02:15.930> it's

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:16.109 
back and eat it I want to see how it's

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:17.110 
back and eat it I want to see how it's
run<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.529> day

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
run that day

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.570 
run that day
flavor<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.629> day<00:02:18.049> that's<00:02:19.010> my<00:02:19.190> favorite

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
flavor is that day that's my favorite

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.339 
flavor is that day that's my favorite
has<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.849> most<00:02:20.000> flavor<00:02:20.269> in<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.930> before<00:02:21.110> you

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
has the most flavor in it before you

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.670 
has the most flavor in it before you
cook<00:02:21.500> it

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
cook it

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.899 
cook it
