the way around it

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.000 
the way around it
the<00:01:18.140> next<00:01:18.470> step<00:01:18.710> is<00:01:19.550> to<00:01:19.840> pull<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:21.020> I<00:01:21.229> use<00:01:21.860> the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
the next step is to pull it I use the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.040 
the next step is to pull it I use the
grass<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.520> just<00:01:22.670> lift<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.120> gently<00:01:23.479> folding<00:01:23.960> it

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
grass and just lift it gently folding it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.380 
grass and just lift it gently folding it
back<00:01:24.080> onto<00:01:24.620> the<00:01:25.370> ground<00:01:25.610> if<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.060> are<00:01:26.150> in<00:01:26.300> the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
back onto the ground if you are in the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.790 
back onto the ground if you are in the
middle<00:01:26.600> of<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:26.750> yard<00:01:26.960> it<00:01:27.200> would<00:01:27.290> be<00:01:27.409> on<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.680> the

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
middle of the yard it would be on to the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.710 
middle of the yard it would be on to the
grass<00:01:28.040> or<00:01:28.400> like<00:01:29.030> here<00:01:29.450> onto<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:29.990> sidewalk<00:01:31.720> the

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
grass or like here onto the sidewalk the

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.859 
grass or like here onto the sidewalk the
next<00:01:33.080> step<00:01:33.320> is<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:34.100> remove<00:01:34.219> the<00:01:35.060> dirt<00:01:35.420> around

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
next step is to remove the dirt around

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.289 
next step is to remove the dirt around
the<00:01:36.259> from<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.770> base<00:01:37.009> of<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.610> sprinkler<00:01:38.000> I<00:01:38.060> use

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
the from the base of the sprinkler I use

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.859 
the from the base of the sprinkler I use
a<00:01:38.329> spade<00:01:38.840> as<00:01:39.140> you<00:01:39.680> see<00:01:39.829> here<00:01:40.149> to<00:01:41.149> help<00:01:41.329> dig<00:01:41.659> that

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
a spade as you see here to help dig that

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.789 
a spade as you see here to help dig that
dirt<00:01:42.170> out<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:44.450> won't<00:01:44.719> be<00:01:44.899> loose<00:01:45.200> down<00:01:45.500> there

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
dirt out this won't be loose down there

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.039 
dirt out this won't be loose down there
so<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:46.039> spade<00:01:46.399> helps<00:01:46.759> to<00:01:46.939> dig<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:47.360> away<00:01:47.539> from<00:01:47.840> the

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
so a spade helps to dig it away from the

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.550 
so a spade helps to dig it away from the
sprinkler<00:01:49.539> you'll<00:01:50.539> need<00:01:50.719> to<00:01:50.810> go<00:01:50.930> down<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.439> the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
sprinkler you'll need to go down to the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.069 
sprinkler you'll need to go down to the
base<00:01:51.770> some<00:01:52.159> of<00:01:52.189> them<00:01:52.520> are<00:01:53.000> deeper<00:01:53.539> than<00:01:53.689> others

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
base some of them are deeper than others

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.770 
base some of them are deeper than others
you<00:01:54.649> can<00:01:54.829> have<00:01:55.070> for<00:01:55.909> example<00:01:55.939> a<00:01:56.329> three-inch

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
you can have for example a three-inch

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.410 
you can have for example a three-inch
sprinkler<00:01:57.320> or<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.590> four-inch<00:01:58.250> sprinkler<00:01:58.789> that

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
sprinkler or a four-inch sprinkler that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.289 
sprinkler or a four-inch sprinkler that
also<00:01:59.689> helps<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:00.289> raise<00:02:01.039> or<00:02:01.369> lower<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:01.820> height

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
also helps you raise or lower the height

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.179 
also helps you raise or lower the height
of<00:02:02.570> your<00:02:02.780> sprinkler<00:02:03.229> if<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.530> need<00:02:03.799> one<00:02:04.009> that's

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
a little closer to the surface you can

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.120 
a little closer to the surface you can
put<00:02:07.549> a<00:02:07.579> taller<00:02:07.880> sprinkler<00:02:08.479> if<00:02:09.440> it's<00:02:09.649> too<00:02:09.920> tall

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
put a taller sprinkler if it's too tall

sprinkler can sink down and the hole

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.950 
sprinkler can sink down and the hole
will<00:03:53.490> become<00:03:53.880> smaller

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
will become smaller

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.280 
will become smaller
just<00:03:55.770> from<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.250> settling<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.880> soil<00:03:57.420> so
