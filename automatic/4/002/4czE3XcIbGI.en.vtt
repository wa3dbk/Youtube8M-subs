00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.680
 Do you need a battery? 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.110

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.790
 then what you will need 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.600

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:35.090

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:38.549

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.799

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.799
 two items the hand you will make 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:54.710
 the goal in the shot 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.890
 Control question here I come here in 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:03.829
 trance in pa 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.850
 I'm giving legal functional control and 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.969
 Oh my friend 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.340
 sky is the limit you can kill yourself 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.560
 playing only remembering that this indicates 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.629
 works you can call your the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.340
 control through just the car you 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.890
 can win on leaving any center 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.940
 west 6 up from xbox the year claiming pc 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.489
 notebook 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.360
 if you were to accept it and to take 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.220
 software 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.640
 so dude its a cool tip but I 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.290
 I can say I 'm not an expert but I'm not 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.860
 I recommend using it for a long time 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.829
 so it 's a tip in a moment of 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.359
 desperation will even burn a control 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.750
 prolonged use 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:47.720
 I do not know, I do not know the season. 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.299
 charger amperage is the same without there 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.690
 recover and is the same control 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.700
 You, I 'm not an electrician, so I want to. 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.310
 my advice is to complement the box 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.840
 but if we go it is necessary and 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.579
 enough to see that moment what 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.459
 You need to finish the game that time, right? 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.560
 this tip so elongated that's it 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.150
 I hope this rich has been 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.590
 valuable to you 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.590
 thanks for the next
