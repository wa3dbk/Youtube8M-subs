00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.429 
little things are called now up top my
head<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.900> put<00:01:16.020> them<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:16.409> just

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
head but you put them in there then just

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.429 
head but you put them in there then just
gonna<00:01:16.710> pop<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> emblem<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:18.439> can't

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
gonna pop the emblem in and I can't

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.600 
gonna pop the emblem in and I can't
imagine<00:01:19.500> how<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.130> perfect<00:01:20.460> dance

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
imagine how you have to perfect dance

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.950

just<00:01:20.790> right<00:01:20.939> there<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.390> I'm<00:01:21.479> assuming<00:01:21.720> if

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
just right there and so I'm assuming if

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.490 
just right there and so I'm assuming if
they<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.439> emblem<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:22.860> pounded<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:24.500> that's

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
they they emblem was pounded on that's

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.749 
they they emblem was pounded on that's
what<00:01:25.619> caused<00:01:25.830> those<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.400> when<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.549> pull<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
what caused those and so when I pull the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.270 
what caused those and so when I pull the
fender<00:01:27.030> back<00:01:27.180> off<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:28.560> get<00:01:28.710> behind<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
fender back off I can get behind it to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.469 
fender back off I can get behind it to
end<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.640> hammer<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:29.970> dolly<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.329> kind

inner Dickey in when I was doing the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.609 
inner Dickey in when I was doing the
work<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.540> vendor<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.899> had<00:01:46.049> welded<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.439> all

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
work on this vendor I had welded up all

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.639 
work on this vendor I had welded up all
of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> emblem<00:01:47.490> holes<00:01:47.670> except<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.180> one

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
of the emblem holes except this one

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.810 
of the emblem holes except this one
because<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> emblem<00:01:50.100> was<00:01:50.220> drilled<00:01:50.460> crooked

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
because the emblem was drilled crooked

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.630 
because the emblem was drilled crooked
always<00:01:51.329> kind<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.600> leaned<00:01:51.780> funny<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.610> I

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
always kind of leaned funny and so I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.100 
always kind of leaned funny and so I
drilled<00:01:54.000> pre-drilled<00:01:54.570> those<00:01:54.689> damn<00:01:54.869> blooms

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
drilled pre-drilled those damn blooms

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.359 
drilled pre-drilled those damn blooms
and<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.320> course<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.619> drilled<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.009> one<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
and of course I drilled this one in the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.160 
and of course I drilled this one in the
wrong<00:01:56.490> spot<00:01:56.880> slightly<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.780> had<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.930> weld

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
wrong spot slightly it so I had to weld

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.429 
wrong spot slightly it so I had to weld
it<00:01:58.350> back<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.950> then<00:01:59.009> read<00:01:59.520> drill<00:01:59.759> it<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:01.200> so

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
it back up and then read drill it and so

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.819 
it back up and then read drill it and so
I'll<00:02:01.590> me<00:02:01.710> too

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
I'll me too

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.170 
I'll me too
put<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.430> little<00:02:03.520> blaze<00:02:03.729> or<00:02:03.909> something<00:02:04.119> right

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
put a little blaze or something right

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.670 
put a little blaze or something right
there<00:02:04.450> if<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:04.990> look<00:02:05.140> right<00:02:05.229> there<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.560> can

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
there if you look right there you can

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.630 
there if you look right there you can
see<00:02:05.799> there<00:02:05.920> was<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.040> low<00:02:06.189> spot<00:02:06.430> right<00:02:06.579> there

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
see there was a low spot right there

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.410 
see there was a low spot right there
anyhow

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
anyhow

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.900 
anyhow
and<00:02:07.810> so<00:02:07.960> I<00:02:08.020> didn't<00:02:08.170> take<00:02:08.289> care<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.500> that<00:02:08.679> but

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
and so I didn't take care of that but

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.990 
and so I didn't take care of that but
all<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.060> all<00:02:10.149> this<00:02:10.330> fender<00:02:10.630> looks<00:02:11.110> like<00:02:11.290> it

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
all in all this fender looks like it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.760 
all in all this fender looks like it
it's<00:02:13.000> pretty<00:02:13.270> good<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:14.020> is<00:02:14.080> just<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.440> foxy

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
it's pretty good and this is just a foxy

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.500 
it's pretty good and this is just a foxy
primer<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.370> think<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.640> put<00:02:15.790> two<00:02:15.910> coats<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.180> epoxy

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
primer I think I put two coats of epoxy

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.670 
primer I think I put two coats of epoxy
on<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.840> particular<00:02:19.840> epoxy<00:02:20.500> hides

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
on it and so this particular epoxy hides

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.040 
on it and so this particular epoxy hides
nothing<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.760> matrix<00:02:22.000> step<00:02:22.390> was<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:22.959> I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
nothing that a matrix step was that I

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.229 
nothing that a matrix step was that I
was<00:02:23.170> using<00:02:23.349> on<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:24.430> rest<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.819> car<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.030> mean

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
was using on the rest of the car I mean

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.479 
was using on the rest of the car I mean
it<00:02:25.390> would<00:02:25.510> actually<00:02:26.040> feel<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.099> don't<00:02:27.370> know<00:02:27.430> if

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
it would actually feel I don't know if

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.770 
it would actually feel I don't know if
it<00:02:27.580> was<00:02:27.640> designed<00:02:27.970> for<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.209> or<00:02:28.360> not<00:02:28.450> but<00:02:28.720> it

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
it was designed for that or not but it

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.750 
it was designed for that or not but it
would<00:02:29.650> recover<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.130> lot<00:02:30.250> better<00:02:30.430> than<00:02:30.640> this

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
would recover a lot better than this

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.650 
would recover a lot better than this
darker<00:02:31.390> color<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:31.780> is<00:02:31.930> some<00:02:32.110> Custom<00:02:32.500> Shop

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
darker color this is some Custom Shop

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.120 
darker color this is some Custom Shop
and<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:34.930> don't<00:02:34.989> honestly<00:02:35.560> think<00:02:35.769> I<00:02:35.980> would

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
and I don't honestly think I would

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.120 
and I don't honestly think I would
probably<00:02:36.250> buy<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.640> again<00:02:36.850> but<00:02:37.299> anyhow<00:02:38.130> that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
probably buy it again but anyhow that

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.009 
probably buy it again but anyhow that
looks<00:02:39.310> pretty<00:02:39.459> good<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:40.540> door<00:02:40.720> on<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.989> other

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
looks pretty good the door on the other

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.090 
looks pretty good the door on the other
hand<00:02:41.640> yes<00:02:42.640> Ken<00:02:42.970> this<00:02:43.750> it's<00:02:44.170> full<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.410> bully

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
hand yes Ken this it's full of bully

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.590 
hand yes Ken this it's full of bully
issues<00:02:45.549> and<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:47.080> mean<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:48.299> you<00:02:49.299> know<00:02:49.360> high

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
issues and so I mean it's you know high

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.470 
issues and so I mean it's you know high
here<00:02:49.900> high<00:02:50.170> here<00:02:50.530> low<00:02:50.799> I<00:02:51.160> do<00:02:51.819> want<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.180> float

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
here high here low I do want to float

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.640 
here high here low I do want to float
this<00:02:52.600> edge<00:02:54.060> across<00:02:55.060> here<00:02:55.390> it's<00:02:55.750> low<00:02:56.200> all<00:02:56.470> in

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
this edge across here it's low all in

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.990 
this edge across here it's low all in
here

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
here

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.340 
here
of<00:02:58.420> course<00:02:58.630> down<00:02:58.810> in<00:02:58.840> there<00:02:59.080> is<00:02:59.140> where<00:02:59.260> all

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
of course down in there is where all

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.009 
of course down in there is where all
that<00:02:59.500> rust<00:02:59.739> was<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.630> had<00:03:01.780> fixed<00:03:03.750> it's<00:03:04.750> got

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
that rust was that I had fixed it's got

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.120 
that rust was that I had fixed it's got
a<00:03:06.690> little<00:03:07.690> spot<00:03:07.900> here<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.680> bunch<00:03:08.859> of<00:03:09.010> them

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
a little spot here and a bunch of them

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.970 
a little spot here and a bunch of them
down<00:03:09.160> here<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:11.200> so<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.650> door<00:03:11.859> itself<00:03:13.980> is

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
down here and so the door itself is

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.289 
down here and so the door itself is
gonna<00:03:15.220> need<00:03:15.400> some<00:03:15.549> work<00:03:15.670> I<00:03:15.850> mean<00:03:15.970> all<00:03:16.060> for<00:03:16.239> the

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
gonna need some work I mean all for the

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.750 
gonna need some work I mean all for the
most<00:03:16.390> part<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:16.840> all<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:18.370> know<00:03:18.459> it's<00:03:18.609> just

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
most part it's all you know it's just

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.780 
most part it's all you know it's just
pretty<00:03:19.000> straight<00:03:19.329> but<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.630> can<00:03:19.780> see<00:03:20.730> where<00:03:21.730> I

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
pretty straight but you can see where I

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.370 
pretty straight but you can see where I
hit<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.000> little<00:03:22.150> filler<00:03:22.450> you<00:03:22.930> know<00:03:23.079> in<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.260> two

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
hit a little filler you know in the two

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.199 
hit a little filler you know in the two
places<00:03:23.799> it's<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.010> door<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.880> course<00:03:25.000> gonna

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
places it's the door of course gonna

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.860 
places it's the door of course gonna
need<00:03:25.390> some<00:03:25.570> work<00:03:25.720> but<00:03:27.540> for<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.630> most<00:03:28.750> part

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
need some work but for the most part

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.910 
need some work but for the most part
considering<00:03:29.380> there<00:03:29.500> with<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.680> amount<00:03:29.829> of

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
considering there with the amount of

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.270 
considering there with the amount of
rust<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:31.500> damage<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:32.650> they<00:03:32.709> had<00:03:32.859> I<00:03:32.890> think<00:03:33.160> it

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
rust and damage that they had I think it

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.160 
rust and damage that they had I think it
turned<00:03:33.489> out<00:03:33.579> pretty<00:03:33.730> good<00:03:33.970> considering<00:03:34.390> you

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
turned out pretty good considering you

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.360 
turned out pretty good considering you
know<00:03:35.260> everything<00:03:35.680> was<00:03:35.769> just<00:03:35.859> roughed<00:03:36.130> in<00:03:36.280> on

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
know everything was just roughed in on

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.920 
know everything was just roughed in on
that<00:03:36.519> I<00:03:37.230> need<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.290> get<00:03:38.380> those<00:03:39.120> lower<00:03:40.120> molding

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
that I need to get those lower molding

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.550 
that I need to get those lower molding
holes<00:03:41.109> drilled<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:43.480> whole<00:03:43.989> side<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.319> car

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
holes drilled this whole side of the car

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.860 
holes drilled this whole side of the car
actually<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:45.850> can<00:03:45.970> put<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.180> lower<00:03:46.359> rally

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
actually so I can put the lower rally

actually so I can put the lower rally
support<00:03:47.170> moldings<00:03:47.739> back<00:03:47.950> on<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:48.639> I<00:03:48.670> want

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
support moldings back on and so I want

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.879

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
to since I got this door adjusted the

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:51.990 
to since I got this door adjusted the
commander<00:03:51.190> adjusts<00:03:51.609> where<00:03:51.730> everything's

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
commander adjusts where everything's

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.270 
commander adjusts where everything's
fitting<00:03:52.239> really<00:03:52.480> nice<00:03:52.720> I<00:03:53.100> probably<00:03:54.100> to<00:03:54.190> get

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
fitting really nice I probably to get

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.309 
fitting really nice I probably to get
those<00:03:54.430> drilled<00:03:54.730> before<00:03:54.850> I<00:03:55.060> I<00:03:55.389> pop<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.870> door<00:03:56.049> I

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
those drilled before I I pop the door I

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.030 
those drilled before I I pop the door I
guess<00:03:56.920> I<00:03:56.980> do<00:03:57.040> want<00:03:57.310> to<00:03:57.370> float<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.700> edge<00:03:59.040> across

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
guess I do want to float the edge across

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.830 
guess I do want to float the edge across
here<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:00.489> it's<00:04:00.609> nice<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:00.910> flat

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
here so it's nice and flat

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.930 
here so it's nice and flat
I<00:04:02.870> did<00:04:03.830> have<00:04:03.950> to<00:04:04.069> kick<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.310> vendor<00:04:04.550> out<00:04:04.670> just<00:04:04.880> a

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
I did have to kick the vendor out just a

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.699 
I did have to kick the vendor out just a
little<00:04:05.120> bit<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.239> had<00:04:05.390> a<00:04:05.420> cool<00:04:05.569> title<00:04:05.750> gap<00:04:06.110> over

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
little bit I had a cool title gap over

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.260 
little bit I had a cool title gap over
here<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:08.330> I<00:04:09.550> might<00:04:10.550> do<00:04:10.640> just<00:04:10.700> a<00:04:10.940> little

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
here and so I might do just a little

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.460 
here and so I might do just a little
more<00:04:11.420> adjusting<00:04:11.720> on<00:04:11.870> there<00:04:12.020> but<00:04:12.170> for<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.349> most

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
more adjusting on there but for the most

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.870 
more adjusting on there but for the most
part<00:04:12.560> I<00:04:12.770> think<00:04:12.950> you're<00:04:13.069> just<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:13.310> little<00:04:13.400> scam<00:04:13.730> I

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
part I think you're just a little scam I

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.479 
part I think you're just a little scam I
did<00:04:14.000> that<00:04:14.120> on<00:04:14.209> that<00:04:14.300> red<00:04:14.480> rally<00:04:14.690> sport<00:04:15.340> it<00:04:16.340> made

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
a you know a big difference in the way

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.040 
a you know a big difference in the way
that<00:04:17.810> fit<00:04:19.810> all<00:04:20.810> in<00:04:21.139> all<00:04:22.570> real<00:04:23.570> happy<00:04:23.600> with<00:04:23.930> the

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
that fit all in all real happy with the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.750 
that fit all in all real happy with the
fender<00:04:24.320> just<00:04:24.560> little<00:04:24.830> minor<00:04:24.980> minor<00:04:25.340> issues

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
fender just little minor minor issues

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.540 
fender just little minor minor issues
and<00:04:26.090> honestly<00:04:26.570> a<00:04:26.630> lot<00:04:26.810> of<00:04:26.930> these<00:04:27.280> Bobby<00:04:28.280> Hager

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
and honestly a lot of these Bobby Hager

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.920 
and honestly a lot of these Bobby Hager
saw<00:04:28.669> put<00:04:28.940> something<00:04:29.240> there<00:04:29.389> but<00:04:29.630> some<00:04:29.840> of

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
saw put something there but some of

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.680 
saw put something there but some of
these<00:04:30.020> aren't<00:04:30.470> even<00:04:30.710> I<00:04:31.120> think<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.180> 2k<00:04:32.450> primer

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
these aren't even I think the 2k primer

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.960 
these aren't even I think the 2k primer
would<00:04:32.870> even<00:04:33.110> fill<00:04:33.380> the<00:04:34.220> door<00:04:34.430> obviously<00:04:34.730> is

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
would even fill the door obviously is

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.719 
would even fill the door obviously is
gonna<00:04:35.090> meet<00:04:35.240> some<00:04:35.450> more<00:04:35.570> work<00:04:35.750> but<00:04:36.729> anyhow

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
gonna meet some more work but anyhow

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.090 
gonna meet some more work but anyhow
that's<00:04:38.090> where<00:04:38.360> I'm<00:04:38.479> at

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
that's where I'm at

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.770 
that's where I'm at
as<00:04:40.100> of<00:04:40.400> now<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.850> think<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.090> upper<00:04:41.450> balance

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
as of now I think the upper balance

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.090 
as of now I think the upper balance
turned<00:04:41.960> out<00:04:42.080> real<00:04:42.229> nice<00:04:42.410> lower<00:04:42.650> balance<00:04:42.950> it's

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
turned out real nice lower balance it's

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.320 
turned out real nice lower balance it's
really<00:04:43.400> good<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.610> didn't<00:04:43.820> seem<00:04:43.940> that<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.090> little

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
really good I didn't seem that a little

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.090 
really good I didn't seem that a little
ding<00:04:44.479> that<00:04:44.660> I<00:04:44.690> had<00:04:44.840> missed<00:04:45.050> once<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.830> was

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
ding that I had missed once I was

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.570 
ding that I had missed once I was
bolting<00:04:46.340> it<00:04:46.400> on<00:04:47.530> all<00:04:48.530> that<00:04:48.710> looks<00:04:48.919> pretty<00:04:49.040> good

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
bolting it on all that looks pretty good

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.690 
bolting it on all that looks pretty good
I<00:04:49.610> need<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.690> incas<00:04:50.990> hood<00:04:51.139> off<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:51.700> replace

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
these wore out hinges this were just an

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.770 
these wore out hinges this were just an
extra<00:04:58.310> set<00:04:58.490> that<00:04:58.639> I<00:04:58.700> had<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:59.120> ones<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.510> were

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
extra set that I had the ones that were

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.469 
extra set that I had the ones that were
for<00:04:59.990> this<00:05:00.139> car<00:05:00.820> excuse<00:05:01.820> me<00:05:01.940> we're<00:05:02.090> really<00:05:02.120> bad

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
and so I kind of threw these things on

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.300 
and so I kind of threw these things on
here<00:05:05.350> hoping<00:05:06.350> they'd<00:05:06.470> be<00:05:06.500> better<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.190> they're

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
here hoping they'd be better and they're

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.389 
here hoping they'd be better and they're
they're<00:05:07.789> not<00:05:07.970> so

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:12.399 

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:15.820 

that's<00:05:13.399> it<00:05:13.639> real<00:05:13.789> good<00:05:13.969> and<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:15.289> course<00:05:15.529> I<00:05:15.679> can

the Camaro started blocking the hit of
panel<00:05:45.769> as<00:05:46.069> you<00:05:46.129> can<00:05:46.369> see<00:05:46.550> it's<00:05:46.699> full<00:05:46.969> of<00:05:48.009> low

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009

00:06:03.489 --> 00:06:03.499 
spots most part it's not too bad I think

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:05.109

everything else that looks on there the
two<00:06:05.539> cable<00:06:05.959> should<00:06:06.259> take<00:06:06.439> care<00:06:06.679> of

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:10.429 
I'm a skim that with some error codes

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:12.579 
I'm a skim that with some error codes
you<00:06:10.639> might<00:06:10.669> take<00:06:10.939> care<00:06:11.059> of<00:06:11.149> that<00:06:11.589> another

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:12.589

first time we did of course we weld it

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:34.049 
first time we did of course we weld it

still

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
still

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.590 
still
a<00:07:13.740> few<00:07:14.370> areas<00:07:14.550> for<00:07:14.820> the<00:07:14.880> most<00:07:15.030> part<00:07:15.300> it's<00:07:15.449> not

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 
a few areas for the most part it's not

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.499 
a few areas for the most part it's not
too<00:07:15.780> too<00:07:16.199> awful<00:07:16.560> bad<00:07:16.710> and<00:07:17.520> did<00:07:17.880> hit<00:07:18.030> metal<00:07:18.300> here

there I'm sure the rest will need a

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.749 
there I'm sure the rest will need a
bunch<00:07:25.590> more<00:07:25.650> since<00:07:26.130> it<00:07:26.220> was<00:07:26.340> just<00:07:26.490> kind<00:07:26.699> of

gonna have any time to work on this and

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.140 
gonna have any time to work on this and
I'd<00:07:40.560> hoped<00:07:40.740> it'd<00:07:40.889> actually<00:07:41.610> get<00:07:41.880> out<00:07:41.970> here<00:07:42.090> and

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.150 
I'd hoped it'd actually get out here and

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.820 
I'd hoped it'd actually get out here and
do<00:07:42.240> something<00:07:42.660> but<00:07:42.780> I<00:07:42.870> just<00:07:43.020> haven't<00:07:43.199> had<00:07:43.380> the

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:43.830 
do something but I just haven't had the

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.040 
do something but I just haven't had the
opportunity<00:07:44.389> and<00:07:45.389> so<00:07:45.539> I<00:07:45.600> will<00:07:45.750> probably<00:07:45.990> let

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.050 
opportunity and so I will probably let

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.939 
opportunity and so I will probably let
him<00:07:46.139> up<00:07:46.260> a<00:07:46.289> little<00:07:46.410> bit<00:07:46.560> just<00:07:46.590> to<00:07:46.830> have

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:46.949 
him up a little bit just to have

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:50.540
