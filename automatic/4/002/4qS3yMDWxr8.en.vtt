00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.089
 welcome to another video then 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.639
 Personally, this one just pdt zezinho 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.559
 Fast mw3 a situation that 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.420
 happened to me and my friends there 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.059
 I was playing what the champion 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.699
 Argentinian grosso and another comrade 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.430
 people found the counter a crazy on the team 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.050
 who was making some in the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.060
 animal if we say she was bouncing 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.029
 tactic in his pee in the middle of the map comes 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.250
 I soon ran, I just did the shit. 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.109
 We fucking people thought up profit 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.600
 doing of course that crazy that this 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.460
 face is doing is bad at crazy and crazy 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.250
 in the end of the matches he always with a 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.149
 lot of points always so xp Taufic 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.800
 Shit, man. 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.329
 there after three or four matches 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 What more or less did I call myself? 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.309
 that what was happening he liked 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.410
 to know them to die on purpose and 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.940
 When he was born he would take his own 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.760
 dog tag back then what not 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.480
 it happens he was adding 50 points 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.129
 for picking up the dog tag and over 200 points 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.960
 for recovering his 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.930
 so every time he did it and that 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.610
 it worked out he was adding 250 points 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.530
 so with that if he did several 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.720
 times during the match and all of them 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.820
 basically 10 is certain he is getting 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.799
 many points in this match that he 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.549
 got enough point he got 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:23.610
 2002 840 he died three bar is pierre 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.100
 made 3/1 24 and died 24 times and scored only 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.049
 three guy then just doing it he already 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.390
 won a lot of point outside the other 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.549
 matches he made very much point had 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.950
 that he made almost 4,000 points 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.600
 and I kept wondering why the bug 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.119
 no fucking bi in the end she was 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.369
 doing all this for wanting to 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.409
 purpose simply to die footprint 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.820
 to the tag with this is adding points 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.159
 so this is it people just wanted to pass 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.960
 quickly and leave the criterion for 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.860
 for you and it will be worth it 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.470
 do that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.119
 is it not worth it that the reptile is 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.200
 it's worth it to be positive or not 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.640
 face should have a seal kit - 5 - six 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.040
 because the way you're doing it just 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.850
 It's getting negative in every game. 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.799
 Hi, how are you guys? 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.799
 Okay, bye and bye, bye to you
