00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.170
 success according to the hairdressers is a 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.460
 most sought cutting type in halls 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.680
 currently and to give all the tips 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.050
 these tricks of how to let our 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.120
 hair like the actress who will explain 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.670
 for the hair stylist maria coutinho 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.680
 Marilia battle is a challenge for 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.570
 hairdressers this type of cut is not 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.210
 one comes to be a challenge that actually 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.280
 Petitioner never stopped using my 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.590
 happens is that her hair is 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.530
 very sharp you are very visible 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.320
 from her hair any kind of 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.200
 hair can be replicated as of tri 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.409
 we brought some hair formats 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.750
 of texture for example is the hair 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.210
 of the glory saucer and who cleans it from the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.990
 adolescence last year the cabocla esse 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.390
 fine and smooth hair but is ideal for 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.549
 make a peaked not is not to be the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.430
 ideal because even this hair goes 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.229
 require a finalization is because the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.420
 people often imagine that at least 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.790
 fact that it is flat that he will stay 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.430
 that way not her hair too 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.729
 there is enough finalization so the news 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.579
 It's good for those who have curly hair. 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.290
 undulates is an example of a curly hair 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.140
 which is well on the side of the hair of the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.750
 danielle is and it was cool that you 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.299
 can see she wanted a fringe he 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.890
 It's nicely spiked It has a color 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.390
 so I've already left a little bit of one 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.990
 product in which it can be 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.439
 increase 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.880
 the tip of her but for those 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.890
 types of hair it is important to make a 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.569
 The school has to help 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.380
 we'll realize that all models 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.920
 here in the hairs are they 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.900
 example to michelle she has mecha is made 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.150
 brush all the hair closed it one 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.250
 little more sensitized 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.000
 so her hair also has a 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.070
 brush have lurk products here to 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.320
 to finish but we talk about several 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.050
 types of hair and the type of young face 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.330
 say I like more full but one 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.210
 A little bit but it's not very good anymore. 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.310
 it's right that's not right 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.170
 the square face and the very round face 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.250
 If you knock it, it gets more in 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.470
 evidence 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.480
 but if the woman she wants to leave the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.700
 face appearing in evidence show 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.470
 beautiful earrings she can wear but the 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.180
 ideal would really be a face but the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.850
 that did not have a very high volume of 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.880
 big to make this cut be 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.500
 use the scissors it is us 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.480
 uses us here particularly 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.930
 like most of the scissors because 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.150
 she can shred and sharpen 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.000
 very much the tip of the hair and hence the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.620
 result does not look nice in this case 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.160
 that bruno is showing that the 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.400
 He is very intense but he is well. 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.370
 connected to the tips the first peg 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.390
 he is connecting to the others 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.360
 differently from that of the 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.090
 past fawcet farrah who was small 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.040
 lion that old man but this hair 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.440
 not now tell us what's the 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.580
 trick because we leave the room 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.280
 There's no way you can leave this wonderful 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.180
 also recorded this effect of the 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.240
 message 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.250
 yes first you saw it is that same 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.650
 hair of jesus of glory 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.900
 saucer it has to be used that 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.640
 hair here he was brushing but like 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.490
 her hair is already a finer texture 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.800
 she could have dried just by playing the 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.100
 head forward drying from below to 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.690
 and it can also use up to 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.140
 time to change clothes some 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.440
 The little old man does not leave 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.580
 long time not to melt it and then 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.650
 favor Bruno 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.500
 let's use the spray here to show 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.800
 This is going to keep the 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.930
 wet hair when also treated 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.690
 we elaborated mousse used for 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.060
 give volume to it so it's good to talk because 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.040
 often the impression that the 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.390
 protein 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.460
 I want this hair is leaving 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.620
 in that way there are no miracles 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.110
 there are care 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.730
 then cut and use all those 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.740
 tricks all these tips that people 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.920
 learned to like and isabela you can see 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:43.110
 in your hair it hurts she's talking 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:46.540
 The new and a son is soon already dating 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.580
 brigade she was beautiful, I loved the tips 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.270
