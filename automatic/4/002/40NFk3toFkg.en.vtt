00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
top of the tank on the surface I have a

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.640 
top of the tank on the surface I have a
mix<00:01:03.320> of<00:01:03.760> Amazon<00:01:04.760> frog<00:01:05.210> bit<00:01:05.510> duckweed<00:01:06.290> and

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
mix of Amazon frog bit duckweed and

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.520 
mix of Amazon frog bit duckweed and
water<00:01:06.979> lettuce<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.970> is<00:01:08.210> here<00:01:09.140> so<00:01:09.350> that

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
water lettuce and that is here so that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.410 
water lettuce and that is here so that
it<00:01:09.619> can<00:01:09.740> help<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.250> absorb<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.030> excess

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
it can help to absorb the excess

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.800 
it can help to absorb the excess
nutrients<00:01:11.930> in<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.200> tank<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:14.150> help<00:01:14.390> keep<00:01:14.600> the

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
nutrients in the tank and help keep the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.460 
nutrients in the tank and help keep the
water<00:01:14.990> quality<00:01:15.320> really<00:01:15.770> good<00:01:16.010> so<00:01:16.250> that<00:01:16.430> these

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
water quality really good so that these

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.160 
water quality really good so that these
plecos<00:01:18.470> will<00:01:18.830> breathe<00:01:19.100> for<00:01:19.400> me<00:01:19.520> consistently

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
plecos will breathe for me consistently

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.510 
plecos will breathe for me consistently
you<00:01:21.170> can<00:01:21.290> see<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.590> roots<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:21.979> angled<00:01:22.369> down

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
you can see the roots is angled down

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.050 
you can see the roots is angled down
into<00:01:23.149> the<00:01:23.270> tank<00:01:24.100> another<00:01:25.100> beneficial<00:01:25.820> thing

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
into the tank another beneficial thing

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.990 
into the tank another beneficial thing
of<00:01:26.240> having<00:01:26.690> these<00:01:27.350> plants<00:01:27.979> in<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.490> tank<00:01:28.790> is

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
of having these plants in the tank is

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.030 
of having these plants in the tank is
that<00:01:29.240> they<00:01:29.479> create<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.880> area<00:01:31.880> for<00:01:32.420> little

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
that they create a area for little

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.580 
that they create a area for little
microorganisms<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:34.280> live<00:01:35.030> in<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.479> roots<00:01:35.750> if<00:01:36.440> I

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
microorganisms to live in the roots if I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.139 
microorganisms to live in the roots if I
had<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:36.710> better<00:01:36.920> camera<00:01:37.250> I<00:01:37.580> would<00:01:37.790> be<00:01:37.880> able<00:01:38.000> to

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
about little organisms living in my fish

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:55.420 
about little organisms living in my fish
