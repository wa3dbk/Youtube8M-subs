00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
that I could play this mission for you

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.509 
that I could play this mission for you
guys<00:00:18.820> if<00:00:19.240> you<00:00:19.810> noticed<00:00:20.410> you<00:00:20.919> will<00:00:21.070> see<00:00:21.310> that

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:21.519 
guys if you noticed you will see that

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.669 
guys if you noticed you will see that
the<00:00:21.669> special<00:00:22.179> mission<00:00:22.570> was<00:00:22.810> pretty<00:00:23.050> damn<00:00:23.320> far

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:23.679 
the special mission was pretty damn far

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.950 
the special mission was pretty damn far
away<00:00:24.009> from<00:00:24.369> my<00:00:24.550> city<00:00:24.849> but<00:00:25.330> I<00:00:25.359> guess<00:00:25.720> that

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
away from my city but I guess that

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.620 
away from my city but I guess that
doesn't<00:00:26.019> matter<00:00:26.529> much<00:00:27.039> anymore<00:00:27.429> because<00:00:28.089> in<00:00:28.539> a

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
doesn't matter much anymore because in a

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.019 
doesn't matter much anymore because in a
recent<00:00:29.019> update<00:00:29.199> named<00:00:29.919> Jackie<00:00:30.279> we<00:00:30.490> made<00:00:30.669> it<00:00:30.789> so

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
recent update named Jackie we made it so

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.000 
recent update named Jackie we made it so
that<00:00:31.210> all<00:00:31.359> special<00:00:31.990> missions<00:00:32.380> have<00:00:32.590> a<00:00:32.619> fixed

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
that all special missions have a fixed

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.729 
that all special missions have a fixed
difficulty<00:00:33.789> so<00:00:34.690> even<00:00:35.110> though<00:00:35.289> the<00:00:35.500> table

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
difficulty so even though the table

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.340 
difficulty so even though the table
difficulty<00:00:36.579> says<00:00:36.879> impossible<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.989> mission

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
difficulty says impossible the mission

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.490 
difficulty says impossible the mission
is<00:00:38.530> actually<00:00:39.129> fairly<00:00:39.399> easy<00:00:39.850> in<00:00:40.120> reality<00:00:40.719> even

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
is actually fairly easy in reality even

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.650 
is actually fairly easy in reality even
though<00:00:41.949> I<00:00:41.980> thought<00:00:42.430> this<00:00:42.760> special<00:00:43.270> mission

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
though I thought this special mission

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.380 
though I thought this special mission
was<00:00:43.840> easy<00:00:44.050> this<00:00:44.710> is<00:00:45.039> actually<00:00:45.609> my<00:00:45.760> third<00:00:45.789> time

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
was easy this is actually my third time

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.349 
was easy this is actually my third time
attempting<00:00:47.050> it<00:00:47.199> the<00:00:47.980> other<00:00:48.160> times<00:00:48.550> I<00:00:48.789> died<00:00:49.059> was

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
attempting it the other times I died was

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.139 
attempting it the other times I died was
a<00:00:49.390> big<00:00:49.719> fail<00:00:49.989> on<00:00:50.230> my<00:00:50.469> part<00:00:50.500> so<00:00:51.489> I<00:00:51.519> will<00:00:51.910> probably

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
a big fail on my part so I will probably

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.330 
a big fail on my part so I will probably
stick<00:00:52.809> that<00:00:52.960> clip<00:00:53.289> in<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.559> end<00:00:53.769> of<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.010> video

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
stick that clip in the end of the video

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.500 
stick that clip in the end of the video
so<00:00:55.149> you<00:00:55.210> guys<00:00:55.390> can<00:00:55.690> laugh<00:00:56.320> meal<00:00:56.829> you<00:00:57.010> want

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
so you guys can laugh meal you want

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.900 
so you guys can laugh meal you want
anyways<00:00:58.510> I<00:00:58.870> didn't<00:00:59.500> even<00:00:59.739> get<00:01:00.039> to<00:01:00.100> explain<00:01:00.670> the

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
anyways I didn't even get to explain the

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.689 
anyways I didn't even get to explain the
details<00:01:01.059> of<00:01:01.600> this<00:01:01.719> mission<00:01:01.989> yet<00:01:02.379> so<00:01:03.219> let's<00:01:03.489> get

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
details of this mission yet so let's get

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.450 
details of this mission yet so let's get
into<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:05.080> objective<00:01:05.770> is<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:05.950> beat<00:01:06.220> this

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
into that the objective is to beat this

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.150 
into that the objective is to beat this
easy<00:01:06.700> track<00:01:07.180> but<00:01:07.660> all<00:01:07.840> blooms<00:01:08.290> are<00:01:08.560> half<00:01:08.800> speed

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
easy track but all blooms are half speed

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.190 
easy track but all blooms are half speed
and<00:01:09.400> you<00:01:09.640> only<00:01:09.730> get<00:01:10.210> half<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.660> cash<00:01:10.900> for

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
and you only get half the cash for

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.100 
and you only get half the cash for
popping<00:01:11.680> bloons<00:01:12.160> of<00:01:12.460> course<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.600> half<00:01:13.810> cash

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
popping bloons of course the half cash

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.250 
popping bloons of course the half cash
doesn't<00:01:14.500> apply<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:15.040> farms<00:01:15.760> so<00:01:16.510> as<00:01:16.720> you<00:01:16.840> can<00:01:17.050> see

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
doesn't apply to farms so as you can see

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.040 
doesn't apply to farms so as you can see
I<00:01:17.530> went<00:01:18.040> completely<00:01:18.280> berserk<00:01:18.910> on<00:01:19.330> farms<00:01:19.840> in

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
I went completely berserk on farms in

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.960 
I went completely berserk on farms in
the<00:01:20.140> early<00:01:20.410> game<00:01:20.710> since<00:01:21.040> they<00:01:21.310> have<00:01:21.520> balloon

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
the early game since they have balloon

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.690 
the early game since they have balloon
speed<00:01:22.450> really<00:01:22.780> helps<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.260> lot<00:01:23.440> because<00:01:23.980> you<00:01:24.520> can

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
speed really helps a lot because you can

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.940 
speed really helps a lot because you can
afford<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.180> have<00:01:25.360> a<00:01:25.390> not<00:01:25.690> so<00:01:25.720> solid<00:01:26.410> D<00:01:26.590> in<00:01:26.770> the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
afford to have a not so solid D in the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.060 
afford to have a not so solid D in the
early<00:01:27.220> game<00:01:27.460> I<00:01:27.760> mean<00:01:28.660> look<00:01:29.230> how<00:01:29.260> slow<00:01:29.860> those

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
early game I mean look how slow those

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.370 
early game I mean look how slow those
blooms<00:01:30.430> are<00:01:30.760> traveling<00:01:31.300> even<00:01:31.930> though<00:01:32.050> it<00:01:32.200> may

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
blooms are traveling even though it may

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.590 
blooms are traveling even though it may
be<00:01:32.410> hard<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.830> tell<00:01:33.130> because<00:01:33.430> this<00:01:33.850> video<00:01:34.300> is

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
be hard to tell because this video is

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.130 
be hard to tell because this video is
sped<00:01:34.900> up<00:01:35.250> anyways<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:37.120> nearing<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.690> rounds

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
sped up anyways it is nearing the rounds

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.040 
sped up anyways it is nearing the rounds
where<00:01:38.530> Moab's<00:01:39.010> could<00:01:39.520> start<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:40.000> appear<00:01:40.390> yet<00:01:40.900> I

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
where Moab's could start to appear yet I

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.160 
where Moab's could start to appear yet I
