00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
a link Naruto from the demo and has put

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.010 
a link Naruto from the demo and has put
it<00:01:11.000> into<00:01:11.240> stomp<00:01:11.570> tree

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
it into stomp tree

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.410

so<00:01:12.710> I've<00:01:12.830> done<00:01:13.010> know<00:01:13.159> that<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.369> demo<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:13.939> now

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
so I've done know that the demo and now

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.880 
so I've done know that the demo and now
I'm<00:01:14.479> not<00:01:14.930> limited<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.080> he<00:01:18.380> stopped<00:01:18.590> using

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
I'm not limited and so he stopped using

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.830 
I'm not limited and so he stopped using
the<00:01:19.390> Naruto<00:01:20.390> model<00:01:21.049> he<00:01:21.320> actually<00:01:21.680> used

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
the Naruto model he actually used

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.740 
the Naruto model he actually used
killaby<00:01:23.840> without<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.469> sama<00:01:24.950> had<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:26.479> fish

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
killaby without the sama had the fish

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.440 
killaby without the sama had the fish
thought<00:01:27.049> I<00:01:27.170> guess<00:01:27.490> so<00:01:28.490> he<00:01:28.670> can<00:01:28.789> transform<00:01:29.270> into

thought I guess so he can transform into

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.120 
thought I guess so he can transform into
is<00:01:29.659> not<00:01:30.500> health<00:01:30.799> piece<00:01:31.070> shit<00:01:31.549> now<00:01:31.759> I
