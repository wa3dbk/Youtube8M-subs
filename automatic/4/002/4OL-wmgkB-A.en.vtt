00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
III that keeps this diagram open could

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.139 
III that keeps this diagram open could
be<00:01:55.090> useful<00:01:55.479> for<00:01:55.600> white<00:01:55.720> and<00:01:56.909> Bishop<00:01:57.909> comes

back<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.720> e7<00:01:59.940> well<00:02:00.940> it's<00:02:01.720> probably<00:02:01.959> necessary

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
back to e7 well it's probably necessary

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.899 
back to e7 well it's probably necessary
if<00:02:02.890> black<00:02:03.159> is<00:02:03.310> gonna<00:02:03.490> play<00:02:04.030> d6<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:05.140> course<00:02:05.909> now

if black is gonna play d6 of course now

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.580 
if black is gonna play d6 of course now

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
there should be two looks normal here

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.490 
there should be two looks normal here
but<00:02:08.829> white<00:02:09.670> played<00:02:09.970> Queen<00:02:10.269> d3<00:02:10.750> which<00:02:10.899> forces

but white played Queen d3 which forces
black<00:02:12.010> into<00:02:12.850> exchanging<00:02:13.540> on<00:02:13.750> g3<00:02:14.560> because<00:02:14.890> the

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
black into exchanging on g3 because the

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.460

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
bishop is about to escape to d6 so black

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.759 
bishop is about to escape to d6 so black
exchanges<00:02:21.280> on<00:02:21.430> g3<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:22.989> means<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.590> H

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
exchanges on g3 but that means the H

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.360 
exchanges on g3 but that means the H
file<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.850> now<00:02:25.269> well<00:02:25.750> semi<00:02:26.290> opened<00:02:26.799> half<00:02:26.980> open

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.770 
file is now well semi opened half open
anyway<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:30.340> reason<00:02:30.670> white<00:02:30.880> wanted<00:02:31.660> to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
anyway and the reason white wanted to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.170 
anyway and the reason white wanted to
force<00:02:32.079> this<00:02:32.380> was<00:02:32.769> to<00:02:32.980> try<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.310> exploit<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
force this was to try and exploit the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
could perhaps take on e4 just exchange

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.300 
could perhaps take on e4 just exchange
the<00:03:31.050> bishop<00:03:31.290> for<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.500> night<00:03:31.710> and<00:03:31.950> play<00:03:32.130> that

the bishop for a night and play that

the bishop for a night and play that
position<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:32.940> would<00:03:33.090> certainly<00:03:33.890> minimize

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
position that would certainly minimize

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
the risk minimize any danger on the King

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.910 
the risk minimize any danger on the King
side<00:03:38.180> but<00:03:39.180> black<00:03:39.630> decides<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.410> counter-attack

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
side but black decides to counter-attack

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.370 
side but black decides to counter-attack
here<00:03:41.460> and<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:41.610> think<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:42.060> understand<00:03:42.720> why<00:03:43.170> he<00:03:43.350> did

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
here and I think I understand why he did

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.010 
here and I think I understand why he did
this<00:03:43.710> because<00:03:44.130> White's<00:03:44.820> King<00:03:45.270> is<00:03:45.660> still<00:03:45.810> in

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
this because White's King is still in

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.850 
this because White's King is still in
the<00:03:46.110> middle<00:03:46.200> perhaps<00:03:46.890> he<00:03:47.160> can<00:03:47.340> use<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.970> C<00:03:48.240> file

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
the middle perhaps he can use the C file

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.700 
the middle perhaps he can use the C file
perhaps<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.220> open<00:03:50.550> e<00:03:50.790> file<00:03:51.120> as<00:03:51.330> well<00:03:51.620> so<00:03:52.620> this

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
perhaps the open e file as well so this

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.090 
perhaps the open e file as well so this
is<00:03:52.770> a<00:03:52.860> very<00:03:53.100> tempting<00:03:53.340> move<00:03:53.760> indeed<00:03:55.100> white

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
is a very tempting move indeed white

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.900 
is a very tempting move indeed white
took<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:58.830> now<00:03:59.070> drop<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.120> knight<00:04:00.300> back<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.720> g3

took and now drop the knight back to g3

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.110 
took and now drop the knight back to g3
now<00:04:03.530> again<00:04:04.530> this<00:04:04.650> is<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:04.890> most<00:04:05.100> ambitious<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
now again this is the most ambitious the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.220 
now again this is the most ambitious the
most<00:04:06.300> risky<00:04:06.959> move<00:04:07.970> let's<00:04:08.970> see<00:04:09.120> what<00:04:09.300> White<00:04:09.900> has

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
most risky move let's see what White has

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.440 
most risky move let's see what White has
in<00:04:10.410> mind<00:04:10.620> well<00:04:10.950> he<00:04:11.400> certainly<00:04:11.760> didn't<00:04:12.180> have<00:04:12.270> in

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
in mind well he certainly didn't have in

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.810 
in mind well he certainly didn't have in
mind<00:04:12.480> playing<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.560> rook<00:04:13.740> back<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.310> D<00:04:14.520> 2

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
mind playing the rook back to D 2

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.460 
mind playing the rook back to D 2
because<00:04:15.780> then<00:04:15.930> black<00:04:16.290> would<00:04:17.190> have<00:04:17.340> made<00:04:18.270> a

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
because then black would have made a

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.450 
because then black would have made a
well<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.500> very<00:04:19.890> obvious<00:04:20.640> sacrifice<00:04:21.180> on<00:04:21.419> e3

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
well a very obvious sacrifice on e3

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.550 
well a very obvious sacrifice on e3
after<00:04:23.460> taking<00:04:24.680> Queen<00:04:25.680> takes<00:04:25.890> g3<00:04:26.520> chick<00:04:26.820> and

after taking Queen takes g3 chick and
well<00:04:28.560> already<00:04:29.310> black<00:04:29.669> has<00:04:29.820> enough<00:04:30.090> for<00:04:30.270> the

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
well already black has enough for the

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.210 
well already black has enough for the
exchange<00:04:30.750> but<00:04:30.900> officer<00:04:31.200> Knight<00:04:31.380> c5<00:04:31.890> this<00:04:32.130> is

exchange but officer Knight c5 this is

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.010 
exchange but officer Knight c5 this is
looking<00:04:32.430> very<00:04:32.490> serious<00:04:33.240> indeed<00:04:33.600> with<00:04:33.930> the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
looking very serious indeed with the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.710 
looking very serious indeed with the
idea<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.350> hopping<00:04:35.160> into<00:04:35.310> e4<00:04:35.940> among<00:04:36.330> others<00:04:36.690> so

idea of hopping into e4 among others so

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.300 
idea of hopping into e4 among others so
black<00:04:37.169> would<00:04:37.350> be<00:04:37.380> doing<00:04:37.650> wonderfully<00:04:38.100> there

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
black would be doing wonderfully there

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.580 
black would be doing wonderfully there
but<00:04:38.790> no<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.030> was<00:04:39.150> never<00:04:39.630> White's<00:04:39.930> intention

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
but no that was never White's intention

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.580 
but no that was never White's intention
white<00:04:41.190> decided<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.730> leave<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.450> rook<00:04:42.630> on<00:04:42.840> d4

white decided to leave the rook on d4

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.410 
white decided to leave the rook on d4
and<00:04:43.910> sacrifice<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.120> exchange<00:04:46.070> black<00:04:47.070> took<00:04:47.280> it

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
and sacrifice the exchange black took it

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.880 
and sacrifice the exchange black took it
and<00:04:49.670> black<00:04:50.670> had<00:04:50.880> dropped<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.750> night<00:04:51.990> back<00:04:52.260> to
