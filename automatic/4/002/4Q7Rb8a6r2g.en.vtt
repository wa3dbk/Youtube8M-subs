care of this and also instead of

bottom of a hamburger patty or something
you<00:00:25.050> can<00:00:25.199> use<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.400> should<00:00:26.519> be<00:00:26.640> a

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
you can use that so this should be a

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.830 
you can use that so this should be a
fairly<00:00:26.910> cheap<00:00:27.269> way<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.660> it

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.540 

before<00:00:34.840> I<00:00:34.870> begin<00:00:34.960> I<00:00:35.440> lay<00:00:35.770> down<00:00:35.950> some<00:00:36.190> wax<00:00:36.430> paper

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
before I begin I lay down some wax paper

before I begin I lay down some wax paper
in<00:00:36.969> case<00:00:37.180> i<00:00:37.329> dripped<00:00:37.570> any<00:00:37.780> glue<00:00:39.000> instead<00:00:40.000> of

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
in case i dripped any glue instead of

depron or other official foams I decided

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.030 
depron or other official foams I decided
to<00:00:43.210> use<00:00:43.300> foam<00:00:43.540> that<00:00:43.720> comes<00:00:43.960> with<00:00:44.199> meat<00:00:44.500> i<00:00:44.710> buy

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
to use foam that comes with meat i buy

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.090 
to use foam that comes with meat i buy
from<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.309> grocery<00:00:45.489> store<00:00:46.620> without<00:00:47.620> removing

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
from the grocery store without removing

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.009 
from the grocery store without removing
the<00:00:48.129> rudder<00:00:48.430> I<00:00:48.670> traced<00:00:49.150> its<00:00:49.360> outlying<00:00:49.720> onto

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
the rudder I traced its outlying onto

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.439 
the rudder I traced its outlying onto
paper<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.620> cut<00:00:51.190> that<00:00:51.220> contour<00:00:51.760> into<00:00:51.970> foam<00:00:52.180> I

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
paper and cut that contour into foam I

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.310 
paper and cut that contour into foam I
made<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.199> extensions<00:00:53.710> 1<00:00:53.980> inch<00:00:54.129> wide<00:00:54.370> I

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
made the extensions 1 inch wide I

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.960 
made the extensions 1 inch wide I
decided<00:00:56.320> to<00:00:56.470> use<00:00:56.500> five-minute<00:00:57.100> epoxy<00:00:57.159> instead

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
decided to use five-minute epoxy instead

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.060 
decided to use five-minute epoxy instead
of<00:00:58.089> hot<00:00:58.239> glue<00:00:58.420> I<00:00:58.750> actually<00:00:59.409> let<00:00:59.739> the<00:00:59.860> glue<00:01:00.040> set

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
of hot glue I actually let the glue set

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.280 
of hot glue I actually let the glue set
up<00:01:00.399> a<00:01:00.519> bit<00:01:00.729> then<00:01:01.390> put<00:01:01.629> it<00:01:01.720> on<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.899> rudder<00:01:02.110> to

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
up a bit then put it on the rudder to

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.660 
up a bit then put it on the rudder to
reduce<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.710> time<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:02.949> had<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:03.370> hold<00:01:03.579> the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
reduce the time I had to hold the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.810 
reduce the time I had to hold the
extension<00:01:04.089> in<00:01:04.180> place<00:01:05.429> once<00:01:06.429> the<00:01:06.610> rudder

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
extension in place once the rudder

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.029 
extension in place once the rudder
extension<00:01:07.390> was<00:01:07.539> in<00:01:07.660> place<00:01:07.869> I<00:01:08.170> decided<00:01:08.920> to

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
extension was in place I decided to

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.380 
extension was in place I decided to
remove<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.460> elevator<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:09.910> make<00:01:10.210> its

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
remove the elevator to make its

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.359 
remove the elevator to make its
extension<00:01:11.020> I<00:01:11.170> was<00:01:11.860> worried<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.280> the

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
extension I was worried that the

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.980 
extension I was worried that the
extensions<00:01:12.880> would<00:01:13.000> droop<00:01:13.270> unevenly<00:01:13.720> and

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
extensions would droop unevenly and

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.999 
extensions would droop unevenly and
cause<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.380> rule<00:01:14.770> force<00:01:15.160> on<00:01:15.369> the<00:01:15.490> plane<00:01:15.729> I<00:01:17.009> again

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
cause a rule force on the plane I again

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.580 
cause a rule force on the plane I again
traced<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.610> contour<00:01:19.060> onto<00:01:19.300> paper<00:01:19.509> cut<00:01:20.470> out

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
traced the contour onto paper cut out

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.880 
traced the contour onto paper cut out
the<00:01:20.770> phone<00:01:20.979> for<00:01:21.460> a<00:01:21.490> 1<00:01:21.640> inch<00:01:21.820> extension<00:01:22.270> I

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the phone for a 1 inch extension I

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.649 
the phone for a 1 inch extension I
pinned<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:23.979> elevator<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:24.490> extension<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.630> a

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
pinned the elevator and extension to a

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.139 
pinned the elevator and extension to a
foam<00:01:25.869> block<00:01:26.200> after<00:01:26.470> applying<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:27.070> epoxy<00:01:27.610> to

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
foam block after applying the epoxy to

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.210 
foam block after applying the epoxy to
make<00:01:28.300> sure<00:01:28.539> the<00:01:28.720> alignment<00:01:28.929> was<00:01:29.350> correct<00:01:29.679> this

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
make sure the alignment was correct this

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.760 
make sure the alignment was correct this
kept<00:01:30.490> both<00:01:30.700> elevator<00:01:31.210> extensions<00:01:31.840> even<00:01:32.649> with

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
kept both elevator extensions even with

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.450 
kept both elevator extensions even with
each<00:01:32.920> other<00:01:33.899> after<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:35.380> elevator<00:01:35.890> dried<00:01:36.220> i

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
each other after the elevator dried i

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.819 
each other after the elevator dried i
reattached<00:01:36.850> it<00:01:37.360> with<00:01:38.020> packing<00:01:38.409> tape<00:01:38.619> and

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
reattached it with packing tape and

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.620 
reattached it with packing tape and
check<00:01:39.009> that<00:01:39.130> all<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.340> surfaces<00:01:39.670> moved<00:01:40.149> evenly

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
check that all the surfaces moved evenly

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.620 
check that all the surfaces moved evenly
and<00:01:40.810> easily<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:42.520> control<00:01:42.880> surfaces<00:01:43.390> are<00:01:43.540> now

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
and easily the control surfaces are now

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.870 
and easily the control surfaces are now
much<00:01:43.810> larger<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.470> will<00:01:45.220> actually<00:01:45.369> be<00:01:45.640> able<00:01:45.700> to

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
much larger and will actually be able to

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.819 
much larger and will actually be able to
go<00:01:46.030> ahead<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.450> have<00:01:47.020> a<00:01:47.049> lot<00:01:47.259> more<00:01:47.409> command

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
go ahead and have a lot more command

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.289 
go ahead and have a lot more command
over<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.159> airplane<00:01:48.520> so<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.759> can<00:01:48.909> have<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.090> lot

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
over the airplane so I can have a lot

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.359 
over the airplane so I can have a lot
more<00:01:49.450> control<00:01:49.780> my<00:01:50.649> work<00:01:50.829> really<00:01:51.009> isn't<00:01:51.310> all

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.410

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
that pretty but it works I did find that

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.289 
that pretty but it works I did find that
I<00:01:56.610> could<00:01:57.610> have<00:01:57.729> gone<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:57.969> hadn't<00:01:58.180> done<00:01:58.270> a

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
I could have gone it hadn't done a

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.740 
I could have gone it hadn't done a
better<00:01:58.509> job<00:01:59.250> and<00:02:00.250> not<00:02:00.549> have<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.880> remove<00:02:01.240> the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
better job and not have to remove the

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.020 
better job and not have to remove the
elevator<00:02:02.170> if<00:02:02.649> I<00:02:02.799> just<00:02:03.039> taken<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.460> foam<00:02:03.670> block

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
elevator if I just taken the foam block

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.630 
elevator if I just taken the foam block
that<00:02:04.240> I<00:02:04.299> was<00:02:04.509> using<00:02:04.689> and<00:02:05.189> pinned<00:02:06.189> it<00:02:06.280> directly

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
that I was using and pinned it directly

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.009 
that I was using and pinned it directly
to<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:06.880> airplane<00:02:07.299> while<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.539> was<00:02:07.719> doing<00:02:07.810> the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
to the airplane while I was doing the

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.160 
to the airplane while I was doing the
glue<00:02:08.200> keep<00:02:08.799> in<00:02:08.950> mind<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.280> keep<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.869> wax<00:02:10.869> paper

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
glue keep in mind to keep the wax paper

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.199 
glue keep in mind to keep the wax paper
between<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.370> would<00:02:12.850> not<00:02:12.970> have<00:02:13.090> had

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
between that I would not have had

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.300 
between that I would not have had
removed<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.799> elevator<00:02:14.799> so<00:02:14.950> if<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.100> do<00:02:15.220> it

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
removed the elevator so if you do it

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.340 
removed the elevator so if you do it
yourself<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:16.420> use<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.630> phone<00:02:16.810> block<00:02:17.049> could

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
yourself just use the phone block could

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.470 
yourself just use the phone block could
it<00:02:17.440> directly<00:02:17.829> on<00:02:18.820> their<00:02:19.060> wallets<00:02:19.329> on<00:02:19.450> the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
it directly on their wallets on the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.080 
it directly on their wallets on the
plane<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.019> it<00:02:20.200> should<00:02:20.380> work<00:02:20.470> out<00:02:20.650> for<00:02:20.890> you

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
plane and it should work out for you

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:30.430 
plane and it should work out for you
anyway<00:02:22.090> good<00:02:22.540> luck

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440
