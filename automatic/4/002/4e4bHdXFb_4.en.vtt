00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.640
 hello very welcome to the channel that 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.410
 Family is great but good 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.570
 as you see today I bring you a video that 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.849
 you have gone a lot more firewood the voice 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.129
 as a piece I've asked a lot of this 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.340
 video and how they have the center 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.380
 from a recommendation of my brushes 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.800
 favorites are the ones that I recommend 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.349
 personally from zoé will continue a lot 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.000
 of brushes of precisely this brand and 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.640
 Well, we've all been crazy with it and 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.630
 but it is true that I under my 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.390
 point of view if you have to choose 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.130
 some kind of concrete brush or you have 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.780
 to start now choose brushes because 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.580
 you do not have or anything I'm going to 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.270
 recommend the ones that I think are 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.920
 basic and most necessary within the 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.350
 toilet and what we need to the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.790
 time to make makeups so if 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.740
 I'm interested in this video I 'll be here 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.480
 I'm going to start well, I'm going to start 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.770
 talking about the face I do not want 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.870
 roll too much and I do not want to 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.210
 teach a lot for you to tell us and 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.399
 in particular of faces I will teach 3 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.230
 what are these three here the first 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.200
 what I want to teach is about this is 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.850
 the one hundred and 27 finish and well then 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.960
 They'll forgive me being a little dirty 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.520
 see that he has used him 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.920
 moment and well I did not want either 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.170
 I would leave this video longer as you see 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.850
 It's a super tight fight 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.850
 you're cut redondito I think it's 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.229
 similar to the sigma f 82 and well then 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.210
 As you can see is a brush of these type 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.240
 kabuki with very preto hair that has 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.240
 a lot of density is very rounded very 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.680
 soft super soft I can assure you and 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.560
 it's one of the gaps that to me more 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.060
 like to put to apply the base and 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.190
 all this because I think it leaves her 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.320
 super integrated in the skin and highly polished 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.630
 you know that normally I applied the 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.240
 bases to circles and is gross in 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.890
 concrete, it seems like a pass for that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.750
 so I think it would be one of the 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.790
 necessary to apply the basis of 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.650
 face 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.910
 the third brush that I want to show you 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.490
 it's for proofreader it's about the 142 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.830
 concealer bayern and as you can see it looks like 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.410
 the previous thing taught before but it is 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.060
 the smallest is also the cut 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.040
 rounded also stupid and is very 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.800
 preta and I say that the hair is 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.660
 equally soft like the previous 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.180
 it does not leave expression lines either 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.650
 that I forgot to say before and the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.180
 truth is that it leaves corrector super good 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.620
 integrated in the area of ​​the eye 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.420
 for him I usually where I use it 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.850
 and brands of granites or any 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.310
 marquita that we want to cover and others and 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.290
 finally I want to teach this fight that 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.950
 apart from being one of the treasures of 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.840
 ceiba 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.930
 I find it very versatile because it would be 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.540
 a three in one basically I say 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.110
 because good this is the 101 looks 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.350
 face defined and as you can see is this 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.660
 White broach that ends up in flame 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.340
 on tiptoe it is also quite dense 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.160
 although much more loose than the previous 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.959
 and I say that this is in one precisely 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.700
 because this brush and that's why in the 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.410
 more face design 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.560
 It is perfectly valid and as it ends in point 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.260
 to contour the face is perfect 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.000
 because it's just the way to do it 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.890
 in the area of ​​the other pleasures there 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.650
 front under the bone of the cheekbone and 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.480
 others to apply the rouge is love 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.489
 pure love I can assure you because 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.560
 precisely because of the form it has and 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.239
 so lucky you leave it super well 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.700
 lit and super well integrated into the 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.200
 skin is really fantastic that is 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.280
 love this brush and you have it 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.250
 you will understand why it is that it is a 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.480
 last and last for the illuminator 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.069
 that just as well as outlined 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.160
 as it finishes in little prongs without squeezing 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.630
 too much you can apply the illuminator 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.090
 perfectly in the area of ​​the act of 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.640
 cheekbone and nose good the typical 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.019
 points where the illuminator is applied like this 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.630
 I think it's a brush stroke with 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.380
 this brush you have three in one and of 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.870
 true that is a must that or basic 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.810
 in our our dressing table for 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.549
 continue with the eyes in this case 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.140
 I'm going to show you four and I'm telling you 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.299
 as they are basic then you can already 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.110
 get out of that range and then I do not know to 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.540
 choose the ones you want 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.400
 but in my case I'm going to show you this one 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.790
 here that is just one I think it is 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.740
 basic and gap the 234 smoking looks 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.060
 shader I will leave you in the numbers of 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.680
 all the things that I'm going to get out here 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.230
 below written in case you need it to 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.180
 look for it and so on and it 's like it said it's 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.240
 a brush then of the most basic 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.920
 there is this is the tongue of the cat 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.010
 white planet as you see is also from 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.890
 natural hair and this is one of the clones 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.310
 of the others that I do not remember right now 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.350
 if the 237 the two is that I get confused 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.240
 but yes it is chronic and Matt's is 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.760
 to apply shadows and also 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.530
 It is a basic that takes very well the 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.780
 shadow works great and deposits 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.000
 very well in the eye another one that I think 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.190
 very basic and you need it yes or yes 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.840
 because to blur cuts and so on is 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.910
 necessary is the 227 soft of fainé and 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.040
 Well, this one is another clone 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.700
 of besides blurring this I think it is 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.569
 the clone 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.939
 22 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:58.459
 I do not remember I am today this sack 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:03.229
 numbers but good is the big 

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:05.179
 the 217 is if the 217 and envy and then 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.309
 that is to diffuse has expert loose 

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:09.009
 it is also but natural and good 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:10.779
 as you see 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.999
 simply without mystery to blur 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:15.099
 shadows I think it's super necessary and not 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:17.080
 take a squad in the eye and it's 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.580
 the ones that count most to me super smooth and 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.610
 I really like how they work 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.259
 shades another basic brush and that to me 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.360
 I like it a lot because I give it a lot of use 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.939
 and varied it's also about this gap 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.279
 so tiny that you see here is the 230 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:32.199
 pencil and good as you see in a 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:34.539
 super-tiny night ends up on tip 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.550
 Boli as its name indicates and on tiptoe 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:40.270
 As you can see, it is also very dark though 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.180
 has the good density just and that 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.759
 is not super stiff and good, well 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.669
 This brush also looks like a brush 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.949
 basic because if you like or are lovers 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.659
 of applying one under the eyelashes 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.129
 lower or to apply shade 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.379
 perfectly also goes for 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:59.199
 blur pencil either up or down 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:01.809
 blur outlined above in short I 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:04.330
 really like I'm going to teach these two 

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:06.969
 to teach together practically because 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.520
 they are something to delineate once cut 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:12.849
 bevelled and another is fine-tipped the 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.879
 beveled cut is the 317 week 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.709
 this is also clone of the mac 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:20.120
 it's exactly the same do not tell me the 

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:21.770
 number because I remember it again 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.229
 and well, as you can see, it's a little bag 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.610
 bevelled planet super finite also 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:28.220
 very soft if you are used to 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.139
 to do is the drawing with a brush 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.620
 beveled to look great has a 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:35.449
 very thin line of affinity leaves you the very 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.850
 perfect and it also makes it very finite 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.770
 precisely because of the hair so tight and 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.500
 so soft he has and the other brush 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.750
 that I have told you before in the 315 fine 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.690
 line air and as you can see it is super 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.550
 finite has four experts and good is 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.550
 as you see this time you are seeing in 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:55.699
 general has the losses also very 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.120
 cortitas and has the beta but also what 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:00.789
 just to be able to do the delineation 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.740
 that is not used to doing it with 

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:05.930
 you are beveled or great family 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.910
 also because, in my opinion, having 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.949
 this form is thus doubled and facilitates 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.650
 much the delineated especially when doing 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:13.910
 puntita and others and I like it very much 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.100
 I use both equally 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.380
 practically and I recommend them without a doubt 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.030
 and well as you can see it is not a long video 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.919
 I did not want to wind up teaching the 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.830
 300,000 shadows precisely because of that 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:27.020
 because if it's a start you need 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.450
 the concrete basics I think it's a 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.100
 foolish to put me to say then this side 

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.950
 deal in is great because it 's work 

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.690
 for me, it's the basic ones that with the 

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.360
 what should you start with and with 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.280
