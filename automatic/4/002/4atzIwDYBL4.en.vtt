00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
chords I'm one of the first times we

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.620 
chords I'm one of the first times we
really<00:00:54.200> need<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.500> get<00:00:54.590> down<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:55.130> play<00:00:58.630> ones

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
really need to get down to play ones

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.170 
really need to get down to play ones
like<00:00:59.900> this<00:01:00.050> that<00:01:00.260> are<00:01:00.350> in<00:01:00.500> a<00:01:00.710> dropped<00:01:01.180> detuning

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
like this that are in a dropped detuning

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.960 
like this that are in a dropped detuning
so<00:01:02.540> I've<00:01:02.600> got<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:02.780> 6-3<00:01:03.080> tune<00:01:03.410> down<00:01:03.590> to<00:01:03.770> D<00:01:04.009> but

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
so I've got a 6-3 tune down to D but

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.600 
so I've got a 6-3 tune down to D but
they<00:01:05.900> tend<00:01:06.229> to<00:01:06.320> use<00:01:06.560> this<00:01:06.770> tuning<00:01:07.220> for<00:01:07.400> songs

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
they tend to use this tuning for songs

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.420 
they tend to use this tuning for songs
not<00:01:07.910> even<00:01:08.210> in<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.420> key<00:01:08.600> of<00:01:08.630> D<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:09.430> that

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
not even in the key of D and that

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.999 
not even in the key of D and that
creates<00:01:10.790> a<00:01:10.940> new<00:01:11.150> form<00:01:11.660> for<00:01:12.110> Barre<00:01:12.320> chords<00:01:12.800> that

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
creates a new form for Barre chords that

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.340 
creates a new form for Barre chords that
is<00:01:13.130> different<00:01:13.610> from<00:01:13.759> our<00:01:13.970> standard<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.690> shape<00:01:15.110> a

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
is different from our standard a shape a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.160 
is different from our standard a shape a
family<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.310> family<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:17.119> this<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:17.869> really

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
family and a family and this is really

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.359 
family and a family and this is really
the<00:01:18.350> D<00:01:18.590> family

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
the D family

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.790 
the D family
so<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:19.910> chord<00:01:20.300> that<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:20.479> worth<00:01:20.750> getting<00:01:21.170> down<00:01:21.380> to

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
so a chord that is worth getting down to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.760 
so a chord that is worth getting down to
