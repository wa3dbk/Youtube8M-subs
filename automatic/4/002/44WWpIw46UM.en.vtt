00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 we always go over the achievements and 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.109
 trophies we do not care about are a 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.260
 foolish but well that we sting 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.599
 once in a while it 's good no no because it happened 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.580
 of achievements and trophies good only 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.619
 once in a while he only wears white and 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.550
 here starts your daily fix of the first of 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.550
 July 2014 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.230
 we have seen that the achievements serve to 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.300
 something more than bragging they give discounts on 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.650
 xbox live but of course they also give us 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.480
 clues about what we're going to 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.940
 find in the games before you 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.010
 come out that if it turns out that someone is 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.960
 dedicate to release them online and of course 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.270
 we are not going to be the ones who put 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.760
 doors to the field you want to know what 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.890
 achievements and trophies will bring destination for 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.870
 take a look at the list because it 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.270
 you really notice the experience for something in 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.739
 bungee saw the achievements and were 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.050
 responsible for some really 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.150
 difficult 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.730
 we continue with achievements but this is limited 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.530
 to xbox one is to say nothing of trophies for 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.470
 here that has now passed into territory 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.449
 microsoft then continue to reform and 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.909
 let's see our progress in xbox 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.920
 dotcom on their website something that had us a 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.470
 little fly since xbox one went out to 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.630
 market almost 8 months ago because to see 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.760
 what is the reason why we can not see 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.890
 our achievements from the pc because 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.840
 only our xbox advances appeared 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.760
 360 and pc 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.620
 according to major nelson the reason is not other 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.510
 that priorities have to do 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.700
 many things from scratch and that's 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.600
 to recreate us on your website should not seem 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.640
 priority 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.090
 whom they will have asked to decide 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.200
 these things the zombie games do not 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.299
 they take no respite 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.759
 we want to see something more of dead island 2 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.860
 after a spectacular trailer dei 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.930
 set are still the first steam 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.020
 although it is not yet a cataloged game 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.350
 as commercial and sony warns us that 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.750
 h1 z1 is going to start its pre alpha phase is 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.759
 say that you can play a little more and 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.380
 there will be lucky that I cut it in the 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.539
 results of this testing phase 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.399
 will serve to channel the development and 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.560
 start optimizing the design of many 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.429
 You do not expect a game 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.319
 complete because it's not about that yet 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.360
 patch that has been running for a month 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.640
 battlefield 4 has made us shut up 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.650
 we have stopped complaining a little bit 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.050
 so much for the rubber effect although at 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.569
 better in this has also been influenced by the e3 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.670
 2014 the announcement of battlefield hard line 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.280
 and that it starts to make heat cited from 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.470
 pool at least around here said this the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.569
 from there they warn of new improvements that 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.310
 your network code will still improve and that 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.160
 we will experience it in the expansion 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.690
 dragon steve is incorporated into the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.730
 definitive elimination of 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.280
 shield and some trap doors that 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.140
 they unbalanced the balance besides us 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.020
 they say that all the experience collected 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.660
 it will look in online battlefield will have 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.560
 this a smooth release without complaints and 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.210
 that satisfies the shareholders this has 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.040
 been all in today and today's fix remember 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.050
 that you can see them online in ig in 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.240
