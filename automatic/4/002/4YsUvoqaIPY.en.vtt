00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:08.170
 a huge hello to everyone and today's video 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:10.720
 I want to show you how to use 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.570
 atomizer for perfume that is such 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.289
 Here is the analogue of the failure which ordered on 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.119
 buyincoins website as directly 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.320
 upload his spirit that is such 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.109
 visual material 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.900
 all who are interested stay with me 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.659
 a link to this failure and I will leave below 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.860
 where you can order it if you wish 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:34.930
 and so generally grass is needed in order 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.230
 in your purse wear your favorite fragrance 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:42.520
 me this is a fragrance in this case from 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.130
 lanvin eclat d'arpege means to 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.400
 small version of this version to wear it to 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.230
 update it for the day so let's 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.640
 Now let's see clearly how 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.030
 we actually download it there 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:03.850
 the spirit 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:08.859
 so at the spirits we open the lid itself 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:14.579
 and this one this thing we shoot this way 

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:17.920
 we get here is such a pilot pin 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:21.700
 here at the very grass la here from this side 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.969
 from the bottom so I hope you can see here 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.880
 there is such a hole here and now we 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.409
 We will be with you on this hole so I will take off 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.020
 cover but this is not necessary 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.469
 I just feel more comfortable with this 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.969
 you on this hole now 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:46.899
 we put the spirit like that 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:52.479
 movements fill the flavor there that is 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:56.549
 and you can see now that we will focus 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.549
 the content fills up there 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.810
 so let's just continue on like this 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.390
 progressive movements as it were 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.209
 we pump the spirit inside that is with us 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.080
 the fragrance does not spill as can be seen 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:21.390
 all not a bit far past 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:23.700
 all we have poured into the bottle well here 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.590
 in general, I will be such an amount 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.049
 enough can also it like this 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.160
 do right here so put on 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:35.220
 table and so here it is there 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.959
 upload at the same time will be much 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.510
 more comfortable here I poured 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:46.349
 I can see the whole whole bottle 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.250
 I like to pump you like this 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:53.160
 your own one got dirty with your favorite scent 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.000
 in such a small mini version I wear it in 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.609
