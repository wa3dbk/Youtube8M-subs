in the Dropbox folder I've shared with

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.150 
in the Dropbox folder I've shared with
you<00:00:09.179> there<00:00:09.870> will<00:00:09.990> be<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.110> folder<00:00:10.469> called<00:00:10.710> models

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
you there will be a folder called models

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.680 
you there will be a folder called models
within<00:00:11.490> which<00:00:11.790> they're<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> couple<00:00:12.269> models

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
within which they're a couple models

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.259 
within which they're a couple models
that<00:00:13.440> we'll<00:00:13.830> be<00:00:13.920> using<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.280> some<00:00:15.030> kind<00:00:15.240> of

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
that we'll be using for some kind of

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.609 
that we'll be using for some kind of
essentially<00:00:15.509> training<00:00:15.990> examples

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
essentially training examples

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.950 
essentially training examples
I'll<00:00:17.130> also<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.460> saving<00:00:17.850> versions<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.840> this

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
I'll also be saving versions of this

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.230 
I'll also be saving versions of this
blend<00:00:19.289> file<00:00:19.590> along<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.250> way<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.670> putting

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
blend file along the way and putting

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.009 
blend file along the way and putting
them<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> training<00:00:22.020> dot<00:00:22.380> blends<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.869> I've

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
them in the training dot blends so I've

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.900 
them in the training dot blends so I've
already<00:00:25.230> loaded<00:00:25.380> up<00:00:25.619> these<00:00:25.769> models<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.340> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
already loaded up these models but the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.970 
already loaded up these models but the
ones<00:00:27.060> are<00:00:27.150> gonna<00:00:27.269> be<00:00:27.359> working<00:00:27.689> with<00:00:27.720> are<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
ones are gonna be working with are the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.349 
ones are gonna be working with are the
same<00:00:29.010> ones<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.820> been<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.029> all<00:00:30.210> my<00:00:30.330> other

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
same ones that have been in all my other

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.160 
same ones that have been in all my other
videos<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:32.300> because<00:00:33.300> things<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.750> changed

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
videos just because things have changed

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.540 
videos just because things have changed
a<00:00:34.230> little<00:00:34.350> bit<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.590> figured<00:00:34.950> I'd<00:00:35.040> work<00:00:35.250> through

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
a little bit I figured I'd work through

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.190 
a little bit I figured I'd work through
this<00:00:35.640> whole<00:00:35.850> example<00:00:36.210> one<00:00:36.660> more<00:00:36.870> time<00:00:37.050> from

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
this whole example one more time from

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.440 
this whole example one more time from
starting<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.620> finish<00:00:37.920> using<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.969> current

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
starting to finish using the current

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.900 
starting to finish using the current
interface<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:41.190> these<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.550> two<00:00:41.700> models

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
interface so these are the two models

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.380 
interface so these are the two models
which<00:00:42.329> I've<00:00:42.770> already<00:00:43.770> imported<00:00:44.760> into<00:00:45.090> blender

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
which I've already imported into blender

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.430 
which I've already imported into blender
so<00:00:45.809> you'll<00:00:45.989> want<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.200> hit<00:00:46.320> space<00:00:47.750> import<00:00:48.750> STL

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
so you'll want to hit space import STL

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.240 
so you'll want to hit space import STL
navigate<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.610> folder<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:52.129> bring<00:00:53.129> in

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
navigate to that folder and bring in

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.930 
navigate to that folder and bring in
these<00:00:53.399> two<00:00:53.579> models<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:56.520> first<00:00:56.699> thing<00:00:56.820> we'll

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
these two models the first thing we'll

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.889 
these two models the first thing we'll
do<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.059> drop<00:00:57.420> down<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> design<00:00:58.109> parameters

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
do is drop down the design parameters

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.299 
do is drop down the design parameters
we'll<00:01:00.899> select<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> models<00:01:02.190> by

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
we'll select one of the models by

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.799 
we'll select one of the models by
right-clicking<00:01:02.730> let<00:01:03.180> me<00:01:03.239> notice<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.660> it's

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
right-clicking let me notice that it's

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.039

highlighted in red and this is the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.140 
highlighted in red and this is the
opposing<00:01:07.500> model<00:01:07.770> I'll<00:01:08.520> make<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
opposing model I'll make that the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.760

highlight in red
we'll<00:01:17.520> make<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.030> master<00:01:18.509> model<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.860> you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
we'll make that the master model and you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.440 
we'll make that the master model and you
notice<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.400> feedback<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.299> these

the<00:01:32.759> outliner<00:01:33.150> will<00:01:33.780> allow<00:01:33.930> us<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.200> work<00:01:34.350> on

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the outliner will allow us to work on

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.260 
the outliner will allow us to work on
multiple<00:01:34.710> restorations<00:01:35.520> at<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> same<00:01:36.000> time

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
multiple restorations at the same time

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.240 
multiple restorations at the same time
later<00:01:37.460> these<00:01:38.460> parameters<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.090> all<00:01:39.240> fine<00:01:39.509> and

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
later these parameters are all fine and

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.499 
later these parameters are all fine and
lock<00:01:41.250> out<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.579> now<00:01:41.729> automatic<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> gets

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
lock out is now automatic it gets

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.120 
lock out is now automatic it gets
blocked<00:01:42.899> out<00:01:43.110> no<00:01:43.290> matter<00:01:43.409> what<00:01:43.500> whether<00:01:44.009> you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
blocked out no matter what whether you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.120 
blocked out no matter what whether you
check<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.460> or<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:46.110> kind<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
check this or not so this is a kind of a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
check this or not so this is a kind of a
vestigial<00:01:47.640> piece<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.810> will<00:01:48.960> get

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
vestigial piece and that will get

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.590 
vestigial piece and that will get
cleaned<00:01:49.350> out<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> next<00:01:50.280> update<00:01:52.130> okay

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
cleaned out in the next update okay

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.749 
cleaned out in the next update okay
we're<00:01:54.600> working<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.020> tooth<00:01:55.290> number<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:56.430> six

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
we're working on tooth number one six

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.109 
we're working on tooth number one six
and<00:01:57.000> that's<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.860> international<00:01:59.119> quadrant

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
and that's the international quadrant

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.649 
and that's the international quadrant
and<00:02:00.299> then<00:02:00.479> distance<00:02:01.320> from<00:02:01.469> Center<00:02:02.030> system<00:02:03.030> so

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659

okay<00:02:13.410> one<00:02:13.890> other<00:02:14.070> bug<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.580> I've<00:02:14.730> found<00:02:15.240> as

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
okay one other bug that I've found as

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.990 
okay one other bug that I've found as
you<00:02:15.600> can't<00:02:15.870> move<00:02:16.650> your<00:02:16.860> 3d<00:02:17.220> cursor<00:02:17.490> at<00:02:17.820> this

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
you can't move your 3d cursor at this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.690 
you can't move your 3d cursor at this
step<00:02:18.270> if<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.600> do<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.110> then<00:02:19.440> rotate<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.160> model

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
step if you do and then rotate the model

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.280 
step if you do and then rotate the model
to<00:02:20.820> where<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.060> want<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.390> be<00:02:21.510> things<00:02:22.080> won't

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
to where you want it to be things won't

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.560 
to where you want it to be things won't
work<00:02:22.380> out<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.740> next<00:02:23.070> step<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.880> for<00:02:24.090> now<00:02:24.210> make

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
work out the next step so for now make

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.780 
work out the next step so for now make
sure<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.780> hit<00:02:24.900> shift<00:02:25.170> see<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:26.400> your<00:02:26.550> cursor

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
sure you hit shift see that your cursor

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.580 
sure you hit shift see that your cursor
is<00:02:26.940> centered<00:02:31.820> now<00:02:32.900> rotate<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.110> models<00:02:34.440> let's

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
is centered now rotate the models let's

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.740 
is centered now rotate the models let's
say<00:02:34.680> you're<00:02:34.830> looking<00:02:35.010> down<00:02:35.450> along<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
say you're looking down along the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.949 
say you're looking down along the
insertion<00:02:37.290> axis<00:02:38.900> R<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.410> then<00:02:40.530> Y<00:02:40.940> are<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.510> then

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
insertion axis R and then Y are and then

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:49.880 
insertion axis R and then Y are and then
Z<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:47.430> we<00:02:47.580> want<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.910> align<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:49.410> mesial<00:02:49.860> distal

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
Z and we want to align the mesial distal

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.720 
Z and we want to align the mesial distal
direction<00:02:50.640> in<00:02:51.200> X<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.620> that's<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:53.580> take

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
direction in X and that's to take

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.699 
direction in X and that's to take
advantage<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.360> screen<00:02:54.660> real<00:02:54.840> estate<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.290> also

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
advantage of screen real estate and also

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.130 
advantage of screen real estate and also
when<00:02:56.400> we're<00:02:56.580> applying<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.150> dynamic<00:02:57.660> contacts

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
when we're applying the dynamic contacts

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.000 
when we're applying the dynamic contacts
if<00:02:58.500> it's<00:02:59.310> set<00:02:59.550> as<00:02:59.730> X<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.959> makes<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.890> lot

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
if it's set as X that makes it a lot

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.850 
if it's set as X that makes it a lot
easier<00:03:02.510> so<00:03:03.510> now<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.170> aligned

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
easier so now that this is aligned

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.670 
easier so now that this is aligned
before<00:03:05.160> we<00:03:05.640> center<00:03:06.239> our<00:03:06.360> view<00:03:06.600> here<00:03:06.900> we<00:03:07.500> want

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
before we center our view here we want

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.210 
before we center our view here we want
to<00:03:07.770> set<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.100> axis<00:03:09.530> now<00:03:10.530> we<00:03:10.590> can<00:03:10.800> sit<00:03:10.980> on<00:03:11.010> our

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
to set the axis now we can sit on our

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.720 
to set the axis now we can sit on our
view<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.930> what<00:03:13.709> we<00:03:13.770> want<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.950> do<00:03:14.070> now<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.310> split

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
view and what we want to do now is split

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.160 
view and what we want to do now is split
this<00:03:14.910> model<00:03:15.300> up<00:03:15.420> into<00:03:15.660> kind<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.870> smaller

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
this model up into kind of smaller

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.539 
this model up into kind of smaller
pieces<00:03:16.410> that'll<00:03:16.860> make<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.010> easier<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.370> work

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
pieces that'll make it easier to work

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.550 
pieces that'll make it easier to work
with<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:17.970> if<00:03:18.750> your<00:03:18.870> computer<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.320> running<00:03:19.350> a

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
with and if your computer is running a

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.259 
with and if your computer is running a
little<00:03:19.650> slow<00:03:19.890> after<00:03:20.519> this<00:03:20.670> step<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:21.090> should

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
little slow after this step it should

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.420 
little slow after this step it should
speed<00:03:21.570> up<00:03:21.600> significantly<00:03:25.100> okay<00:03:26.100> so<00:03:26.160> there's

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
speed up significantly okay so there's

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.590 
speed up significantly okay so there's
several<00:03:26.610> ways<00:03:26.790> we<00:03:26.940> can<00:03:27.060> do<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:30.420> first

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
several ways we can do this the first

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.110 
several ways we can do this the first
thing<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.840> want<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.019> select<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:32.489> distal

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
thing you want to select is the distal

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.120 
thing you want to select is the distal
surface<00:03:33.269> of<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.720> mesial<00:03:34.080> tooth<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.980> can

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
surface of the mesial tooth you can

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.470 
surface of the mesial tooth you can
select<00:03:35.250> as<00:03:35.430> much<00:03:35.610> as<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.760> bit<00:03:35.880> as<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.000> want<00:03:36.269> but

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
select as much as a bit as you want but

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.500 
select as much as a bit as you want but
I<00:03:36.510> find<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.900> I've<00:03:37.590> just<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.040> area<00:03:38.280> here<00:03:38.700> and

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
I find that I've just this area here and

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.900 
I find that I've just this area here and
we<00:03:39.930> can<00:03:40.140> hit<00:03:40.350> C<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:41.430> circle<00:03:41.820> select<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:44.370> scroll

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
we can hit C to circle select and scroll

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.530 
we can hit C to circle select and scroll
up<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.989> select<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:47.370> but<00:03:47.670> what<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:47.910> find<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.360> easy

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
up and select it but what I find is easy

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.449 
up and select it but what I find is easy
especially<00:03:49.110> when<00:03:49.410> contacts<00:03:49.920> been<00:03:50.100> broken

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
especially when contacts been broken

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.370 
especially when contacts been broken
nice<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:50.790> cleanly<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.570> hit<00:03:51.780> B<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:55.230> can

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
nice and cleanly you hit B you can

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.960 
nice and cleanly you hit B you can
select<00:03:55.560> just<00:03:55.799> like<00:03:56.070> you<00:03:56.190> would<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.610> many

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
select just like you would and many

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.890 
select just like you would and many
other<00:03:57.180> programs<00:03:59.390> also<00:04:00.390> at<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:00.600> time<00:04:00.660> you

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
other programs also at this time you

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.690 
other programs also at this time you
want<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.049> make<00:04:01.200> sure<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:02.250> little

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
want to make sure that this little

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.780 
want to make sure that this little

skimpy with your selections can you know

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.030 
skimpy with your selections can you know
get<00:04:31.960> more<00:04:32.170> of<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:32.320> tooth<00:04:32.500> but<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.830> doesn't
