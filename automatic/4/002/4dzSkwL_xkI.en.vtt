it<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> nicer<00:00:49.739> manner<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:51.149> I'm<00:00:51.420> using

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
it it is in a nicer manner so I'm using

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.529 
it it is in a nicer manner so I'm using
the<00:00:52.170> tangle<00:00:52.620> teezer<00:00:52.860> which<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.489> sort<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.329> like

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the tangle teezer which is sort of like

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.580 
the tangle teezer which is sort of like
a<00:00:54.570> comb

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.470

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
around the nape area I'm going to take
this<00:01:28.360> much<00:01:28.660> of<00:01:28.900> a<00:01:29.050> section<00:01:29.649> of<00:01:29.830> hair<00:01:30.790> I<00:01:31.210> don't

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
take a lot of it just take a little bit

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.230 
take a lot of it just take a little bit
the<00:01:34.869> amount<00:01:35.410> that<00:01:35.560> I'm<00:01:35.710> taking<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.310> all<00:01:37.119> you

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
the amount that I'm taking and all you

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.529 
the amount that I'm taking and all you
have<00:01:37.390> to<00:01:37.509> do<00:01:37.660> is<00:01:37.979> take<00:01:38.979> it<00:01:39.009> from<00:01:39.399> this<00:01:39.640> angle<00:01:39.820> to

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
have to do is take it from this angle to

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.990 
have to do is take it from this angle to
this<00:01:40.780> angle<00:01:40.840> because<00:01:41.740> you<00:01:41.860> will<00:01:42.100> be<00:01:42.280> reading

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
this angle because you will be reading

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.290 
this angle because you will be reading
it<00:01:43.390> in<00:01:43.720> that<00:01:44.560> angle<00:01:44.890> then<00:01:45.670> brush<00:01:46.090> your<00:01:46.270> hair

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
it in that angle then brush your hair

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.749 
it in that angle then brush your hair
this<00:01:46.960> particular<00:01:47.440> portion<00:01:47.619> is<00:01:47.830> crucial<00:01:48.430> so

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
this particular portion is crucial so

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.450 
this particular portion is crucial so
brush<00:01:49.060> it<00:01:49.240> out<00:01:49.420> whenever<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.930> can<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:50.470> now

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
brush it out whenever you can and now

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.719 
brush it out whenever you can and now
I'm<00:01:51.610> going<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:51.850> divide<00:01:51.940> this<00:01:52.330> part<00:01:52.630> into<00:01:53.080> three

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
I'm going to divide this part into three

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:02.580 
I'm going to divide this part into three
with<00:01:54.729> my<00:01:54.880> fingers<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.700> I<00:02:01.000> have<00:02:01.479> this<00:02:01.810> into

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
with my fingers so I have this into

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.529 
with my fingers so I have this into
three<00:02:02.860> parts<00:02:03.069> and<00:02:03.429> then<00:02:04.000> I'm<00:02:04.119> going<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.300> start

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
three parts and then I'm going to start

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.900 
three parts and then I'm going to start
braiding<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:05.110> but<00:02:05.740> this<00:02:06.099> braid<00:02:06.429> is<00:02:06.459> going<00:02:06.640> to

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
braiding it but this braid is going to

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.940 
braiding it but this braid is going to
be<00:02:07.030> from<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.720> bottom<00:02:07.869> so<00:02:08.319> you<00:02:08.410> can<00:02:08.440> see<00:02:08.770> I<00:02:08.800> took

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
be from the bottom so you can see I took

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.220 
be from the bottom so you can see I took
that<00:02:09.490> particular<00:02:09.880> portion<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.360> moved<00:02:10.990> it

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
that particular portion and moved it

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.120 
that particular portion and moved it
below<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.069> others<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:14.170> that's<00:02:14.860> what<00:02:15.040> I'm

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
below the others so that's what I'm

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.730 
below the others so that's what I'm
going<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.280> do<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:17.200> I'm<00:02:17.260> going<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.500> do<00:02:17.590> that

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
going to do so I'm going to do that

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.030 
going to do so I'm going to do that
twice<00:02:18.180> braid<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.330> twice<00:02:19.540> like<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.319> then

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
twice braid it twice like that and then

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.589 
twice braid it twice like that and then
I'm<00:02:21.190> going<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.400> start<00:02:21.670> taking<00:02:21.790> extra<00:02:22.270> hair<00:02:22.450> so

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
I'm going to start taking extra hair so

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.059 
I'm going to start taking extra hair so

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
don't want to take a lot of hair in one

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.030 
don't want to take a lot of hair in one
braid<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.730> then<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.420> know<00:03:33.569> like<00:03:34.079> one<00:03:34.709> link

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
braid and then you know like one link

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.789 
braid and then you know like one link
and<00:03:35.280> then<00:03:35.970> very<00:03:36.450> little<00:03:36.810> not<00:03:37.139> the<00:03:37.290> link<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.709> the

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
and then very little not the link of the

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:48.050 
and then very little not the link of the
braid<00:03:45.709> now<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.829> can<00:03:47.010> see<00:03:47.280> I'm<00:03:47.489> doing<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:47.849> on

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
braid now you can see I'm doing this on

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.750 
braid now you can see I'm doing this on
the<00:03:48.239> side<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.379> side<00:03:49.650> is<00:03:49.680> easiest<00:03:50.400> because

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
the side and the side is easiest because

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.780 
the side and the side is easiest because
it's<00:03:51.269> exactly<00:03:52.139> at<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.709> sort<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.190> direction<00:03:53.489> of

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
it's exactly at the sort of direction of

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.479 
it's exactly at the sort of direction of
the<00:03:53.879> hair<00:03:54.060> growth<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:55.019> this<00:03:55.680> side<00:03:55.889> is<00:03:56.010> easier

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
the hair growth so this side is easier

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.479 
the hair growth so this side is easier
and<00:03:57.049> again<00:03:58.049> all<00:03:58.349> you<00:03:58.470> have<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.680> do<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:59.010> mix<00:03:59.310> a

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
and again all you have to do is mix a

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.210 
and again all you have to do is mix a
little<00:03:59.730> bit<00:03:59.879> of<00:03:59.970> hair<00:04:00.209> in<00:04:00.629> one<00:04:00.930> strand<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.590> go

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
little bit of hair in one strand and go

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.399 
little bit of hair in one strand and go
below<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:04.129> do<00:04:05.129> the<00:04:05.310> same<00:04:05.669> on<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.599> upper<00:04:06.900> above

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
strand take a little from above and go

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.379 
strand take a little from above and go
below<00:04:10.319> I'm<00:04:10.709> going<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.250> do<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.519> same<00:04:11.819> in<00:04:12.209> the
