which<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.550> much<00:00:23.760> easier<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.300> bend<00:00:25.039> and<00:00:26.039> I've

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
which is much easier to bend and I've

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.460

do this too quickly peace will break for
this<00:02:58.660> two<00:02:58.810> foot<00:02:59.020> radius<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.560> nail<00:02:59.800> about<00:03:00.070> four

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
this two foot radius I nail about four

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.580 
this two foot radius I nail about four
inches<00:03:00.550> apart<00:03:00.610> in<00:03:01.390> order<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.840> maintain<00:03:02.020> a<00:03:02.260> nice

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
inches apart in order to maintain a nice

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.730

smooth curve of course the curve isn't
really<00:03:06.070> smooth<00:03:06.280> yet<00:03:06.520> but<00:03:07.270> it<00:03:07.390> gets<00:03:07.480> better<00:03:07.750> and

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
really smooth yet but it gets better and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.140 
really smooth yet but it gets better and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
better as a flexible corner bead goes on
