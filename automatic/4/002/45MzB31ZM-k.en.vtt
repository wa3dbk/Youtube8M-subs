00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.930
 hello everyone today I have here the bq 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:15.380
 aquarium 3.5 the small of the family of 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.380
 bq smartphones with its 35 inches of 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.689
 screen is ideal to put it in 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.630
 the pocket and not only for its size but 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.900
 also for its price its 3.5 screen 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.590
 inch ips technology has HVGA 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:35.000
 with a resolution of 480 x 320 pixels 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.030
 and a viewing angle of 178 degrees the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.180
 screen works very smoothly 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.260
 and it's very comfortable to write on it 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.260
 despite the clear size 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.890
 on the front of the aquarium 3.5 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.350
 we have a vga resolution camera 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.719
 to make video conferences and in the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.420
 classic bottom buttons 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.940
 Android to manage the menus in 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.080
 the back the camera 2 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.180
 megapixels 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.250
 at the top the button 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.760
 power off and lock and the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.180
 minijack connection for a headset 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.970
 here we have the microusb connection with the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.120
 that we can connect the aquarium 3.5 to 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.510
 our computer and also recharge it 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.090
 and in this other side we have the 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.630
 volume control but there is one thing 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.060
 even more interesting but it is that it is 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.180
 inside so let's remove the lid and 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.280
 is that aquarium 3.5 is dual without this 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.440
 what does it mean then that you can put two 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.840
 cards without on the device can 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.760
 be from the same operator or different and 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.280
 it's perfect if you want to use 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.650
 example a card for leisure and other 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.120
 for work or just to talk and 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.250
 another for data depending on the 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.350
 rates you want to choose too 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.100
 we have here the 1200 battery 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.240
 milliamps and the microsd card for 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.970
 increase storage capacity 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.680
 internal to manage our cards 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.490
 all we have to do is enter 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.679
 in card management settings 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.860
 and here we see the two sims that we have 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.090
 introduced pepephone and movistar 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.810
 we can put the operator that we want 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.260
 since the device is free 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.360
 in this menu we find the management 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.010
 of voice call that is if we want 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.110
 that every time we make a call 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.540
 voice exit using the card 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.099
 pepephone that of movistar or that we 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.420
 always ask if we are going to do the 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.160
 call 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.489
 we also have the possibility of 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.890
 change the video calls messages or 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.840
 the data connection in this way 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.120
 we will always control the expense 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.190
 depending on the operator and the rate 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.110
 that we have chosen how it could not be 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.819
 otherwise the operating system is 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.690
 Android in its version and the living 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:57.220
 that is 4.2.2 and it is updatable 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.220
 through ota 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.550
 or are you the acronym of verbier that is 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.290
 a distribution service 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.780
 software updates that we 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.970
 allows us to update our device 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.640
 without the need to connect it to a 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.160
 computer in the case of aquariums 3.5 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.110
 we also have a specific application 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.410
 to check the updates 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.810
 what we have from our device 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.400
 also informs us when there is a 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.980
 application without the need for us to enter 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.340
 in this case the device is already 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.980
 updated and informs us of it is 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.450
 important that the updates 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.510
 always do them when the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.450
 notification as they implement improvements 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.750
 of the system and security its processor 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.180
 it is dual core a dual a -7 cortex 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.420
 core to a gigahertz and also has 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.820
 of a Mali 400 graphics processor for 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.680
 improve performance and fluency in 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.680
 your multimedia content and games 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.730
 that a little game 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.660
 but let's stop playing 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.520
 we go to more serious things like 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.030
 example the ram memory giga that 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.070
 integrates the aquarium 3.5 also has 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.230
 of 4 gb of storage capacity 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.380
 in this model that I have in my hand but 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:29.550
 there is also another waris 3.5 model that 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.130
 has 16 gb of internal storage in 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.730
 both models in the box there is a card 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:40.200
 4gb microsd to expand that 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.730
 capacity or 8 or 20 gigas as in other 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.510
 bq devices that I have 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.690
 spoken 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.530
 the aquarius 3.5 comes with the application 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.060
 ex file explorer installed through 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.400
 this application we can find 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.220
 our files so easy either 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.790
 on the device in a network or in the 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.560
 cloud in addition the aquarium is 3.5 is capable 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.030
 to play the most common files 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:09.180
 video text and music image 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.420
 It has bluetooth wifi gps and connection 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.780
 cellular 3g plus that is 14 mb of 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.950
 download data and upload 7.2 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.920
 in addition to this model in black of 8 GB 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.560
 there is this other aquarium 3.5 of 8 gigas 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.270
 blank both black and white models 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.820
 they are also available in the version 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.050
 of 20 gigas 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.090
 these are the accessories and the content 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.840
 what you'll find in the box I had to 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.400

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.150
 other users so do not stop
