00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hi guys, in today's video I'm going to talk 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.049
 about iphone 5 s 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.340
 go first, and I'll stick with 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.929
 the iphone 5 s 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.179
 I know that in the last video was enough 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.769
 who was homesick for iphone 5 etc 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.560
 but I thought he would regret it 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.350
 very back and earphone 51 was 50's too 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.970
 good this is not worth going back in 2014 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.710
 it's not worth buying a cell phone was 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.590
 released in 2012 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.840
 I stayed with him, he's not sorry. 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.390
 mainly because the break 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.279
 here I put as much as possible to be 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.660
 If I can, I 'll talk about the game. 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:41.219
 or soon iPhone 5s if space 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.750
 under the observation that talking about the kites 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.340
 that I have until my black 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.829
 apple some people asked me 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.840
 Who is your film I do not use 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.760

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.840
 leather microfiber that I already spoke in 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.820
 video and have another video. 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.469
 dust cap here acrylic which is a 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.940
 transparent paint is cool because 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.000
 it hides nothing from the design of the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.000
 appliance 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:10.260
 here it's very simple pretty pretty 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.170
 so let's start from the beginning what it is 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.939
 geographic of the break is a tool 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.520
 that you install on your iphone for you 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.229
 open his system that you have one 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.970

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.540
 download social network photo applications 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.090
 and various other things 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.250
 can i give a million examples of cid 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.110
 a shop is a little different than India is 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.549
 this is what you install through 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.460
 of the day break 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.020
 Are you in room tools that you can 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.600
 modify the operation of the system 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.909
 you can download the app you download 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.590
 is one in themes that can change the

 appearance of the icons appears on your 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.659
 phone in the way it works and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.329
 As you may know, I had a lot of 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.409
 I miss 600 r the feedback now that 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.509
 left the bric ps 7.1 break came back 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.890

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.829
 new meets 6 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.110
 so what I did the most here all or 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.929
 to do was to try to bring 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.660

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.660

 for the control in the control center 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.819
 for the great things that have no idea 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.549
 Thats because it 's too much. 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:45.420
 same item archiving management is 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.650

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:58.030
 multimedia messaging network navigation 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:01.329

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.650
 categories that each have more than 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.290
 a lot of things you do to 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.609
 change has to do and fails to 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.870
 put that face on him 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.889
 work the way you want it to 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.389
 run I did a diving break 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:19.530
 The first thing I did was bring 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.639
 back iof the icons 6-15 with 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.739
 1,068 collected maps that for some reason 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.229
 not getting a shaft 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.239
 he basically is if you want to be 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:30.699
 back even takes the icons of some 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.959
 third-party applications like YouTube and 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:37.419
 shows fetch iphone and books pads not there 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.190
 it's the maximum he got it 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.769
 Take what else I did, I put it on. 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.930
 here the final belly continues s6 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:49.150
 I put a battery 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.829
 same as s60 or selection 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.750
 animations that I know she made me 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.639
 very slow I will accelerate them now 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.849
 gets in and out of things much faster 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:04:00.180
 I installed a button in the virtual start 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.489
 a lot of people are just here that the 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.859
 assists touch the assistive control that 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.530
 worries the beginning button that a lot of people 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:11.290
 It's okay to break it, you 're 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.569
 This virtual button is fine here, but it's 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.430
 very boring you have to be using a 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.870
 vital motor like that, right? 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.870
 so what I did 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.710
 I downloaded it if that twiggy is called 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.390
 virtual home only works with 5 s 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.120
 it uses the presence sensor that the button 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.490
 has works when he witnessed the 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.860
 finger on simple to click the button it already 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.840
 leaves it works as a touch on a 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.240
 button turns a virtual button basically 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.160
 little helps the other is very interesting 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.050
 Another thing I installed was close 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.580
 everything instead of closing percent to 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.780
 close applications to pull down 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.580
 once it closes everything that I 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.290
 I've changed the control center now 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.150
 smarter when you're not playing 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.600
 a song it hides the controls 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.600
 music 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.190
 This was just one of the changes I made. 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.380
 I was very conservative not only did I change 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.570
 little system as I changed a bit like 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.640
 model to make you more like 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.010
 that he was your driver 17 but you 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.210
 can do many things many things 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.800
 same 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.100
 Another thing I said was that the 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.590
 beges these notification icons 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.840
 I have a little application now 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.240
 More fitness business is six times 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.760
 a simple red ball that neither 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.520
 this set and came back to the old s6 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.950
 downloaded old dock the s6 has a lot of 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.740
 thing you can do something else 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.810
 What I did was change the keyboard to black. 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.850
 here too the keyboard and black 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.440
 so I changed I put the control 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.150
 also be black aquino 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.430
 here all the other applications here on 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.730
 messaging application for example or 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.680
 on safari now apps in black 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:54.210
 I think it got a little prettier than 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.260
 but I sent the display here 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.720
 operator I put to show nothing 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.010
 I can come in here not even listen 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.050
 what I want to do I if I léo 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.310
 I want it but I do not want it to appear 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.430
 Nothing because it does not matter that 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.140
 appear from the sequel operator and so on 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.890
 goes what allows you to change what 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.330
 you want it on the system and that's all you 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.100
 I sent it I sent it very little I think 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.120
 Why do people find video in the 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.530
 the person who has changed 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.370
 completely the operation of the 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.740
 telephone 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.050
 I was a bit more conservative now 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.230
 How do you do the break day? 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.050
 It's very simple, you just play in the old days. 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.080
 you could only make the jailbreak curious 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.449
 7.07 point did not have to break 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.090
 now there is and I had to choose between 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.069
 or getting spoon 7.0 that was giving me 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.169
 too much crash and slow problem 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:41.370
 installing 7.1 but giving up the 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.169
 Henrique 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.020
 I prefer a good game and downloaded 7 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:48.419
 point but now it is shelter for him 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.090
 so it was perfect for me that you 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:54.120
 does you go on your computer down a 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.490
 only problem of pango and makes day b that 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.340
 You connect if it was not going to take you have a 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.110
 step by step is to download the pango 1.1.0 will 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.069
 thus having the instructions in English is well 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.479
 easy 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:06.240
 the only thing I recommend that you 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:07.469
 makes a backup of your device because it 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.629
 from anything wrong you can 

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:12.060
 restore it in itunes I'll tell it 

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:14.819
 then pick up the backup restore project 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.020
 he was rather alone because the 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:18.120
 jailbreak may have some problems 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.750
 when you give your device so you 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:28.440
 comes here in the password settings and 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:30.990
 You take these yes you come here off 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.449
 or turning off the code is as simple as 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.770
 Did you play? I'll show you. 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:37.529

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.169
