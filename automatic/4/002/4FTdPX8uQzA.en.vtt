00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.290
 and in addition today we find ourselves 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.180
 with a little already a little bit special 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.460
 since already it is a rather rare booster 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.710
 a plasma booster storm the effigy of 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.419
 signa braz but it's not me 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.700
 he bought he comes from teddy 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.050
 who gave it to me for my birthday 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.210
 also for the setting of twenty thousand 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.920
 subscribers then frankly all or 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.629
 vintage and bored one is displayed at 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.379
 The image went to see her doing chain 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.450

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.220

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.380
 very good friend often makes great prices 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.520
 great sales and that's what it's me 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.290
 offered a little booster for my 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.340
 birthday is essential game 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.230
 the opening small age today in 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.400
 your company I left the bottom of 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.140
 the grid because I find that the 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.760
 colors have perfectly with cima braz 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.530
 the blue booster there plasma storms 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.680
 and I hope that today we could 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.120
 get the secret dracaufeu 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.649
 that they keep opening up 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.640
 storm boosters placement a quantity 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.980
 unimaginable 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.659
 he never fired the little secret draco 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.979
 on video me I have not already shot by the 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.140
 past I remember I saw it in a 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.939
 opening of 8 booster and if we 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.859
 got it today in the booster 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.749
 that they offer me I think he would do 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.039
 a heart attack it would really be 

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:16.450
 very very very funny 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.219
 so if we could get it 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.719
 today in this hemisphere just 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.520
 for fun it would be to see that apple 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.170
 good I do not care a bit of everything is said 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.240
 but hey that would be huge I think 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.039
 you agree with me then the back 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.749
 a booster here it is here 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.100
 not to be asked one can be 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:31.810
 calm before this storm 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.939
 Go, I propose you two steps of cage 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.310
 Open this little booster frankly 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.020
 if you pulled out, I'm dying but there 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.249
 you will not understand I really do not 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.709
 of luck right now at the level of 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:42.549
 prints apart in the pokémon janko that 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.619
 had been a long time since I had a 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.209
 as good draw but if today I 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.639
 pulls us and that would be enough 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.829
 incredible and to be honest I do not 

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:52.029
 do not think so, let's go rediscover 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.229
 all the cars of this series that we 

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:55.450
 has not seen for a long time 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.399
 starts with an inch party that is at 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.499
 end of a building there we see in the distance the 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.579
 pokemon center that deep down I hope 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.090
 that he will not wish that he is not 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.020
 suicidal 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:11.750

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.340
 black and white block plasma series you 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.810
 notice the terminals are not 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.730
 yellow as usual they are blue 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.010
 to represent the color of the team 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.750
 good farmer plasma in this case a 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.760
 ant but very very resistant I do not 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.290
