00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.820 
pig I thought that Z is better overall
so<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.330> decided<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.840> pick<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.529> then<00:00:31.679> they

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
so I decided to pick that and then they

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.520

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and all the Q assesses but you get it to

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.550 
and all the Q assesses but you get it to
the<00:02:03.119> game<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.600> your<00:02:03.840> birthday<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.500> then

the game it's your birthday and then
first<00:02:05.250> blood<00:02:05.549> goes<00:02:05.790> down<00:02:06.060> second<00:02:06.810> blood<00:02:06.990> goes

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
first blood goes down second blood goes

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.080 
first blood goes down second blood goes
down<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:08.099> you're<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.369> okay<00:02:08.789> what<00:02:08.940> am<00:02:08.970> I

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
down and then you're like okay what am I

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.540 
down and then you're like okay what am I
gonna<00:02:09.239> do<00:02:09.420> now<00:02:09.539> what<00:02:09.750> did<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.899> do<00:02:10.110> from<00:02:10.319> there

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
gonna do now what did you do from there

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.690 
gonna do now what did you do from there
so

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
so

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.530 
so
this<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.569> usual<00:02:13.690> gambit<00:02:14.170> game<00:02:14.849> when<00:02:15.849> we

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
this is the usual gambit game when we

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.140 
this is the usual gambit game when we
invade<00:02:17.410> on<00:02:17.530> blue<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.860> die<00:02:17.950> again<00:02:18.160> static<00:02:18.430> so

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
invade on blue and die again static so

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.790 
invade on blue and die again static so
it's<00:02:19.450> our<00:02:19.599> tradition<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:22.150> after<00:02:23.080> we<00:02:23.440> lost

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
it's our tradition so after we lost

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.440 
it's our tradition so after we lost
couple<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.340> games<00:02:24.519> like<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.790> we<00:02:25.269> are<00:02:25.330> getting

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
couple of games like that we are getting

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.750 
couple of games like that we are getting
used<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.959> it<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.890> was<00:02:26.920> much<00:02:27.220> easier<00:02:27.400> this

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
used to it so it was much easier this

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.370 
used to it so it was much easier this
time<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:29.830> think<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.940> after<00:02:31.870> like<00:02:32.170> they

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
time and I think that after like they

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.100 
time and I think that after like they
died<00:02:32.590> too<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.130> think<00:02:33.849> that<00:02:33.970> Darren<00:02:34.360> got<00:02:34.690> some<00:02:34.959> of

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
died too I think that Darren got some of

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.539 
died too I think that Darren got some of
experience<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.280> he<00:02:36.580> needed<00:02:36.760> for<00:02:37.390> 1<00:02:37.569> V<00:02:37.720> 2<00:02:37.750> I

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
experience that he needed for 1 V 2 I

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.890 
experience that he needed for 1 V 2 I
expect<00:02:39.549> to<00:02:39.610> get<00:02:39.730> laid<00:02:39.940> two<00:02:40.120> lanes<00:02:40.330> so<00:02:40.599> he<00:02:40.750> lost

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
expect to get laid two lanes so he lost

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.380 
expect to get laid two lanes so he lost
some<00:02:41.080> experience<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.920> overall<00:02:42.879> I<00:02:42.910> think<00:02:43.060> that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
some experience and overall I think that

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.750 
some experience and overall I think that
like<00:02:44.260> okay<00:02:44.590> Gragas<00:02:44.980> could<00:02:45.220> deal<00:02:45.400> with<00:02:45.610> the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
like okay Gragas could deal with the

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.630 
like okay Gragas could deal with the
lane<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.450> think<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:47.110> could<00:02:47.260> do<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.640> overall

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
lane but I think you could do it overall

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.460 
lane but I think you could do it overall
like<00:02:49.000> gragas<00:02:49.390> would<00:02:49.540> be<00:02:49.660> denied<00:02:49.959> less<00:02:50.170> than

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
like gragas would be denied less than

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.309 
like gragas would be denied less than
mundo<00:02:50.799> so<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:52.239> was<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.599> only<00:02:52.870> two<00:02:52.989> kills

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
mundo so this was like only two kills

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.960 
mundo so this was like only two kills
that<00:02:53.440> give<00:02:53.620> less<00:02:53.799> gold<00:02:54.040> then<00:02:54.430> they<00:02:54.610> usually

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
that give less gold then they usually

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.539 
that give less gold then they usually
did<00:02:55.269> so<00:02:55.989> it<00:02:56.170> was<00:02:56.319> okay<00:02:56.680> because<00:02:57.069> they<00:02:57.310> didn't

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
did so it was okay because they didn't

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.069 
did so it was okay because they didn't
even<00:02:57.610> invite<00:02:57.910> our<00:02:58.090> blue<00:02:58.360> or<00:02:58.450> anything<00:02:58.840> so

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
playing it I just thought about it like

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.729 
playing it I just thought about it like
maybe<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:25.630> hero<00:03:25.870> was<00:03:26.019> not<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:26.290> bad<00:03:26.350> as<00:03:26.620> I

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
maybe that hero was not that bad as I

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.420 
maybe that hero was not that bad as I
thought<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.850> I<00:03:28.420> tried<00:03:29.230> him<00:03:29.410> in<00:03:29.530> soloqueue<00:03:30.040> it

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
thought so I tried him in soloqueue it

thought so I tried him in soloqueue it
worked<00:03:30.819> I<00:03:31.209> decided<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.019> try<00:03:32.139> it<00:03:32.200> at<00:03:32.319> LCS<00:03:32.709> yeah

everyone<00:03:55.660> in<00:03:56.230> our<00:03:56.349> team<00:03:56.680> playing<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.069> bit<00:03:57.220> like

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
everyone in our team playing a bit like

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.280 
everyone in our team playing a bit like
stubborn<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:58.060> trying<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.780> face<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.109> face

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
stubborn and trying to face the face

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.160 
stubborn and trying to face the face
enemies<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:00.459> like<00:04:01.329> me<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:01.630> diamonds<00:04:02.019> are<00:04:02.139> the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
enemies so like me and diamonds are the

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.110 
enemies so like me and diamonds are the
only<00:04:02.410> ones<00:04:02.650> that<00:04:02.889> are<00:04:02.980> flanking<00:04:03.489> and<00:04:03.700> going

only ones that are flanking and going
from<00:04:04.299> behind<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.680> it's<00:04:06.370> like<00:04:06.630> backdooring

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
from behind so it's like backdooring

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.740 
from behind so it's like backdooring
