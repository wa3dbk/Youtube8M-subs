Islamic terrorists who are doing these

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.900 
Islamic terrorists who are doing these
things<00:04:12.270> so<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.170> president<00:04:13.500> it's<00:04:14.310> it's<00:04:14.700> not

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
wrong for the president to

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.720 
wrong for the president to
you<00:04:16.750> say<00:04:16.959> we're<00:04:17.200> at<00:04:17.320> peace<00:04:17.560> here<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:18.070> try<00:04:18.670> and

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
you say we're at peace here and try and

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.290 
you say we're at peace here and try and
reach<00:04:19.000> an<00:04:19.150> accord<00:04:19.510> of<00:04:19.810> some<00:04:20.110> kind<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:21.430> think

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
reach an accord of some kind I think

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.270 
reach an accord of some kind I think
however<00:04:22.690> there<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.080> missing<00:04:23.350> element<00:04:23.650> here

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
however there is a missing element here

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.880 
however there is a missing element here
and<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:25.150> missing<00:04:25.480> element<00:04:25.630> is<00:04:26.080> force<00:04:26.440> it

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
and the missing element is force it

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.990 
and the missing element is force it
doesn't<00:04:27.220> mean<00:04:27.310> you<00:04:27.370> have<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.490> use<00:04:27.730> it<00:04:27.880> right

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
doesn't mean you have to use it right

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.940 
doesn't mean you have to use it right
away<00:04:28.150> but<00:04:28.300> you<00:04:28.660> can't<00:04:29.020> take<00:04:29.260> it<00:04:29.410> off<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.740> table

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
away but you can't take it off the table

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.460 
away but you can't take it off the table
you<00:04:30.400> have<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.760> make<00:04:30.910> it<00:04:31.090> clear<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:31.810> this<00:04:32.410> is

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
you have to make it clear that this is

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.350 
you have to make it clear that this is
not<00:04:32.590> an<00:04:32.830> open-ended<00:04:33.430> discussion<00:04:33.850> forever

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
not an open-ended discussion forever

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.510 
not an open-ended discussion forever
because<00:04:34.750> that<00:04:34.960> looks<00:04:35.230> weak<00:04:35.620> in<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:35.950> eyes<00:04:36.160> of

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
because that looks weak in the eyes of

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.050 
because that looks weak in the eyes of
an<00:04:36.670> Islamist<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.560> but<00:04:38.770> if<00:04:39.010> you<00:04:39.490> do<00:04:39.820> it

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
an Islamist and it but if you do it

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.820 
an Islamist and it but if you do it
though<00:04:40.330> I<00:04:40.360> mean<00:04:40.570> I<00:04:40.660> hate<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.110> keep<00:04:41.260> circling

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
though I mean I hate to keep circling

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.010 
though I mean I hate to keep circling
back<00:04:42.250> if<00:04:42.580> you<00:04:42.790> do<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.090> what<00:04:43.270> happens<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.990> our

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
back if you do it what happens to our

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.350 
back if you do it what happens to our
not<00:04:44.590> only<00:04:44.830> in<00:04:44.920> the<00:04:45.040> Islamic<00:04:45.520> world<00:04:45.550> but<00:04:46.030> China

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
not only in the Islamic world but China

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.840 
not only in the Islamic world but China
Russia<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:47.380> think<00:04:47.920> actually<00:04:48.100> some<00:04:48.640> of<00:04:48.730> our

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
Russia I think actually some of our

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.720 
Russia I think actually some of our
closest<00:04:49.300> allies<00:04:49.780> would<00:04:50.260> be<00:04:50.410> upset<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.100> we

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
closest allies would be upset and we

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.220 
closest allies would be upset and we
would<00:04:51.910> cut<00:04:52.360> almost<00:04:52.480> find<00:04:52.780> ourselves<00:04:52.900> out

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
would cut almost find ourselves out

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.930 
would cut almost find ourselves out
there<00:04:53.260> alone<00:04:53.470> in<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:54.040> case<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.250> our<00:04:54.460> closest

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
there alone in the case of our closest

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.280 
there alone in the case of our closest
allies<00:04:55.270> or<00:04:55.450> even<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.750> ones<00:04:55.900> we<00:04:56.020> want<00:04:56.110> our

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
allies or even the ones we want our

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.900 
allies or even the ones we want our
closest<00:04:56.620> alloys<00:04:57.040> let's<00:04:57.370> take<00:04:57.520> a<00:04:57.550> look<00:04:57.730> at<00:04:57.820> the

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
closest alloys let's take a look at the

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.370 
closest alloys let's take a look at the
