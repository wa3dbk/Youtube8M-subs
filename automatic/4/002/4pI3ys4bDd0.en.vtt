00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:14.150
 This is Guilherme Guilherme does not like 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.150
 to do video presentation 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:32.540
 but that's because he does not know how 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:34.280
 make an accurate video presentation 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.770
 be nice to see and achieve 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.980
 transmit your content accurately and 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.170
 efficiency 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.960
 care must be taken with the quality of the 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.180
 image and audio as well as content 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.860
 so that the video does not become a 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.860
 to anyone who sees it 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.040
 do not wait 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.950
 We're here to help you, yes. 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.159
 and guilherme 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:22.430
 first let's the most elementary question 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:24.979
 the choice of the camera is not always the camera 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.549
 more sophisticated is the best option for 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.829
 a simple video presentation 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.320
 these cameras often have 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.329
 more complicated configurations, which 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.450
 can end up more hindering than 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.450
 Helping 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.930
 look for a simpler camera 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.700
 automated settings 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.149
 but I still get a 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.840
 reasonable resolution digital cameras 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.579
 compact can be a good choice 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.979
 make sure they are 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.899
 related options to record at the best 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.920
 possible quality and also the sound 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.969
 chosen the camera 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.969
 Let's go to the recording 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.540
 to start you must choose a place 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.540
 where you can concentrate 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.080
 then you may worry about the 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.350
 positioning of your camera and the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.350
 framework 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.470
 audio is one of the most 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.620
 important 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.400
 so that noise can not be disturbed 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.400
 your capture 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.640
 care with the background is also 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.100
 indispensable 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.070
 neutral neutral funds. 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.990
 very flashy 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.570
 otherwise it may end 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.000
 deconcentrating who watches and divert the 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.660
 attention to the most important of your 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.660
 presentation 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.200
 Now you have to be objective. 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.580
 it would take too long in the presentation 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.140
 explanation or include many 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.960
 information that does not concern 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.810
 directly to your presentation can 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.810
 end up giving sleep to the poor spectator 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.690
 to help 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.490
 focus on the following questions 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.870
 who are you 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:38.580
 how will the course expectations you 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.130
 have for the experience of the trainees everything 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.040
 done see how the final result was 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.750
 in us and for other people and ask 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:53.000
 Good Aguilera's opinion 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.000
 I just was not that hard 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.610
 O 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.670
 the clothes 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.870
 apple 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.780
 the goal set fire 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.980
 O 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:20.000
 It's good
