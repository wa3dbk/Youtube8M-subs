scavenge<00:00:23.640> mechanic<00:00:24.119> now<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.019> mechanic<00:00:25.470> is

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
scavenge mechanic now this mechanic is

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.009 
scavenge mechanic now this mechanic is
part<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.430> golgari<00:00:26.789> tribe<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
part of the golgari tribe that is the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.500 
part of the golgari tribe that is the
black<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.529> green<00:00:28.740> gilled<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.910> return<00:00:30.420> to

black and green gilled in return to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.959 
black and green gilled in return to
ravnica<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:31.769> scavenge<00:00:32.130> does<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.640> less

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
ravnica and what scavenge does is less

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.720 
ravnica and what scavenge does is less
you<00:00:33.410> get<00:00:34.410> some<00:00:34.680> more<00:00:34.860> value<00:00:35.250> from<00:00:35.370> creatures

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
you get some more value from creatures

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.850 
you get some more value from creatures
in<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.969> graveyard<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> two<00:00:37.170> cards<00:00:37.739> that

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
in a graveyard so the two cards that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.440 
in a graveyard so the two cards that
have<00:00:37.950> been<00:00:38.070> spoiled<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.489> far<00:00:38.730> our<00:00:38.969> drag

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
have been spoiled so far our drag

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.250 
have been spoiled so far our drag
Mangler<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.250> dead<00:00:41.250> bridge<00:00:41.460> Goliath<00:00:41.969> now<00:00:42.809> both

Mangler in dead bridge Goliath now both

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.080 
Mangler in dead bridge Goliath now both
of<00:00:43.290> these<00:00:43.440> cards<00:00:43.800> are<00:00:44.040> already<00:00:44.460> super

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
of these cards are already super

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
of these cards are already super
efficient<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.660> their<00:00:45.780> own<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.649> Mangler<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.190> is

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
efficient on their own the Mangler it is

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.330 
efficient on their own the Mangler it is
a<00:00:47.340> 3<00:00:47.670> mana<00:00:47.879> 33<00:00:48.390> hey<00:00:48.539> stir<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.710> Goliath<00:00:50.160> is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
a 3 mana 33 hey stir and the Goliath is

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.389 
a 3 mana 33 hey stir and the Goliath is
a<00:00:50.370> format<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.000> 55<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.050> those<00:00:52.559> are<00:00:52.590> both<00:00:52.920> fine

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
a format of 55 so those are both fine

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.000 
a format of 55 so those are both fine
you<00:00:53.640> know<00:00:53.699> find<00:00:54.090> beaters<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.750> when<00:00:55.739> they<00:00:55.829> both

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
you know find beaters and when they both

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.130 
you know find beaters and when they both
die<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.730> also<00:00:56.910> get<00:00:57.239> some<00:00:57.390> value<00:00:57.750> because<00:00:57.780> you

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
die they also get some value because you

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.049 
die they also get some value because you
can<00:00:58.260> scavenge<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> them<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.160> put<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> bunch<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
can scavenge to them and put a bunch of

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.779 
can scavenge to them and put a bunch of
+1<00:01:00.300> +1<00:01:00.510> counters<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.260> your<00:01:01.410> creatures<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
+1 +1 counters on your creatures so the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.640 
+1 +1 counters on your creatures so the
garden<00:01:03.120> has<00:01:03.180> always<00:01:03.570> been<00:01:04.049> about<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.379> know

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
garden has always been about you know

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.130 
garden has always been about you know
using<00:01:04.949> your<00:01:05.280> graveyard<00:01:05.640> as<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.119> resource<00:01:06.780> and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
using your graveyard as a resource and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.170 
using your graveyard as a resource and
these<00:01:07.500> are<00:01:07.650> no<00:01:07.740> different<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.820> mechanic

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
these are no different and the mechanic

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.109 
these are no different and the mechanic
actually<00:01:09.570> let's<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.049> very<00:01:10.260> simple<00:01:11.119> when

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
actually let's be like very simple when

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.760 
actually let's be like very simple when
you<00:01:12.210> look<00:01:12.330> at<00:01:12.450> them<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:13.380> always<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
you look at them it's it's always a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.070 
you look at them it's it's always a
value<00:01:14.250> card<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.119> don't<00:01:15.540> see<00:01:15.840> them<00:01:16.049> doing

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
value card but I don't see them doing

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.280 
value card but I don't see them doing
that<00:01:16.380> much<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.299> actual<00:01:18.750> mechanic

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that much with the actual mechanic

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.570 
that much with the actual mechanic
because<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.770> know<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.369> put

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
because you know all you can do is put

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.749 
because you know all you can do is put
+1<00:01:20.939> +1<00:01:21.030> counters<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.720> something<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:23.400> best<00:01:23.610> you

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
+1 +1 counters on something the best you

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.120 
+1 +1 counters on something the best you
can<00:01:23.850> probably<00:01:24.150> hope<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.960> someone<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:26.100> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
can probably hope for is someone with a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.920 
can probably hope for is someone with a
variable<00:01:26.460> power<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.939> toughness<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.509> lord

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
variable power and toughness of a lord

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.929 
variable power and toughness of a lord
of<00:01:28.020> extinction<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.520> guy<00:01:29.790> has

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
of extinction and if that guy has

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.270 
of extinction and if that guy has
scavenge<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.750> get<00:01:30.900> pretty<00:01:31.110> crazy<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
scavenge and I can get pretty crazy so

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.660 
scavenge and I can get pretty crazy so
that's<00:01:32.820> about<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.750> only<00:01:34.009> cool<00:01:35.009> design<00:01:35.400> space

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that's about the only cool design space

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.120 
that's about the only cool design space
i<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:36.030> them<00:01:36.150> account<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.750> into<00:01:37.130> now

I<00:01:43.920> actually<00:01:44.070> kind<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.640> mechanic<00:01:45.000> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
I actually kind of like this mechanic a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.300 
I actually kind of like this mechanic a
lot<00:01:45.210> more<00:01:45.420> now<00:01:46.020> rakdos<00:01:46.470> has<00:01:46.680> always<00:01:46.979> been

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
lot more now rakdos has always been

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.090 
lot more now rakdos has always been
about<00:01:47.460> offense<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.930> not<00:01:49.470> staying

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
about offense and you know not staying

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.340 
about offense and you know not staying
back<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.430> defend<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.030> unleash<00:01:51.659> does<00:01:52.020> just

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
back to defend and unleash does just

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.020 
back to defend and unleash does just
that<00:01:52.409> where<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> creature<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.759> come<00:01:53.909> into

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that where a creature you can come into

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.719 
that where a creature you can come into
play<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> +1<00:01:54.960> +1<00:01:55.170> counter<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.549> has

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
play with a +1 +1 counter but if it has

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.359 
play with a +1 +1 counter but if it has
a<00:01:56.759> +1<00:01:57.030> +1<00:01:57.240> counter<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.020> cannot<00:01:58.320> block<00:01:58.619> so

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
a +1 +1 counter on it it cannot block so

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.280 
a +1 +1 counter on it it cannot block so
the<00:01:59.640> two<00:01:59.759> cars<00:01:59.969> falls<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.390> far<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:00.990> this

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the two cars falls so far with this

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.109 
the two cars falls so far with this
mechanic<00:02:01.770> or<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.950> room<00:02:02.310> roustabout<00:02:02.909> and

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
mechanic or a room roustabout and

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.420 
mechanic or a room roustabout and
carnival<00:02:03.930> health<00:02:04.140> speed<00:02:04.380> now<00:02:04.979> carnival

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
carnival health speed now carnival

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.920 
carnival health speed now carnival
health<00:02:05.610> speed<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.909> pretty<00:02:06.210> simple<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.719> mean

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
health speed is pretty simple I mean

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.889 
health speed is pretty simple I mean
it's<00:02:07.079> just<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.530> big<00:02:08.489> power<00:02:08.789> guy<00:02:08.970> with<00:02:09.479> haste<00:02:09.720> and

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
it's just a big power guy with haste and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.980 
it's just a big power guy with haste and
first<00:02:10.140> strike<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.129> get

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
first strike so you get

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.600 
first strike so you get
between<00:02:12.320> you<00:02:12.440> know<00:02:12.590> maybe<00:02:13.100> having<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.460> first

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
between you know maybe having a first

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.520 
between you know maybe having a first
strike<00:02:13.730> blocker<00:02:14.120> or<00:02:14.450> just<00:02:15.080> having<00:02:15.320> a<00:02:15.380> really

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
strike blocker or just having a really

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.830 
strike blocker or just having a really
efficient<00:02:16.040> paste<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:16.880> first<00:02:17.030> right<00:02:17.180> guy<00:02:17.360> now

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
efficient paste and first right guy now

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.380 
efficient paste and first right guy now
grim<00:02:18.140> roustabout<00:02:18.680> other<00:02:19.100> hand<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.610> lets<00:02:20.270> you

grim roustabout other hand it lets you

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.990 
grim roustabout other hand it lets you
really<00:02:20.720> see<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.310> duality<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:22.580> mechanic

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
really see the duality of this mechanic

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.790 
really see the duality of this mechanic
because<00:02:23.240> on<00:02:23.480> one<00:02:23.510> hand<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:24.020> would<00:02:24.110> have<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.290> 1-1

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
because on one hand you would have a 1-1

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.880 
because on one hand you would have a 1-1
or<00:02:24.950> generator<00:02:25.370> or<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:26.810> can<00:02:26.960> just<00:02:27.110> have<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.320> 22

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
or generator or you can just have a 22

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.980 
or generator or you can just have a 22
or<00:02:28.220> generator<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.880> can't<00:02:29.150> block<00:02:29.450> now

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
or generator that can't block now

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.720 
or generator that can't block now
regeneration<00:02:30.500> has<00:02:30.680> always<00:02:31.070> been<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.430> really

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
regeneration has always been a really

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.940 
regeneration has always been a really
good<00:02:31.880> defensive<00:02:32.390> ability<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.590> really<00:02:33.620> lets

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
good defensive ability so it really lets

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.440 
good defensive ability so it really lets
newer<00:02:34.190> players<00:02:34.460> see<00:02:34.730> there<00:02:35.030> can<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.240> know<00:02:35.330> the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
newer players see there can you know the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.660 
newer players see there can you know the
economy<00:02:36.020> of<00:02:36.250> when<00:02:37.250> you're<00:02:37.370> unleashing

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
economy of when you're unleashing

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.450 
economy of when you're unleashing
something<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.270> when<00:02:38.360> you're<00:02:38.450> not<00:02:38.600> so<00:02:39.440> but<00:02:40.010> but

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
something and when you're not so but but

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.070 
something and when you're not so but but
the<00:02:40.910> mechanic<00:02:41.540> actually<00:02:41.810> looks<00:02:41.960> pretty

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
the mechanic actually looks pretty

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.260 
the mechanic actually looks pretty
simple<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.680> think<00:02:42.950> this<00:02:43.130> mechanic<00:02:43.610> has<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.970> lot

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
simple I think this mechanic has a lot

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.240 
simple I think this mechanic has a lot
of<00:02:44.300> design<00:02:44.780> space<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.260> explore<00:02:45.500> I'm<00:02:45.860> actually

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
of design space to explore I'm actually

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.790 
of design space to explore I'm actually
pretty<00:02:46.490> excited<00:02:46.670> about<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.380> if<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:48.440> play

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
pretty excited about it if you play

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.680 
pretty excited about it if you play
magic<00:02:49.160> for<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.340> while<00:02:49.520> or<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.820> play<00:02:50.000> cube<00:02:50.390> or

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
magic for a while or you play cube or

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.090 
magic for a while or you play cube or
something<00:02:50.930> like<00:02:51.020> that<00:02:51.080> I<00:02:51.470> might<00:02:51.710> do<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.920> video

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
something like that I might do a video

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.280 
something like that I might do a video
about<00:02:52.250> cube<00:02:52.610> later<00:02:52.820> but<00:02:53.450> there's<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.870> card<00:02:54.110> club

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
about cube later but there's a card club

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.720 
about cube later but there's a card club
wicker<00:02:54.560> borough<00:02:54.770> elder<00:02:55.160> that<00:02:55.370> comes<00:02:55.550> into

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
wicker borough elder that comes into

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.430 
wicker borough elder that comes into
play<00:02:55.940> with<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.150> minus<00:02:56.420> one<00:02:56.660> minus<00:02:56.810> one<00:02:56.960> counter

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
play with a minus one minus one counter

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.260 
play with a minus one minus one counter
and<00:02:57.620> when<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.310> remove<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:58.940> can<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.210> know

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
and when you remove it you can you know

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.240 
and when you remove it you can you know
a<00:02:59.330> shortcut<00:02:59.630> artifact<00:03:00.140> or<00:03:00.260> enchantment<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.890> I

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
a shortcut artifact or enchantment and I

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.160 
a shortcut artifact or enchantment and I
can<00:03:01.430> see<00:03:01.580> them<00:03:01.820> doing<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.150> with<00:03:02.420> unleash<00:03:02.810> too

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
can see them doing that with unleash too

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.950 
can see them doing that with unleash too
so<00:03:03.860> like<00:03:04.070> say<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.340> get<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.610> four<00:03:04.910> mana<00:03:05.150> 33<00:03:05.780> with

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
so like say you get a four mana 33 with

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.110 
so like say you get a four mana 33 with
unleash<00:03:06.380> but<00:03:07.130> if<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:07.520> put<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.790> plus<00:03:07.910> one<00:03:07.940> plus

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
unleash but if you put the plus one plus

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.030 
unleash but if you put the plus one plus
one<00:03:08.210> counter<00:03:08.540> on<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.020> may<00:03:09.230> like<00:03:09.500> pay<00:03:09.740> say

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
one counter on it you may like pay say

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.790 
one counter on it you may like pay say
like<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:11.360> know<00:03:11.390> one<00:03:12.080> color<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.410> one<00:03:12.560> black<00:03:12.770> one

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
like you know one color is one black one

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.280 
like you know one color is one black one
red<00:03:13.220> remove<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.000> +1<00:03:14.180> +1<00:03:14.390> counter<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.050> destroy

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
red remove the +1 +1 counter to destroy

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.320 
red remove the +1 +1 counter to destroy
target<00:03:15.650> creature<00:03:15.830> so<00:03:16.580> that<00:03:16.730> way<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:16.940> can<00:03:17.120> have

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
target creature so that way you can have

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.900 
target creature so that way you can have
a<00:03:17.570> creature<00:03:18.110> that<00:03:18.200> uses<00:03:18.740> +1<00:03:19.100> +1<00:03:19.190> counters<00:03:19.730> as<00:03:19.880> a

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
a creature that uses +1 +1 counters as a

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.690 
a creature that uses +1 +1 counters as a
resource<00:03:20.330> so<00:03:21.230> that's<00:03:21.620> some<00:03:22.100> design<00:03:22.460> space

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
resource so that's some design space

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.750 
resource so that's some design space
that<00:03:23.000> we<00:03:23.450> haven't<00:03:23.720> seen<00:03:23.780> yet<00:03:23.930> but<00:03:24.380> i<00:03:24.410> believe

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
that we haven't seen yet but i believe

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.880 
that we haven't seen yet but i believe
wizards<00:03:25.760> is<00:03:25.880> going<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.300> go<00:03:26.450> into<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:27.530> unleash

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
wizards is going to go into so unleash

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.730 
wizards is going to go into so unleash
is<00:03:28.100> actually<00:03:28.490> a<00:03:28.520> pretty<00:03:29.090> cool<00:03:29.180> mechanic<00:03:29.740> some

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
is actually a pretty cool mechanic some

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.310 
is actually a pretty cool mechanic some
other<00:03:30.860> stuff<00:03:31.100> that<00:03:31.340> might<00:03:31.550> happen<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:32.120> um<00:03:32.450> you

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
other stuff that might happen is um you

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.070 
other stuff that might happen is um you
see<00:03:33.770> unleashes<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.660> negative<00:03:35.660> for<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.930> most

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
see unleashes a negative for the most

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.960 
see unleashes a negative for the most
part<00:03:36.410> you<00:03:36.650> know<00:03:36.770> and<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.430> only<00:03:37.640> positive

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
part you know and the only positive

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.660 
part you know and the only positive
might<00:03:38.600> be<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.840> +1<00:03:39.020> +1<00:03:39.200> counter<00:03:39.740> but<00:03:40.340> there<00:03:40.550> can

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
might be the +1 +1 counter but there can

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.220 
might be the +1 +1 counter but there can
easily<00:03:41.000> be<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.270> sign<00:03:41.450> space<00:03:41.750> where<00:03:42.050> you<00:03:42.080> know

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
easily be the sign space where you know

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.110 
easily be the sign space where you know
if<00:03:42.350> creature<00:03:42.650> also<00:03:42.920> has<00:03:43.040> a<00:03:43.070> +1<00:03:43.310> +1<00:03:43.520> counter<00:03:44.030> on

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
if creature also has a +1 +1 counter on

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.610 
if creature also has a +1 +1 counter on
it<00:03:44.300> you<00:03:44.720> know<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:44.960> gains<00:03:45.170> additional

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
it you know it gains additional

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.370 
it you know it gains additional
abilities<00:03:46.270> so<00:03:47.270> unleashes<00:03:47.780> pretty<00:03:47.990> exciting

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
abilities so unleashes pretty exciting

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.130 
abilities so unleashes pretty exciting
I'm<00:03:48.530> pretty<00:03:48.710> excited<00:03:48.830> about<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:50.140> some

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
I'm pretty excited about it and some

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.800 
I'm pretty excited about it and some
other<00:03:51.320> cards<00:03:51.710> that<00:03:52.270> there<00:03:53.270> are<00:03:53.390> three<00:03:53.600> other

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
other cards that there are three other

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.600 
other cards that there are three other
guilds<00:03:54.290> in<00:03:54.410> return<00:03:54.740> to<00:03:54.830> ravnica<00:03:55.220> it's<00:03:55.430> going

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
guilds in return to ravnica it's going

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.610 
guilds in return to ravnica it's going
to<00:03:55.670> be<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.790> celesta<00:03:56.420> it's<00:03:57.020> going<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.380> be<00:03:57.470> as

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
to be a celesta it's going to be as

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.520 
to be a celesta it's going to be as
aureus<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:58.340> it's<00:03:58.640> going<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:59.030> be<00:03:59.330> is<00:03:59.540> it<00:03:59.810> so

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
aureus and it's going to be is it so

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.080 
aureus and it's going to be is it so
I'll<00:04:00.860> probably<00:04:01.070> discuss<00:04:01.460> those<00:04:01.580> mechanics

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
I'll probably discuss those mechanics

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.660 
I'll probably discuss those mechanics
later<00:04:02.570> but<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.230> do<00:04:03.320> want<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.650> talk<00:04:03.770> about<00:04:03.830> a<00:04:04.280> car

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
later but I do want to talk about a car

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.310 
later but I do want to talk about a car
that<00:04:04.790> has<00:04:04.910> been<00:04:05.090> really<00:04:05.390> excited<00:04:05.840> which<00:04:05.990> is<00:04:06.110> is

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
that has been really excited which is is

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
it charm this was one of the first cars

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.630 
it charm this was one of the first cars
spoiled<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:09.020> it's<00:04:09.830> one<00:04:10.070> blue<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.310> one<00:04:10.490> red

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
different modes now the first of all d

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.340 
different modes now the first of all d
is<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.209> can<00:04:14.330> counter<00:04:14.630> target<00:04:14.900> non<00:04:15.050> creature

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
is you can counter target non creature

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.720 
is you can counter target non creature

colorless<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.930> second<00:04:18.230> moment<00:04:18.350> is<00:04:18.500> it<00:04:18.709> can

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
colorless the second moment is it can

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.440 
colorless the second moment is it can

talking about using it in legacy and the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.040 
talking about using it in legacy and the
reason<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.880> is<00:04:29.060> is<00:04:29.270> because<00:04:29.360> it<00:04:29.600> simply

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
reason that it is is because it simply

reason that it is is because it simply
so<00:04:30.410> flexible<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.000> know<00:04:32.120> if<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.449> cast

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
so flexible and so you know if the cast

a knot creature spell you have the

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.710 
a knot creature spell you have the
chance<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.490> counter<00:04:34.850> it<00:04:34.880> if<00:04:35.419> they<00:04:35.570> catch

creature you can kill the creature in

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.760 
creature you can kill the creature in
the<00:04:37.729> late<00:04:37.910> game<00:04:38.180> when<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:39.110> don't<00:04:39.320> actually

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
the late game when you don't actually

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.830 
the late game when you don't actually
need<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.310> card<00:04:40.580> you<00:04:41.000> can<00:04:41.150> simply<00:04:41.300> draw<00:04:41.630> two

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
need the card you can simply draw two

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.020 
need the card you can simply draw two
cards<00:04:41.990> and<00:04:42.199> discard<00:04:42.500> two<00:04:42.590> cards<00:04:42.620> to<00:04:42.979> filter<00:04:43.280> so

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
cards and discard two cards to filter so

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.330 
cards and discard two cards to filter so
it's<00:04:44.389> just<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:44.900> flexible<00:04:45.350> all<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.979> moves<00:04:46.160> are

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
it's just so flexible all the moves are

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.340 
it's just so flexible all the moves are
useful<00:04:46.760> and<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.090> covers<00:04:47.240> all<00:04:47.540> the<00:04:47.600> bases<00:04:47.750> and

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
useful and it covers all the bases and

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.530 
useful and it covers all the bases and
I'm<00:04:49.070> pretty<00:04:49.280> excited<00:04:49.430> about<00:04:49.760> it<00:04:49.910> I<00:04:50.180> think<00:04:50.419> it's

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
I'm pretty excited about it I think it's
