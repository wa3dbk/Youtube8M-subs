it<00:01:25.649> will<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:26.100> swamped<00:01:26.399> short<00:01:27.390> term

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.350 

but<00:01:30.770> it's<00:01:30.920> turning<00:01:31.250> as<00:01:31.369> much<00:01:31.549> as<00:01:31.759> this<00:01:31.880> i<00:01:32.060> think

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
but it's turning as much as this i think

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.240 
but it's turning as much as this i think
the<00:01:32.840> ospin<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:33.320> certainly<00:01:33.650> much<00:01:33.770> better<00:01:34.009> off

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
the ospin is certainly much better off

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.280 
the ospin is certainly much better off
calling<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.729> right-hander's<00:01:35.360> there's

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
calling the right-hander's there's

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.969 
calling the right-hander's there's
always<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:37.310> inside<00:01:37.640> it<00:01:37.820> seemed<00:01:38.799> fixed<00:01:39.799> and

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
always the inside it seemed fixed and

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:51.200 
always the inside it seemed fixed and
seemed<00:01:40.280> away<00:01:40.580> that's<00:01:40.880> better

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.050 

looking<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.390> see<00:01:52.770> he<00:01:53.770> sound<00:01:54.130> she's<00:01:54.460> just<00:01:54.790> out

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.690 

he's<00:02:26.150> not<00:02:26.330> saying<00:02:26.599> that

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
he's not saying that

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.630 
he's not saying that
and<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:30.319> ball<00:02:30.470> hasn't<00:02:30.739> hit<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.129> ground<00:02:31.340> so

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
and the ball hasn't hit the ground so

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.949

there<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:31.879> no<00:02:32.000> chance<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.569> pitching

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
there is no chance of it pitching

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.860 
there is no chance of it pitching
outside<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:34.310> line<00:02:34.519> of<00:02:34.700> leg<00:02:34.849> stump<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.360> think

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
outside the line of leg stump I think

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.330 
outside the line of leg stump I think
that<00:02:35.930> was<00:02:36.019> heading<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.530> all<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.800> storms<00:02:37.129> I

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
that was heading to all the storms I

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.330 
that was heading to all the storms I
think<00:02:37.550> that<00:02:37.580> would<00:02:37.790> have<00:02:37.910> hit<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.239> storms

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
think that would have hit the storms

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.970 
think that would have hit the storms
let's<00:02:40.340> see<00:02:40.519> what<00:02:40.700> Hawkeyes<00:02:41.150> is<00:02:41.480> but<00:02:42.440> similarly

let's see what Hawkeyes is but similarly
if<00:02:43.099> he<00:02:43.220> hadn't<00:02:43.550> seen<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.239> that's<00:02:44.810> a

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
if he hadn't seen it and that's a

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.930 
if he hadn't seen it and that's a
problem<00:02:44.989> for<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.650> batsman<00:02:46.099> not<00:02:46.459> for<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.760> bola

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
problem for the batsman not for the bola

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.970

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.570 
that's going to hit the stumps BAM
that's<00:02:49.400> gonna<00:02:49.670> give<00:02:49.940> note<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.330> would<00:02:50.390> think

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.460 

well<00:02:55.210> it<00:02:55.330> looks<00:02:55.510> good<00:02:55.780> i<00:02:55.900> think<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.440> a

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
well it looks good i think this is a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.420 
well it looks good i think this is a
decision<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.070> will<00:02:57.250> be<00:02:57.610> turned<00:02:58.360> on<00:02:58.600> but

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
decision that will be turned on but

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.110 
decision that will be turned on but
there's<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.550> signal<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.240> side<00:03:02.160> 7050<00:03:03.160> 747<00:03:04.000> he's
