00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.649 
firstly the doors rattling the the base
units<00:02:49.980> were<00:02:50.099> in<00:02:50.189> the<00:02:50.310> door<00:02:50.549> that<00:02:51.209> was<00:02:51.299> just<00:02:51.540> a

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
units were in the door that was just a

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.270 
units were in the door that was just a
bit<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.810> vibration<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.620> didn't<00:02:52.859> feel<00:02:53.040> like<00:02:53.099> it

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
bit of vibration it didn't feel like it

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.280 
bit of vibration it didn't feel like it
was<00:02:53.519> stiff<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.090> was<00:02:54.209> it's<00:02:54.569> kind<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.170> was

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
was stiff so it was it's kind of it was

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.559 
was stiff so it was it's kind of it was
a<00:02:55.319> bit<00:02:55.439> of<00:02:55.560> resonance<00:02:55.980> there

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.250 

it's<00:02:59.959> plenty<00:03:00.349> of<00:03:00.379> power<00:03:00.620> there<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:03.079> actually

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
it's plenty of power there and actually

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.899 
it's plenty of power there and actually
feels<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:03.950> middle<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.430> sounds<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.849> little

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
feels the middle it sounds a little

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.390 
feels the middle it sounds a little
richer<00:03:05.659> in<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.260> mid-range<00:03:06.739> compared<00:03:07.280> with

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
richer in the mid-range compared with

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.849 
richer in the mid-range compared with
car<00:03:07.700> warm<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:10.299> quite<00:03:11.299> liked<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:12.170> it's<00:03:12.530> not<00:03:12.709> as

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
car warm I quite liked it it's not as

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.059 
car warm I quite liked it it's not as
harsh<00:03:13.129> in<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.269> top<00:03:14.510> notes<00:03:14.829> still<00:03:15.829> quite

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
harsh in the top notes still quite

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.030 
harsh in the top notes still quite
bright

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.100 

so<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.160> conclusion<00:03:22.700> pretty<00:03:23.390> clear-cut<00:03:23.720> the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
so the conclusion pretty clear-cut the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.350 
so the conclusion pretty clear-cut the
top<00:03:24.290> end<00:03:24.560> Bentley<00:03:24.980> was<00:03:25.130> miles<00:03:25.490> in<00:03:25.730> front<00:03:25.970> with

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
top end Bentley was miles in front with

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.449 
top end Bentley was miles in front with
the<00:03:26.450> name<00:03:26.630> system<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.290> then<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:28.190> other<00:03:28.310> two

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
the name system and then the other two

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.220 
the name system and then the other two
were<00:03:28.580> quite<00:03:28.760> close<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.569> second<00:03:30.020> was<00:03:30.200> the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
were quite close but the second was the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.050 
were quite close but the second was the
Jaguar<00:03:30.920> with<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.459> Bowers<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.030> Wilkins

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
Jaguar with the Bowers and Wilkins

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.819 
Jaguar with the Bowers and Wilkins
system<00:03:32.930> ahead<00:03:33.500> of<00:03:33.740> the<00:03:34.310> B&amp;O
