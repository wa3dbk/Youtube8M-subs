00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
with this being a diesel it probably

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.229 
with this being a diesel it probably
does<00:02:23.410> sort<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:23.980> in<00:02:24.040> excess<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.519> what<00:02:24.700> 60<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.150> the
