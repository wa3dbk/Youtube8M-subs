you know how to do this it'll be
pleasure<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:37.000> make<00:02:37.150> actors<00:02:37.870> for<00:02:38.079> all<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.349> your

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
pleasure to make actors for all of your

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.360 
pleasure to make actors for all of your
like<00:02:38.769> abilities<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.760> level<00:02:40.150> up<00:02:40.239> stuff<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:41.370> but

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
like abilities and level up stuff so but

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.770 
like abilities and level up stuff so but
I've<00:02:42.459> done<00:02:42.639> like<00:02:43.180> my<00:02:43.329> healing<00:02:43.510> fountain

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
I've done like my healing fountain

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.679 
I've done like my healing fountain
tutorial<00:02:44.170> I've<00:02:44.260> done<00:02:44.409> a<00:02:44.439> lot<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:45.480> actors<00:02:46.480> stuff

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
tutorial I've done a lot of actors stuff

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:47.729 
tutorial I've done a lot of actors stuff
so<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:46.870> think<00:02:46.930> people<00:02:47.170> are<00:02:47.349> getting<00:02:47.439> pretty

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
so I think people are getting pretty

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.679 
so I think people are getting pretty
familiar<00:02:47.920> with<00:02:48.159> it<00:02:48.370> but<00:02:48.519> personally<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.540> find

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
familiar with it but personally I find

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.330 
familiar with it but personally I find
actors<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.169> be<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.319> most<00:02:50.409> difficult<00:02:50.620> part<00:02:50.980> of

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
actors to be the most difficult part of

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.960 
actors to be the most difficult part of
the<00:02:51.939> editor<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.540> grasp<00:02:53.129> and<00:02:54.129> heroes<00:02:54.609> are<00:02:54.760> part

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
the editor to grasp and heroes are part

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.339 
the editor to grasp and heroes are part
of<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.180> heroes<00:02:55.450> are<00:02:55.569> pretty<00:02:55.810> difficult<00:02:55.989> to

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
of that heroes are pretty difficult to

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.520 
of that heroes are pretty difficult to
but<00:02:57.510> once<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.599> know<00:02:58.720> how<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.930> do<00:02:59.109> it<00:02:59.230> then<00:02:59.379> it

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
but once you know how to do it then it

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.179 
but once you know how to do it then it
can<00:02:59.650> be<00:02:59.739> pretty<00:02:59.889> rewarding<00:03:01.079> anyways<00:03:02.079> let's<00:03:02.919> go

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
can be pretty rewarding anyways let's go

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.220 
can be pretty rewarding anyways let's go
back<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.549> visual<00:03:03.939> here<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.389> the<00:03:05.019> model

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
back to this visual here so the model

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.899 
back to this visual here so the model
art<00:03:05.950> dash<00:03:06.250> model<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:07.810> think<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.799> was<00:03:09.400> talking<00:03:09.579> to

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
art dash model I think I was talking to

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.280 
art dash model I think I was talking to
a<00:03:10.500> cone<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.799> call<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.579> he<00:03:13.060> said<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:14.109> the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
a cone of call and he said that the

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.610 
a cone of call and he said that the
blink<00:03:14.590> model<00:03:15.010> was<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.459> good<00:03:16.090> choice<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:16.629> by<00:03:17.560> the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
blink model was a good choice and by the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.140 
blink model was a good choice and by the
way<00:03:17.769> he<00:03:18.340> is<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:19.239> guy<00:03:19.540> who<00:03:19.599> made<00:03:19.810> sodus<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:22.120> I

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
way he is the guy who made sodus so I

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.969 
way he is the guy who made sodus so I
figured<00:03:22.540> he<00:03:22.720> was<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.900> good<00:03:23.139> candidate<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.620> tell

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:23.979 
figured he was a good candidate to tell

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:27.420 
figured he was a good candidate to tell
me<00:03:25.199> what<00:03:26.199> would<00:03:26.319> be<00:03:26.409> good<00:03:26.560> model<00:03:26.859> for<00:03:26.889> this<00:03:27.069> and

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
me what would be good model for this and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.800 
me what would be good model for this and
apparently<00:03:27.609> blizzard<00:03:28.120> DOTA<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.479> going<00:03:28.659> to<00:03:28.720> be

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
apparently blizzard DOTA is going to be

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.619 
apparently blizzard DOTA is going to be
using<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:30.280> mothership<00:03:30.819> warp<00:03:31.150> in<00:03:31.299> it<00:03:31.419> for

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
using the the mothership warp in it for

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.189 
using the the mothership warp in it for
their<00:03:31.750> level<00:03:32.109> level<00:03:32.889> visual<00:03:33.340> but<00:03:34.049> this<00:03:35.049> one's

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
their level level visual but this one's

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.229 
their level level visual but this one's
a<00:03:35.260> bit<00:03:35.409> more<00:03:35.500> subtle<00:03:35.799> he<00:03:36.010> said<00:03:36.220> so<00:03:36.489> i'm<00:03:37.120> going

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
a bit more subtle he said so i'm going

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.869 
a bit more subtle he said so i'm going
to<00:03:37.299> use<00:03:37.449> the<00:03:37.540> blink<00:03:37.750> origin<00:03:38.199> model<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.879> that's

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
to use the blink origin model and that's

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.699 
to use the blink origin model and that's
a<00:03:40.030> little<00:03:40.209> nice<00:03:40.419> little<00:03:40.919> visual<00:03:41.919> effect<00:03:42.340> for

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
a little nice little visual effect for

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.099 
a little nice little visual effect for
for<00:03:44.709> our<00:03:44.799> hero<00:03:45.269> let's<00:03:46.269> see<00:03:46.449> so<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.840> scale<00:03:47.079> you

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
for our hero let's see so the scale you

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.819 
for our hero let's see so the scale you
can<00:03:47.349> maybe<00:03:47.590> increase<00:03:47.949> into<00:03:48.129> like<00:03:48.280> 1.5<00:03:49.799> it's<00:03:50.799> a

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
can maybe increase into like 1.5 it's a

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.099 
can maybe increase into like 1.5 it's a
bit<00:03:50.979> tiny<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.489> original<00:03:51.879> model<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.329> maybe

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
bit tiny the original model and maybe

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.500 
bit tiny the original model and maybe
this<00:03:53.260> will<00:03:53.409> help<00:03:53.439> a<00:03:53.650> bit<00:03:53.879> now<00:03:54.879> the<00:03:54.939> events<00:03:55.359> this

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
this will help a bit now the events this

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.449 
this will help a bit now the events this
is<00:03:55.629> the<00:03:55.689> most<00:03:55.810> important<00:03:56.290> part<00:03:56.319> we<00:03:57.220> need<00:03:57.340> to

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
is the most important part we need to

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.390 
is the most important part we need to

and<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:05.829> words<00:04:06.129> called<00:04:06.459> k<00:04:07.349> crest<00:04:08.349> levels<00:04:08.739> and

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:08.979 
and the words called k crest levels and

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.539 
and the words called k crest levels and
the<00:04:09.759> action<00:04:10.599> is<00:04:10.689> create<00:04:10.989> so<00:04:11.889> now<00:04:12.009> we<00:04:12.099> have<00:04:12.340> this

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
the action is create so now we have this

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.599 
the action is create so now we have this
which<00:04:13.180> will<00:04:13.509> create<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.259> visual<00:04:14.409> effect<00:04:14.889> and

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
which will create the visual effect and

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.420 
which will create the visual effect and
save<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:17.049> we<00:04:17.139> have<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.320> sound<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:18.159> we<00:04:18.310> have

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
save and we have the sound and we have

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.190 
save and we have the sound and we have
our<00:04:18.579> hero<00:04:19.000> which

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
our hero which

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.230 
our hero which
which<00:04:22.010> takes<00:04:22.250> forever<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.520> load<00:04:22.670> but<00:04:22.970> which

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
which takes forever to load but which

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.910 
which takes forever to load but which
has<00:04:23.450> all<00:04:23.600> that<00:04:25.210> level<00:04:26.210> up<00:04:26.330> stuff<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:27.830> think

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
has all that level up stuff so I think

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.530 
has all that level up stuff so I think
we<00:04:28.160> can<00:04:28.250> go<00:04:28.400> in<00:04:28.490> game<00:04:28.610> now<00:04:28.820> and<00:04:30.250> figure<00:04:31.250> out<00:04:31.540> if

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
we can go in game now and figure out if

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.700 
we can go in game now and figure out if
everything<00:04:32.870> is<00:04:32.960> working<00:04:32.990> it<00:04:33.350> up<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:33.620> this

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
everything is working it up to this

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.500 
everything is working it up to this
point<00:04:33.950> for<00:04:34.210> this<00:04:35.210> part<00:04:35.480> of<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.600> tutorial<00:04:36.490> okay

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
point for this part of the tutorial okay

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.360 
point for this part of the tutorial okay
let's<00:04:38.510> see<00:04:38.720> we've<00:04:39.560> got<00:04:39.590> intelligence<00:04:39.950> one

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
let's see we've got intelligence one

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.010 
let's see we've got intelligence one
strength<00:04:40.760> one<00:04:40.910> you<00:04:41.300> can<00:04:41.420> see<00:04:41.540> our<00:04:41.570> damages

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
strength one you can see our damages

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.470 
strength one you can see our damages
plus<00:04:42.170> 2<00:04:42.500> because<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.190> strength<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:43.730> we

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
plus 2 because of the strength and we

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.880 
plus 2 because of the strength and we
actually<00:04:44.750> have<00:04:44.840> 350<00:04:45.320> health<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:45.980> 550<00:04:46.580> energy

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
actually have 350 health and 550 energy

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
actually have 350 health and 550 energy
because<00:04:48.890> they<00:04:48.920> got<00:04:49.160> added<00:04:49.460> from<00:04:49.610> this<00:04:49.760> one

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
because they got added from this one

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.790 
because they got added from this one
intelligence<00:04:50.420> and<00:04:51.290> you<00:04:51.350> can<00:04:51.470> see<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.590> dole

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
intelligence and you can see the dole

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.380 
intelligence and you can see the dole
tooltips<00:04:52.310> there<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:52.670> let's<00:04:52.820> go<00:04:52.970> we're<00:04:53.180> level

experience<00:05:05.540> and<00:05:05.660> there<00:05:05.870> was<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:06.050> level<00:05:06.260> of

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
experience and there was the level of

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.170 
experience and there was the level of
thing<00:05:06.500> which<00:05:06.620> happened<00:05:07.220> pretty<00:05:07.310> fast<00:05:07.430> but<00:05:07.790> I

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
energy went up and his damage went up

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.350 
energy went up and his damage went up

level up visual link origin model why
did<00:05:52.610> it<00:05:52.730> do<00:05:52.940> that

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.800 

okay<00:06:05.240> well<00:06:06.370> let's<00:06:07.370> see<00:06:07.700> what's<00:06:08.630> the

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
okay well let's see what's the

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.560 
okay well let's see what's the
mothership<00:06:09.230> one<00:06:09.440> look<00:06:09.620> like<00:06:09.850> oops<00:06:10.850> mothership

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
mothership one look like oops mothership

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.370 
mothership one look like oops mothership
will<00:06:11.750> warp<00:06:11.960> in<00:06:14.200> mothership<00:06:15.200> teleport<00:06:15.680> out

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
will warp in mothership teleport out

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.360 
will warp in mothership teleport out
mothership<00:06:18.380> warp<00:06:18.770> in<00:06:18.890> let's<00:06:19.070> see<00:06:19.160> how<00:06:19.220> this

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
mothership warp in let's see how this

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.710 
mothership warp in let's see how this
looks<00:06:19.840> if<00:06:20.840> it<00:06:21.230> still<00:06:21.440> looks<00:06:21.620> crappy<00:06:22.430> then<00:06:23.150> you

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
looks if it still looks crappy then you

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.910 
looks if it still looks crappy then you
can<00:06:23.870> go<00:06:23.990> ahead<00:06:24.080> and<00:06:24.200> search<00:06:24.440> for<00:06:24.470> other<00:06:24.680> things
