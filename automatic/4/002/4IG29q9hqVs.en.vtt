00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:13.230
 boxing boxing of the xbox one day 1 I know 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.910
 that during the last several days 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.220
 people have already gone up BOXING 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.110
 xbox one and all this but like me 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.970
 it took so long to arrive in fact I just 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.949
 to arrive today in the morning because I could not 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.660
 record the unboxing obviously though 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.269
 I did the damned presale that obviously 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.460
 it was not worth much 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.380
 Anyway, I could not record anything 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.690
 but original or I want to make myself a 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.920
 boxing and also that obviously this in 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.720
 boxing is going to have a different concept 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.670
 it's not going to be like boxing 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.699
 normal this is going to be a boxing 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.309
 summarized and detailed narrated and something 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.780
 different so check and good for 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.580
 start the unboxing first I had to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.619
 cut these scripts with the xbox logo 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.239
 since you cut them that 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:53.610
 I could open the box I did not say the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.949
 backpack card color black and so 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.449
 bright and good also inside 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.460
 it comes so much in the box I do not know well 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.680
 crazy and everything ordered not very well 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.420
 also that you have a guarantee policy 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.799
 after that it's a matter of kinect not 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.260
 it's a bit difficult to get out because 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.060
 it comes as well as a very tight space and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.520
 the change is another focus but not good anymore 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.740
 what do you get out then there you have the kinect 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.079
 they know him physically it's very special 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.359
 it's just a black box with a 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.820
 camera then the part comes not the 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:22.649
 section of the codes and all that not 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.539
 it also comes in the headband that is very 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.969
 crazy not the marketing stadium that 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.149
 include well the fifa 14 also the 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:32.130
 fifa 14 code is also there 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.229
 they give you a decal detonated in the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.259
 taps that out there or that is to win not 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.049
 a good manual comes to you there is that 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.299
 I have read and exactly right in these 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.670
 codes not here 14 days of code 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.250
 goldie test the achievement this day 1 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.079
 not this code very crazy then comes the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.149
 second part more special that is the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.939
 control not editing control 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.950
 commemorative special of day 1 not that 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.909
 quick key to not waste time 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.039
 check here is the control day 1 2013 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.420
 although good this must be day 5 not 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.849
 because they gave it to me until the 5th 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.280
 so then what's the difference as they leave the 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:10.110
 control then we proceed to see the cables 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.660
 not that this is the most boring thing 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.260
 they are just cables the hdmi and the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.120
 connection cable to light 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.670
 changes connection to light too and 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.470
 good in this regulator the eliminator 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.299
 what he says is not from that box where 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.120
 the energy passes and the current changes 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:29.150
 so that it does not burn the xbox and good 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.030
 finally the most awaited moment what 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.040
 who see the xbox one down 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.739
 finally here values a packaging in 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.280
 This plastic foam of a not 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.230
 it is damaged is not scratched and nothing happens 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.150
 Well, we took it off quickly, 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.909
 we also accelerate this part to 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.390
 get to the rust and boom 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:52.700
 here is finally the xbox one see 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.010
 see how the xbox shines here 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.900
 we have different angles I know that 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.340
 See, you have that ventilation thing 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.989
 what seems like this one never heats up 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.510
 also here in the back has 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.700
 all this not the connection has the hdmi 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.519
 to go to the TV the hdmi for in the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.129
 cable TV and the internet if you have 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.720
 all those magical connections and 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.489
 absolute there of lying there are some 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.170
 decals and he had hoped for 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.849
 long this console and after 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.159
 a lot of hard work I could finally 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.790
 get it so good my channel is going to 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:25.010
 be xbox with blue I'm not going 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.610
 starting with the FIFA 14 he'm 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.250
 playing for a while 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.900
 wow percent they give it to you too 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.460
 I'm going to know what to say about battlefield 4 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.830
 and good also the game that I have most 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.290
 waited for a lot that is the 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.580
 halo 5 although in fact this game has 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.190
 been a great motivation to get 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.630
 the rocks one and nothing else because that would be 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.390
 I hope everything in the next ones that I used 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.860
 the xbox one more than anything else but that 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.700
 you liked it thanks for this video 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.700
 and until next time
