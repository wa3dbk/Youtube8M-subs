00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
and in here I've got a servo and that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.530 
and in here I've got a servo and that
runs<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.420> radio<00:02:08.890> this<00:02:09.890> plug<00:02:10.190> right<00:02:10.340> here

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
runs to the radio this plug right here

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.120 
runs to the radio this plug right here
runs<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.870> radio<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:12.440> turn<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.950> blade

runs to the radio I can turn the blade

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.540 
runs to the radio I can turn the blade
on<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.550> off<00:02:13.840> while<00:02:14.840> it's<00:02:14.870> moving<00:02:15.200> now<00:02:17.380> but

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
on and off while it's moving now but

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.900 
on and off while it's moving now but
servo<00:02:19.550> from<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:20.239> switch<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:21.190> turns<00:02:22.190> on<00:02:22.489> this

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
servo from a switch that turns on this

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:32.340 
servo from a switch that turns on this
solenoid<00:02:24.670> thus<00:02:25.670> Illinois<00:02:26.260> runs<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.739> motor

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.170 

yeah<00:02:33.350> that's<00:02:34.220> basically<00:02:34.519> it<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.760> can<00:02:37.970> see

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
yeah that's basically it you can see

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.840 
yeah that's basically it you can see
down<00:02:38.470> there's<00:02:39.470> nothing<00:02:39.620> else<00:02:39.860> in<00:02:40.100> there<00:02:40.160> it's

all<00:02:41.800> it's<00:02:42.800> all<00:02:42.890> made<00:02:43.130> out<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:43.310> diamond<00:02:43.730> plate

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
all it's all made out of diamond plate

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.479 
all it's all made out of diamond plate
so<00:02:44.510> far<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:47.590> still<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.739> lot<00:02:48.920> of<00:02:48.950> stuff<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.340> want

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
all together I bet it weighs 75 pounds

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.050 
all together I bet it weighs 75 pounds
and<00:03:10.400> there's<00:03:10.610> got<00:03:10.819> to<00:03:10.909> be<00:03:10.940> at<00:03:11.840> least<00:03:13.000> at<00:03:14.000> least
