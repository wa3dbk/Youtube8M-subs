really<00:00:35.370> switched<00:00:35.760> around<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> perks<00:00:36.840> or

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
really switched around like the perks or

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.580 
really switched around like the perks or
anything<00:00:37.380> cuz<00:00:37.950> um<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.520> mean<00:00:38.879> if<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.180> game<00:00:39.390> had

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
anything cuz um I mean if this game had

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.080 
anything cuz um I mean if this game had
marathon<00:00:40.590> pro<00:00:40.860> at<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> actual<00:00:41.460> marathon<00:00:41.730> pro

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
marathon pro at the actual marathon pro

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.660 
marathon pro at the actual marathon pro
like<00:00:42.300> mono<00:00:42.570> 42<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.350> black<00:00:44.010> ops<00:00:44.280> had<00:00:44.489> like

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
like mono 42 and black ops had like

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.369 
like mono 42 and black ops had like
unlimited<00:00:44.940> sprinting<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.750> would<00:00:46.200> use<00:00:46.350> that

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
unlimited sprinting I would use that

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.160 
unlimited sprinting I would use that
instead<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.980> sleight<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.309> hand<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:47.989> to<00:00:48.989> me

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
instead of sleight of hand but to me

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.110 
instead of sleight of hand but to me
it's<00:00:49.500> kind<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.829> pointless<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.370> use<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> marathon

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it's kind of pointless to use a marathon

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.080 
it's kind of pointless to use a marathon
in<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:52.160> but<00:00:53.160> sleight<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.640> hand<00:00:53.879> works

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
in this one but sleight of hand works

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.389 
in this one but sleight of hand works
good<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.329> me<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:55.739> basically<00:00:56.010> why<00:00:56.370> i

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
good for me and that's basically why i

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.029 
good for me and that's basically why i
never<00:00:56.610> changed<00:00:57.000> my<00:00:57.059> classes<00:00:57.480> okay<00:00:58.289> there's<00:00:58.859> no

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
never changed my classes okay there's no

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.680 
never changed my classes okay there's no
other<00:00:59.160> perks<00:00:59.520> I'd<00:00:59.699> rather<00:00:59.879> use<00:01:00.149> besides<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
other perks I'd rather use besides the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.240 
other perks I'd rather use besides the
ones<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.989> help<00:01:01.109> me<00:01:01.199> out<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.440> most<00:01:01.469> which<00:01:02.219> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
ones that help me out the most which is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.179 
ones that help me out the most which is
a<00:01:02.600> quick-draw<00:01:03.600> death<00:01:04.470> thought<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.860> need<00:01:05.010> that

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
a quick-draw death thought you need that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.649 
a quick-draw death thought you need that
sounds<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.729> search<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.060> went<00:01:06.240> over<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
sounds and search I went over that in a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.200 
sounds and search I went over that in a
commentary<00:01:07.020> before<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.760> slide<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> hand<00:01:08.880> you
