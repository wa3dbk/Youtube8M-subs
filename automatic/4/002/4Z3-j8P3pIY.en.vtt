00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.470 
and the foul never came so I was able to
get<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.260> basket<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.010> lay<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.460> so<00:02:58.730> that

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
get to the basket and lay it in so that

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.910 
get to the basket and lay it in so that
was<00:02:59.570> a<00:02:59.630> big<00:02:59.840> play<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:00.110> then<00:03:00.440> they<00:03:00.560> didn't<00:03:00.830> have

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
was a big play and then they didn't have

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.500 
was a big play and then they didn't have
a<00:03:00.950> timeout<00:03:01.250> left<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:01.940> we<00:03:02.090> had<00:03:02.240> to<00:03:02.330> scramble

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
a timeout left so we had to scramble

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.750 
a timeout left so we had to scramble
back<00:03:02.960> and<00:03:03.260> in<00:03:04.190> Wade<00:03:04.490> had<00:03:05.090> two<00:03:05.240> throwing<00:03:05.630> up<00:03:05.780> so

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
back and in Wade had two throwing up so

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.030 
back and in Wade had two throwing up so
definitely<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.850> huge<00:03:08.330> comeback<00:03:08.600> for<00:03:09.590> us<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:09.980> we

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
definitely a huge comeback for us and we

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.880 
definitely a huge comeback for us and we
never<00:03:10.190> gave<00:03:10.460> up<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.030> was<00:03:11.120> big<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:12.470> Dallas
