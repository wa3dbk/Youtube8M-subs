00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:33.670
 Chinese is a plastic case here and 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.719
 Chinese battery is not very reliable 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.429
 days and batteries 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.699
 searches are not even enough and bluetooth car 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.969

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.760

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:11.760
 own turn on only left 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.760

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.350

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.840

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.100
 I go to the device 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.710

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.520

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.810

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.810

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.120
 this loud means 31 dollar 29

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.349
 where the card is trying not to play mp3 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:25.120
 standalone solution is also possible 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.750
 use high transmitter that is 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.930
 instead of ordinary 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.620
 fm transmitters which connects to 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.049
 cigarette lighter 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.230
 in the timer you can use it 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.560

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:44.870

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.099

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.290
 there are no complaints at least at least 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.260
 closed windows 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.630
 door you can hear everything is fine but when already 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.900
 the window you open uc about almost inaudible 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.900
 solar battery works well 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.900

 this is a little more than three thousand tenge 3,700 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.540
 thousand six hundred cost me a phone 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:04:10.400
 that kind of money 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:20.530
 such a phone you can not buy grief over how 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:20.530
 how are things you hear me clearly audible 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:33.949

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:22.270

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.650
 incoming call 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.250

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.170
 it is seen 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:54.630

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.360
