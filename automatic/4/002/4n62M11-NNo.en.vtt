00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.819
 1 which more 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:12.469
 nothing 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.140
 even know the name of the site of making of technology then 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.470
 we have been talking a lot about flash lately among these superheroes 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.500
 which avoids no but the format that you find on the internet 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.329
 indeed it is a lot of dissatisfied because this format is not supported by 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.259
 a lot of devices and among others not to mention live gold there 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.780
 must put 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.040
 there is a lot of debate about the importance of being able to read the format 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.880
 flash on this type of device personally I am of the opinion that the 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.020
 consumer must have no choice and I will show that today all 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.670
 the possibilities you will have with the latest 10-point flash version 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.760
 so here you have the nexus wan who is running with their men from hpc d'isere 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.210
 let me show you what it's like with a little flash 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.410
 so here I'm sure the 147-point gts like let's look at what it looks like 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.440
 on a device that does not support flash there fans and so everywhere there is 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.140
 flash we see this blue bricks Lego team that shows that the content 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.710
 can not be read it's gone we'll start a game while choosing the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.250
 first I shout idea of ​​what some 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.550
 I'm connected to wifi so it must be pretty fast when they start 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.550
 immediately to read the animation 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.360
 I can double click to switch to full screen 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.360
 I can put in landscape mode 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.340
 but I think it's better in that sense 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.530
 alas to go to the end and start playing as you would on any 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.050
 which computer you have access of course to the instructions and all the 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.230
 options so here it was just a game but for example the cube uses the 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.400
 flash technology and here you can play the videos directly from the 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.780
 Navigator 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.720
 have a lot of sites that use flash for advertising 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.010
 percent of any interactive elements and well there it will not pose 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.450
 of problem 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.740
 again I think the user should not have the choice 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.740
 to activate the flash or not and suffer the consequences with regard to the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.620
 charging time to adapt 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.360
 so I do not really like it when these decisions are made for me 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.610
 that's a lot of reasons that I have to have flash drive on my 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.619
 phone 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.089
 we get to the question for you do you think that flash is 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.359
 important on your phone do you have any usefulness or not 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.259

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.589
