imagine<00:00:42.120> if<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.360> will<00:00:43.670> for<00:00:44.670> waste<00:00:44.940> piles<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
imagine if you will for waste piles and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.630 
imagine if you will for waste piles and
for<00:00:46.469> foundation<00:00:47.070> piles<00:00:47.870> let's<00:00:48.870> say<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.640> just

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
for foundation piles let's say here just

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.510 
for foundation piles let's say here just
so<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:51.030> mark<00:00:51.300> those<00:00:52.100> these<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.370> four

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
so we can mark those these are your four

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.319 
so we can mark those these are your four
waste<00:00:53.789> piles<00:00:55.879> these<00:00:56.879> are<00:00:57.000> your<00:00:57.120> four

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
waste piles these are your four

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.450 
waste piles these are your four
foundation<00:00:58.020> piles<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:59.489> what<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.270> is

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
foundation piles and what you can do is

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.910 
foundation piles and what you can do is
you<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.609> move<00:01:02.879> any<00:01:04.549> card<00:01:05.549> that's<00:01:05.850> not<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.330> ace

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
you can move any card that's not an ace

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.570 
you can move any card that's not an ace
up<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:09.270> waste<00:01:09.510> piles<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:11.900> you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.260> move

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
up to your waste piles and you can move

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.649 
up to your waste piles and you can move
to<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> foundation<00:01:15.299> piles<00:01:17.330> sequences<00:01:18.330> by

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
to the foundation piles sequences by

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.969 
to the foundation piles sequences by
suit<00:01:19.520> starting<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:20.640> an<00:01:20.729> ace<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.500> at<00:01:22.890> the

suit starting with an ace so at the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.740 
suit starting with an ace so at the
start<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.340> game<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.759> do<00:01:23.820> get<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.390> move<00:01:24.570> up

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
start of this game I do get to move up

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.320 
start of this game I do get to move up
to<00:01:25.080> aces<00:01:25.470> ace<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.979> spades<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.520> ace<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.210> clubs

to aces ace of spades and ace of clubs

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.100 
to aces ace of spades and ace of clubs
and<00:01:29.570> around<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.720> board

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and around the board

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.740 
and around the board
I<00:01:31.280> can<00:01:32.280> build<00:01:32.570> sequentially<00:01:33.570> by<00:01:34.350> suit<00:01:35.750> let's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
I can build sequentially by suit let's

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.520 
I can build sequentially by suit let's
see<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.290> that's<00:01:37.500> possible<00:01:37.799> at<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.850> time

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
see if that's possible at this time

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.920 
see if that's possible at this time
there<00:01:40.530> are<00:01:40.560> no<00:01:40.740> suited<00:01:41.579> sequences<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.689> can

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
there are no suited sequences that I can

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.429 
there are no suited sequences that I can
play<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> way<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.610> waste<00:01:44.909> piles

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
play so the way that the waste piles

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.999 
play so the way that the waste piles
come<00:01:46.439> into<00:01:46.710> play<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:50.360> move<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.509> card

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
come into play is that I can move a card

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.380 
come into play is that I can move a card
up<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.399> it<00:01:56.399> enables<00:01:56.790> me<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.939> open

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
up to here so that it enables me to open

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.990 
up to here so that it enables me to open
up<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.570> space<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.140> see<00:01:58.680> what<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.340> may<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.640> able<00:01:59.880> to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
up a space and see what I may be able to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.929 
up a space and see what I may be able to
play<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.899> board<00:02:01.140> by<00:02:02.130> moving<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.610> Queen

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
play on the board by moving this Queen

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.609 
play on the board by moving this Queen
up<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:04.430> opened<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:06.020> spot<00:02:07.020> where<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.350> move

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
up I opened up a spot where I can move

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.790 
up I opened up a spot where I can move
the<00:02:08.280> ten<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.520> clubs<00:02:08.729> over<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.410> Jack<00:02:10.770> of

the ten of clubs over on to the Jack of

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.149 
the ten of clubs over on to the Jack of
Clubs

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
Clubs

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:18.820 
Clubs
and<00:02:13.690> by<00:02:14.690> having<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:15.230> queen<00:02:15.500> up<00:02:15.650> here<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:17.830> will

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
and by having this queen up here I will

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.369 
and by having this queen up here I will
be<00:02:18.950> able<00:02:19.129> to<00:02:19.489> move<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.790> jack<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.269> later<00:02:20.540> if<00:02:20.900> I

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
be able to move a jack up later if I

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.360 
be able to move a jack up later if I
need<00:02:21.409> to<00:02:23.920> let's<00:02:24.920> see

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
need to let's see

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.300 
need to let's see
I<00:02:25.810> don't<00:02:26.810> have<00:02:26.989> any<00:02:27.319> place<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.799> can<00:02:27.950> make<00:02:28.099> right

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
I don't have any place I can make right

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.059 
I don't have any place I can make right
now<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:30.700> will<00:02:31.700> move<00:02:32.269> another<00:02:32.720> queen<00:02:33.110> up<00:02:33.890> to

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
now so I will move another queen up to

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.520 
now so I will move another queen up to
here<00:02:34.370> can<00:02:34.940> move<00:02:35.030> any<00:02:35.269> value<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.379> you're

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
here can move any value but you're

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.130 
here can move any value but you're
better<00:02:36.739> off<00:02:36.890> moving<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.489> higher<00:02:37.790> value<00:02:38.480> card<00:02:38.810> up

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
better off moving a higher value card up

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.220 
better off moving a higher value card up
to<00:02:39.290> here<00:02:39.470> like<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:39.950> could<00:02:40.099> move<00:02:40.220> this<00:02:40.340> 10<00:02:41.230> or

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
to here like I could move this 10 or

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.410 
to here like I could move this 10 or
this<00:02:42.470> 4<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.610> doing<00:02:43.819> so<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.090> would<00:02:44.209> not<00:02:44.359> be

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
this 4 but doing so it would not be

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.569 
this 4 but doing so it would not be
advantageous<00:02:47.859> let's<00:02:48.859> look<00:02:49.010> around<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.310> board

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
advantageous let's look around the board
