00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.139
 hello to all that such a welcome one day 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.420
 more to the channel in today's video I bring 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.680
 the eleventh volume of more for less in 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.270
 these videos what we are going to teach 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.779
 five products that I think have 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.949
 a good quality for a low price and 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.289
 I'll start now so that the video does not 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.449
 either win or first of all I want you 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.310
 teach the lolas has of kiko are 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.779
 shadows in cream in jumbo format that 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.550
 has the mark on the line the fixed 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.929
 although it is true that from time to time 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.170
 in collections they also take out some 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.660
 they cost 6 with 90 so they do not rule 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.160
 general and they are products that for me 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.570
 They are very well 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.330
 I guess many of you know us are 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.680
 these here promise to last eight hours 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.510
 but the truth is that they last me longer 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.880
 I use them both for the bottom line 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.760
 of tabs like for the water line or 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.000
 as to use base shade or 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.840
 simply as a single shadow I like them 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.660
 much 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.240
 They bring 1.64 grams and last 24 months 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.430
 open I will teach you 5 for not 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.090
 lengthen me and good this first that you 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.090
 I teach from here 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.390
 is this meat color is from an edition of 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.150
 a special collection called 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.400
 colors in the world and it's tone 28 this 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.159
 from here is number 13 this is the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.710
 number 4 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.219
 this is number 10 and this is the number 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.219
 eleven 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.810
 they are products that once they have 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.550
 drying they stay super fixed and it's very 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.770
 difficult to remove skin must 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.680
 rubbing does not stain the eye but it 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.450
 they are very attached and I personally 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.920
 I'm delighted with these products 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.750
 they love me and although I already have enough 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.010
 I discard getting one more because 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.450
 the truth is that they give me a result 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.800
 incredible another product that I want 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.660
 highlight in this volume are the are 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.150
 some loose springfield I have 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.040
 five but there are some more that I have 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.320
 understood and good are shadows that I 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.380
 they like them a lot are shadows in dust 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.660
 come in this packaging so cute 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.960
 Cardboard reminds me a bit of the packaging 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.960
 of val 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.350
 here they bring the shade of the shadow and good 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.390
 they are shadows that open like this 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.000
 pressure comes with a protective plastic 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.810
 and below come the shadows without a mirror 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.270
 nothing 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.650
 well I tell you I have five tones the 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.950
 specific products usually cost 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.780
 five euros but if you buy two they will charge 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.760
 the third therefore you would pay ten 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.290
 euros for three shadows you would get each 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.420
 a three with something so I think it's 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.670
 pretty good, I'm going to teach the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.250
 five tones that I have 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.810
 this first one here is called beige for 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.640
 I'm a pink more than a beige and I 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.860
 like to use it a lot for the eyelid 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.260
 mobile or to light up a bit the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.030
 animal this is called brown this is 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.130
 called 'violet this is called cloud and 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.480
 this is called blue black I imagine that it 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.270
 flame blue black because it's a blue with 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.160
 a pretty dark base this blue is a 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.440
 turquoise prices or purple you know that 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.660
 its pretty purple with the base too 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.010
 quite dark also and good these 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.720
 two that I love to use them 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.640
 together they look like very shadows 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.260
 nice you see that they make you up pretty 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.700
 well and yes it is true that they are a bit 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.200
 dusty and that are not the crème either 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.910
 of the crème but it is true that by the 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.500
 price that you have for me can not be 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.180
 ask for more if they have lovely colors 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.500
 another product that I want to recommend and 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.989
 it seems that today the video is shadows 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.519
 they are the unique shadows of deliplus me 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.200
 I have a few but I'm going to teach you 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.060
 four to not lengthen the video much 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.230
 I think they are around four or five euros 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.489
 I'm not sure because I've never 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.950
 bought no lock is that I have me 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.480
 they have given them away I have understood that they are 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.790
 of fixed and good linear I'm going to 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.620
 teach four of the colors this black 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.690
 is the number 26 that is a pretty black 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.760
 black that pigments rather better with the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.750
 brush that with the finger this is the number 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.560
 7 that is a lovely matt brown 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.670
 is a number 5 is a bluish green and 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.500
 this is number 10 that summers of 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.240
 olive also very beautiful you see that 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.190
 pigment very well are not dusty 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.390
 adhere look at the eyelid and I the 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.220
 I'm really happy with them 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.810
 they work well they diffuse well and 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.670
 I think for four euros books that 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.690
 cost are pretty good too the 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.490
 next product that I love you 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.230
 mention are the powders and activated from 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.390
 burguiba are some dust that to me 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.680
 I really like the tone 52 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.700
 vanilla that is the clearest that is 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.830
 does in Spain for what I have 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.570
 understood and there are times that it is a powder 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.490
 mattifiers that last 10 hours 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.410
 they say it moisturizes and they provide a 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.330
 healthy shine I like them a lot 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.730
 more effective on the skin give me a look 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.930
 super velvety and more a person me 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.510
 asked what he was wearing on his skin 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.709
 used these powders I like them a lot 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.150
 yes it is true that these are the seconds 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.130
 that I have and do not smell like the 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.239
 first the first ones smelled so many 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.800
 fruits and I do not know if these 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.650
 they were already open from 'it's not what they 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.000
 it happens but they do not violate also still 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.740
 It is a powder that I love to me 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.300
 they go great and well I think 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.710
 around 10 euros but still remains 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.660
 here on pages as a cousin you can 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.040
 get for about 7 with something and 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.950
 lately there are quite a few promotions in 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.560
 Murcia or all products at 25% the 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.659
 second product 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.819
 enough promotions so it's more 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.139
 baratito or get them so I os 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.879
 I recommend that you keep an eye on them because 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.169
 a thousand times that I get very well and the 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.060
 last product that I want to recommend you 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.590
 It is also a product for the face in 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.780
 this case is about the proofreader 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.400
 concealer and neymar de mix this I have 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.400
 me here is the tone 13 orange 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.909
 but I recommend it to you in 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.939
 any color is a super corrector 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.559
 Covering enough moisturizer is working 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.749
 well it diffuses well and the truth is that 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:12.710
 I 'm delighted with them this was a 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:16.189
 gift a kiss chus but good i before 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.689
 I had skin color and I liked it very much 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.909
 is also you see that covers a pass 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:22.909
 although obviously it is for more things 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:24.259
 concrete that the other but did not want 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:25.639
 generally recommend these 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.080
 correctors like I do not have the color that 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.240
 why not spend it because I teach good 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.539
 this but good is not to recommend 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.339
 the color itself but the brand the product 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.960
 itself the truth that I think it deserves 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:37.819
 very much worth it and I do not know if it's around five 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.610
 or six euros I think it's a good 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:42.949
 corrector and if you have the opportunity to 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.629
 try it then I recommend you and good 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:46.339
