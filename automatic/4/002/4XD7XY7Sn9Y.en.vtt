to attach it when you get it and attach

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.990 
to attach it when you get it and attach

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.650 

it's<00:00:41.129> already<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.999> part<00:00:42.269> is<00:00:42.390> already

it and these four areas here we press it
in

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
in

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.950 
in
now<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> haven't<00:01:18.900> used<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.650> yet<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.760> just<00:01:20.970> opened

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
now I haven't used it yet I just opened

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.110 
now I haven't used it yet I just opened
it<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:25.250> this<00:01:26.250> will<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.580> my<00:01:26.700> first<00:01:26.880> time

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
it so this will be my first time

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.390 
it so this will be my first time
actually<00:01:29.360> using<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:31.410> has<00:01:31.590> directions<00:01:32.070> on

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
actually using it it has directions on

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.030 
actually using it it has directions on
the<00:01:32.520> back<00:01:33.140> for<00:01:34.140> these<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.650> didn't<00:01:34.890> have

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the back for these it didn't have

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.790 
the back for these it didn't have
direction<00:01:36.800> had<00:01:37.800> two<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.250> these

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
direction had two of these

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.480 
direction had two of these
dryer<00:01:40.800> man<00:01:41.100> things<00:01:42.650> so<00:01:43.650> I<00:01:43.680> guess<00:01:44.070> these<00:01:44.250> like

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
dryer man things so I guess these like

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.180 
dryer man things so I guess these like
samples<00:01:45.260> that<00:01:46.260> they<00:01:46.380> put<00:01:46.620> in<00:01:46.740> there<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.040> they

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
samples that they put in there so they

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.410 
samples that they put in there so they
can<00:01:47.370> make<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.700> buy<00:01:47.940> some<00:01:48.660> more<00:01:49.820> which<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.000> kind

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
can make you buy some more which is kind

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.900 
can make you buy some more which is kind
of<00:01:51.480> unfair<00:01:52.910> but<00:01:53.910> I<00:01:54.740> understand<00:01:58.370> what<00:01:59.370> people

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
of unfair but I understand what people

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.600 
of unfair but I understand what people
assume<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.810> supposed<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.290> come<00:02:01.560> with
