00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.590
 whine people that's part two of 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.599
 nexus pro project and the right one 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.730
 Smartphone is important for the next one 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.440
 Project but mostly you have yourself 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.260
 already made the decision which 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.330
 smartphone itself and that's why 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.250
 should the nexus pro project because yes 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.070
 for anyone who wants to be in android handy 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.599
 also has to be completely customizable too 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.580
 Of course, from the hardware completely 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.830
 be customizable and that means you can 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.290
 Every smartphone use in my case 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.809
 now here is the samsung galaxy s 4 in 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.230
 I know what I chose and that 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.480
 my express can be what you are 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.450
 you always wish it is important only 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 that it's always 10.1 or 10.2 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.520
 you can support it easy to 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.000
 are on the website and that's it 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.170
 already 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.239
 if you have that then you can 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.480
 in principle on the next project 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.760
 participate says 10.1 is for me here 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.460
 currently available only as a knightley so 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.710
 as the most unstable published 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.000
 betaversion but I have not had one yet 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.409
 problem i use the phone now 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.450
 quite a while also next 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.530
 pro I also give you the whole 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.720
 can show things because I have to 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.890
 Of course, try a bit before 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.659
 and i have not had any problems yet 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.040
 you should when you come to yours 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.380
 looks look if that any 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.900
 known bugs is something else 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.479
 not working with the 10.1 or 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.159
 10.2 you wanted to use then just because 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.869
 I can not tell you what you are 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.729
 should use or want or can 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.170
 because that's different from device to device 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.810
 will not work for all those 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.600
 regular android use a custom rom 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.549
 rom comes from read only memory 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.470
 a kind of operating system, so to speak 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.680
 I can play here at android 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.720
 and yet offers me the advantage that 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.060
 It is very close to pure android oriented 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.619
 is also in many cases one 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.409
 better battery life brings and also 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.320
 Performance improvement does not have to be 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.060
 but can and that 's just cool because 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.680
 completely pure android one has very many 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.540
 customization options and can do that 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.909
 make the device the way you want it 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.770
 besides, the biggest custom rom is in 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.750
 the android scene or the best known 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.610
 I say and therefore has the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.929
 biggest community support so i 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.850
 you chose it here but you can 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.920
 also for my sake a whole row 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.740
 us problem as you always are 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.480
 As long as you take the next step 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.060
 could make the next step 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.950
 the packet of sajani mod with open 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.670
 Pedro , we just take that 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.520
 firmware in autocad pedro or 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.250
 how to choose the program 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.880
 then from open pit and at mirjam ott and 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.440
 packet so to speak the firmware that 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.990
 means we have then the firmware file 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.420
 we maybe we have this 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.280
 update file and we have the jobs 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.510
 we need we need to load down 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.110
 and then play on our device 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.730
 have to 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.650
 For this we need a custom recovery 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.050
 So that's just what we're looking for 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.480
 google just into the valley 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.950
 Recovery then our device and then 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.780
 We usually also find a custom 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.700
 Recovery with me you now in recovery 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.170
 project because I like that best 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.720
 personally, but there are also 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.070
 example still clockwork mod is quite 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.140
 no matter what you use, you matter 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.790
 then have one that you these things on 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.350
 can play at this point again 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.000
 I take no responsibility for 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.440
 Any kind of equipment you like 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.930
 break down or something 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.660
 it is just important that you yourself 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.800
 know what she is doing here and that 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.910
 It's not my fault if anything 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.770
 happens because it can always happen 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.180
 brings can always happen but I 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.380
 had no problems but so far 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.880
 If I happen something I am for that 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.110
 not responsible look at you first 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.180
 the complete video 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.710
 that is important because otherwise could 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.080
 Something goes wrong now is first 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.290
 important that we so jan j flats and 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.630
 plus the igs and also the open pit 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.010
 pat the I always recommend together with 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.780
 the james again so if 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.640
 you are updated sometime then it is 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.710
 important that you do not directly from the device 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.240
 from updated but first still this 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.890
 patch again imitate because 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.600
 every time you update you lose 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.240
 the patch again that is if one 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.860
 new update comes out you have to 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.000
 pull whole on video on the computer 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.540
 the file could be on the device 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.860
 download 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.260
 but would have to go back to the computer 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.210
 pull again through this apg patcher 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.620
 cut through and then you have it again 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.330
 the patch for the newer version 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.710
 and then you can do it all 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.000
 resurfacing with custom recovery 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.380
 under the gate 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.540
 and do not forget about it afterwards 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.580
 the ball away and the cash to learn her 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.850
 By the way, if you open pit, get pat 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.440
 one more restore file the two 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.790
 files so the update data restore file 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.989
 Both are not complete 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.640
 guidance more but really only this 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.480
 update file it means you have to go ahead 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.700
 already his job 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.350
 Maybe you can but you can 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.600
 this restore file is sort of easy 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.470
 get rid of this open pc again without 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.060
 that your device is complete 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.590
 this must be restored 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.210
 also means if you have a current one 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.890
 his team had already installed the version 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.810
 you can just open the pit upstairs 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.320
 over it parcel and loses none 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.550
 dates 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.500
 Nevertheless, it is important that you have one 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.780
 complete backup of your complete 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.520
 Systems probably makes it go 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.900
 if you install a custom recovery 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.640
 all data is lost and you should 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.110
 anyway just always have a backup 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.210
 if anything happens here 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.500
 can happen and that's it 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.810
 now we just have to stay on ours 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.400
 device to install the pedro it manager 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.900
 and now have the possibility of individual 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.220
 rights for every single app too 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.050
 manage and can, for example, the 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.450
 facebook app the possibility of the ten 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.920
 to send sms or send mms what 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.780
 of course it's great because facebook is supposed to 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.110
 Do not send sms for me that would like 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.030
 not me 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.680
 and so you can for every single app 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.000
 to set that up and through and that 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.100
 It was just awesome now you have one 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.570
 completely safe smartphone comes 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.170
 Of course there are more apps in the 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.670
 next part 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.350
 but you can now individually 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.060
 determine which apps which rights 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.990
 it may be that some apps then 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.250
 no longer work properly 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.350
 so play around with it a bit 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.880
 and give the apps back the right ones 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.140
 you need like for example that you 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.030
 to access the accounts if 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.500
 but they need the example 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.660
 facebook app works great too 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.640
 without you being allowed to send sms and you 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.860
 can also apps the online connection 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.830
 withdraw and thus, so to speak, the 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.810
 could stop the advertising 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.730
 evade GPS reception and you can 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.930
 so that no one knows more about eps data 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.430
 get or complete the data 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.110
 withdrawing is completely up to you so you 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.150
 can set it all free as 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.220
 said completely customizable on you 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.830
 plays with lichenroth and that means 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.720
 is it that it is part of the 233 then the 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.920
 apps will come up in the next video though 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.630
 You can get your device there first 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.710
 beautiful set up and that on it 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.080
 do whatever you want you can do yours 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.550
 to say here as nexus pro already 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.200
 I'm personally using the way, by the way 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.910
 to be seen at gamescom if you so 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.100
 I'll just have a look over 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.750
 thursday and friday at gamescom 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.470
 So who wants to say hello to me 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.060
 like to do that 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.790
 Just do not talk to me 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.620
 I am very friendly and wise 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.150
 then we will see each other in the next and 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.150
 I'm looking forward to you, so it's good
