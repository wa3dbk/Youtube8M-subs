forearm curls again but this time on a
bench<00:02:37.320> you've<00:02:38.130> probably<00:02:38.280> seen<00:02:38.490> me<00:02:38.550> do<00:02:38.760> this

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
bench you've probably seen me do this

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.560 
bench you've probably seen me do this
before<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.660> my<00:02:40.020> arm<00:02:40.800> wrestlin<00:02:41.130> workout

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
before on my arm wrestlin workout

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.490 
before on my arm wrestlin workout
because<00:02:42.570> this<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:42.960> really<00:02:43.140> good<00:02:43.380> for

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
because this is really good for

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.350 
because this is really good for
strengthen<00:02:43.890> your<00:02:44.040> wrists<00:02:44.400> as<00:02:44.790> well<00:02:44.850> as<00:02:45.150> your

basically<00:02:47.130> what<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.730> gonna<00:02:48.360> get<00:02:48.600> but

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
basically what this is gonna get but

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
basically what this is gonna get but
I've<00:02:48.900> got<00:02:49.670> I've<00:02:50.670> got<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.880> five<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:52.020> two<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.740> a

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
I've got I've got a five and a two and a

I've got I've got a five and a two and a
half<00:02:53.010> kilos<00:02:53.460> on<00:02:53.880> each<00:02:54.000> side<00:02:54.240> so<00:02:54.450> it's<00:02:54.570> not

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
half kilos on each side so it's not

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.110 
half kilos on each side so it's not
exactly<00:02:54.840> heavy<00:02:55.410> but<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.370> repetitions<00:02:57.000> is

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
exactly heavy but the repetitions is

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.030 
exactly heavy but the repetitions is
what<00:02:57.270> makes<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.540> hard<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:58.110> put<00:02:58.800> your<00:02:58.890> hands

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.180 

this<00:03:27.900> next<00:03:28.110> exercise<00:03:28.260> what<00:03:29.010> you're<00:03:29.100> gonna

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
this next exercise what you're gonna

this next exercise what you're gonna
need<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:31.940> just<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:33.090> long<00:03:33.300> haul<00:03:33.540> bad<00:03:34.160> piece<00:03:35.160> of

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
need is just a long haul bad piece of

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.229 
need is just a long haul bad piece of
string<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.650> some<00:03:37.650> weights<00:03:38.040> on<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.400> end<00:03:38.519> what

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
string and some weights on the end what

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.930 
string and some weights on the end what
you<00:03:39.269> can<00:03:39.450> do<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.750> just<00:03:39.959> use<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.890> dumbbell<00:03:41.610> with

you can do is just use a dumbbell with
the<00:03:42.000> weights<00:03:42.209> off<00:03:42.450> from<00:03:42.660> time<00:03:45.050> lose<00:03:46.050> yourself

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
the weights off from time lose yourself

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.040 
the weights off from time lose yourself
in<00:03:46.709> brilliant<00:03:47.340> but<00:03:48.300> basically<00:03:48.630> what<00:03:48.870> this<00:03:48.900> is

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
in brilliant but basically what this is

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.910 
in brilliant but basically what this is
is<00:03:49.500> called<00:03:50.310> um<00:03:51.120> coils<00:03:51.570> because<00:03:52.560> what<00:03:52.680> we<00:03:52.769> do

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
is called um coils because what we do

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.729 
is called um coils because what we do
you<00:03:53.340> have<00:03:53.489> your<00:03:53.610> arms<00:03:53.820> up<00:03:53.970> straight<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:55.590> what

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
you have your arms up straight and what

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.170 
you have your arms up straight and what
we're<00:03:55.860> gonna<00:03:55.950> do<00:03:56.160> is<00:03:56.340> just<00:03:56.370> keep<00:03:57.590> rollin<00:03:59.180> so

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
we're gonna do is just keep rollin so

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.810 
we're gonna do is just keep rollin so
alternative<00:04:01.050> like<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.459> until<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.670> weight

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
alternative like that until the weight

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.410 
alternative like that until the weight
was<00:04:03.000> fully<00:04:03.239> up<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:04.700> then<00:04:05.700> what<00:04:05.820> we<00:04:05.910> do<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.090> that

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
was fully up and then what we do is that

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.650 
was fully up and then what we do is that
the<00:04:06.540> way<00:04:06.660> go<00:04:06.840> down

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
the way go down

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.120 
the way go down
don't<00:04:09.660> just<00:04:09.810> let<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.200> roll<00:04:10.350> down<00:04:10.709> with<00:04:10.950> that

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
don't just let it roll down with that

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.300 
don't just let it roll down with that
actually<00:04:11.790> make<00:04:12.150> us<00:04:12.330> see<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:12.570> comin<00:04:12.900> down<00:04:13.310> and

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
actually make us see it comin down and

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.710 
actually make us see it comin down and
then<00:04:14.519> once<00:04:14.730> it's<00:04:14.970> all<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.150> way<00:04:15.269> down<00:04:15.450> keep

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
then once it's all the way down keep

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.060 
then once it's all the way down keep
your<00:04:15.870> arm<00:04:15.959> straight<00:04:16.140> then<00:04:16.470> we<00:04:16.560> then<00:04:16.680> go<00:04:16.890> the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
your arm straight then we then go the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.740 
your arm straight then we then go the
other<00:04:17.160> way<00:04:18.470> for<00:04:19.470> this<00:04:21.290> go<00:04:22.290> along<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.620> rope

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
other way for this go along the rope

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.370 
other way for this go along the rope
but<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:27.100> all<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.370> way<00:04:27.490> up<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.960> then<00:04:29.260> we're

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
but to all the way up and then we're

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.240 
but to all the way up and then we're
going<00:04:29.470> to<00:04:29.530> let<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.740> way<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:29.919> get<00:04:30.070> it<00:04:30.160> down

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
going to let the way to get it down

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.640 
going to let the way to get it down
really<00:04:30.580> slowly<00:04:30.910> again<00:04:33.660> what<00:04:34.660> we<00:04:34.780> do<00:04:34.960> we

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
really slowly again what we do we

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.460 
really slowly again what we do we
basically<00:04:35.919> do<00:04:36.220> this<00:04:36.460> five<00:04:37.360> times<00:04:37.389> each<00:04:38.139> side

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
basically do this five times each side

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.070 
basically do this five times each side
and<00:04:38.919> you<00:04:39.460> can<00:04:39.699> do<00:04:39.850> as<00:04:40.180> many<00:04:40.300> sets<00:04:40.630> as<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:40.810> like

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
and you can do as many sets as you like

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.140 
and you can do as many sets as you like
that<00:04:41.260> those<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.680> only<00:04:41.860> do<00:04:42.070> so<00:04:42.250> I<00:04:42.310> like<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.610> set<00:04:42.970> to

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
that those I only do so I like to set to

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.730 
that those I only do so I like to set to
them<00:04:43.300> but<00:04:43.570> if<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:43.900> don't<00:04:44.229> feel<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.560> burn

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
after two sets then you can do another

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.379 
after two sets then you can do another
set<00:04:47.280> but<00:04:48.280> they're<00:04:48.400> really<00:04:48.610> good<00:04:48.880> and<00:04:49.120> you<00:04:49.240> will
