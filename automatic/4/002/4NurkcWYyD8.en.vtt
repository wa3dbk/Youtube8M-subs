bleach it the same day because you need

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.580 
bleach it the same day because you need
your<00:01:26.189> hair<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.610> rest<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.479> at<00:01:27.600> least<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:28.049> week<00:01:28.380> or

processing cat and I let it sit there

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.620 
processing cat and I let it sit there
for<00:03:48.140> like<00:03:48.470> 40<00:03:49.340> minutes<00:03:49.370> because<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.270> don't<00:03:50.300> do

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
for like 40 minutes because I don't do

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.150 
for like 40 minutes because I don't do
my<00:03:50.660> roots<00:03:50.989> birds<00:03:51.200> cannot<00:03:51.530> do<00:03:51.800> your<00:03:51.950> roots

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
my roots birds cannot do your roots

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.420 
my roots birds cannot do your roots
until<00:03:52.849> you<00:03:52.970> apply<00:03:53.180> all<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.569> hair<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.470> wait<00:03:55.040> 40

minutes<00:03:55.459> after<00:03:56.030> performance<00:03:56.480> is<00:03:56.599> up<00:03:56.750> you

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
minutes after performance is up you

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.420 
minutes after performance is up you
could<00:03:57.170> do<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.290> roots<00:03:57.590> because<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.250> roots

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
could do the roots because the roots

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.070 
could do the roots because the roots
process<00:03:58.849> faster<00:03:59.090> because<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.599> has<00:03:59.720> its<00:03:59.930> own

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
process faster because it has its own

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.259 
process faster because it has its own
