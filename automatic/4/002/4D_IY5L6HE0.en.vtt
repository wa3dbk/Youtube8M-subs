00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:12.045
This is the inside of the main house, and as you 
 can see it is a real journey back in time

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:19.064
you will see a house that was really luxurious, sumptuous I would say

00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:24.126
here we have the kitchen

00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:31.295
it's a kitchen typical of its period

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:44.119
really interesting, and although it is in a bad condition, 
 those who love restoration will quickly see its potential

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:50.197
here we can see old hand-pressed floor tiles

00:00:50.197 --> 00:00:56.368
we restored a property in Menorca which had this type of tile

00:00:56.368 --> 00:01:07.739
and there is a craftsman in Mahon who still makes this type 
 of tile when we need to repair an old floor

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:10.031
and he can assist us with this

00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:17.074
here we have a staircase with a double handrail

00:01:17.074 --> 00:01:28.784
from here we can see that it is a house  
 with very special characteristics, it's an old manor house

00:01:28.784 --> 00:01:36.166
here we find a very large dining room or a sitting room

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:56.180
as you can see it still has many details which help us to imagine 
 how luxurious it was, and how elegant the inside of this house was

00:01:56.183 --> 00:02:00.860
let's look at more rooms

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.780
the rooms are really spacious

00:02:04.782 --> 00:02:16.170
the woodwork is amazing, here for example there is another large sitting room

00:02:16.174 --> 00:02:22.980
what really grabs our attention is the woodwork with mouldings and paintings

00:02:22.982 --> 00:02:34.640
there really are so many little details, and like I said at 
 the beginning, it's a journey back into the past

00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:41.020
it's amazing that we find so many fireplaces

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.770
this is another clear sign of wealth and comfort

00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:53.230
here possibly there was papered ceiling which has been removed, a false ceiling

00:02:53.233 --> 00:03:11.320
here for example a ledge made for the window, all these type of 
 details tell us of the quality of the house in its day

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:16.300
it's a really delight for anyone who loves antiques

00:03:16.304 --> 00:03:22.080
he we have another room, it's like a double sitting room

00:03:22.083 --> 00:03:27.230
the room we saw earlier was probably the dining room

00:03:27.226 --> 00:03:36.830
and once again the woodwork reminds us of the 
 type of house that it once was

00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:46.300
and it could be once again, because this house is ideal for anyone 
 who appreciates this type of construction and would like to reform it

00:03:46.304 --> 00:03:55.050
here we have a really pretty floor, but what has happened 
 is that over time the dirt has covered it over

00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:57.320
let's continue looking at things

00:03:57.315 --> 00:04:10.620
here we have a room, much simpler, possibly 
 it was a bedroom or a perhaps a sort of library

00:04:10.618 --> 00:04:22.510
and as I said these large spaces with 
 elaborate woodwork really grabs your attention

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:27.630
let's continue looking at more things

00:04:27.627 --> 00:04:34.760
here again the tiles are hand pressed with a border pattern

00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:40.600
there are numerous rooms, just this house has more than 700 square metres

00:04:40.595 --> 00:04:57.150
here we have a room which we cannot get to as it is closed, 
 but here, one moment, here we can get to the upper part

00:04:57.149 --> 00:05:10.510
usually here there are large rooms which were drying 
 rooms to store the food of the house

00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:18.510
let's see if we can get in, but 
 carefully as its a very old house

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:23.170
here for instance, it is closed-off but there are more rooms with more space

00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:25.740
here they probably kept animals

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:37.170
well, what we have seen will give you a good 
 idea of the potential that this house has

00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:39.080
let's continue

00:05:39.076 --> 00:05:45.980
this is the inside of the farmer's house, the tenant 
 farmer or payÃ©s as we call them in Menorca

00:05:45.985 --> 00:05:50.600
it has different rooms, it's spacious

00:05:50.604 --> 00:05:55.920
we can see different rooms

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:03.270
it's very personal, and I do not want to invade the privacy 
 of the owners and so I'm going to be very brief

00:06:03.268 --> 00:06:08.970
I'm amazed by the walls, they are very thick

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.010
here we have a bedroom

00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:16.350
with wooden ceiling beams

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:22.160
here they have changed some of the beams as these are concrete beams

00:06:22.163 --> 00:06:27.860
here again we can see the thickness of the walls which are enormous

00:06:27.858 --> 00:06:33.050
this is the kitchen area, and it has a vaulted ceiling

00:06:33.054 --> 00:06:38.730
it would be nice to restore to take off 
 the paint and to expose the stone

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.980
and this leads to the outside

00:06:42.976 --> 00:06:50.400
it has a lot of square metres, I'm not sure how many 
 rooms, I'm not going to go in these rooms

00:06:50.398 --> 00:06:54.920
but it's really interesting, let's go
