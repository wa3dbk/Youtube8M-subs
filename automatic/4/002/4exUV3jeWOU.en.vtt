00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the number pad on the side so it's a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.660 
the number pad on the side so it's a
little<00:01:22.560> bit<00:01:22.650> bigger<00:01:22.860> than<00:01:23.070> what<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.340> want

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
little bit bigger than what I want

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.160

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that's why I went for this and plus I

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.319 
that's why I went for this and plus I
think<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.009> RGB<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:28.939> keyboard<00:01:29.939> just

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
think that the RGB of this keyboard just

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.179 
think that the RGB of this keyboard just
looks<00:01:30.509> really<00:01:30.840> really<00:01:31.020> cool<00:01:31.470> being<00:01:31.799> able<00:01:31.920> to

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
looks really really cool being able to

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
looks really really cool being able to
pick<00:01:32.820> any<00:01:33.060> color<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.659> anything<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.229> want

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
pick any color for anything you want

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.080 
pick any color for anything you want
like<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.740> says<00:01:34.920> right<00:01:34.950> here<00:01:35.810> 16.8<00:01:36.810> million<00:01:37.229> key

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
like it says right here 16.8 million key

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.289

inexpensive so let's go ahead and let's
just<00:02:06.299> slice<00:02:06.540> into<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.869> side<00:02:07.079> here

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
course this is just an unboxing but I

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.599 
course this is just an unboxing but I
will<00:03:48.989> plug<00:03:49.319> this<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.949> guys<00:03:50.129> can<00:03:50.459> get<00:03:50.549> a

good look at the LEDs when they lit up
hopefully<00:03:53.549> it's<00:03:53.909> pre-programmed<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.959> do

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
hopefully it's pre-programmed to do

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.289 
hopefully it's pre-programmed to do
something<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.400> guys<00:03:56.669> can<00:03:56.909> see<00:03:57.060> what<00:03:57.180> it

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
unfortunately it's not programmed to do

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.750 
unfortunately it's not programmed to do
anything<00:04:46.960> cool<00:04:47.470> right<00:04:47.889> out<00:04:48.010> of<00:04:48.040> the<00:04:48.220> box<00:04:48.460> it's

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
anything cool right out of the box it's

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.629 
anything cool right out of the box it's
just<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:49.060> simple<00:04:50.220> WASD<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.250> then<00:04:52.050> directional

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
just a simple WASD and then directional

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.710 
just a simple WASD and then directional
directional<00:04:54.639> keys<00:04:54.820> right<00:04:55.000> there<00:04:55.060> so<00:04:55.510> those

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
directional keys right there so those

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.210 
directional keys right there so those
are<00:04:55.840> lit<00:04:55.990> up<00:04:56.080> white<00:04:56.290> and<00:04:56.620> then<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:56.979> rest<00:04:57.130> of

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
are lit up white and then the rest of

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.610 
are lit up white and then the rest of
the<00:04:57.340> keypad<00:04:57.700> is<00:04:57.910> actually<00:04:58.270> red<00:04:58.510> so<00:04:59.350> it's<00:04:59.500> not

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
the keypad is actually red so it's not

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.890 
the keypad is actually red so it's not
programmed<00:05:00.100> to<00:05:00.160> do<00:05:00.310> anything<00:05:00.490> fancy<00:05:01.000> like<00:05:01.840> I

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
programmed to do anything fancy like I

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.150 
programmed to do anything fancy like I
said<00:05:02.080> this<00:05:02.139> isn't<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.500> full<00:05:02.680> review<00:05:02.830> so<00:05:03.070> I'm

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
said this isn't the full review so I'm

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.440 
said this isn't the full review so I'm
not<00:05:03.280> going<00:05:03.400> to<00:05:03.460> go<00:05:03.550> through<00:05:03.850> too<00:05:04.090> many<00:05:04.210> details

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
not going to go through too many details

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.719 
not going to go through too many details
of<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.020> keyboard<00:05:05.410> but<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:05.710> do<00:05:05.830> have<00:05:05.979> a<00:05:06.040> little

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
of the keyboard but you do have a little

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.010 
of the keyboard but you do have a little
light<00:05:06.940> switch<00:05:07.150> to<00:05:07.270> which<00:05:07.360> allows<00:05:07.690> you<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.840> show

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
light switch to which allows you to show

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.960 
light switch to which allows you to show
off<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.229> LEDs<00:05:08.530> that's<00:05:09.340> its<00:05:09.490> lowest<00:05:09.850> setting

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
off the LEDs that's its lowest setting

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.820 
off the LEDs that's its lowest setting
medium<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:10.600> then<00:05:10.720> high<00:05:10.930> it's<00:05:11.229> just<00:05:11.440> like<00:05:11.650> my

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
medium and then high it's just like my

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.710 
medium and then high it's just like my
