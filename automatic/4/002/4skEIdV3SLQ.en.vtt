00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello again we are here with another 

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:10.780
 video tutorial on techniques of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.790
 guitar on this occasion what are we going to 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.450
 to do is to learn how the 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.740
 righi rhythms 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.720
 in many of its aspects, like the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.189
 funky rhythm that we saw in the video 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.140
 previous the idea is that this hand though 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.759
 some will say good because it does not either 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.829
 it is necessary to set the pace constantly 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.710
 good I for planning I prefer that 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.060
 people strum constantly to 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.040
 shine in that rhythm 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.290
 as I said in the previous video for 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.570
 those who have not seen it what 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.830
 it's about keeping a strumming semi 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.830
 known with this hand 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.160
 agree and what we are going to do with the 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.630
 another hand now is making the chords 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:08.120
 in this case I'm going to make a progression 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:10.100
 that will be simple because you can 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.280
 choose any other because what is 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.140
 it's about learning how the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.950
 reed and good rhythms as I said 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.710
 let's keep the rhythm constant and 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.510
 what we are going to do in the reagge is 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.740
 usually the guitar what's going to 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.960
 do is 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.950
 sound the chords in the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.280
 setbacks of major hits 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.520
 1 2 3 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.549
 4 1 2 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.770
 4 what we are going to do is touch on the 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.630
 setbacks then to count the 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.000
 prototypes I recommend adding the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:55.659
 letter and between each of those of the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.090
 numbers would be 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 1 and 2 and 3 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:10.780
 and 4 agree that we are going to do is 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:13.939
 keep the right hand 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.939
 [Music] 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.550
 [Music] 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.870
 two 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:52.450
 and let's see again a variant on this 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.129
 same rhythm instead of making a note of 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.680
 every setback for things we can 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.890
 do two then the variation would be 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.890
 A) Yes 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:11.499
 [Music] 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.349
 well you already have as you see two variants 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.299
 about this same rhythm of ricky there are some 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.720
 fairly frequent variations that is 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:28.120
 do the shuffle or swing type rhythm 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.370
 agree that instead of being so straight 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.940
 taka taka taka taka then what is it 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.879
 is in let's say group the hits for 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.590
 that are not so symmetrical then in 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.590
 this case the rhythm would be more similar 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.340
 Well with this type of variation also 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:19.339
 you can do it 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:19.339
 [Music] 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.210
 Well, I hope you have understood 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.020
 of the ricky rhythms in guitar us 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.020
 we see in the following video
