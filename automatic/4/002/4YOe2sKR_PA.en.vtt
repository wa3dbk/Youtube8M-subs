minutes<00:01:27.570> or<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.070> my<00:01:29.310> bowl<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.880> my<00:01:29.939> big

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
minutes or so so in my bowl and my big

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.749 
minutes or so so in my bowl and my big
bowl<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.869> four<00:01:31.350> blocks<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:32.009> softened

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
bowl I have four blocks of softened

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.280 
bowl I have four blocks of softened
room-temperature<00:01:33.329> cream<00:01:33.540> cheese<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.049> it's

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
room-temperature cream cheese and it's

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.690 
room-temperature cream cheese and it's
important<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.979> they're<00:01:35.130> softened<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.670> room

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
important that they're softened at room

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.880 
important that they're softened at room
temperature<00:01:36.299> because<00:01:36.450> it'll<00:01:36.869> blend<00:01:37.170> very

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
temperature because it'll blend very

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.069 
temperature because it'll blend very
nicely<00:01:38.009> it'll<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> smooth<00:01:39.150> creamy<00:01:39.720> filling

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
nicely it'll be a smooth creamy filling

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.469 
nicely it'll be a smooth creamy filling
you<00:01:40.439> won't<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.770> any<00:01:40.920> lumps<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.549> it'll<00:01:42.299> help

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
you won't have any lumps and it'll help

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.080 
you won't have any lumps and it'll help
for<00:01:43.259> even<00:01:43.649> baking<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.490> won't<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:45.060> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
for even baking so you won't have a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.270 
for even baking so you won't have a
crack<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.930> top<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.500> when<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.070> bake

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
crack on the top and when you bake

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.740 
crack on the top and when you bake
cheesecake<00:01:47.579> that's<00:01:48.329> something<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.720> should

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
cheesecake that's something you should

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.380 
cheesecake that's something you should
strive<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:50.070> not<00:01:50.100> want<00:01:50.880> there<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
strive for you do not want there to be a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.560 
strive for you do not want there to be a
huge<00:01:51.780> crack<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> crater<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
huge crack or like a crater and in the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.209 
huge crack or like a crater and in the
middle<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:55.079> cheesecake<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.040> that's

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
middle of your cheesecake and that's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.830 
middle of your cheesecake and that's
really<00:01:56.369> first<00:01:56.670> static<00:01:57.000> reasons<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.630> also

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
really first static reasons but it also

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.480 
really first static reasons but it also
is<00:01:57.990> an<00:01:58.170> indication<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.890> over<00:01:59.250> baked

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
is an indication that you over baked

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.190 
is an indication that you over baked
over<00:01:59.909> mixed<00:02:00.240> or<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.540> your<00:02:00.689> ingredients<00:02:00.930> were

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
over mixed or that your ingredients were

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
not at the right temperature so on top

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.090 
not at the right temperature so on top
of<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.380> you're<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.770> want<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.950> go<00:02:05.009> ahead

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
of that you're going to want to go ahead

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.660 
of that you're going to want to go ahead
and<00:02:05.340> sprinkle<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.969> your

tablespoons of flour and that's going to

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.830 
tablespoons of flour and that's going to
kind<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.069> keep<00:02:15.370> everything<00:02:15.700> tight<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.510> bind

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
it all together as well as the eggs

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.650 
it all together as well as the eggs
that's<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.790> purpose<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.300> eggs<00:02:19.450> as<00:02:19.630> well

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
that's the purpose of the eggs as well

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.390 
that's the purpose of the eggs as well
and<00:02:20.200> that's<00:02:20.470> just<00:02:20.680> for<00:02:21.040> again

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
and that's just for again

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.790 
and that's just for again
room-temperature<00:02:22.209> eggs<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:23.050> then<00:02:23.470> I'm<00:02:23.620> also

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
room-temperature eggs and then I'm also

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.559 
room-temperature eggs and then I'm also
going<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.130> put<00:02:24.340> in<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.700> little<00:02:24.880> grating<00:02:25.420> of

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
going to put in just a little grating of

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.050 
going to put in just a little grating of
lemon<00:02:26.380> peel<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.100> not<00:02:27.190> necessary<00:02:27.790> so

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
lemon peel and this is not necessary so

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.210 
lemon peel and this is not necessary so
you<00:02:28.120> can<00:02:28.360> kind<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.810> skip<00:02:29.739> this<00:02:29.860> all<00:02:30.040> together

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
you can kind of skip this all together

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.550 
you can kind of skip this all together
but<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.670> find<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.150> because<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.170> rich

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
but I find that because this is so rich

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.949 
but I find that because this is so rich
and<00:02:32.890> creamy<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.940> this<00:02:34.300> really<00:02:34.630> kind<00:02:34.810> of

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
and creamy that this really kind of

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.170 
and creamy that this really kind of
helps<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.440> lighten<00:02:36.069> it<00:02:36.160> up<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.970> really

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
helps to lighten it up and it really

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.330 
helps to lighten it up and it really
kind<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.480> perfumes<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.200> with<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.319> soft<00:02:38.680> citrusy

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
kind of perfumes it with a soft citrusy

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.610 
kind of perfumes it with a soft citrusy
some<00:02:39.580> sets<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.720> really<00:02:41.319> like<00:02:41.470> the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
some sets to it so I really like the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.460 
some sets to it so I really like the
addition<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:43.569> without<00:02:43.720> adding

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
addition of this so without adding

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.990 
addition of this so without adding
anything<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.340> like<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.640> just<00:02:45.760> kind<00:02:45.970> of

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
anything to it I like to just kind of

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.729 
anything to it I like to just kind of
break<00:02:46.299> up<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.720> cream<00:02:46.930> cheese<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.290> little<00:02:47.440> bit

and<00:02:47.980> then<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.459> like<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.850> go<00:02:48.940> ahead<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.390> gray<00:02:49.690> in

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
to do is over mix this because then

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.229

so<00:05:45.470> slightly<00:05:45.500> and<00:05:46.310> then<00:05:46.460> you're<00:05:46.789> basically

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
so slightly and then you're basically

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.480 
so slightly and then you're basically
going<00:05:47.390> to<00:05:47.450> toss<00:05:47.810> it<00:05:48.080> in<00:05:48.229> Barry<00:05:48.710> so<00:05:49.100> go<00:05:49.310> ahead

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
going to toss it in Barry so go ahead

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.830 
going to toss it in Barry so go ahead
and<00:05:51.520> coat<00:05:52.520> your<00:05:52.760> berries<00:05:53.330> and

and coat your berries and
struggling<00:05:54.320> uh<00:05:54.470> kind<00:05:54.800> of<00:05:54.889> uh<00:05:55.070> pull<00:05:55.430> them<00:05:55.669> in

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
struggling uh kind of uh pull them in

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.970 
struggling uh kind of uh pull them in
like<00:05:56.090> this<00:05:56.330> and<00:05:56.630> the<00:05:57.260> reason<00:05:57.320> I'm<00:05:57.620> doing<00:05:57.650> this

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
like this and the reason I'm doing this

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.590 
like this and the reason I'm doing this
is<00:05:58.130> because<00:05:58.400> it's<00:05:58.730> going<00:05:58.850> to<00:05:58.910> glisten<00:05:59.300> and

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
is because it's going to glisten and

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.300 
is because it's going to glisten and
shimmer<00:05:59.990> it's<00:06:00.290> going<00:06:00.410> to<00:06:00.470> basically<00:06:00.560> gel<00:06:01.070> back

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
shimmer it's going to basically gel back

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.460 
shimmer it's going to basically gel back
up<00:06:01.520> as<00:06:01.669> it<00:06:01.880> cools<00:06:02.180> and<00:06:02.479> it'll<00:06:03.050> have<00:06:03.229> this

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
up as it cools and it'll have this

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.409 
up as it cools and it'll have this
really<00:06:03.800> beautiful<00:06:04.070> effect<00:06:04.610> on<00:06:04.790> top<00:06:05.000> of<00:06:05.300> the

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
really beautiful effect on top of the

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.230 
really beautiful effect on top of the
cheesecake<00:06:05.930> so<00:06:06.770> go<00:06:06.949> ahead<00:06:07.070> and<00:06:07.280> take<00:06:08.000> this

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
cheesecake so go ahead and take this

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.030 
cheesecake so go ahead and take this
mixture<00:06:08.690> and<00:06:08.930> like<00:06:09.080> I<00:06:09.169> said<00:06:09.229> fresh<00:06:09.530> frames<00:06:09.830> to
