you're going to click on it it's like
pose<00:01:19.650> mode<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.159> now<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:20.880> pose<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.060> easy

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
pose mode and now you can pose it easy

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.390 
pose mode and now you can pose it easy
is<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.259> there's<00:01:22.619> several<00:01:22.830> ways<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.250> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
is that there's several ways to do that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.359 
is that there's several ways to do that
but<00:01:23.549> that's<00:01:23.700> definitely<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.210> easiest<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:26.220> now

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
but that's definitely the easiest so now

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.490 
but that's definitely the easiest so now
this<00:01:26.670> brings<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.090> question<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.659> how<00:01:28.439> do

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
this brings up the question of how do

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.620 
this brings up the question of how do
you<00:01:28.650> actually<00:01:28.710> pose<00:01:29.220> them<00:01:29.460> same<00:01:30.180> thing<00:01:30.450> it's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
you actually pose them same thing it's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.050 
you actually pose them same thing it's
like<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.960> as<00:01:31.110> if<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.680> had<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.130> single<00:01:32.640> Simmons

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
like is as if you had a single Simmons

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.490 
like is as if you had a single Simmons
file<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.869> move<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.140> any<00:01:34.259> way<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.409> want

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
file you can move it any way you want

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.289 
file you can move it any way you want
you're<00:01:35.280> still<00:01:35.520> going<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.000> file

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
you're still going to have to file

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.940 
you're still going to have to file

like<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.619> would<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.009> that's<00:01:47.640> how<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.820> pose

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
like you would and that's how you pose

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.300 
like you would and that's how you pose
two<00:01:49.079> sims<00:01:49.290> together<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.189> that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
for multiple sins but it gets a little

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.460 
for multiple sins but it gets a little
bit<00:01:53.430> tricky<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:53.939> not<00:01:54.119> really<00:01:54.329> when<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> have

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
bit tricky but not really when you have
