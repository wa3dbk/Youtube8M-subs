00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.739
 looking in the description information 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.720
 of the video you give to show more and there 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.810
 you have the other videos for now 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.329
 13 but still when they update it 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.500
 I'll be putting more so that nothing 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.800

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.150
 it's been all for this video I remember that 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.770
 are all solutions so if not 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.260
 I was on stand at what I was looking for is because 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.810

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.400

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.360
 updating as you go up 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.470
