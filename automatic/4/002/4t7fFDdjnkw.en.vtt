00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 ok 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.119
 nice to all the shining sager guys 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.490
 as you can see I am alone because 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.470
 I'm commenting on the new zombie map 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.630
 parade that just come out at 12 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.710
 have put more or less the download and in 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.000
 I will show you this video more or less 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.059
 a little bit the beginning of the map the first seven 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.930
 eight round the arms on the wall as it opens 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.660
 where is the key to the dinner of 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.980
 this time I will find guardian again 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.069
 once the rega mark ii is the new weapon 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.370
 which seems to be like the wonder goes fan 

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:54.589
 of the kooks 1 however you can see the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.329
 graphics the well done map here are i 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.679
 first rounds 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.999
 here after the first room where you expose 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.729
 it speeds up once and then it falls 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:07.640
 down this to get this room 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.659
 seizure is used to put the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.479
 you own weapons 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.650
 in fact the shapes are drawn but if 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.690
 click on it gives you as if it were a 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.790
 chalk and then you go there in fact 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.220
 write on the question mark 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.780
 the weapon in question not only the weapon that 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.680
 in this case one chooses as the 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.750
 first time I tried to click on 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.850
 crush on the remington is that 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.880
 drawn on the question mark 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.320
 see this is the first time indeed ok 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:43.190
 perfect and i took the remington here 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.050
 let's press the pre town A Type 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.050
 piece before here is the city 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.140
 meanwhile here I was trying to foresee pieces e 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.140
 various stuff 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.410
 more speeded up some guys because 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.240
 however the game was quite long 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.550
 just to let you bring me a video 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.600
 immediately and initially had to speed up 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.400
 here to upload as soon as possible 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.690
 there's the first work table I don't know 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.470
 what is another question mark? 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.580
 and here is the chest in this house if not 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:25.360
 I will find here here and there is the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.800
 I will find the beautiful new python 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.390
 revolver and here is the key to 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.120
 guardian already just taken from mine 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.800
 mate when we were playing 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.560
 and here is the door for the giant 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.840
 to give her to drink that he in a few 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.010
 words will move the rubble 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.440
 all the rubble you will find here 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.720
 during the map you will not be able to move 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.780
 he will take care of it only in any case to do 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.640
 yes, she's going to have to give it to him 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.740
 drink alcohol that you can find anyway 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.020
 in the hobby cell or the good or bad 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.030
 we found it in the cell on the table 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:01.150
 In fact I was trying some more piece 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:03.450
 implemented this piece here anyway I have to 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.340
 say that as a map it is quite nice 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.320
 that is for what I could see i 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.010
 first 10 15 minutes of gameplay is not 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.340
 not bad at all 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:17.830
 here is giant now drinking beach continues to 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:20.489
 smashing into nothing to destroy 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.489
 file seven 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.209
 here you see giant is going to go to 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.939
 smash something like 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.760
 then as usual the b 23 r as doors 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:41.250
 that they open but it's okay I didn't have 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:43.889
 money so I could not open here 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.750
 the power of the new python 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:50.400
 mom mia here reloading fight fight 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.519
 with a stroke of course the first rounds 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.430
 but I have to say that it's really good 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.430
 weapon as was the old python in short 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.379
 there is samantha that sometimes appears 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.840
 from the end there is indeed a reputational cost 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:11.120
 samantha and now here guys rega mark 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.319
 ii for the second time seen the ra.gi 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.840
 here I will try it enough because 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.370
 however that at the beginning of zungri hand 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.780
 everywhere therefore not knowing well but a 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.769
 party that were in trouble here 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.440
 other pieces 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.440
 but I don't know how they were here at the bar he has 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.570
 but further on where I'll show you where 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.509
 find that is the ball for the easy egg 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.979
 it seemed I don't know if I said in bars yes 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.990
 will find the win knife 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.380
 obviously there will always be something to 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.360
 the sofa will open and obstacles though 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.270
 there will be the boy knife here are others 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.889
 pieces where to open to the guardian as the 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:49.020
 giant guardians here other pieces of 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.919
 map it is likely that this map is 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.050
 really huge 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:57.150
 or better at the beginning it seems huge like 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.900
 of the river was the other maps but not 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.900
 we know 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.000
 here is to open the bar with a boat 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.550
 I don't know what else to work at 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.050

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.289
