00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
they were all together what I personally

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.790 
they were all together what I personally
felt<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:58.120> I<00:04:58.450> don't<00:04:58.690> think<00:04:59.050> initially<00:04:59.320> I

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
felt that I don't think initially I

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.000 
felt that I don't think initially I
should<00:05:00.100> be<00:05:00.250> available<00:05:00.820> for<00:05:01.060> film<00:05:01.419> for<00:05:02.020> more

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
should be available for film for more

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.980 
should be available for film for more
than<00:05:03.160> four<00:05:03.340> three<00:05:03.520> seven<00:05:03.700> zero<00:05:03.850> and<00:05:04.419> so<00:05:04.840> that

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
than four three seven zero and so that

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.330 
than four three seven zero and so that
is<00:05:05.110> what<00:05:05.320> I<00:05:05.740> have

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
is what I have

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:44.810 
is what I have
because<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:42.479> don't<00:05:43.479> think<00:05:43.900> so<00:05:44.050> because

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
because I don't think so because

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.490 
because I don't think so because
definitely<00:05:45.820> still<00:05:46.360> you<00:05:46.510> will<00:05:46.630> have<00:05:46.810> 24<00:05:47.229> songs

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
definitely still you will have 24 songs

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.860 
definitely still you will have 24 songs
of<00:05:47.650> image<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.220> you<00:05:48.790> will<00:05:49.000> have<00:05:50.520> one<00:05:51.520> album<00:05:51.870> so

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
of image and you will have one album so

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.650 
of image and you will have one album so
I<00:05:52.960> think<00:05:53.020> that<00:05:53.350> should<00:05:53.830> be<00:05:53.979> enough<00:05:54.540> into<00:05:55.540> this

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
I think that should be enough into this

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.420 
I think that should be enough into this
times<00:05:55.930> when<00:05:56.169> everyone<00:05:56.560> is<00:05:56.680> just<00:05:56.860> restricting

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
times when everyone is just restricting

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.750 
times when everyone is just restricting
him<00:05:57.520> coming<00:05:57.789> out<00:05:57.910> work<00:05:58.150> I<00:05:58.330> I<00:05:59.139> inside<00:05:59.979> when<00:06:00.669> the

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
him coming out work I I inside when the

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.350 
him coming out work I I inside when the
time<00:06:00.940> was<00:06:01.060> there<00:06:01.270> I<00:06:01.810> did<00:06:02.410> about<00:06:02.650> 240<00:06:03.250> songs<00:06:03.610> of

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.050 

36<00:06:07.360> once<00:06:08.260> and<00:06:08.440> I<00:06:08.500> practically<00:06:09.430> got<00:06:09.669> all<00:06:09.910> the

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
36 once and I practically got all the

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.600 
36 once and I practically got all the
words<00:06:10.300> of<00:06:10.450> the<00:06:10.539> season<00:06:10.930> but<00:06:11.680> now<00:06:12.010> I<00:06:12.039> think<00:06:12.250> it's

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
words of the season but now I think it's

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.700 
words of the season but now I think it's
time<00:06:12.850> to<00:06:12.880> cut<00:06:13.720> down<00:06:13.840> my<00:06:13.900> work<00:06:14.289> and<00:06:14.470> just

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
time to cut down my work and just

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.279 
time to cut down my work and just
concentrate<00:06:15.580> on<00:06:15.789> exactly<00:06:16.479> what<00:06:16.720> just<00:06:16.960> I<00:06:17.080> want

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
concentrate on exactly what just I want

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.230 
concentrate on exactly what just I want
to<00:06:17.350> do<00:06:17.500> give<00:06:18.070> me<00:06:18.190> job<00:06:18.340> satisfaction<00:06:18.550> and<00:06:19.090> to

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
to do give me job satisfaction and to

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.360 
to do give me job satisfaction and to
satisfy<00:06:19.419> so<00:06:20.380> many<00:06:20.560> times<00:06:20.830> because<00:06:21.220> the

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
satisfy so many times because the

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:38.520 
satisfy so many times because the
expectations<00:06:21.940> are<00:06:35.160> I<00:06:37.229> surprised<00:06:38.229> but<00:06:38.380> I'm

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
expectations are I surprised but I'm

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.930 
expectations are I surprised but I'm
still<00:06:39.090> reading<00:06:40.090> and<00:06:41.130> because<00:06:42.130> music<00:06:42.550> is

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
still reading and because music is

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.660 
still reading and because music is
something<00:06:43.240> very<00:06:43.539> refined

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670 
something very refined

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.300 
something very refined
if<00:06:45.510> I<00:06:45.600> stop<00:06:45.870> doing<00:06:45.990> realize<00:06:46.380> it<00:06:46.740> just<00:06:49.310> it

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
if I stop doing realize it just it

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.890 
if I stop doing realize it just it
doesn't<00:06:50.520> work<00:06:50.760> that<00:06:50.910> way<00:06:51.090> I<00:06:51.120> think<00:06:51.510> I'm<00:06:51.660> still

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
doesn't work that way I think I'm still

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.320 
doesn't work that way I think I'm still
composing<00:06:52.380> three<00:06:52.530> song<00:06:52.740> setting<00:06:53.010> but<00:06:53.220> if<00:06:54.030> I'm

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
composing three song setting but if I'm

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.840

extremely<00:06:55.080> satisfied<00:06:55.410> with<00:06:55.890> that<00:06:56.010> song<00:06:56.280> then

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:56.850 
extremely satisfied with that song then

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:02.990 
extremely satisfied with that song then
