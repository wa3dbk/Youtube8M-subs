about this one beautiful quality fish
we're<00:01:55.259> going<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.560> use<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.979> lateral<00:01:56.430> line

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
we're going to use the lateral line

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.310 
we're going to use the lateral line
which<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> line<00:01:57.149> down<00:01:57.600> here<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> guide

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
which is the line down here is the guide

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.920 
which is the line down here is the guide
for<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.619> blade<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.640> take<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> blade<00:02:00.240> and

for the blade and take the blade and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.050 
for the blade and take the blade and
just<00:02:01.200> push<00:02:01.409> straight<00:02:01.439> down<00:02:01.799> onto<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.640> lateral

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
just push straight down onto the lateral

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.760 
just push straight down onto the lateral
line<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.719> knife<00:02:03.930> will<00:02:04.170> drop<00:02:04.380> onto<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
line and the knife will drop onto the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.560 
line and the knife will drop onto the
bone

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
bone

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.170

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
but the bone has a ridge in the middle I

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.630 
but the bone has a ridge in the middle I
just<00:02:08.570> drop<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.990> tip<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.320> the<00:02:09.410> blade<00:02:09.500> over<00:02:09.920> the
