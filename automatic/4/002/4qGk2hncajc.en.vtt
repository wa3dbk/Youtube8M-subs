00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
the process of me doing that also I

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.390 
the process of me doing that also I
couldn't<00:00:09.840> have<00:00:09.929> picked<00:00:10.050> any<00:00:10.320> worse<00:00:10.530> time<00:00:10.950> to

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
couldn't have picked any worse time to
