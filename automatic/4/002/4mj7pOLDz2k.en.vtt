corner because that's what you used to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.480 
corner because that's what you used to
have<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:06.900> whereas<00:01:07.290> now<00:01:07.440> you<00:01:08.130> kind<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.340> just

have to do whereas now you kind of just
shoot<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.979> sandbox<00:01:14.460> experience<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.060> we

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
shoot the sandbox experience that we

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
shoot the sandbox experience that we
usually<00:01:15.240> described<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.020> where<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.800> do

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
usually described it as where you can do

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
usually described it as where you can do
anything<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> battlefield<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.420> got

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
anything on the battlefield just got

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.260 
anything on the battlefield just got
another<00:01:18.869> layer<00:01:19.350> added<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.190> it<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:21.030> now

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
another layer added to it because now

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
another layer added to it because now
you<00:01:21.330> don't<00:01:21.660> have<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.840> go<00:01:22.020> round<00:01:22.560> static<00:01:23.160> your

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you don't have to go round static your

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.710

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
bigs anything like that and what we can

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.030 
bigs anything like that and what we can
just<00:01:24.750> take<00:01:25.050> out<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> walls<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:25.770> through

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
just take out the walls and go through

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.950 
just take out the walls and go through
the<00:01:26.700> tanks<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.390> drive<00:01:27.570> through<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the tanks can just drive through the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.020 
the tanks can just drive through the
forest<00:01:28.350> instead<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.070> lot<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.729> will
