this<00:00:25.070> is<00:00:25.250> a<00:00:25.570> ec135<00:00:26.570> it<00:00:27.050> is<00:00:27.410> when<00:00:27.980> engines<00:00:28.430> so

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
this is a ec135 it is when engines so

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.790 
this is a ec135 it is when engines so
that's<00:00:28.760> a<00:00:28.880> safety<00:00:29.120> feature<00:00:29.360> in<00:00:29.690> of<00:00:29.840> itself<00:00:30.200> it

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
that's a safety feature in of itself it

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.030 
that's a safety feature in of itself it
also<00:00:30.830> has<00:00:31.550> a<00:00:31.580> weather<00:00:32.150> radar<00:00:32.510> in<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.040> cockpit

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
also has a weather radar in the cockpit

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.370 
also has a weather radar in the cockpit
where<00:00:34.220> the<00:00:34.340> pilot<00:00:34.700> sits<00:00:34.730> and<00:00:35.300> that<00:00:35.630> enables<00:00:36.230> us

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
where the pilot sits and that enables us

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.080 
where the pilot sits and that enables us
to<00:00:36.440> be<00:00:36.650> able<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:36.830> tell<00:00:37.070> where<00:00:37.310> the<00:00:37.460> storms<00:00:37.850> are

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
to be able to tell where the storms are

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.660 
to be able to tell where the storms are
and<00:00:38.330> how<00:00:38.480> to<00:00:38.540> how<00:00:38.900> to<00:00:38.930> avoid<00:00:39.350> those<00:00:39.650> as<00:00:39.920> well<00:00:40.100> it

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
and how to how to avoid those as well it

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.190 
and how to how to avoid those as well it
also<00:00:40.850> has<00:00:41.120> something<00:00:41.390> that<00:00:41.629> shows<00:00:41.840> us<00:00:42.020> where

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
also has something that shows us where

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.110 
also has something that shows us where
the<00:00:42.350> lightning<00:00:42.739> strikes<00:00:43.070> are<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:43.790> we<00:00:43.910> can

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
the lightning strikes are so that we can

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.119 
the lightning strikes are so that we can
tell<00:00:44.390> if<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.840> storm<00:00:45.140> or<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.440> cloud<00:00:45.739> coverage

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
tell if the storm or the cloud coverage

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.340 
tell if the storm or the cloud coverage
that<00:00:46.340> we<00:00:46.430> see<00:00:46.640> actually<00:00:47.090> has<00:00:47.300> production<00:00:48.050> of

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
that we see actually has production of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.390 
that we see actually has production of
lightning<00:00:48.739> with<00:00:48.980> it

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
lightning with it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.890 
lightning with it
the<00:00:49.640> other<00:00:49.760> thing<00:00:49.970> that<00:00:50.000> it<00:00:50.210> has<00:00:50.360> is<00:00:50.570> it's<00:00:50.720> got

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
the other thing that it has is it's got

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.950 
the other thing that it has is it's got
something<00:00:51.290> that<00:00:51.790> allows<00:00:52.790> us<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.270> see<00:00:53.480> towers

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
something that allows us to see towers

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.139 
something that allows us to see towers
other<00:00:54.260> air<00:00:54.680> traffic<00:00:55.100> that<00:00:55.489> we<00:00:55.640> may<00:00:55.820> not<00:00:55.970> have

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
other air traffic that we may not have

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.510 
other air traffic that we may not have
seen<00:00:56.450> because<00:00:56.720> of<00:00:56.960> cloud<00:00:57.890> coverage<00:00:58.340> or

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
seen because of cloud coverage or

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.920 
seen because of cloud coverage or
anything<00:00:58.820> else<00:00:59.000> that<00:00:59.210> was<00:00:59.300> going<00:00:59.570> on<00:00:59.690> with<00:00:59.899> us

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
anything else that was going on with us

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.650 
anything else that was going on with us
so<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.860> features<00:01:01.520> in<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.940> front<00:01:02.270> of<00:01:02.480> the

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
so the features in the front of the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.600 
so the features in the front of the
aircraft<00:01:02.840> are<00:01:03.350> actually<00:01:03.739> all<00:01:03.920> geared<00:01:04.220> towards

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
aircraft are actually all geared towards

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.310 
aircraft are actually all geared towards
a<00:01:04.699> safe<00:01:04.910> flight<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:05.780> when<00:01:05.899> you<00:01:05.990> look<00:01:06.140> at<00:01:06.229> the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
a safe flight so when you look at the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.710 
a safe flight so when you look at the
type<00:01:06.500> calls<00:01:06.770> that<00:01:07.070> we<00:01:07.160> do<00:01:07.369> our<00:01:07.759> staff<00:01:08.240> are<00:01:08.540> both

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
type calls that we do our staff are both

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.680 
type calls that we do our staff are both
person<00:01:09.560> as<00:01:09.710> well<00:01:09.950> as<00:01:10.100> our<00:01:10.250> pilots<00:01:10.729> at<00:01:10.850> landing

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
person as well as our pilots at landing

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.630 
person as well as our pilots at landing
on<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.960> side<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.320> road<00:01:12.530> in<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.979> field<00:01:13.250> on

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
on the side of the road in the field on

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.940 
on the side of the road in the field on
the<00:01:13.880> interstate<00:01:14.390> things<00:01:14.660> like<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.649> pick

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
the interstate things like that to pick

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.410 
the interstate things like that to pick
up<00:01:16.070> patients<00:01:16.250> that<00:01:16.580> have<00:01:16.670> been<00:01:16.790> in<00:01:16.880> accidents

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
up patients that have been in accidents

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.120 
up patients that have been in accidents
or<00:01:17.540> patients<00:01:18.050> that<00:01:18.110> have<00:01:18.410> them<00:01:18.619> eyes<00:01:18.860> or

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
or patients that have them eyes or

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.889 
or patients that have them eyes or
strokes<00:01:19.430> that<00:01:19.640> are<00:01:19.729> called<00:01:20.000> from<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.660> scene

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
strokes that are called from the scene

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.719 
strokes that are called from the scene
so<00:01:21.229> this<00:01:21.440> patient<00:01:21.860> may<00:01:21.979> have<00:01:22.009> started<00:01:22.340> out<00:01:22.610> at

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
so this patient may have started out at

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.930 
so this patient may have started out at
their<00:01:22.910> home<00:01:23.149> and<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:24.680> EMS<00:01:25.190> has<00:01:25.399> recognized

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
their home and the EMS has recognized

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.250 
their home and the EMS has recognized
that<00:01:26.119> they're<00:01:26.240> having<00:01:26.570> an<00:01:26.660> event<00:01:27.050> that

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
that they're having an event that

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.990 
that they're having an event that
requires<00:01:27.799> them<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:28.130> be<00:01:28.250> at<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.490> larger<00:01:28.820> facility

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
requires them to be at a larger facility

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.719 
requires them to be at a larger facility
quickly<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:30.320> we<00:01:30.440> can<00:01:30.650> lend<00:01:30.920> there<00:01:31.190> but<00:01:31.700> a

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
quickly and so we can lend there but a

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.370 
quickly and so we can lend there but a
large<00:01:32.000> portion<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.659> calls<00:01:32.869> that<00:01:32.990> we<00:01:33.229> do

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
large portion of the calls that we do

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.380 
large portion of the calls that we do
are<00:01:33.650> in<00:01:33.680> our<00:01:33.979> facility<00:01:34.549> transfers<00:01:35.150> which

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
are in our facility transfers which

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.090 
are in our facility transfers which
means<00:01:35.690> that<00:01:35.960> we<00:01:36.110> go<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.380> that<00:01:36.740> smaller

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
means that we go to that smaller

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.399 
means that we go to that smaller
Hospital<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:37.970> we<00:01:38.330> pick<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.689> patient<00:01:39.140> up<00:01:39.260> we

Hospital and we pick that patient up we
assist<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:39.860> crew<00:01:40.340> because<00:01:40.909> you've<00:01:41.090> got<00:01:41.299> a

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
assist that crew because you've got a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.450 
assist that crew because you've got a
nurse<00:01:42.470> a<00:01:42.740> physician<00:01:43.189> or<00:01:43.310> a<00:01:43.340> respiratory

nurse a physician or a respiratory

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.980 
nurse a physician or a respiratory
therapist<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.150> are<00:01:44.270> already<00:01:44.600> doing<00:01:44.810> a

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
therapist that are already doing a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.899 
therapist that are already doing a
wonderful<00:01:45.470> job<00:01:45.619> in<00:01:45.680> that<00:01:46.040> smaller<00:01:46.340> Hospital

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
wonderful job in that smaller Hospital

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.910 
wonderful job in that smaller Hospital
but<00:01:47.030> they've<00:01:47.240> gone<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.200> extent<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:48.710> they

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
but they've gone to the extent that they

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.469 
but they've gone to the extent that they
can<00:01:49.189> with<00:01:49.400> this<00:01:49.549> patient

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
can with this patient

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.510 
can with this patient
obviously<00:01:52.470> helicopters<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.159> made<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> big

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
obviously helicopters have made a big

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.440 
obviously helicopters have made a big
difference<00:01:53.729> when<00:01:54.090> they're<00:01:54.210> used

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
difference when they're used

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.179 
difference when they're used
appropriately<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.259> also<00:01:55.650> because<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
appropriately and also because the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.620 
appropriately and also because the
helicopter<00:01:56.729> has<00:01:56.880> critical<00:01:57.330> care

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
helicopter has critical care

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.420 
helicopter has critical care
capabilities<00:01:58.259> they're<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.950> very<00:01:59.100> safe

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
capabilities they're in a very safe

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.310
