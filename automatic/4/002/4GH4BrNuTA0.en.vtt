00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
pullback models the quad bike and the

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.530 
pullback models the quad bike and the
record<00:00:24.070> breaker<00:00:24.279> which<00:00:25.060> are<00:00:25.210> pretty<00:00:25.450> awesome

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
record breaker which are pretty awesome

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.080 
record breaker which are pretty awesome
and<00:00:26.130> we're<00:00:27.130> gonna<00:00:27.250> race<00:00:27.490> them<00:00:27.669> across<00:00:27.880> the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
and we're gonna race them across the

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.870 
and we're gonna race them across the
room<00:00:28.240> and<00:00:28.570> see<00:00:29.109> which<00:00:29.260> one<00:00:29.500> is<00:00:30.039> going<00:00:30.250> fastest

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
room and see which one is going fastest

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.299 
room and see which one is going fastest
so<00:00:31.660> which<00:00:31.840> one<00:00:32.050> do<00:00:32.230> you<00:00:32.349> think<00:00:32.410> is<00:00:32.680> gonna<00:00:32.830> win

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.639 

we<00:00:36.850> created<00:00:37.180> a<00:00:37.360> racetrack<00:00:37.570> right<00:00:38.050> here<00:00:38.350> in<00:00:38.559> the

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
we created a racetrack right here in the

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.009 
we created a racetrack right here in the
middle<00:00:38.890> of<00:00:38.980> our<00:00:39.100> office<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:40.329> first<00:00:40.629> model

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
middle of our office the first model

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.310 
middle of our office the first model
that<00:00:41.050> reaches<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.649> end<00:00:41.769> will<00:00:42.579> be<00:00:42.699> the<00:00:42.820> winner

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
that reaches the end will be the winner

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.139 
that reaches the end will be the winner
let's<00:00:44.320> do<00:00:44.500> it

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
let's do it

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.700 
let's do it
so<00:00:46.149> what<00:00:46.329> I'm<00:00:46.480> gonna<00:00:46.690> do<00:00:46.930> is<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.350> pull<00:00:47.530> back

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
so what I'm gonna do is to pull back

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.850 
so what I'm gonna do is to pull back
both<00:00:48.070> mothers<00:00:48.610> to<00:00:49.420> their<00:00:49.449> max<00:00:50.079> to<00:00:50.379> get<00:00:50.530> both

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
both mothers to their max to get both

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.479 
both mothers to their max to get both
the<00:00:51.070> vehicle<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.670> Maximus

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:12.020 

all<00:00:55.940> right<00:00:56.270> Ready<00:00:57.230> Steady

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.490 

so<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.180> record<00:01:13.479> breaker<00:01:13.689> was<00:01:14.079> a<00:01:14.110> clear<00:01:14.439> winner

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
so the record breaker was a clear winner

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.850 
so the record breaker was a clear winner
did<00:01:15.310> you<00:01:15.399> guess<00:01:15.579> that<00:01:16.079> but<00:01:17.079> you<00:01:17.439> know<00:01:17.560> why<00:01:17.799> this

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
did you guess that but you know why this

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.370 
did you guess that but you know why this
happened<00:01:18.549> let's<00:01:18.880> take<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.090> look<00:01:19.240> so<00:01:20.170> what's

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
happened let's take a look so what's

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.469 
happened let's take a look so what's
going<00:01:20.590> on<00:01:20.710> here<00:01:20.920> with<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:21.939> surface<00:01:22.299> we're

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
going on here with the surface we're

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.810 
going on here with the surface we're
racing<00:01:22.840> on<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.320> most<00:01:23.530> obvious<00:01:23.979> thing<00:01:24.189> is<00:01:24.549> the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
racing on the most obvious thing is the

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.719 
racing on the most obvious thing is the
gearing<00:01:25.060> from<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.570> different<00:01:25.960> wheel<00:01:26.140> sizes

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
gearing from the different wheel sizes

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.130 
gearing from the different wheel sizes
you<00:01:27.729> can<00:01:27.880> see<00:01:28.060> here<00:01:28.299> that<00:01:28.329> the<00:01:28.600> tires<00:01:28.840> are<00:01:29.110> very

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
you can see here that the tires are very

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.960 
you can see here that the tires are very
different<00:01:29.560> on<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.159> two<00:01:30.310> models<00:01:30.700> the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
different on the two models the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.539 
different on the two models the
record-breaker<00:01:31.960> tires<00:01:32.319> are<00:01:32.799> much<00:01:33.100> smaller

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
record-breaker tires are much smaller

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.539 
record-breaker tires are much smaller
than<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.149> quad<00:01:34.360> bike<00:01:34.740> because<00:01:35.740> both<00:01:36.009> models

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
than the quad bike because both models

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.730 
than the quad bike because both models
received<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.119> same<00:01:37.329> amount<00:01:37.390> of<00:01:37.780> force<00:01:37.990> the

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
received the same amount of force the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.609 
received the same amount of force the
smaller<00:01:39.069> tires<00:01:39.399> will<00:01:40.030> have<00:01:40.210> a<00:01:40.240> greater

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
smaller tires will have a greater

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.830 
smaller tires will have a greater
acceleration<00:01:41.619> than<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.189> larger<00:01:42.520> tires<00:01:42.840> it

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
acceleration than the larger tires it

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.889 
acceleration than the larger tires it
means<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.709> accelerates<00:01:45.459> at<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:45.759> faster<00:01:46.299> rate<00:01:46.539> as

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
means it accelerates at a faster rate as

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.580 
means it accelerates at a faster rate as
soon<00:01:47.380> as<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:47.770> let<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.099> model<00:01:48.369> go<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:50.110> quad<00:01:50.380> bike

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
soon as I let the model go the quad bike

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.440 
soon as I let the model go the quad bike
on<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:51.009> other<00:01:51.130> hand<00:01:51.429> is<00:01:51.640> designed<00:01:52.149> to<00:01:52.329> go

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
on the other hand is designed to go

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.319 
on the other hand is designed to go
off-road<00:01:52.929> and<00:01:53.140> with<00:01:53.740> its<00:01:53.920> large<00:01:54.310> tires<00:01:54.700> it

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
off-road and with its large tires it

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.179 
off-road and with its large tires it
will<00:01:55.630> travel<00:01:55.959> along<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.409> distance<00:01:56.920> per

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
will travel along a distance per

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.240 
will travel along a distance per
revolution<00:01:57.489> on<00:01:57.939> this<00:01:58.509> smooth<00:01:58.989> surface<00:01:59.590> this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
revolution on this smooth surface this

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.940 
revolution on this smooth surface this
means<00:02:00.579> that<00:02:01.090> over<00:02:01.299> a<00:02:01.450> longer<00:02:01.810> distance<00:02:01.959> the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
means that over a longer distance the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.130 
means that over a longer distance the
quad<00:02:03.220> bike<00:02:03.459> would<00:02:03.909> eventually<00:02:04.239> overtake<00:02:04.929> the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
quad bike would eventually overtake the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.589 
quad bike would eventually overtake the
record-breaker<00:02:05.649> and<00:02:06.009> win<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.549> race<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.090> that

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
record-breaker and win the race so that

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:09.539 
record-breaker and win the race so that
I<00:02:07.750> could<00:02:08.019> break<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.200> one<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.769> lived<00:02:09.069> up<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.250> its

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
I could break it one and lived up to its

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.120 
I could break it one and lived up to its
name<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:10.690> one<00:02:11.079> can<00:02:11.260> argue<00:02:11.410> wasn't<00:02:11.950> really

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
name but one can argue wasn't really

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.160 
name but one can argue wasn't really
fair<00:02:12.370> for<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.670> quad<00:02:12.880> bike<00:02:13.090> because<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.989> quad

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
fair for the quad bike because the quad

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.349 
fair for the quad bike because the quad
bike<00:02:14.349> is<00:02:14.680> not<00:02:14.890> really<00:02:15.190> designed<00:02:15.340> for<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:16.030> smooth

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
bike is not really designed for a smooth

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.690 
bike is not really designed for a smooth
surface<00:02:16.660> like<00:02:17.109> this<00:02:17.319> but<00:02:18.069> did<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.310> know<00:02:18.459> you

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
surface like this but did you know you

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.490 
surface like this but did you know you
can<00:02:18.880> combine<00:02:19.090> these<00:02:19.480> two<00:02:19.540> models<00:02:20.109> and<00:02:20.260> get<00:02:20.470> a

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
can combine these two models and get a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.670 
can combine these two models and get a
copy<00:02:20.829> models<00:02:21.370> with<00:02:21.579> two<00:02:21.880> pullback<00:02:22.299> bombers

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
copy models with two pullback bombers

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.709 
copy models with two pullback bombers
really<00:02:23.950> could<00:02:24.129> be<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> good<00:02:24.640> challenge<00:02:25.060> between

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:25.719 
really could be a good challenge between

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.530 
really could be a good challenge between
the<00:02:26.590> combi<00:02:26.890> model<00:02:27.219> and<00:02:27.579> our<00:02:27.849> rival<00:02:28.209> breaker
