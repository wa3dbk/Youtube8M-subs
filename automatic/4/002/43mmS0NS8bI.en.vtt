00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:12.930
 the current youtube speaks of reik if 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.150
 piqué m in a new world set in this 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.859
 occasion it's my chicken pokemon 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.079
 favorite gentlemen as well as they saw it in 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.539
 the tournament and I also think they saw it 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:23.429
 in the title we are going to do many set of 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.019
 elements and this is now going to be 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.119
 quite original I assure you 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.589
 then we will start to analyze the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.949
 German gentlemen because they are of type 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.690
 dragon and flying guy is a guy who 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.220
 he repeats a lot, but you have to get him out 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.050
 the best benefit we can despite 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.910
 have a strong enough weakness 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.740
 to ice type as it would be almost all 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.870
 the dragons well we started with the 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.810
 skills have intimacy that lowers the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.880
 attack in -1 when we enter the field 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.740
 in front of the opponent and another 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.450
 skill that is also pretty good 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.730
 and it has become very popular is 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.890
 fifth generation is maxi that we like 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.350
 the attack every time we weaken a 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.480
 pokémon of the opponent reviewing the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.150
 'stand' gentlemen we see that you have a hp of 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.240
 95 you see that there is nothing wrong with 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.069
 reality reaching the maximum of 394 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.649
 I have also seen salame scurrying 

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:12.420
 like poc and defensive physical and really 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.960
 they endure the blows very well after 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.670
 we have a pace attack of 135 the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.939
 maximum takes 405 that's why I love it 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.799
 favorite is quite devastating a 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.799
 80's defense that is not bad 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.539
 reaching the maximum 184 attack 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.450
 110 pretty good special arriving 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.179
 to 350 maximum new way we have a 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.850
 80 but now in the special defense and 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:42.149
 finally a speed of 100 base that 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.920
 will take us to the maximum 328 as 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.079
 we see is a pretty balanced Pokémon 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.299
 Actually none of your stats arrive 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.889
 to the point of being bad we can run the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.579
 different ways and for that reason 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:56.520
 Gentlemen today I bring you the full elements 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.039
 I'm using this special attack 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.320
 in andrius gentlemen consell more still 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:05.880
 andrews those old days 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:11.290
 fun in just getting myself up to the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.880
 Line number 51 45 at sound the sun 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.370
 23 nothing else is beautiful gentlemen but 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.140
 good is and right now is on board wine 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.940
 I'm recording this I do not know if it's going to 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.410
 return to andrews which I hope with 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.580
 Many cravings but good if it is not like that 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.340
 less here I bring you to do that is 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.530
 pretty chemical very weird but pretty 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.080
 fun to use as they say we're going to 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.970
 use live to search our 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.920
 skill attacks we are going to use 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.209
 privacy because obviously you are 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.640
 praises to a special attacker 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.500
 then the maxi does not help in anything 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.700
 we are going to use in timidity we put 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.290
 our rooms in front of some 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.209
 pokemon that is physical we lower the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.850
 attack and we can hold at least one 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.489
 rocket in motion gentlemen we are going to 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.550
 start with high drop pampa yes gentlemen 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.519
 give more you learn to hydro bottom then 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.580
 first movement to hydro pon 110-110 of 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.769
 page power a not very good precision of 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.210
 80 percent but good is the 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.460
 movement 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.370
 characteristic of water types with the 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.110
 Greater beige power and with less 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.510
 secondary consequences only that 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.980
 fail but good after we went to worst 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.630
 a recovery movement that's coming 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.700
 pretty good in room more when it's already 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.560
 about to be weakened a surprise 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.270
 rust and we return at least to half of 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.740
 our life after is the 'monster 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.080
 you have to emit obviously you can not 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.770
 missing a movement with beige staff 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.020
 130 power and an accuracy of 90 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.880
 a hundred I think they got it down 11 095 no 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.030
 I'm sure but good Enrique Meyer 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.320
 special dragon-like movement that 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.630
 we will be doing well enough in 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.790
 this is mans and finally for 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.640
 finish with the coverage we have fire 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.160
 blast movement of beige power 110 and 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.280
 an accuracy of 85 like hi drop 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.800
 on but because the fire type can 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.140
 change the flame software if you 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.540
 they want is less power but it is more 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.060
 precision so you will continue between 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.310
 those fire last of life lower depending 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.990
 of your needs is a muscle that 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.120
 it pleases a lot because it is a very 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.819
 good coverage 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.159
 I would hit neutral to almost everything I think if not 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.739
 I'm wrong or everything follows everything where 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.269
 hit him another so I'm thinking 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.970
 but well let's move on to the 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:19.510
 states gentlemen is a special attacker 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.880
 blue then there is not much complexity 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.479
 in the jets in the inversion of eps 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.120
 we have 252 in special attack 252 in 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:31.150
 speed and finally 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.740
 4 sorry 44 in hp you can get it to 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.510
 the defense the special defense gives 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.520
 Exactly the same, I do not see any 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.830
 problem and of obvious nature 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.440
 let's use a limit nature 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.979
 to give a very good speed to 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.020
 these wings with 321 8 and an attack 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.750
 special of 319 that you will think that 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.080
 it's something short but remember how it hits 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.520
 report go having a short attack 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.620
 then nothing more 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.260
 I really like this set already 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.610
 I said it's a pretty weird set that 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.720
 decided to use because everyone 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.870
 is using up the teacher 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.520
 gandayas 86 scary and always physical but 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.020
 well I decided to make this set and I 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.280
 I liked quite take by surprise 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.080
 many pokemon let's go 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.060
 some of the advantages and disadvantages 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.160
 that I can only have first 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.720
 the surprise factor is indispensable 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.100
 nobody hope lamas attacker 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.650
 special blue 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:24.130
 droid horizon committee hits that led a 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.600
 mega blasco and he forgets then if he 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.389
 we grab on the change and use two 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.050
 twice times we have to measure what we are going to 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.790
 smashing into trouble also hits 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.200
 quite strong some other defensive 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.760
 that other defenses failed or andrew 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.280
 lloyd wright and for example the up to 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.980
 50 percent which is perfect and 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.750
 defensive special must do quite 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.370
 damage will not weaken it obviously 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.500
 because this special dress was there 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.600
 has 404 of hp holds up pretty well 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.530
 but still not going away it's going to take 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.240
 a very very very good blow and good that 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.340
 another advantage can extend this in addition 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.169
 has a see a pretty speed 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.360
 well actually bull said goodbye 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.580
 some things from andrews that we can 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.570
 cause some problems I can fire 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.790
 to 6 min 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.510
 which will allow us to give you a 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.270
 fair lost 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.880
 and well you can also trust the 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.500
 storm if they predict a fierce blitz and 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.970
 there to be able to use brusque and maintain 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.560
 in a good position is another of the 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.120
 advantages that this mans style has 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.850
 because the little sister is a little more 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.710
 which is quite common in andrius now 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.870
 happening to the disadvantages gentlemen have 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.880
 good speed not enough like 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.590
 we can ask for some faster things 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.150
 in bricks as it could be breaker 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.580
 which is actually trail and you do not 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.490
 I'm wrong at the moment but well no 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.410
 has enough speed to study 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.420
 things that are so so so fast 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.500
 but still degenerate you come to 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.110
 see the city 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.200
 in the same way it is quite easy to 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:52.190
 trust with flowers flowers against everything in 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.720
 one of josh so what can I do is 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.270
 very difficult to find a counter for 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.590
 flowers but in this case is the most is 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.240
 easily reliable 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.490
 It does not matter if you letizia if you use it 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.960
 physical special in this case we're going 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.940
 Special running will end you 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.680
 counting flower and this is another one of those 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.330
 we can see in this defensive 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.640
 specials are obviously going to 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.230
 tell of mega you talked about do not run 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.950
 as defensive so much more runs with a 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.360
 by attacker 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.210
 it already has good little that then people 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.850
 does not worry well put him good hp and 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.460
 hp yes but not helpless then by 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.140
 that I said what I said of the king commission 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.940
 because if it's a little bit that nobody 

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.550
 mind defenses to your megablas and gets 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.770
 in special attack and hp but good in 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.780
 another one of the disadvantages that can have 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.420
 nothing more obviously is his weakness for 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.280
 four ice type which is going to 

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.800
 benefit don fan very much as it is 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.360
 a one it that joe with unai be also 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.340
 you have to be careful with that just like 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.750
 flower furniture is a good club to 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.340
 Although they have no special attack
