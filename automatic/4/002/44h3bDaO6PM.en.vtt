00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
from Andy's body position the shapes the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.110 
from Andy's body position the shapes the
positioning<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.980> his<00:00:35.130> feet<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.399> his<00:00:35.610> hips<00:00:35.880> and

yeah<00:04:54.620> it's<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:55.070> difficult<00:04:55.340> they've<00:04:55.730> done

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
yeah it's so difficult they've done

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.250 
yeah it's so difficult they've done
studies<00:04:56.240> like<00:04:56.360> this<00:04:56.480> using<00:04:56.780> computer

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
studies like this using computer

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.600 
studies like this using computer
simulations<00:04:57.860> so<00:04:58.070> you<00:04:58.160> watch<00:04:58.310> it<00:04:58.460> on<00:04:58.550> a

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
simulations so you watch it on a

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.890 
simulations so you watch it on a
computer<00:04:58.790> and<00:04:59.150> just<00:04:59.180> have<00:04:59.360> to<00:04:59.390> say<00:04:59.630> where<00:04:59.810> the

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
computer and just have to say where the

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.720 
computer and just have to say where the
balls<00:05:00.080> going<00:05:00.290> and<00:05:00.620> from<00:05:01.040> them<00:05:01.220> they<00:05:01.400> can<00:05:01.580> see

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
balls going and from them they can see

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.370 
balls going and from them they can see
that<00:05:01.850> early<00:05:02.090> athletes<00:05:02.540> can<00:05:03.050> tell<00:05:03.230> much

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
that early athletes can tell much

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.750 
that early athletes can tell much
earlier<00:05:03.800> where<00:05:03.980> the<00:05:04.010> ball<00:05:04.250> is<00:05:04.280> coming<00:05:04.610> from

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
earlier where the ball is coming from

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.310 
earlier where the ball is coming from
but<00:05:05.240> to<00:05:05.330> have<00:05:05.450> to<00:05:05.570> actually<00:05:05.930> produce<00:05:06.080> a

but to have to actually produce a

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.020 
but to have to actually produce a
physical<00:05:06.800> response<00:05:07.190> when<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.460> ball<00:05:07.700> is<00:05:07.880> flying

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
physical response when a ball is flying

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.570 
physical response when a ball is flying
at<00:05:08.390> you<00:05:08.540> then<00:05:09.140> it's<00:05:09.590> really<00:05:10.040> good<00:05:10.310> skills

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
at you then it's really good skills

what<00:05:38.720> you're<00:05:38.870> saying<00:05:39.080> despite<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.830> location

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
what you're saying despite the location

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.130 
what you're saying despite the location

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
because the first time being here he's

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.020 
because the first time being here he's
still<00:05:42.530> recalling<00:05:43.160> the<00:05:43.310> pictures<00:05:43.700> what<00:05:43.910> he's

maybe<00:05:46.820> much<00:05:47.180> as<00:05:47.330> in<00:05:47.450> in<00:05:47.570> training<00:05:47.930> and<00:05:48.140> he's

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
maybe much as in in training and he's

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.440 
maybe much as in in training and he's
recalling<00:05:49.160> all<00:05:49.310> those<00:05:49.550> messages<00:05:49.910> and<00:05:50.240> in<00:05:50.330> his

recalling all those messages and in his

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.690 
recalling all those messages and in his
brain<00:05:50.660> saying<00:05:50.930> this<00:05:51.410> is<00:05:51.590> execution<00:05:52.070> exactly

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
brain saying this is execution exactly

and<00:05:52.790> that's<00:05:52.910> kind<00:05:53.150> of<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.270> whole<00:05:53.420> point<00:05:53.630> of

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
and that's kind of the whole point of

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.060 
and that's kind of the whole point of
people<00:05:53.990> training<00:05:54.260> even<00:05:54.530> though<00:05:54.710> they<00:05:54.830> can't

train in a mapped environment they can

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.090 
train in a mapped environment they can

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
still take their experiences from the

training ground put it into practice in
the<00:05:59.960> match<00:06:00.140> take<00:06:00.680> things<00:06:00.890> from<00:06:01.010> one<00:06:01.280> match<00:06:01.460> and

the match take things from one match and

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.910 
the match take things from one match and
utilize<00:06:02.300> it<00:06:02.330> in<00:06:02.630> another<00:06:02.870> and<00:06:03.200> even<00:06:03.530> utilize

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
utilize it in another and even utilize

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.560 
utilize it in another and even utilize
things<00:06:04.250> in<00:06:04.430> a<00:06:04.490> really<00:06:04.700> strange<00:06:04.910> situation

things in a really strange situation

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.030 
things in a really strange situation
like<00:06:05.690> we've<00:06:05.810> got<00:06:05.960> here<00:06:06.170> in<00:06:06.320> terms<00:06:06.830> of<00:06:06.980> the

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
like we've got here in terms of the

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.070 
like we've got here in terms of the
match<00:06:07.280> this<00:06:07.550> means<00:06:07.850> that<00:06:08.420> instead<00:06:08.660> of<00:06:08.930> having

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
match this means that instead of having

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.570 
match this means that instead of having
to<00:06:09.290> track<00:06:09.500> the<00:06:09.680> ball<00:06:09.800> completely<00:06:10.040> onto<00:06:10.490> his

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
to track the ball completely onto his

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.250 
to track the ball completely onto his
foot<00:06:10.850> he<00:06:11.240> could<00:06:11.390> be<00:06:11.510> scanning<00:06:11.870> to<00:06:11.960> see<00:06:11.990> where

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
foot he could be scanning to see where

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.870 
foot he could be scanning to see where
the<00:06:12.350> goalkeeper<00:06:12.590> is<00:06:13.130> if<00:06:13.340> there's<00:06:13.760> any

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
the goalkeeper is if there's any

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.370 
the goalkeeper is if there's any
movement<00:06:14.390> there<00:06:14.420> so<00:06:14.660> he<00:06:14.750> can<00:06:14.900> then<00:06:15.020> place<00:06:15.350> his

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
movement there so he can then place his

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.640 
movement there so he can then place his
shot<00:06:15.800> past<00:06:16.370> where<00:06:16.640> the<00:06:16.730> goalkeeper<00:06:16.880> might<00:06:17.300> be

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
shot past where the goalkeeper might be

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.030 
shot past where the goalkeeper might be
well<00:06:18.650> as<00:06:18.800> its<00:06:19.220> base<00:06:19.490> of<00:06:19.850> the<00:06:20.180> my<00:06:20.360> success<00:06:20.900> is<00:06:21.290> to

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
well as its base of the my success is to

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.160 
well as its base of the my success is to
improve<00:06:22.310> myself<00:06:22.550> all<00:06:23.000> the<00:06:23.180> time<00:06:23.210> so<00:06:23.900> this<00:06:24.020> is

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.170 
improve myself all the time so this is

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.660 
improve myself all the time so this is
why<00:06:24.320> I'm<00:06:24.500> one<00:06:24.920> of<00:06:25.010> the<00:06:25.130> best<00:06:25.310> players<00:06:25.460> in<00:06:25.580> the
