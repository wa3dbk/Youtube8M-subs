00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
system with a criterium on top here let

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.549 
system with a criterium on top here let
me<00:01:00.030> show<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.270> how<00:01:00.360> it<00:01:00.480> works<00:01:00.690> first<00:01:01.290> I'm<00:01:01.440> going

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
me show you how it works first I'm going

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.359 
me show you how it works first I'm going
to<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.860> just<00:01:02.100> open<00:01:02.550> up<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> wheel<00:01:03.719> straps

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
to do is just open up the wheel straps

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.090 
to do is just open up the wheel straps
and<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:06.420> has<00:01:06.539> this<00:01:06.780> clamping<00:01:07.410> arm<00:01:07.619> which<00:01:07.979> I'm

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and it has this clamping arm which I'm

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.730 
and it has this clamping arm which I'm
going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> put<00:01:08.550> in<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.789> upright<00:01:09.149> position

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
going to put in the upright position

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.350 
going to put in the upright position
kind<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.830> about<00:01:11.070> where<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.490> needs<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.789> be<00:01:11.880> I'll

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
kind of about where it needs to be I'll

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.029 
kind of about where it needs to be I'll
probably<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.229> little<00:01:13.440> bit<00:01:13.560> once<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:13.920> my

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
probably just a little bit once I get my

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.180 
probably just a little bit once I get my
bike<00:01:14.160> up<00:01:14.369> there<00:01:14.550> but<00:01:15.649> we've<00:01:16.649> found<00:01:16.800> that<00:01:17.009> full

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
bike up there but we've found that full

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.230 
bike up there but we've found that full
easier<00:01:17.459> to<00:01:17.520> kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> get<00:01:17.910> that<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.209> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
easier to kind of get that up at the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.380 
easier to kind of get that up at the
place<00:01:18.450> first<00:01:18.690> all<00:01:19.649> right<00:01:19.740> here<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.100> go<00:01:20.390> loading

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
place first all right here we go loading

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.419 
place first all right here we go loading
the<00:01:21.569> bike<00:01:21.690> now<00:01:23.539> see<00:01:24.860> upright<00:01:25.860> bike<00:01:26.039> carrier

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
the bike now see upright bike carrier

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.130 
the bike now see upright bike carrier
means<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.569> need<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.810> take<00:01:27.990> off

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
means that you don't need to take off

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.419 
means that you don't need to take off
the<00:01:28.229> front<00:01:28.470> wheel<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:29.729> super<00:01:29.880> convenient

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
the front wheel so it's super convenient

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.820 
the front wheel so it's super convenient
just<00:01:32.429> roll<00:01:32.700> by<00:01:33.209> kind<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.660> forward<00:01:34.259> into<00:01:34.619> place

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
just roll by kind of forward into place

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.320 
just roll by kind of forward into place
there<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:35.640> now<00:01:35.729> I'm<00:01:35.849> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> kind<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
there and now I'm going to kind of

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.359 
there and now I'm going to kind of
adjust<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:37.259> clamp<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.190> of<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
adjust the clamp so that it's out of the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.880 
adjust the clamp so that it's out of the
way<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.520> my<00:01:38.670> bottle<00:01:39.060> cage<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.539> then<00:01:40.500> once<00:01:40.709> I've

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
way of my bottle cage and then once I've

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.520 
way of my bottle cage and then once I've
got<00:01:41.099> it<00:01:41.149> where<00:01:42.149> I<00:01:42.179> want<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.539> it's<00:01:43.229> got<00:01:43.410> this

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
got it where I want it it's got this

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.710 
got it where I want it it's got this
dial<00:01:43.920> right<00:01:44.190> here<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.849> I'm<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.660> to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
dial right here and I'm just going to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.529 
dial right here and I'm just going to
raise<00:01:46.289> that<00:01:46.679> dial<00:01:47.009> let's<00:01:47.759> watch<00:01:48.030> out<00:01:48.209> there<00:01:48.479> we

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
raise that dial let's watch out there we

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.169 
raise that dial let's watch out there we
go<00:01:48.660> there<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.229> some<00:01:49.560> sort<00:01:49.709> of<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.860> V<00:01:50.130> contour<00:01:51.000> to

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
go there is some sort of a V contour to

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:52.969 
go there is some sort of a V contour to
the<00:01:51.270> clamp<00:01:51.569> and<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.050> want<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.319> sort<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.530> Center

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the clamp and you want to sort of Center

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.339 
the clamp and you want to sort of Center
the<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.610> center<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.209> V<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.929> know<00:01:54.959> on<00:01:55.229> the
