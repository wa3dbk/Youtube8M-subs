00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
I've actually never done before I did it

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.790 
I've actually never done before I did it

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
don't hate me uh-huh but anyways I did

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.910 
don't hate me uh-huh but anyways I did
in<00:00:20.100> yang<00:00:20.430> nails<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:22.140> looked<00:00:22.289> like<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.650> I

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
in yang nails and it looked like this I

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.130 
in yang nails and it looked like this I
didn't<00:00:23.160> do<00:00:23.250> them<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.609> all<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.119> my<00:00:24.240> fingers<00:00:24.600> just
