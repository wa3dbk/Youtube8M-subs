 Hey. You are watching an experimental reaction show. And in this issue 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.100
 I will tell you how to make a non-Newtonian fluid. 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.070
 For this we need: bucket, potato starch, 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.840
 measuring cup and food dyes. First we take 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.690
 mixing tank and measuring cup. In relation to 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.400
 200 g of starch / 400 ml of water begin to mix. 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.800
 In the first portion of the water we need to add food dyes. 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.700
 After that, pour our water into the container with starch and mix 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.500
 We mix our mixture until a homogeneous mass, so that there would be no lumps. 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.000
 We should have this mixture. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.200
 The so-called non-Newtonian fluid 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.300
 with fast interaction behaves like a solid body, 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.900
 while slow, like a liquid. 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.659
 This liquid can be played forever, not only children but also adults. Try 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.100
 and I'm sure you will like it. subscribe to my channel 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.389
 and put your finger up if you liked this release, 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.700
 until next friday.
