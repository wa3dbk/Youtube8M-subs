 we visit talking 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.750
 jaboatÃ£o to know how it happens 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:11.840
 recycling process is one of those ten 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.430
 years, we have been advancing 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.640
 now there is a great hope 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.520
 through the national waste policy 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.250
 that it really applies 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.930
 in all its management is called whether it is 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.509
 put into practice 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.930
 and then we will have an evolution 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:32.960
 quite significant in this area of 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.670
 and plastic recycling with others 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.670
 material results as well 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.320
 the well is to rise in the morning to catch the 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.650
 bus get here and so I am 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.729
 Arriving at work, we change. 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.610

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.220
 of people is different because there is a lot 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.500
 difficult for the woman to work in that 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.080
 place is very difficult and today work 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.050
 an industrial company like this by 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.569
 gratification is a privilege that 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.660
