00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
you don't really see the jab step with

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.590 
you don't really see the jab step with
I've<00:01:52.680> seen<00:01:52.979> some<00:01:53.220> guys<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.939> side<00:01:54.270> turn

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
I've seen some guys do like a side turn

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.830 
I've seen some guys do like a side turn
or<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.960> back<00:01:55.229> turn<00:01:55.729> but<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:56.909> really<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.210> you

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
or a back turn but that's really it you

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.109 
or a back turn but that's really it you
know<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.130> take<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.850> extra<00:02:00.000> step

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
know it's just I take that extra step

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.399 
know it's just I take that extra step
back<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> kind<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.049> look<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.229> at<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
back just to kind of look up at the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.429 
back just to kind of look up at the
target<00:02:01.770> one<00:02:01.920> more<00:02:02.070> time<00:02:02.310> get<00:02:03.060> my<00:02:03.180> bills

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
target one more time get my bills

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.300 
target one more time get my bills
visualization<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.530> where<00:02:04.649> I'm<00:02:04.799> kicking<00:02:05.130> to

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
visualization of where I'm kicking to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.190 
visualization of where I'm kicking to
and<00:02:05.640> then<00:02:06.149> that's<00:02:06.299> when<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.479> step<00:02:06.780> up<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.140> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and then that's when I step up and I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.990 
and then that's when I step up and I
reset<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.950> that's<00:02:08.489> where<00:02:08.670> I'm<00:02:08.729> comfortable

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
reset and that's where I'm comfortable

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.880 
reset and that's where I'm comfortable
at<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.810> think<00:02:10.020> that's<00:02:10.349> kind<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.649> big

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
at so I think that's kind of the big

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.990 
at so I think that's kind of the big
factor<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.550> whatever<00:02:12.000> works

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
factor in it whatever works

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.780 
factor in it whatever works
and<00:02:13.090> for<00:02:13.540> sharp<00:02:13.840> his<00:02:14.440> routine<00:02:15.010> clearly<00:02:15.550> works

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
and for sharp his routine clearly works

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.970 
and for sharp his routine clearly works
but<00:02:16.330> now<00:02:16.510> he<00:02:16.570> heads<00:02:17.020> for<00:02:17.260> his<00:02:17.350> shot<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.890> NFL

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
but now he heads for his shot in the NFL

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.850 
but now he heads for his shot in the NFL
playing<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.820> position<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.660> has<00:02:19.900> unusual

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
playing a position that has unusual

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.130 
playing a position that has unusual
pressures<00:02:21.400> it's<00:02:22.030> very<00:02:22.270> different<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.660> know<00:02:22.810> a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
pressures it's very different you know a

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.660 
pressures it's very different you know a
lot<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.680> people<00:02:23.890> will<00:02:23.980> say<00:02:24.160> we're<00:02:24.370> either<00:02:24.490> the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
lot of people will say we're either the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.250 
lot of people will say we're either the
hero<00:02:24.880> or<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.120> zero<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.540> know<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.930> common

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
hero or the zero you know it's a common

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.860 
hero or the zero you know it's a common
term<00:02:26.410> with<00:02:26.590> us<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.490> enjoy<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.060> moment<00:02:28.450> and

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
I take it as an opportunity you know if

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.250 
I take it as an opportunity you know if
the<00:02:31.120> offense<00:02:31.450> can't<00:02:31.660> put<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.840> ports<00:02:32.080> on<00:02:32.170> the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the offense can't put the ports on the
