00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
preserved we'd actually like to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.370

reintroduce<00:00:32.880> them<00:00:33.270> into<00:00:33.600> their<00:00:33.840> original

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
reintroduce them into their original

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.049 
reintroduce them into their original
places<00:00:34.590> they<00:00:35.010> came<00:00:35.219> from<00:00:35.399> which<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.730> France

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
places they came from which is France

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.020 
places they came from which is France
and<00:00:36.360> North<00:00:37.110> Africa<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.430> these<00:00:38.579> are<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.820> most

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and North Africa so these are the most

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.450 
and North Africa so these are the most
recent<00:00:39.540> boys<00:00:39.780> here<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.340> will
