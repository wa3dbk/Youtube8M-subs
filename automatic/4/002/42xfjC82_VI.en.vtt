00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
having it roll around on the floor look

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.090 
having it roll around on the floor look
like<00:01:05.820> caroling<00:01:06.540> uhm<00:01:06.630> what<00:01:07.380> he<00:01:07.680> did<00:01:07.830> was<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
like caroling uhm what he did was the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.550 
like caroling uhm what he did was the
add<00:01:08.220> gravity<00:01:08.700> lift<00:01:09.000> switch<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.750> gravely<00:01:10.500> its

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
add gravity lift switch on gravely its

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.200 
add gravity lift switch on gravely its
gravity<00:01:10.950> zones<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.430> make<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.850> float<00:01:12.090> around

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
gravity zones and make it float around

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
gravity zones and make it float around
so<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.659> something<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.350> air<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.860> be

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
so that something in the air can be

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.530 
so that something in the air can be
shoved<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.460> lot<00:01:14.670> easier<00:01:14.909> than<00:01:15.090> something<00:01:15.360> on

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
shoved a lot easier than something on

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.810 
shoved a lot easier than something on
the<00:01:15.600> ground<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.920> couldn't<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.580> since

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the ground so if you couldn't so since

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.060 
the ground so if you couldn't so since
he<00:01:17.909> did<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.240> emit<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> lot<00:01:18.960> funner<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.470> so

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
he did that emit a lot funner and so

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.700 
he did that emit a lot funner and so
much<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.640> don't<00:01:21.600> know<00:01:21.659> what<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.960> say<00:01:22.020> I'm<00:01:22.680> just
