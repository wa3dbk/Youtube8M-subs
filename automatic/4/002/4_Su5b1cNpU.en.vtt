00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
right we all know what binoculars are we

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:13.660 
right we all know what binoculars are we
know<00:00:12.740> what<00:00:12.980> they<00:00:13.099> look<00:00:13.309> like

and<00:00:13.910> we<00:00:14.210> know<00:00:14.330> what<00:00:14.480> we<00:00:14.599> use<00:00:14.780> them<00:00:14.990> for<00:00:15.139> we<00:00:15.259> also

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
and we know what we use them for we also

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.080 
and we know what we use them for we also
know<00:00:15.650> they're<00:00:15.799> an<00:00:15.919> incredibly<00:00:16.550> important

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.550 
know they're an incredibly important
tool<00:00:17.300> for<00:00:17.570> the<00:00:17.630> naturalist<00:00:18.020> but<00:00:18.170> how<00:00:18.289> many<00:00:18.350> of

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
tool for the naturalist but how many of

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.800 
tool for the naturalist but how many of
you<00:00:18.770> actually<00:00:19.010> know<00:00:19.519> how<00:00:19.970> to<00:00:20.000> set<00:00:20.539> them<00:00:20.689> up

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
you actually know how to set them up

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.290 
you actually know how to set them up
correctly<00:00:21.350> for<00:00:21.470> your<00:00:21.859> eyes<00:00:22.160> well<00:00:22.939> there's<00:00:23.240> a

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
correctly for your eyes well there's a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.390 
correctly for your eyes well there's a
few<00:00:23.510> very<00:00:23.539> simple<00:00:24.260> little<00:00:24.349> adjustments<00:00:25.010> to

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
few very simple little adjustments to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.120 
few very simple little adjustments to
make<00:00:25.580> using<00:00:25.939> your<00:00:26.060> binoculars<00:00:27.130> absolutely

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
make using your binoculars absolutely

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:36.160 
make using your binoculars absolutely
perfect<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:34.250> first<00:00:34.520> one<00:00:34.820> my<00:00:35.270> simple<00:00:35.660> one<00:00:35.810> is

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
perfect the first one my simple one is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.010 
perfect the first one my simple one is
the<00:00:36.410> distance<00:00:36.800> between<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:37.400> eye<00:00:37.430> cups<00:00:38.020> most

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
the distance between the eye cups most

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.840 
the distance between the eye cups most
blockages<00:00:39.380> pivot<00:00:39.860> a<00:00:40.040> little<00:00:40.310> bit<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:40.700> that

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
blockages pivot a little bit and that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.520 
blockages pivot a little bit and that
changes<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:41.240> distance<00:00:41.570> between<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:42.110> two<00:00:42.260> so

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
changes the distance between the two so

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.290 
changes the distance between the two so
to<00:00:42.590> get<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:43.010> right<00:00:43.310> you<00:00:43.760> hold<00:00:44.000> them<00:00:44.150> up<00:00:44.270> to

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
to get that right you hold them up to

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.430 
to get that right you hold them up to
your<00:00:44.450> face<00:00:44.750> and<00:00:44.830> you<00:00:45.830> pivot<00:00:46.490> them<00:00:46.850> until<00:00:47.440> you

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
your face and you pivot them until you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.650 
your face and you pivot them until you
have<00:00:48.740> got<00:00:49.040> a<00:00:49.220> nice<00:00:49.750> clear<00:00:50.830> circle<00:00:51.830> of<00:00:51.950> view<00:00:52.850> not

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
have got a nice clear circle of view not

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.660 
have got a nice clear circle of view not
like<00:00:53.840> classic<00:00:54.320> binocular<00:00:55.010> shape<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:55.400> see<00:00:55.430> in

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
like classic binocular shape you see in

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.670 
like classic binocular shape you see in
all<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.880> movies<00:00:56.240> James<00:00:56.870> Bond<00:00:57.200> has<00:00:57.440> it<00:00:57.560> they're

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
all the movies James Bond has it they're

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.440 
all the movies James Bond has it they're
not<00:00:57.770> going<00:00:57.950> to<00:00:57.980> set<00:00:58.220> up<00:00:58.370> incorrectly<00:00:58.790> all<00:00:59.270> the

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
not going to set up incorrectly all the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.550 
not going to set up incorrectly all the
time<00:01:04.300> so<00:01:05.300> once<00:01:05.510> you've<00:01:05.630> got<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:05.840> set<00:01:05.900> there's

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
time so once you've got that set there's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.960 
time so once you've got that set there's
a<00:01:06.620> couple<00:01:06.830> of<00:01:06.950> other<00:01:07.100> little<00:01:07.340> adjustments<00:01:07.850> the

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
a couple of other little adjustments the

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.060 
a couple of other little adjustments the
other<00:01:08.090> one<00:01:08.180> is<00:01:08.300> if<00:01:08.480> you<00:01:08.690> wear<00:01:08.840> glasses<00:01:09.110> make

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
other one is if you wear glasses make

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.010 
other one is if you wear glasses make
sure<00:01:10.280> your<00:01:10.490> eye<00:01:10.640> caps<00:01:11.060> in<00:01:11.480> this<00:01:11.630> case<00:01:11.840> they're

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
sure your eye caps in this case they're

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.720 
sure your eye caps in this case they're
twisty<00:01:12.380> ones<00:01:12.530> but<00:01:12.800> some<00:01:12.980> pushing<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.520> some

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
twisty ones but some pushing and some

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.100 
twisty ones but some pushing and some
are<00:01:13.820> just<00:01:13.850> have<00:01:14.030> little<00:01:14.240> rubber<00:01:14.420> sleeves<00:01:14.750> make

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
are just have little rubber sleeves make

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.290 
are just have little rubber sleeves make
sure<00:01:15.230> your<00:01:15.350> eye<00:01:15.380> caps<00:01:15.740> are<00:01:15.920> fully<00:01:16.490> in<00:01:16.790> that

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
sure your eye caps are fully in that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.640

wear glasses like me you can make sure

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.080 
wear glasses like me you can make sure
better<00:01:23.750> for<00:01:24.430> extension<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:25.730> increases

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
better for extension so that increases

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
better for extension so that increases
the<00:01:26.390> gap<00:01:26.570> there<00:01:31.270> now<00:01:32.270> this<00:01:32.450> is<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.720> bit<00:01:32.930> that

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
the gap there now this is the bit that

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.770 
the gap there now this is the bit that
most<00:01:33.320> people<00:01:33.800> don't<00:01:34.640> know<00:01:34.790> about<00:01:34.970> it's<00:01:35.300> a<00:01:35.390> tiny

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
most people don't know about it's a tiny

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.600 
most people don't know about it's a tiny
adjustment<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:36.650> makes<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:37.100> massive

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
adjustment that makes a massive

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.210 
adjustment that makes a massive
difference<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:38.659> is<00:01:39.170> your<00:01:39.470> diopter

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
difference and that is your diopter

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.000 
difference and that is your diopter
setting<00:01:40.300> your<00:01:41.300> what<00:01:41.540> your<00:01:41.960> diopter<00:01:42.560> setting<00:01:42.590> a

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
setting your what your diopter setting a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.730 
setting your what your diopter setting a
diopter<00:01:43.430> is<00:01:43.729> simply<00:01:44.180> this<00:01:44.659> little<00:01:45.080> scale<00:01:45.350> here

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
diopter is simply this little scale here

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.740 
diopter is simply this little scale here
this<00:01:46.040> pair<00:01:46.250> blockers<00:01:46.580> has<00:01:46.850> this<00:01:47.240> little<00:01:47.420> scale

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
this pair blockers has this little scale

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.500 
this pair blockers has this little scale
for<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.140> positive<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:49.130> minus<00:01:49.700> on<00:01:49.850> it<00:01:50.000> that

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
for the positive and a minus on it that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.360 
for the positive and a minus on it that
is<00:01:50.870> something<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.710> can<00:01:51.860> adjust<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.250> my

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
is something that I can adjust to my

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.030 
is something that I can adjust to my
eyes<00:01:52.610> most<00:01:53.600> binoculars<00:01:54.140> however<00:01:54.530> have<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:54.890> on

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
eyes most binoculars however have it on

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.920 
eyes most binoculars however have it on
one<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.460> eyepieces<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.330> on<00:01:56.570> these<00:01:56.750> old

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
one of the eyepieces and on these old

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.380 
one of the eyepieces and on these old
faithfuls<00:01:57.530> there<00:01:58.280> it<00:01:58.400> is<00:01:58.580> there<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:58.880> can<00:01:59.180> see

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
faithfuls there it is there you can see

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.080 
faithfuls there it is there you can see
it<00:01:59.450> quite<00:01:59.630> clearly<00:01:59.690> that<00:02:00.110> scale<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:01.090> firstly

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
it quite clearly that scale and firstly

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.080 
it quite clearly that scale and firstly
cover<00:02:02.990> up<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:04.010> side<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.400> binoculars<00:02:04.580> with

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
cover up the side of the binoculars with

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.149 
cover up the side of the binoculars with
the<00:02:05.180> diopter<00:02:05.450> on<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:05.900> just<00:02:06.260> do<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.710> cover<00:02:07.040> it

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
the diopter on it just do that cover it
