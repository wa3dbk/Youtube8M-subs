as<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.149> mentioned<00:01:06.329> in<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.380> previous<00:01:08.009> couple

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
as we mentioned in the previous couple

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.910 
as we mentioned in the previous couple
of<00:01:08.399> rides<00:01:08.609> the<00:01:08.909> top<00:01:09.149> rider<00:01:09.420> cannot<00:01:10.320> overtake

so<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.780> few<00:01:36.050> discussions<00:01:36.650> going<00:01:36.860> on<00:01:37.070> there

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
so a few discussions going on there

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.600 
so a few discussions going on there
between<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:38.150> Spanish<00:01:39.020> coach<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.370> two

between the Spanish coach and the two

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:54.960 
between the Spanish coach and the two
riders

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.150 

on<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.510> back<00:01:55.720> all<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.320> riders<00:01:56.530> will<00:01:56.830> choose

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
on the back all the riders will choose

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.100 
on the back all the riders will choose
not<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.700> ride<00:01:57.910> through<00:01:58.210> this<00:01:58.420> wheels<00:01:58.720> front

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
not to ride through this wheels front

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.770 
not to ride through this wheels front
and<00:01:59.380> back<00:01:59.620> for<00:01:59.970> maneuverability<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.480> also

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
and back for maneuverability and also

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.500 
and back for maneuverability and also
because<00:02:02.110> there<00:02:02.320> is<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.620> potential<00:02:02.950> for

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
because there is the potential for

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.950 
because there is the potential for
crosswinds<00:02:04.510> and<00:02:05.040> things<00:02:06.040> in<00:02:06.250> this

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
crosswinds and things in this

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.499 
crosswinds and things in this
the<00:02:07.920> flags<00:02:08.280> are<00:02:08.550> clutching<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.119> little<00:02:09.390> bit

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the flags are clutching a little bit

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.110 
the flags are clutching a little bit
more<00:02:09.750> wildly<00:02:10.289> now<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:11.459> we'll<00:02:11.640> see<00:02:11.880> whether

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
more wildly now so we'll see whether

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.230 
more wildly now so we'll see whether
that<00:02:12.330> changes<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.260> times

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240

the leaders disappointment for the Dutch
it<00:02:40.200> looked<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.530> me<00:02:40.650> like<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.950> change<00:02:41.250> was<00:02:41.430> okay

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
it looked to me like the change was okay

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.610 
it looked to me like the change was okay
but<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:42.060> did<00:02:42.360> notice<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.810> one<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.410> Dutch

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.460 
but it did notice that one of the Dutch
the<00:02:44.070> Dutch<00:02:44.100> rider<00:02:44.490> who<00:02:44.760> had<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.720> come<00:02:45.960> through
