00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
on the PlayStation is he worth more than

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.729 
on the PlayStation is he worth more than
his<00:03:24.190> non<00:03:24.400> informer<00:03:24.940> know<00:03:25.299> that<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:26.470> price

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
his non informer know that that price

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.370 
his non informer know that that price
that<00:03:27.160> price<00:03:27.430> range<00:03:27.549> is<00:03:27.940> just<00:03:28.450> not<00:03:28.870> worth<00:03:29.049> it<00:03:29.230> at

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
that price range is just not worth it at

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.380 
that price range is just not worth it at
all<00:03:29.560> like<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.799> 86<00:03:30.370> rated<00:03:30.700> card<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.120> can<00:03:31.269> get

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
all like the 86 rated card it can get

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.420 
all like the 86 rated card it can get
you<00:03:31.540> goals<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:32.140> feels<00:03:32.500> good<00:03:32.709> on<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.980> ball<00:03:33.130> and

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
you goals it feels good on the ball and

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.520 
you goals it feels good on the ball and
it's<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.700> very<00:03:33.910> nice<00:03:34.090> card<00:03:34.450> whereas<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.230> pink

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
it's a very nice card whereas the pink

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.590 
it's a very nice card whereas the pink
card<00:03:35.799> although<00:03:36.459> it's<00:03:36.640> good<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.330> feels<00:03:37.360> a

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
card although it's good and it feels a

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.210 
card although it's good and it feels a
lot<00:03:37.720> quicker<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.500> guess<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.830> shots<00:03:39.040> are<00:03:39.190> a

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
lot quicker and I guess the shots are a

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.770 
lot quicker and I guess the shots are a
little<00:03:39.340> bit<00:03:39.489> more<00:03:39.580> powerful<00:03:40.209> you're<00:03:40.630> gonna

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
little bit more powerful you're gonna

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.990 
little bit more powerful you're gonna
finish<00:03:41.049> anyway<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.920> then<00:03:42.220> it's<00:03:42.400> basically

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
finish anyway and then it's basically

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.539 
finish anyway and then it's basically
like<00:03:43.180> 5050<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.739> shooting<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.400> has<00:03:45.519> a

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
like 5050 it is a shooting it has a

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.370 
like 5050 it is a shooting it has a
shooting<00:03:46.000> being<00:03:46.150> increased<00:03:46.570> it<00:03:46.720> is<00:03:46.900> very<00:03:47.140> hard

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
shooting being increased it is very hard

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.110 
shooting being increased it is very hard
to<00:03:47.530> tell<00:03:47.799> depending<00:03:48.220> what<00:03:48.370> situations<00:03:49.030> you

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
to tell depending what situations you

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.850 
to tell depending what situations you
get<00:03:49.299> yourself<00:03:49.390> in<00:03:49.750> like<00:03:49.900> I<00:03:50.080> remember<00:03:50.500> taking<00:03:50.650> a

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
get yourself in like I remember taking a

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.130 
get yourself in like I remember taking a

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
shot on the edge of the box that it was

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.479 
shot on the edge of the box that it was
a<00:03:53.170> different<00:03:53.380> animation<00:03:53.950> than<00:03:54.130> what<00:03:54.340> I've

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
a different animation than what I've

it<00:03:59.200> has<00:03:59.380> been<00:03:59.590> improved<00:03:59.980> but<00:04:00.400> does<00:04:00.549> it<00:04:00.580> warrant

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
it has been improved but does it warrant

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.640
