00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.060
 Hello everyone welcome to ixtem motorcycle 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.710
 for a new video 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.830
 so today we will talk about 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.120
 penguins are handlebar accessories 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.950
 which will bring you a good dose of 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.900
 extra comfort in winter in 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.850
 protecting your hands from the cold and 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.470
 rain while you're bikers or 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.720
 scooters as you moved 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.130
 rather in town or on fast lane you 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.450
 be more or less chilly the goal 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.730
 of this little presentation 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.220
 it's actually targeting the product that 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.380
 will best match your usage to 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.220
 your need so the products that I have 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.750
 with me here we have three we have two 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.790
 tucano urbano products so the brand 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.100
 italian tucano urbano sleeves in 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.920
 neoprene always at you channels the 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.480
 nylon sleeves and then at baxter 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.700
 French brand the sleeves are 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.620
 bauxite heaters 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.320
 so to start with the formula the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.550
 more economical I would say we have them 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.860
 neoprene sleeves 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.500
 so it's this product then quite 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.930
 suitable for scooters and use 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.370
 I would say urban and it is also suitable for 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.530
 small motorcycles 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.070
 so you see we are on a product 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.360
 relatively compact especially because 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.040
 that they do not adopt all 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.500
 commands that we see here only for 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.630
 manipulate the lighting controls the 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.460
 horn turn signals we're going to have here 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.700
 a small outgrowth to come 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.470
 operate the commodos we have a little bit 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.200
 of reflection here and then the neoprene 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.370
 taming with which they made this 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.880
 product will provide good protection 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.380
 against cold and rain 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.120
 that's the model I would say light in 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.550
 tucano the neoprene sleeve 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.050
 if you need protection a 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.920
 little more important or if you 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.040
 ride on fast lane 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.740
 it should rather be on the model 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.180
 nylon so it's this sleeve then 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.060
 there we have one we see everything is a 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.620
 produced much larger so he 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.850
 is made entirely of nylon for the 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.750
 outer membrane so in term 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.970
 sealing 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.100
 it's irreproachable inside we have 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.720
 a lining already much more 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.729
 consequent a fleece lining so 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.900
 also at the level of heat we go 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.720
 to be on something a lot more 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.130
 hot than neoprene model and then 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.300
 so especially the big difference and 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.800
 that's why he's more 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.240
 bulky is that in fact it goes 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.590
 encompass all of your orders 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.170
 so you will actually continue to 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.910
 handle the flagship flashing commodos 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.140
 xterra directly inside the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.040
 sleeve also you see here 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.170
 when you have mirrors that 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.430
 are implanted on the handlebars that lift 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.080
 a small hole that allows to do 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.480
 take out the mirror 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.810
 so that's the nylon model then to 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.340
 note also that he is at reinforcements 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.610
 rigid here on the front and on the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.200
 sides 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.580
 so that 's going to be quite suitable 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.450
 if you are driving on the fast track since 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.160
 it will help prevent the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.209
 airflow when you ride exercise 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.130
 undesirable pressures on 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.500
 brake or clutch levers 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.290
 that was the name champmillon of all 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.030
 channels and finally I would say for the 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.150
 more cautious or the most demanding it is 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.920
 a little choice we have the baxter sleeve 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.970
 bauxite 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.590
 so this product is a product 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.790
 heater you see here that we have 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.220
 a small connection that allows you to 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.459
 connect the product to the electrical circuit 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.810
 of your machine so also produces 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.070
 nylon with a warm lining to 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.930
 inside so be you can 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.950
 use it without heating so already 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.840
 it's a very hot product and 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.950
 waterproof and in addition we had you a 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.440
 small switch with two positions 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.910
 heaters that allow you to 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.250
 to really keep your hands well at 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.510
 hot a little bit like on the handle 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.130
 neoprene so here we have a small 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.430
 outgrowth to manipulate it's like 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.410
 oddo should be noted that at baxter actually 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.790
 you also have the boxer model that 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.349
 was exactly the same except he 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.450
 does not have the heating function 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.310
 so here are actually two products at 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.420
 baxter boxer or 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.319
 exceet if you want the function 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.090
 so that's his products his 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.709
 Heated penguins for to be more 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.840
 comfortable in winter on your two wheels 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.670
 I hope it will help you that 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.360
 will facilitate the choice thank you for your 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.360
 attention and see you soon
