00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
doubt so it has plenty of working space

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.840 
doubt so it has plenty of working space
and<00:01:16.350> make<00:01:16.770> sure<00:01:16.830> there's<00:01:17.100> nothing<00:01:17.340> metal

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and make sure there's nothing metal

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.100 
and make sure there's nothing metal
around<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.420> you're<00:01:18.570> working<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:18.960> these

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
for them to cling to because that's just

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.539 
for them to cling to because that's just
a<00:01:21.420> big<00:01:21.570> pain<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> butt<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.890> first<00:01:23.220> thing

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.460 
the next thing you got to do is work it
over<00:01:31.520> okay<00:01:33.530> like<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:36.020> then<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.170> want<00:01:37.380> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
over okay like that and then you want to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.530 
over okay like that and then you want to
go<00:01:37.590> back<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.460> other<00:01:38.490> way<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.210> got<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.479> be

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
go back the other way you got to be

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.649 
go back the other way you got to be
careful<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.130> how<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.520> pop<00:01:42.240> apart

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
careful you see how they pop apart

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.179 
careful you see how they pop apart
you've<00:01:42.810> got<00:01:43.020> alternating<00:01:43.740> poles<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
you've got alternating poles here and

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.179 
you've got alternating poles here and
then<00:01:48.079> try<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.110> make<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.530> visible<00:01:50.130> as

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
then try to make this as visible as

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.580 
then try to make this as visible as
possible<00:01:52.040> okay<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.509> then<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:55.170> whole<00:01:55.350> time

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
possible okay and then the whole time

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.139 
possible okay and then the whole time
you<00:01:55.649> can<00:01:55.950> make<00:01:56.100> sure<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.399> stays<00:01:56.640> together<00:01:59.149> it

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
you can make sure it stays together it

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.690 
you can make sure it stays together it
will<00:02:00.450> eventually<00:02:01.049> hold<00:02:01.740> itself<00:02:02.219> once<00:02:02.610> you

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
will eventually hold itself once you

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.630 
will eventually hold itself once you
have<00:02:02.820> enough<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.270> these<00:02:03.450> back<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.110> know

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
have enough of these back you know

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.680 
have enough of these back you know
connected<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:07.879> it'll<00:02:08.879> get<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> lot<00:02:09.149> easier<00:02:09.360> to

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
connected and it'll get a lot easier to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.110 
connected and it'll get a lot easier to
do<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.950> already<00:02:11.310> getting<00:02:11.580> willies

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
do it's already getting willies

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.750 
do it's already getting willies
you<00:02:12.530> can<00:02:13.530> do<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:13.890> little<00:02:14.069> bit<00:02:14.190> click<00:02:14.549> here

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
you can do it a little bit click here

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.320 
you can do it a little bit click here
now<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.239> it's<00:02:15.959> hard<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:17.069> show<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.370> what

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
I'm doing because it the easiest way to

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.990 
I'm doing because it the easiest way to
do<00:02:20.159> this<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.580> hold<00:02:20.849> it<00:02:21.030> down<00:02:21.709> okay<00:02:23.000> while

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
do this is to hold it down okay while

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.940 
do this is to hold it down okay while
you're<00:02:25.280> running<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.519> back<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.940> forth<00:02:27.950> because

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
you're running it back and forth because

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.750 
you're running it back and forth because
it<00:02:29.370> keeps<00:02:29.610> them<00:02:30.060> from<00:02:30.750> popping<00:02:31.230> apart<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.640> it's

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
it keeps them from popping apart so it's

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.899 
it keeps them from popping apart so it's
kind<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.000> hard<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.269> show<00:02:33.659> you<00:02:33.720> what<00:02:34.260> I'm<00:02:34.319> doing

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
kind of hard to show you what I'm doing

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.449 
kind of hard to show you what I'm doing
while<00:02:35.909> I<00:02:35.940> do<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.269> not<00:02:37.019> do<00:02:37.140> my<00:02:37.290> best<00:02:37.530> here<00:02:37.799> and

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
while I do it not do my best here and

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.850 
while I do it not do my best here and
you<00:02:39.180> basically<00:02:39.390> you're<00:02:40.019> going<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.200> do<00:02:40.379> this<00:02:40.530> to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
you basically you're going to do this to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.740 
you basically you're going to do this to
the<00:02:40.980> entire<00:02:41.280> length<00:02:41.610> you're<00:02:42.329> going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.569> get

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
the entire length you're going to get

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.360 
the entire length you're going to get
one<00:02:43.019> band<00:02:44.269> this<00:02:45.269> wide<00:02:45.569> as<00:02:46.290> wide<00:02:46.590> as<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:47.099> with<00:02:47.340> a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
one band this wide as wide as the with a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.309 
one band this wide as wide as the with a
bit<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.540> cube<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:50.030> then<00:02:51.140> what<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.170> have

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
bit of the cube and then what you have

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.020 
bit of the cube and then what you have
it<00:02:52.799> at<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.579> point<00:02:53.849> you<00:02:54.890> can<00:02:55.890> go<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:56.849> the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
it at that point you can go on to the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.069 
it at that point you can go on to the
next<00:02:57.239> step<00:03:00.650> all<00:03:01.650> right<00:03:01.829> I<00:03:02.159> jumped<00:03:03.030> ahead<00:03:03.150> just

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
next step all right I jumped ahead just

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.890 
next step all right I jumped ahead just
to<00:03:04.200> spare<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.769> some<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:05.940> boredom<00:03:06.390> make

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
to spare you some of the boredom make

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.080 
to spare you some of the boredom make
this<00:03:07.079> as<00:03:07.349> least<00:03:07.709> boring<00:03:07.980> as<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.370> possibly<00:03:08.579> can

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
this as least boring as I possibly can

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.910 
this as least boring as I possibly can
this<00:03:09.750> next<00:03:10.079> part<00:03:10.319> is<00:03:10.349> going<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.560> be<00:03:10.620> kind<00:03:10.769> of

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
this next part is going to be kind of

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.119 
this next part is going to be kind of
hard<00:03:11.069> to<00:03:11.159> show<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.670> now<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.480> cube<00:03:13.349> is<00:03:13.440> six

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
hard to show you it now the cube is six

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.460 
hard to show you it now the cube is six
magnets<00:03:14.819> along<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.480> need<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.989> fold<00:03:16.260> this

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
magnets along so you need to fold this

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.300 
magnets along so you need to fold this
over<00:03:16.790> six<00:03:17.790> minutes<00:03:18.299> long<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.950> will<00:03:20.130> do<00:03:20.280> my

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
over six minutes long and I will do my

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.990 
over six minutes long and I will do my
best<00:03:20.669> to<00:03:20.880> show<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:22.560> camera<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.400> can<00:03:23.549> see

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
best to show the camera so you can see

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.069 
best to show the camera so you can see
and<00:03:24.989> should<00:03:25.799> just<00:03:25.980> kind<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.690> pop<00:03:27.690> right<00:03:27.930> into

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
and should just kind of pop right into

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.259 
and should just kind of pop right into
place<00:03:28.260> just<00:03:28.530> like<00:03:28.799> that<00:03:29.040> I'll<00:03:29.790> turn<00:03:30.060> that

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
place just like that I'll turn that

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.449 
place just like that I'll turn that
around<00:03:30.419> so<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.870> can<00:03:31.019> see<00:03:31.139> it<00:03:31.859> better<00:03:32.099> view<00:03:32.430> on

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
around so you can see it better view on

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.309 
around so you can see it better view on
the<00:03:32.579> camera<00:03:33.470> it's<00:03:34.470> tough<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.160> do<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:36.319> ensure

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
the camera it's tough to do so ensure

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.650 
the camera it's tough to do so ensure
the<00:03:37.410> camera<00:03:37.859> so<00:03:38.069> i<00:03:38.099> am<00:03:38.430> just<00:03:38.459> going<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.359> go

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
the camera so i am just going to go

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:51.680 
the camera so i am just going to go
ahead<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:44.090> flip<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:46.370> get<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:47.489> done<00:03:50.690> and

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
ahead and flip it and get this done and

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.119 
ahead and flip it and get this done and
then

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.940 

flip<00:03:56.129> it<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.340> then<00:03:56.670> one<00:03:57.030> more<00:03:57.650> should<00:03:58.650> just

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
flip it and then one more should just

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.410 
flip it and then one more should just
pull<00:03:59.940> longer<00:04:00.440> just<00:04:01.440> like<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.269> then<00:04:03.269> the

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
pull longer just like that and then the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.420 
pull longer just like that and then the
cube<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:04.489> completely<00:04:05.489> done<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:06.440> together<00:04:07.440> and

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
cube is completely done and together and

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.170 
cube is completely done and together and
if<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:10.489> purchased<00:04:11.489> one<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.790> came<00:04:11.970> with<00:04:12.150> a

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
if you purchased one that came with a

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.500 
if you purchased one that came with a
nice<00:04:12.420> little<00:04:12.450> nifty<00:04:13.440> carrying<00:04:14.069> case<00:04:14.280> like<00:04:15.180> the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
nice little nifty carrying case like the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.360 
nice little nifty carrying case like the
buckyballs<00:04:16.260> did<00:04:16.699> put<00:04:17.699> education<00:04:19.130> try<00:04:20.130> again

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
buckyballs did put education try again

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.669 
buckyballs did put education try again
another<00:04:20.459> day
