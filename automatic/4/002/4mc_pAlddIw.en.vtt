00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.820
 first warning from ajax early in the 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.320
 contest 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.469
 now that ball does not seem quite right 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.600
 to share a cruise very quickly 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.070
 to go and then pulls on there by 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.190
 yo grind

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.299
 his team in the ninth minute 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.189
 head Start 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.680

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.580
 first pile by grinding yo with good 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.070
 goal 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.610
 Geri Vink also thinks the thumb 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.610
 Up Now will again after li 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.330

 cycling weather male male to right and 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:34.160

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.950
 engaged in the title fight 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:41.900
 with utrecht and volendam and is much better 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.600
 then feyenoord in the 1st half 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.600
 male male he shoots 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.960
 is dangerous but is not yet possible 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.960
 draw his second goal 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.640
 well sean fernandez roughly on the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.020
 right pull the front 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.890
 and one of the first opportunities for 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:14.200
 feyenoord for that chon 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.200

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.070

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.450

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.230
 modibo is about the goal instead of 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.230
 between the posts 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.920
 we put the weapon in the hands of justin 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.730
 ax the keeper 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.600

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.760
 granted russia fernandez with good 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.900
 boss on najjar and alberta 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.750

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.660
 ajax-feyenoord a month ago at 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.670
 did in the final minutes because he has 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.020
 leave two points and see Utrecht 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.020
 come alongside on the rankings
