mail<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:40.959> believe<00:02:41.410> but<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.560> can<00:02:41.769> program<00:02:41.950> them

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
mail I believe but you can program them

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
important one is that top one there

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.180 
important one is that top one there
which<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:45.880> going<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.090> change<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.480> back<00:02:46.660> now<00:02:46.930> to

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
which is going to change it back now to

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.050 
which is going to change it back now to
the<00:02:48.190> touch<00:02:48.700> mode<00:02:48.940> there<00:02:49.480> we<00:02:49.569> go<00:02:49.980> yes<00:02:50.980> see<00:02:51.790> if<00:02:51.970> I

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
the touch mode there we go yes see if I

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.220 
the touch mode there we go yes see if I
can<00:02:52.209> touch<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.660> right<00:02:52.780> place<00:02:53.049> without

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
can touch it in the right place without

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.380 
can touch it in the right place without
looking<00:02:53.709> again<00:02:53.950> that's<00:02:54.160> hard<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.459> do<00:02:54.610> without

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
looking again that's hard to do without

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.140 
looking again that's hard to do without
looking<00:02:55.959> harder<00:02:56.319> than<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.500> looks<00:02:56.830> there<00:02:57.819> we<00:02:58.000> go

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
looking harder than it looks there we go

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.720 
looking harder than it looks there we go
now<00:02:59.019> looking<00:02:59.680> at<00:02:59.799> the<00:02:59.980> bottom<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.700> sides

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
now looking at the bottom and the sides

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.430 
now looking at the bottom and the sides
of<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.209> tablet<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.660> notice<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.080> bottom

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
of the tablet you notice the bottom

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.070 
of the tablet you notice the bottom
there's<00:03:02.799> really<00:03:02.950> nothing<00:03:03.099> there<00:03:03.640> on<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.870> left

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
there's really nothing there on the left

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.600 
there's really nothing there on the left
hand<00:03:05.260> side<00:03:05.380> there's<00:03:05.860> really<00:03:06.069> nothing<00:03:06.489> there

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
hand side there's really nothing there

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.220 
hand side there's really nothing there
so<00:03:06.790> they<00:03:06.910> keep<00:03:07.060> those<00:03:07.239> clean<00:03:07.569> lines<00:03:07.840> as<00:03:08.049> much

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
so they keep those clean lines as much

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.590 
so they keep those clean lines as much
as<00:03:08.350> possible<00:03:08.530> on<00:03:08.950> all<00:03:09.100> sides<00:03:09.370> now<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.390> top

power<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.430> device<00:03:18.700> now<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.060> did<00:03:19.299> notice

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
power to the device now I did notice

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.750 
power to the device now I did notice
that<00:03:19.690> using<00:03:20.170> this<00:03:20.260> power<00:03:20.530> slider<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.459> have<00:03:21.609> to

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
that using this power slider you have to

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.270 
that using this power slider you have to
actually<00:03:21.940> put<00:03:22.450> pull<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:22.959> hold<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.470> for<00:03:23.709> a

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
actually put pull it and hold it for a

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.190 
actually put pull it and hold it for a
few<00:03:24.340> seconds<00:03:24.940> maybe<00:03:25.090> like<00:03:25.329> about<00:03:25.540> two<00:03:25.750> seconds

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
few seconds maybe like about two seconds

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.199 
few seconds maybe like about two seconds
which<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.380> longer<00:03:26.680> than<00:03:26.890> I'm<00:03:27.040> used<00:03:27.069> to<00:03:27.459> using

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
which is longer than I'm used to using

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.199 
which is longer than I'm used to using
on<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.720> tablet<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.500> adjust<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.280> power<00:03:30.489> that's

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
on a tablet to adjust the power that's

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.000 
on a tablet to adjust the power that's
what<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.510> takes<00:03:31.660> next<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.530> your<00:03:32.739> pc

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
what it takes next to that is your pc

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.750 
what it takes next to that is your pc
card<00:03:33.370> slot<00:03:33.670> on<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:35.100> other<00:03:36.100> end<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.519> device

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
card slot on the other end of the device

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.220 
card slot on the other end of the device
so<00:03:36.940> this<00:03:37.090> is<00:03:37.239> where<00:03:37.389> all<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.510> good<00:03:37.750> stuff<00:03:37.810> is

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.040 
do to show you this next one is it
really<00:05:01.030> going<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:01.270> give<00:05:01.419> you<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:01.570> good<00:05:01.780> idea

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
really going to give you a good idea

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.020 
really going to give you a good idea
just<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.500> relative<00:05:03.159> size<00:05:03.340> of<00:05:03.520> this<00:05:03.640> thing<00:05:03.700> so

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
just the relative size of this thing so

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.310 
just the relative size of this thing so
I<00:05:04.060> thought<00:05:04.330> I'd<00:05:04.479> do<00:05:04.599> something<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:05.020> little<00:05:05.050> bit

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
I thought I'd do something a little bit

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.430 
I thought I'd do something a little bit
different<00:05:05.740> and<00:05:05.890> show<00:05:06.669> you<00:05:06.729> the<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.419> i-44<00:05:08.110> TD

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
different and show you the the i-44 TD

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.010 
different and show you the the i-44 TD
against<00:05:08.880> objects<00:05:09.880> you<00:05:10.360> might<00:05:10.539> have<00:05:10.719> in<00:05:10.870> your

against objects you might have in your
house<00:05:11.200> for<00:05:11.500> example<00:05:11.979> I<00:05:13.320> said<00:05:14.320> it<00:05:14.440> looked<00:05:14.620> like

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
house for example I said it looked like

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.159 
house for example I said it looked like
an<00:05:14.919> overgrown<00:05:15.190> ipod<00:05:15.520> and<00:05:16.000> there<00:05:16.870> you<00:05:16.960> have<00:05:16.990> a

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
an overgrown ipod and there you have a

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.730 
an overgrown ipod and there you have a
comparison<00:05:18.210> here's<00:05:19.210> my<00:05:19.479> ipod<00:05:19.960> it's<00:05:20.320> one<00:05:20.620> of

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
comparison here's my ipod it's one of

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.300 
comparison here's my ipod it's one of
the<00:05:20.800> later<00:05:21.250> color<00:05:21.930> video<00:05:22.930> ipods<00:05:23.530> and<00:05:24.010> you<00:05:24.130> can

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
the later color video ipods and you can

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.300 
the later color video ipods and you can
see<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:24.610> resemblance<00:05:25.620> but<00:05:26.620> of<00:05:26.919> course<00:05:26.979> it's

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
see the resemblance but of course it's

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.770 
see the resemblance but of course it's
quite<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.490> bit<00:05:27.669> larger<00:05:28.030> than<00:05:28.060> an<00:05:28.270> ipod<00:05:28.570> let's

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780
