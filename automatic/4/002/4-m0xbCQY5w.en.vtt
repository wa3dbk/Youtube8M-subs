 with the orchestra 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.659
 that would be so bad 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.840
 and in fact, without any knowledge of the boat, the boats do not want to gamble 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:21.450

 here you will find out 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.300
 Experts are instead that is a bandit Irish lake actually really one 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.740

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.900
 Siemens has problems 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.219
 what was the problem and conception of and, so to speak, a collective singing 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.779

 somewhere in Moscow 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:29.779
