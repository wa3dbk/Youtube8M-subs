characters<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.160> game<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:03.150> it<00:02:03.300> was

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
characters in this game but it was

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.880 
characters in this game but it was
pretty<00:02:03.660> much<00:02:03.810> hush-hush<00:02:04.110> about<00:02:04.560> what<00:02:04.710> we

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
pretty much hush-hush about what we

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.880 
pretty much hush-hush about what we
could<00:02:05.010> expect<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.930> if<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.080> past<00:02:07.320> Mario<00:02:07.620> Wii

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
could expect so if the past Mario Wii

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.920 
could expect so if the past Mario Wii
games<00:02:08.160> are<00:02:08.340> any<00:02:08.460> indication<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.330> think<00:02:09.780> there's

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
games are any indication I think there's

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.360 
games are any indication I think there's
a<00:02:09.990> strong<00:02:10.290> possibility<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:11.190> there<00:02:11.340> being

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
a strong possibility of there being

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.780 
a strong possibility of there being
hidden<00:02:11.760> characters<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.630> game<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.610> there

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
hidden characters in this game so there

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.520 
hidden characters in this game so there
you<00:02:14.880> have<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.090> look<00:02:15.570> for<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.840> title<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.380> be

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
you have it look for this title to be

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.220 
you have it look for this title to be
released<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.040> fall
