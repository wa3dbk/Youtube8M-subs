00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello everyone and so guess how many times 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.819
 I was asked which processor is better 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.500
 select for a layer of two video cards 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.889
 top either 780 them or 780 ti or 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.260
 chair rs2 tops 290x video cards for n.d. 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.060
 and the main question was enough cast 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.250
 core i7 4770 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.699
 or still need to take something more powerful 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.000
 on 6 cores i.e. for example core i7 4930 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.640
 to 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.740
 and I myself often asked such a question and 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.820
 finally my team store point 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.109
 py gave me the opportunity 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.559
 to test 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.870
 a bunch of 2,780 invidia cards on 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.030
 two different processors and so suggest 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.550
 you together with me to look at 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.559
 the results of these tests 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.510
 I conducted testing in two games on 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.010
 My opinion is the most technologically advanced of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.079
 demanding processor 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.449
 battlefield 4 and krayzis 3 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.890
 Well, the most important question is 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.510
 testing methodology mainly 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.309
 war processes various sites 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.199
 adjusting in such a way that leaves 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.719
 all settings are almost at a minimum and 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.850
 in order to highlight the differences and 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.040
 superiority poured different processors 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.460
 testing is mostly done in 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.760
 1024 resolution at 768 at the minimum 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.860
 settings but the point is to test in such 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.689
 modes are not particularly understandable since 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.450
 Such settings, few will play and 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.509
 few people wonder about the top 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.549
 processors for such settings for 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.970
 testing, I chose the flash mode somewhere 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.070
 there is a monitor resolution of 1920 by 1080 i 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.460
 I think such monitors have already 70 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.409
 percent of gamers and settings in two 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.450
 These games I chose high that is not 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.579
 ultra since ultra is already loading 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.009
 video cards the difference between processors 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.619
 there is no longer so obvious 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.810
 It was chosen exactly high mode full hd 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.850
 in order to more or less understand 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.310
 the difference between these two processors 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.200
 insert graphics settings no less 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.360
 I see the point because we are comparing two 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200
 top video cards on two top 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.390
 processors 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.880
 that is why the mode was chosen 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.799
 closer to everyday gaming cult 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.049
 ra settings also processor 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.299
 tested in tokyo that is in that form 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.479
 which they go from the store or factory 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.619
 and overclocking by 4 gigahertz 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.620
 accelerated itself manually each 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.540
 processor and 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.670
 and created this in order to understand 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.220
 the difference between six cores and four 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.959
 cores at the same frequencies and so 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.370
 I suggest you first look at 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.080
 two different stands on which 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.750
 tested own system 1 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.140
 cent based on a 4930 processor to 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.730
 and motherboard asus rampage formula 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.360
 the processor was cooling with a zalman cooler 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.750
 cnps10x 2 stand respectively assembled on 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.260
 core i7 4770 k on maternal 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.230
 motherboard gigabyte z87 sniper cooler by the way 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.090
 on the processor was more powerful than on 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.319
 previous processor but accurate 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.390
 Unfortunately I do not remember the name 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.420
 the only thing I remember is that it was a cooler 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.420
 master 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.739
 and so on these settings 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.629
 tested the game battlefield 4 now 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.849
 let's look at the scene in which she 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.830
 tested in this scene very much 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.629
 blasts destructions scripts precisely 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.280
 therefore, one can adequately compare 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.720
 professor since the load on him 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.720
 going very good 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.860
 I will raise 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.920
 I 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.330
 well now let's look at 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.799
 Settings game krayzis 3 here I would become 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.150
 maximum settings with medium 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.069
 smoothing since on any 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.349
 settings this game is very strong 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.239
 loaded the processor and on any 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.150
 settings you can adequately track it 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.650
 load and performance difference 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.810
 for the test, I also chose the script 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.790
 the scene is the only way to create 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.040
 identical conditions for two different 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.410
 tests this video was recorded 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.060
 on processor 4930 k therefore the whole 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.250
 which statistics is displayed in 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.180
 top left is also relevant to 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.220
 for a bunch of 780 moisture processor from 49 3. 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.260
 program name top left 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.690
 can also be seen in the description 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.760
 by the way pay attention to the temperature 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.650
 overclocked 6 most powerful nuclear 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.650
 CPU in the most load 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.669
 processors g krayzis 3 coolers only 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.560
 for 1000 rubles 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.840
 very well cools this 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.350
 processor only 50 degrees of steam 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.620
 kilometer first you need to get around the fire 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.620
 bag 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.470
 [music] 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.029
 but I think this scene already many people know 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.099
 almost by heart so let's 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:03.050
 hurry up to get it soon 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.759
 look at the test results and 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.189
 before we look at the results 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.959
 tests I suggest you once again draw 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:11.059
 attention to testing methodology so 

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:13.699
 processors were tested two different 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:16.059
 modes it is in stock mode and in mode 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.860
 overclocking up to 4 gigahertz 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:20.419
 in order to adequately evaluate 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.939
 the differences between four and six 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.379
 modern cores 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:26.990
 benchmark was built to be 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:29.269
 Markov program Fred that is, by pressing 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.969
 f11 it measures the minimum average and 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:34.009
 maximum frames per second 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.809
 fps measurement stopped without recording i.e. 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.759
 the video you see was recorded 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:40.310
 separately and after that was already filmed 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:46.189
 frame rate per second 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.189
 [music] 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.000
 [music] 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.080
 So you have a comparison table. 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.509
 results 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.669
 I note that if we did the comparison 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.979
 so how do you do that many offices then 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.139
 We have set the settings on the minimum 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:07.080
 then the difference between the processors would become 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:09.449
 would be more meaningful but we make a comparison 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.819
 what is your processor enough for two 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.220
 card tops and therefore minimum 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:16.319
 settings are unacceptable for us so what 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.120
 we actually see the differences are not so 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:21.060
 and great are the only ones where wins 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.919
 core i7 4930 k so this is synthetics and 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.469
 wins slightly at minimum 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.840
 indicators fett game krayzis 3 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:30.030
 you can draw your own conclusions 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.120
 it seems to me that at the moment 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.349
 processor core i7 4770 is enough 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.770
 even without overclocking 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:39.509
 for two top cards if you want 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.569
 raise a slightly lower figure 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:44.250
 frames per second or want to put 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:46.199
 somewhere a record, respectively 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:49.229
 overclocking is recommended to you but if you 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.940
 chase at all for each frame is 4930 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.190
 how of course it will help you with it 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.110
 but on this i have today i hope you all 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.509
 test data liked it and you 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.310
 found the answer for so long 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:01.500
 many tormented question what is 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.690
 processor enough for a bunch of two 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.510
 top video cards everyone thanks for 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:10.640
 attention and bye 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.640
