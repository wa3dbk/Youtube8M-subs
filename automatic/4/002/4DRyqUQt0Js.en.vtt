throw the patch on there on the back you

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.920

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
know you grab from over here you go slap

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.400 
know you grab from over here you go slap
it<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.290> here<00:03:09.020> doesn't<00:03:10.020> really<00:03:10.050> look<00:03:10.350> that

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
it on here doesn't really look that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.490 
it on here doesn't really look that
great<00:03:10.950> maybe<00:03:11.880> I'm<00:03:12.060> not<00:03:12.209> putting<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.660> on<00:03:12.780> very

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
great maybe I'm not putting it on very

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.820 
great maybe I'm not putting it on very
nicely<00:03:13.910> but<00:03:14.910> just<00:03:15.360> looking<00:03:16.140> at<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:16.590> with<00:03:16.709> the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
nicely but just looking at it with the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.729 
nicely but just looking at it with the
patches<00:03:17.370> oh<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:18.870> think<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.260> something

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
patches oh I think this is something

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.050 
patches oh I think this is something
maybe<00:03:19.860> they<00:03:20.130> actually<00:03:20.640> keep<00:03:20.819> as<00:03:21.030> a

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
maybe they actually keep as a

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.160 
maybe they actually keep as a
collector's<00:03:21.630> item

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
collector's item

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.290 
collector's item
I<00:03:22.200> would<00:03:22.920> rather<00:03:23.100> wear<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:24.709> right<00:03:25.709> there<00:03:26.300> it

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
I would rather wear this right there it

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.850 
I would rather wear this right there it
just<00:03:27.330> looks<00:03:27.690> kind<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:28.019> sloppy<00:03:28.170> with<00:03:28.709> the

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
just looks kind of sloppy with the

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.470 
just looks kind of sloppy with the
patches<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.550> this<00:03:29.640> is<00:03:29.790> actually<00:03:30.120> I'm<00:03:30.269> pretty

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
patches and this is actually I'm pretty

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.979 
patches and this is actually I'm pretty
well<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:31.140> mean<00:03:31.650> it's<00:03:31.800> not<00:03:31.950> exact<00:03:32.400> but<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.930> know

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
even over here it just looks like

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.240

this is more for collecting and not

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.920 
this is more for collecting and not
wearing<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.830> mean<00:04:35.130> I<00:04:35.490> just<00:04:36.420> don't<00:04:36.630> think<00:04:36.840> it
