00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.609

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.170
 can you add here 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.770

 and we are going to look 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.099
 sometimes looking 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.780
 good for in the other tutorials though 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.790
 a little bit we caught 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.769
 with this vision 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.050
 but how is google more for the 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.680
 small with 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.680
 Hello 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.240
 Well, from here we can see him 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.030
 at home here we get seven in two 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.430
 loading errors 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.450
 they did not show is a device 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.490
 samsung that also left in his body 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.440
 but very good 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.840
 we have the street view we also have 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.220
 the broad 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.220
 sometimes and they do not accept the real ones 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.290
 here load less 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.540
 against stress vigo and then 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.310
 I want to have a version for myself and photos of 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.200
 you for what we have 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.200
 we'll put the desert and I had 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.510
 and 20 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:25.599
 not for a megabyte and deal in 24 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.599
 but he says that 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.940
 I have you 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.760
 Energy 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:57.070
 he told me to download it 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.280
 yesterday the government 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.840
 and well it can be done good by a 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.720
 recommendation that you have with everything is already 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:09.010
 close as battaglia for example if 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.220
 this city put it in the maximum that 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:16.510
 Look great 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:19.450
 it puts you put to such 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.969
 it fits our case well with the swing 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.709
 from the area 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:28.459
 it's already going out to save the 

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:28.459
 location and load the map with all
