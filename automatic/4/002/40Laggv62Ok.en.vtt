this<00:01:15.119> ether<00:01:15.570> t9<00:01:15.810> harness<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.680> spliced<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
this ether t9 harness was spliced and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.940 
this ether t9 harness was spliced and
cut<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:18.750> expecting<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.740> wires

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
cut I was expecting to have the wires

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.450 
cut I was expecting to have the wires
going<00:01:20.340> all<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> way<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> door<00:01:21.810> panels

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
going all the way up to the door panels

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.760 
going all the way up to the door panels
but<00:01:23.630> everyone<00:01:24.630> does<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.049> they<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.470> cut<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
but everyone does is they just cut the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.020 
but everyone does is they just cut the
wires<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.369> place<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.580> into<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
wires and just place it into the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.450 
wires and just place it into the
existing<00:01:27.860> speaker<00:01:28.860> harness

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
existing speaker harness

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.950 
existing speaker harness
however<00:01:30.470> mine<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.860> my<00:01:32.400> 90<00:01:33.299> 70<00:01:33.509> 39<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.680> not<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
however mine is my 90 70 39 is not a

does<00:01:36.960> not<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> DSP<00:01:37.740> setup<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.530> I'm<00:01:40.530> just

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
does not have a DSP setup so I'm just

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.690 
does not have a DSP setup so I'm just
gonna<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.040> add<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.369> additional

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
gonna have to add the additional

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.520 
gonna have to add the additional
speakers<00:01:42.090> or<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.329> don't<00:01:42.689> know<00:01:42.780> put<00:01:43.079> some<00:01:43.259> dummy

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
speakers or I don't know put some dummy

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.359 
speakers or I don't know put some dummy
resistors<00:01:44.430> maybe<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> dome<00:01:46.189> I'm<00:01:47.189> gonna

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
resistors maybe for a dome I'm gonna

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.649 
resistors maybe for a dome I'm gonna
have<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.579> play<00:01:47.759> around<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.630> I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
have to play around with that but I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.560 
have to play around with that but I
might<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:48.990> end<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.470> getting<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:50.450> ripping<00:01:51.450> out

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
might just end up getting a ripping out

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.850 
might just end up getting a ripping out
an<00:01:51.689> m5<00:01:52.079> interior<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.829> putting<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.280> mind

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
an m5 interior and putting it in mind

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.050 
an m5 interior and putting it in mind
and<00:01:54.980> putting<00:01:55.850> those<00:01:56.060> speakers<00:01:56.390> in<00:01:56.600> there<00:01:56.690> so

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
and putting those speakers in there so

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.090 
and putting those speakers in there so
everything<00:01:59.060> works<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.800> fortunately<00:02:00.800> I<00:02:00.890> was

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
everything works and fortunately I was

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.430 
everything works and fortunately I was
pretty<00:02:01.520> surprised<00:02:02.240> that<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.570> did<00:02:02.840> not<00:02:02.960> have<00:02:03.230> to

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
pretty surprised that I did not have to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.109 
pretty surprised that I did not have to
recode<00:02:04.150> since<00:02:05.150> I<00:02:05.240> was<00:02:05.360> able<00:02:05.480> to<00:02:05.630> deactivate

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
recode since I was able to deactivate

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.300 
recode since I was able to deactivate
the<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.660> engine<00:02:09.020> code<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.710> start<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:10.039> through

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
the the engine code to start it through

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.130 
the the engine code to start it through
the<00:02:10.640> navigation<00:02:11.210> screen<00:02:13.840> but<00:02:14.840> everything

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
the navigation screen but everything

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.270 
the navigation screen but everything
works<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:17.200> there's<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.380> plug<00:02:18.710> that<00:02:18.920> it<00:02:19.070> plugs

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
works so there's a plug that it plugs

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.740 
works so there's a plug that it plugs
into<00:02:19.460> we<00:02:20.060> got<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.480> radio<00:02:22.570> AM<00:02:23.570> connectors<00:02:25.750> mk3

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
into we got the radio AM connectors mk3

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.410 
into we got the radio AM connectors mk3
and<00:02:27.050> then<00:02:27.770> this<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.400> actually<00:02:28.580> for<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.000> mk2

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
and then this is actually for the mk2

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:37.090 
and then this is actually for the mk2
Trimble<00:02:30.080> which<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.530> not<00:02:31.100> being<00:02:31.340> used<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:36.100> what

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
Trimble which is not being used and what

you get a good ground and the person

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.560 
you get a good ground and the person
that<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.110> bought<00:02:42.320> this<00:02:42.530> from<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:43.390> don't<00:02:44.390> know

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
that I bought this from I don't know

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.570 
that I bought this from I don't know
what<00:02:44.810> this<00:02:45.290> person<00:02:45.560> did<00:02:45.890> what<00:02:46.100> they<00:02:46.220> actually

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
what this person did what they actually

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.630 
what this person did what they actually
cut<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.030> ground<00:02:47.270> plate<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.800> just<00:02:49.250> had<00:02:49.430> to

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
cut the ground plate so I just had to

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.460 
cut the ground plate so I just had to
twist<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.090> wires<00:02:50.270> together<00:02:50.510> just<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.989> test<00:02:51.230> it

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
twist the wires together just to test it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.710 
twist the wires together just to test it
you<00:02:52.220> know<00:02:52.370> get<00:02:52.550> all<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.730> grounds<00:02:53.209> connected

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
you know get all the grounds connected

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.150 
you know get all the grounds connected
together<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:55.010> jumper<00:02:55.370> cable<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:55.880> then

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
together the jumper cable and then

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.259 
together the jumper cable and then
clamped<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.250> on<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.670> negative<00:02:59.090> battery

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
clamped it on to the negative battery

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.470 
clamped it on to the negative battery
terminal<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:01.190> everything<00:03:01.519> does<00:03:01.670> work<00:03:03.190> so

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
terminal so everything does work so

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.600 
terminal so everything does work so
let's<00:03:05.480> go<00:03:06.049> cycle<00:03:06.620> through<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.860> menu<00:03:07.190> see<00:03:07.430> if<00:03:07.519> I

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
let's go cycle through the menu see if I

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.020 
let's go cycle through the menu see if I
can<00:03:07.790> get<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.180> on-board<00:03:08.690> computer

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
can get the on-board computer

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.470 
can get the on-board computer
computations<00:03:11.030> yep<00:03:11.660> it's<00:03:12.140> all<00:03:12.200> there
