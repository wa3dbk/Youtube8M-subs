00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 no strings of respect celetistas without one at the local marina 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.400
 they represent the high point of the pocket and some are larger than a house but 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.889
 costing millions 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.900
 goals are created 20 centers of states today 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.800
 with a collection consisting of how many pieces of wood that will be 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800
 used to build a mold for the fiberglass suit 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.830
 a cleaning team but needs about 15 months to design and build a 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.830
 mold 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.810
 first the structure is built 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.950
 he was the one who made the way in which kind of life 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.060
 where it has to be made to make the boat that is fault-free and 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.170
 defects 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.170
 so they work neatly on the top of the hill 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.000
 he talked to the specialist doctor the hot environments 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 which will support around eight years of modeling 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.460
 as determined we started the image of the fiberglass boat 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.220
 the company provides the exact proportion of fiberglass and plastic resin 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.710
 the fiberglass that can come in the form of very thin flexible fibers 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.070
 they may appear brittle but these fibers are stronger than steel 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.130
 that do not burn I was not with what did not happen 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.130
 so if the material that is made to build bar 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.210
 employees have to establish the epidemic activity of the fissure in each 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.000
 alcove 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.160
 this is indispensable because it seems difficult not to be applied with care 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.529
 the package has structural defects 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.529
 When I say fiberglass it increases in hard 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.449
 to feel that they use a material called 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.899
 it reinforces the fiberglass that makes it stiffer 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:29.099
 they also put up for sale at the points where they later assembled equipment 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.650
 then covers a fair with fiberglass to protect it from moisture 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.309
 after about an hour until being removed from the hill 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.049
 the success that the novel can be used to raise the case 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.139
 we can only hope that for the participants 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.519
 and after installing the hill complex 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:30.989
 the promoter placed 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.370
 besides the electrical wiring for the mechanical parts that a plumbing 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:40.599
 the boat takes shape on the assembly that does not 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.909
 the top of the boat was built she is called blind 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.909
 and the interior called the refis time mixed 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.849
 next comes furniture 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.339
 after certain components at times like the instrument panel 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.630
 the last stop in quality control 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.700
 a series of tests to ensure that every mechanical part works well because 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.700
 a person totally waterproof 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.610
 finally a protective packaging 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.669
 to protect the boat during transport
