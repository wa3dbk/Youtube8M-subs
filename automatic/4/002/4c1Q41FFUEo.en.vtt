just<00:01:54.390> huge<00:01:54.869> spines<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:56.009> around<00:01:56.219> 63<00:01:57.000> 64<00:01:57.600> 65

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
just huge spines of around 63 64 65

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.370 
just huge spines of around 63 64 65
millimeters<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.979> height<00:01:59.840> just<00:02:00.840> absolutely

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
millimeters in height just absolutely

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.200 
millimeters in height just absolutely
monstrous<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.159> weight<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.670> still<00:02:02.909> pretty

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
monstrous and the weight is still pretty

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.539 
monstrous and the weight is still pretty
light<00:02:03.479> most<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.960> these<00:02:04.049> bats<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.500> -<00:02:04.680> 9<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:04.950> -<00:02:05.250> 10

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
light most of these bats of - 9 or - 10

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.350 
light most of these bats of - 9 or - 10
so<00:02:06.329> that's<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.869> thing<00:02:07.079> with<00:02:07.380> SF<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.429> also

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
so that's the thing with SF and also

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.390 
so that's the thing with SF and also
with<00:02:09.539> CA<00:02:09.810> you're<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.560> getting<00:02:10.830> absolutely

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
with CA you're just getting absolutely

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.920 
with CA you're just getting absolutely
massive

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
massive

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.559 
massive
that's<00:02:12.109> for<00:02:12.409> the<00:02:12.469> weight<00:02:13.000> as<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.209> can<00:02:14.420> see

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
that's for the weight as you can see

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.750 
that's for the weight as you can see
from<00:02:14.659> the<00:02:14.840> shot<00:02:15.079> that's<00:02:15.170> quite<00:02:15.409> a<00:02:15.439> good

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
from the shot that's quite a good

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.309 
from the shot that's quite a good
illustration<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.879> how<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.090> CA<00:02:17.450> blades<00:02:17.989> a

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
illustration of how the CA blades a

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.949 
illustration of how the CA blades a
slightly<00:02:18.739> shorter<00:02:19.250> as<00:02:19.489> we've<00:02:20.180> explained<00:02:20.659> in
