some food army models that do they're

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.770 
some food army models that do they're
larger<00:00:52.449> I<00:00:52.659> think<00:00:53.229> like<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.530> military<00:00:53.799> or<00:00:54.549> that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780

larger I think like the military or that
gosh<00:00:55.780> I<00:00:55.989> did<00:00:56.139> a<00:00:56.170> review<00:00:56.559> on<00:00:56.620> one<00:00:57.069> and<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:57.429> can't

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
gosh I did a review on one and I can't

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.639 
gosh I did a review on one and I can't
remember<00:00:57.819> which<00:00:58.209> model<00:00:58.719> now<00:00:58.899> but<00:00:59.260> I<00:01:00.239> would<00:01:01.239> say

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
remember which model now but I would say

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.530 
remember which model now but I would say
because<00:01:02.649> that<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.069> knife<00:01:03.309> doesn't<00:01:03.789> lock<00:01:04.180> or

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
because that the knife doesn't lock or

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.030 
because that the knife doesn't lock or
the<00:01:04.660> blade<00:01:05.020> doesn't<00:01:05.260> lock<00:01:05.530> in<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.800> plate

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
the blade doesn't lock in the plate

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.520 
the blade doesn't lock in the plate
that's<00:01:06.760> a<00:01:06.850> great<00:01:07.120> teaching<00:01:07.570> opportunity<00:01:08.320> of

that's a great teaching opportunity of

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.510 
that's a great teaching opportunity of
proper<00:01:09.490> faith<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.720> Ike<00:01:10.780> handling<00:01:11.260> so<00:01:11.710> that's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
proper faith and Ike handling so that's

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.390
