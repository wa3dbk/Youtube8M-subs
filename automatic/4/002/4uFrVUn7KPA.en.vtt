actually get this little bit closer to
the<00:01:58.170> camera<00:01:58.320> hopefully<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.920> will<00:01:58.979> focus<00:01:59.250> in

there<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.030> think<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.630> pretty<00:02:00.840> cool<00:02:00.990> if<00:02:01.049> you

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
there I think be pretty cool if you

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.510 
there I think be pretty cool if you
could<00:02:01.259> actually<00:02:01.409> customize<00:02:01.979> what<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.340> says

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
could actually customize what it says

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280 
could actually customize what it says
right<00:02:02.549> here<00:02:02.790> add<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.719> your<00:02:03.899> youtube<00:02:04.259> name

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290

right here add like your youtube name
your<00:02:04.770> gamertag<00:02:05.100> something<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.729> I

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
your gamertag something like that I

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.039 
your gamertag something like that I
think<00:02:06.030> that'd<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.240> pretty<00:02:06.390> cool<00:02:06.509> maybe<00:02:06.810> that

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
think that'd be pretty cool maybe that

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.449 
think that'd be pretty cool maybe that
could<00:02:07.200> be<00:02:07.259> an<00:02:07.380> option<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> future<00:02:08.280> what

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
could be an option in the future what

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.309 
could be an option in the future what
not<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.450> that's<00:02:09.869> pretty<00:02:10.080> much<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319
