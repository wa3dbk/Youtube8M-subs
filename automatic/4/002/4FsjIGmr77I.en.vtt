00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.790
 the impression of being in a shuttle 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.250
 Space 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.440
 a dull acceleration of braking 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.160
 really something that I had 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.160
 never felt 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.450

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.030
 the event takes place between the two with 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.770
