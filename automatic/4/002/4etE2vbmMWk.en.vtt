the face and the background so we're

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.620 
the face and the background so we're
going<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.010> take<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.190> look<00:00:35.489> at<00:00:35.700> three<00:00:36.270> different

going to take a look at three different

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.630 
going to take a look at three different
ways<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:37.079> giving<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.829> image<00:00:38.129> back<00:00:38.340> into<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
ways of giving this image back into a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.270 
ways of giving this image back into a
usable<00:00:39.120> format<00:00:39.570> first<00:00:40.410> we're<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> use

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
usable format first we're going to use

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.600 
usable format first we're going to use

solution<00:00:45.510> which<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.739> found<00:00:46.950> by<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
solution which can be found by going to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.840 
solution which can be found by going to
the<00:00:48.030> toolbar<00:00:48.450> clicking<00:00:48.780> image<00:00:49.850> adjustments

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the toolbar clicking image adjustments

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.080 
the toolbar clicking image adjustments
and<00:00:51.030> then<00:00:51.629> auto<00:00:51.989> levels<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.640> see<00:00:53.820> this

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and then auto levels so you can see this

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.760 
and then auto levels so you can see this
is<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.660> great<00:00:54.899> improvement<00:00:55.079> over<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.739> original

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
is a great improvement over the original

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.610 
is a great improvement over the original
brings<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.780> light<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> face<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.590> can

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
brings that light into the face you can

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.069 
brings that light into the face you can
see<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> eye<00:00:59.010> color<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.489> little<00:00:59.820> bit<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.930> from

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
see the eye color a little bit but from

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.799 
see the eye color a little bit but from
my<00:01:01.170> perspective<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:02.039> still<00:01:02.449> not<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.570> good<00:01:03.690> as

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
my perspective it's still not as good as

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.359 
my perspective it's still not as good as
it<00:01:03.930> could<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> background<00:01:05.100> still

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
it could be and the background still

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.330 
it could be and the background still
falls<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.909> quite<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> bit<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.630> we're<00:01:06.750> going<00:01:06.900> to

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
falls out quite a bit so we're going to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.010 
falls out quite a bit so we're going to
undo<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.369> change<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.630> we're<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.900> look

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
undo that change and we're going to look

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.530 
undo that change and we're going to look
at<00:01:10.280> editing<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.700> levels<00:01:12.150> manually<00:01:12.920> which

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
at editing the levels manually which

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.630 
at editing the levels manually which
prior<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.009> back<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.280> days<00:01:17.430> of

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
prior to the back in the days of

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.780 
prior to the back in the days of
Photoshop<00:01:18.479> ps7<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:20.070> would<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.369> probably<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
Photoshop ps7 this would be probably the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.820 
Photoshop ps7 this would be probably the
primary<00:01:21.030> way<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.659> dealing<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.350> photograph

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
primary way of dealing with a photograph

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.980 
primary way of dealing with a photograph
like<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.240> we're<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.509> choose<00:01:24.689> image

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
like this so we're going to choose image

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.460 
like this so we're going to choose image
adjustment<00:01:25.950> levels<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:28.020> that'll<00:01:28.350> bring

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
adjustment levels and then that'll bring

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.890 
adjustment levels and then that'll bring
up<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:29.310> box<00:01:29.610> where<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> graph<00:01:30.540> that

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
up this box where we have a graph that

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.810 
up this box where we have a graph that
has<00:01:31.049> three<00:01:31.530> different<00:01:31.560> bars<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.610> can

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
has three different bars that we can

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.810 
has three different bars that we can
slider<00:01:33.720> bars<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.530> alter<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:35.549> want<00:01:35.729> to

take the one on the Left move it

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.319 
take the one on the Left move it
slightly<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.680> right<00:01:37.920> maybe<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.909> one

unit change we want to take the one on
the<00:01:41.610> far<00:01:41.820> right<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.540> bring<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.380> all<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> way

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
highlight and shadow areas which we can

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.330 
highlight and shadow areas which we can
see<00:01:57.090> by<00:01:57.990> moving<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.409> back<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.799> forth<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.250> you

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
see by moving it back and forth and you

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.830 
see by moving it back and forth and you
just<00:01:59.579> move<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.909> back<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.299> forth<00:02:00.390> until<00:02:00.780> you

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
just move that back and forth until you

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.000 
just move that back and forth until you
get<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.320> a
