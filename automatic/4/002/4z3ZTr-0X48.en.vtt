right into it first up let's talk about
how<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.189> CPU<00:00:08.940> players<00:00:09.269> will<00:00:09.599> work<00:00:09.809> on<00:00:10.050> your

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
how the CPU players will work on your

how the CPU players will work on your
team<00:00:11.300> 2k<00:00:12.300> made<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> smooth<00:00:13.019> move<00:00:13.440> here<00:00:13.740> all<00:00:13.980> cpu

they're<00:00:18.359> not<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.960> dominating<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
they're not going to be dominating the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.679 
they're not going to be dominating the
game<00:00:19.740> if<00:00:20.460> you've<00:00:20.699> ever<00:00:20.850> played<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.330> Jordan

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
game if you've ever played the Jordan

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.269 
game if you've ever played the Jordan
rec<00:00:21.840> center<00:00:22.140> for<00:00:22.320> example<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.890> somebody's

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
rec center for example and somebody's

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.400 
rec center for example and somebody's
dropped<00:00:23.609> out<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.060> other<00:00:24.210> team<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.720> lot<00:00:25.289> of

dropped out on the other team a lot of

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.410 
dropped out on the other team a lot of
times<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:26.310> actually<00:00:26.490> makes<00:00:26.910> their<00:00:27.180> team

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
times that actually makes their team

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.019 
times that actually makes their team
better<00:00:27.810> because<00:00:28.230> their<00:00:28.470> CPU<00:00:29.070> player<00:00:29.400> will

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
better because their CPU player will

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.569 
better because their CPU player will
grab<00:00:30.269> all<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.720> boards<00:00:31.380> he'll<00:00:31.980> make<00:00:32.279> all<00:00:32.550> of

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
grab all the boards he'll make all of

grab all the boards he'll make all of
this<00:00:32.820> shot<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.270> start<00:00:33.570> dominating<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.380> game

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
this shot so start dominating the game

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.830 
this shot so start dominating the game
he'll<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.460> jumping<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> passing<00:00:36.600> lanes

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
he'll be jumping the passing lanes

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.080 
he'll be jumping the passing lanes
getting<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.350> kind<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.739> stills<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.280> 2k<00:00:38.790> said

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
getting all kind of stills but 2k said

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.450 
getting all kind of stills but 2k said
in<00:00:39.270> their<00:00:39.480> live<00:00:39.719> stream<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.920> year<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
in their live stream that this year the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
in their live stream that this year the
CPU<00:00:41.940> players<00:00:42.239> are<00:00:42.480> not<00:00:42.629> going<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:42.989> very

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
CPU players are not going to be very

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.060 
CPU players are not going to be very
good<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:44.460> don't<00:00:45.030> want<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.480> have

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
good so you actually don't want to have

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.500 
good so you actually don't want to have
cpu<00:00:47.070> players<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.670> only<00:00:47.850> want<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.329> them

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
cpu players you only want to have them

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.760 
cpu players you only want to have them
if<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.719> don't<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:48.989> anybody<00:00:49.170> else<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.559> play

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
if you don't have anybody else to play

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.830 
if you don't have anybody else to play
with<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.730> definitely<00:00:51.000> don't<00:00:51.480> want<00:00:51.600> that

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
with but you definitely don't want that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.049 
with but you definitely don't want that
to<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.530> strategy<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.820> good

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
to be your strategy and this is good

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.560 
to be your strategy and this is good
because<00:00:54.090> online<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.280> past<00:00:56.579> defending<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
because online in the past defending the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.569 
because online in the past defending the
CPU<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.620> up<00:00:58.710> against<00:00:59.160> them<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
CPU and going up against them it's a

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.869 
CPU and going up against them it's a
pain<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.660> messes<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> flow<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.579> now

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
pain it just messes up the flow so now

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.660 
pain it just messes up the flow so now
human<00:01:03.660> players<00:01:03.960> will<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> clear

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
human players will have a clear

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.020 
human players will have a clear
advantage<00:01:06.439> online<00:01:07.460> going<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.549> against<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
advantage online going up against the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.550 
advantage online going up against the
cpu<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.810> don't<00:01:10.049> want<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.409> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
cpu so you don't want that you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.030 
cpu so you don't want that you
definitely<00:01:11.189> want<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.970> your<00:01:12.119> 5v5<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.530> i

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
definitely want to have your 5v5 and i

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.310 
definitely want to have your 5v5 and i
think<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> great<00:01:15.090> addition<00:01:15.570> now

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
think that is a great addition now

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.870 
think that is a great addition now
what's<00:01:16.560> interesting<00:01:16.799> about<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.580> they

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
what's interesting about this is they

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.910 
what's interesting about this is they
said<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.780> five<00:01:19.049> players<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.740> say

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
said if you do have five players and say

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.789 
said if you do have five players and say
one<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.220> your<00:01:20.369> players<00:01:20.610> lags<00:01:21.119> out<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:22.380> lagged

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
one of your players lags out that lagged

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.249 
one of your players lags out that lagged
out<00:01:23.009> player<00:01:23.369> supposedly<00:01:24.330> isn't<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.110> be

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
out player supposedly isn't going to be

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.240 
out player supposedly isn't going to be
playing<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> game<00:01:26.009> they're<00:01:26.189> gonna

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
playing the game they're gonna

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.609 
playing the game they're gonna
substitute<00:01:26.790> him<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.479> bring<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.900> some<00:01:28.470> other

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
substitute him and bring in some other

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.260 
substitute him and bring in some other
mediocre<00:01:29.400> player<00:01:29.610> that's<00:01:29.909> what<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.210> were

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
mediocre player that's what they were

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.020 
mediocre player that's what they were
hinting<00:01:30.900> at<00:01:31.110> when<00:01:32.009> they<00:01:32.130> were<00:01:32.189> discussing<00:01:32.909> how

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
hinting at when they were discussing how

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.490 
hinting at when they were discussing how
the<00:01:33.090> CPU<00:01:33.570> players<00:01:33.810> are<00:01:33.930> gonna<00:01:34.049> work<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the CPU players are gonna work and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.440 
the CPU players are gonna work and
that's<00:01:34.619> interesting<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:36.180> could<00:01:36.329> be

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that's interesting because that could be

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.300 
that's interesting because that could be
a<00:01:36.479> problem<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.350> some<00:01:37.619> 90<00:01:38.040> something

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
a problem if you have some 90 something

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.310 
a problem if you have some 90 something
ready<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> die<00:01:38.850> when<00:01:39.119> he<00:01:39.150> leads<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.869> quits<00:01:40.140> the

ready to die when he leads you quits the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.140 
ready to die when he leads you quits the
game<00:01:40.350> or<00:01:40.770> even<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.340> he<00:01:41.430> doesn't<00:01:41.579> quit<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> game

dominating<00:01:44.700> because<00:01:44.850> he's<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.060> CPU<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.409> even

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
dominating because he's the CPU but even

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.340 
dominating because he's the CPU but even
in<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.070> situation<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.720> still<00:01:49.020> not<00:01:49.200> going
