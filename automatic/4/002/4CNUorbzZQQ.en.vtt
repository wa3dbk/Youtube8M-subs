what's<00:00:07.140> going<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.530> gardeners<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:08.670> Kevin

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
what's going on gardeners this is Kevin

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.540 
what's going on gardeners this is Kevin
from<00:00:09.389> epic<00:00:09.750> gardening<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:11.100> mentioned<00:00:11.490> that

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
from epic gardening and I mentioned that

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.540 
from epic gardening and I mentioned that
I<00:00:11.700> did<00:00:12.270> have<00:00:12.480> an<00:00:12.690> aqua<00:00:13.140> farm<00:00:13.350> from<00:00:13.890> back<00:00:14.220> to<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.550 
I did have an aqua farm from back to the

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.210 
I did have an aqua farm from back to the
roots<00:00:15.260> dot-com<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.619> that's<00:00:16.830> what<00:00:16.950> this<00:00:17.040> is

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
roots dot-com and that's what this is

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.130 
roots dot-com and that's what this is
right<00:00:17.400> here<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.420> actually<00:00:18.779> my<00:00:18.869> first

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
right here so this is actually my first

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.970 
right here so this is actually my first
venture<00:00:19.529> into<00:00:20.869> proper<00:00:21.869> aquaponics<00:00:22.529> which<00:00:22.619> if

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
venture into proper aquaponics which if

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.390 
venture into proper aquaponics which if
you're<00:00:23.099> unfamiliar<00:00:23.520> is<00:00:23.849> using<00:00:24.540> fish<00:00:24.989> and

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
you're unfamiliar is using fish and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.909 
you're unfamiliar is using fish and
plants<00:00:26.400> together<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.380> basically<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.470> symbiotic

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
plants together in basically a symbiotic

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.540 
plants together in basically a symbiotic
cycle<00:00:29.669> so<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.480> fish<00:00:31.020> excrete<00:00:31.680> waste<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
cycle so the fish excrete waste that the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.810 
cycle so the fish excrete waste that the
plants<00:00:33.030> use<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.899> nutrients<00:00:34.560> and<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
plants use as nutrients and in the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.939 
plants use as nutrients and in the
process<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:37.170> plants<00:00:37.440> using<00:00:37.620> them<00:00:37.829> as

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
process of the plants using them as

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:39.680 
process of the plants using them as
nutrients<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.850> actually<00:00:39.210> cleans<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.660> water

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
nutrients it actually cleans the water

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.990 
nutrients it actually cleans the water
so<00:00:40.199> the<00:00:40.289> plants<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.039> filter<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
so the plants are the filter if you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.389 
so the plants are the filter if you
think<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.510> an<00:00:42.600> aquarium<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.980> fish

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
think of it as an aquarium and the fish

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.250 
think of it as an aquarium and the fish
are<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.000> nutrients<00:00:45.449> if<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.109> as

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
are the nutrients if you think of it as

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.700 
are the nutrients if you think of it as
a<00:00:46.289> hydroponic<00:00:46.949> system<00:00:47.149> so<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.570> actually<00:00:49.410> had<00:00:49.679> a

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
a hydroponic system so I actually had a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.229 
a hydroponic system so I actually had a
little<00:00:49.829> bit<00:00:49.949> of<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.190> mishap<00:00:50.429> with<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.910> fish

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
little bit of a mishap with the fish

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.639 
little bit of a mishap with the fish
that<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> purchased<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.109> I<00:00:52.170> need<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> go<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.589> a

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
that I purchased so I need to go get a

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.819 
that I purchased so I need to go get a
new<00:00:52.920> one<00:00:53.100> because<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:55.109> I<00:00:55.140> did<00:00:55.440> is

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
new one because I think what I did is

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.770 
new one because I think what I did is
the<00:00:56.190> temperature<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> water<00:00:57.179> was<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.539> bit

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the temperature of the water was a bit

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.389 
the temperature of the water was a bit
too<00:00:57.929> warm<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.499> the<00:00:58.589> fish<00:00:58.800> couldn't<00:00:59.129> handle<00:00:59.339> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
too warm and the fish couldn't handle it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.599 
too warm and the fish couldn't handle it
so<00:00:59.460> unfortunately<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.359> fish<00:01:00.600> passed<00:01:00.960> away

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
so unfortunately the fish passed away

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.070 
so unfortunately the fish passed away
100%<00:01:02.609> my<00:01:02.699> fault<00:01:02.940> there<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.480> figured<00:01:03.960> why

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
100% my fault there but I figured why

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.930 
100% my fault there but I figured why
not<00:01:04.110> give<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.530> tour<00:01:04.800> of<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.640> system

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
not give you a tour of what the system

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.510 
not give you a tour of what the system
is<00:01:05.970> all<00:01:06.180> about<00:01:06.300> so<00:01:07.010> I've<00:01:08.010> already<00:01:08.250> opened<00:01:08.340> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
is all about so I've already opened it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.060 
is all about so I've already opened it
up<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.420> box<00:01:09.660> that<00:01:09.870> it<00:01:09.990> comes<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.410> is<00:01:10.740> pretty

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
up the box that it comes in is pretty

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.460 
up the box that it comes in is pretty
cool<00:01:11.280> pretty<00:01:11.490> well<00:01:11.700> designed<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.470> here's

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
cool pretty well designed but here's

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.590 
cool pretty well designed but here's
what<00:01:13.590> comes<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.250> first<00:01:15.120> off<00:01:15.360> let's<00:01:15.540> talk

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
what comes in it so first off let's talk

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.180 
what comes in it so first off let's talk
about<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> stuff<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.380> get<00:01:16.530> fish<00:01:16.830> prep

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
about the stuff that you get fish prep

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.670 
about the stuff that you get fish prep
I've<00:01:18.120> unfortunately<00:01:18.540> already<00:01:19.050> used<00:01:19.410> this<00:01:19.500> I'm

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
I've unfortunately already used this I'm

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.500 
I've unfortunately already used this I'm
going<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:19.860> need<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.010> get<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.160> new<00:01:20.370> one<00:01:20.550> it

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
going to need to get a new one it

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.180 
going to need to get a new one it
basically<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:21.930> cleans<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> fish<00:01:22.740> make<00:01:23.040> sure

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
basically just cleans the fish make sure

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.850 
basically just cleans the fish make sure
that<00:01:23.340> no<00:01:23.430> disease<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.000> transferred<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:25.710> I'm

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
that no disease is transferred this I'm

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.460 
that no disease is transferred this I'm
back<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.400> beneficial<00:01:26.940> bacteria<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.780> basically

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
back is beneficial bacteria it basically

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.490 
back is beneficial bacteria it basically
is<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.830> starter<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.630> system<00:01:31.110> because

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
is the starter for the system because

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.860 
is the starter for the system because
when<00:01:31.710> you're<00:01:31.830> doing<00:01:31.980> an<00:01:32.280> aquaponic<00:01:32.910> setup<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
when you're doing an aquaponic setup you

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.690 
when you're doing an aquaponic setup you
need<00:01:34.020> beneficial<00:01:34.590> bacteria<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:35.280> there<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
need beneficial bacteria in there to

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.630 
need beneficial bacteria in there to
convert<00:01:36.240> fish<00:01:36.690> waste<00:01:36.980> into<00:01:37.980> the<00:01:38.190> nitrates

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
convert fish waste into the nitrates

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.420 
convert fish waste into the nitrates
that<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:39.180> plants<00:01:39.750> actually<00:01:39.930> use<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:41.310> you've

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that the plants actually use then you've

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.680 
that the plants actually use then you've
got<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.640> fish<00:01:41.850> food<00:01:42.060> I'll<00:01:42.270> show<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> this

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
got the fish food I'll show you this

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.650 
got the fish food I'll show you this
actually<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:44.490> somewhere<00:01:45.210> else<00:01:45.270> right<00:01:45.630> now

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
actually it's somewhere else right now

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.780 
actually it's somewhere else right now
but<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.410> extremely<00:01:46.890> small<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.610> use<00:01:47.760> a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
but it's extremely small and you use a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.030 
but it's extremely small and you use a
betta<00:01:48.030> fish<00:01:48.150> and<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.200> betta<00:01:49.350> fish<00:01:49.440> apparently

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
betta fish and the betta fish apparently

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.400 
betta fish and the betta fish apparently
has<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.730> stomach<00:01:51.150> as<00:01:51.270> big<00:01:51.480> as<00:01:51.600> its<00:01:51.750> eyeball<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
has a stomach as big as its eyeball and

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
they give it to you is because you

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.270 
they give it to you is because you

waste otherwise the tanks gonna

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.140 
waste otherwise the tanks gonna

accumulate too much fish waste and to

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.210 
accumulate too much fish waste and to

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.370 
get basil or any other type of herb
going<00:03:37.720> then<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.530> can<00:03:38.709> actually<00:03:38.920> replace<00:03:39.370> that

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
going then you can actually replace that

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.990 
going then you can actually replace that
but<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.650> is<00:03:41.770> a<00:03:41.800> good<00:03:41.950> idea<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.310> use<00:03:42.459> that<00:03:42.489> at<00:03:42.850> the

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
but it is a good idea to use that at the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.630 
but it is a good idea to use that at the
start<00:03:43.290> here's<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.440> décor<00:03:44.890> in<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.400> back<00:03:45.610> here

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
start here's the décor in the back here

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.810 
start here's the décor in the back here
just<00:03:46.570> simple<00:03:46.840> little<00:03:46.930> bottle<00:03:47.320> alright<00:03:48.070> so<00:03:48.340> the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
just simple little bottle alright so the

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.370 
just simple little bottle alright so the
actual<00:03:49.239> nuts<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.660> bolts<00:03:49.840> of<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.020> system

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
actual nuts and bolts of the system

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.580 
actual nuts and bolts of the system
right<00:03:50.980> here<00:03:51.280> you've<00:03:51.489> got<00:03:51.700> five<00:03:52.120> net<00:03:52.420> cups<00:03:52.690> with

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
right here you've got five net cups with

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.750 
right here you've got five net cups with
the<00:03:53.770> gross<00:03:53.980> tones<00:03:54.250> it's<00:03:54.459> actually<00:03:54.730> a

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
the gross tones it's actually a

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.920 
the gross tones it's actually a
different<00:03:55.120> type<00:03:55.239> of<00:03:55.270> grosser<00:03:55.540> than<00:03:55.690> what<00:03:55.840> I'm

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
different type of grosser than what I'm

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.930 
different type of grosser than what I'm
used<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.290> it's<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.590> little<00:03:56.800> bit<00:03:56.920> lighter<00:03:57.160> a

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
used to it's a little bit lighter a

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.660 
used to it's a little bit lighter a
little<00:03:58.239> bit<00:03:58.480> smaller<00:03:58.810> so<00:03:59.110> that<00:04:00.100> just<00:04:00.280> fits<00:04:00.489> in

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
little bit smaller so that just fits in

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.630 
little bit smaller so that just fits in
just<00:04:01.209> like<00:04:01.360> that<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:03.250> can<00:04:03.370> see<00:04:03.520> I've

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
just like that you can see I've

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.860 
just like that you can see I've
sprinkled<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.120> wheatgrass<00:04:04.390> some<00:04:04.660> of<00:04:04.780> it

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
sprinkled the wheatgrass some of it

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.600 
sprinkled the wheatgrass some of it
started<00:04:05.110> to<00:04:05.230> sprout<00:04:05.560> unfortunately<00:04:06.520> I'm

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
started to sprout unfortunately I'm

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.979 
started to sprout unfortunately I'm
probably<00:04:06.820> gonna<00:04:07.090> have<00:04:07.270> to<00:04:07.330> ditch<00:04:07.570> this<00:04:07.810> batch

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
probably gonna have to ditch this batch

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.449 
probably gonna have to ditch this batch
because<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:08.470> don't<00:04:08.620> have<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:08.800> fish<00:04:09.040> in<00:04:09.070> there<00:04:09.310> to

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
because I don't have a fish in there to

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.449 
because I don't have a fish in there to
create<00:04:09.730> nutrients<00:04:10.450> for<00:04:10.750> this<00:04:10.989> weed<00:04:11.980> grass<00:04:12.190> and

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
create nutrients for this weed grass and

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.460 
create nutrients for this weed grass and
for<00:04:12.580> this<00:04:12.700> basil

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
for this basil

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.370 
for this basil
well<00:04:14.470> let's<00:04:14.620> pop<00:04:14.920> open<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.400> tank<00:04:15.610> just<00:04:15.760> to<00:04:15.880> see

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
well let's pop open the tank just to see

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.349 
well let's pop open the tank just to see
pretty<00:04:17.380> self-explanatory<00:04:17.970> very<00:04:18.970> small

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
pretty self-explanatory very small

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.970 
pretty self-explanatory very small
little<00:04:19.630> pump<00:04:19.840> with<00:04:20.080> tubing<00:04:20.530> to<00:04:20.680> pump<00:04:20.890> the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
little pump with tubing to pump the

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.520 
little pump with tubing to pump the
water<00:04:21.100> up<00:04:21.340> into<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:21.940> reservoir<00:04:22.330> up<00:04:22.450> here<00:04:22.720> you

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
water up into the reservoir up here you

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.050 
water up into the reservoir up here you
can<00:04:23.680> see<00:04:23.860> that<00:04:24.100> goes<00:04:24.280> there<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.790> then<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:24.970> way

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
can see that goes there and then the way

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.900 
can see that goes there and then the way
that<00:04:25.090> would<00:04:25.330> actually<00:04:25.630> work<00:04:25.840> is<00:04:26.550> if<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.700> can

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
that would actually work is if I can

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.409 
that would actually work is if I can
grab<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:29.039> it<00:04:30.039> actually<00:04:30.160> just<00:04:30.550> kind<00:04:30.760> of<00:04:30.820> slides

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
grab it it actually just kind of slides

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.590 
grab it it actually just kind of slides
in<00:04:31.660> right<00:04:31.930> there

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
in right there

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.530 
in right there
and<00:04:33.140> starts<00:04:33.410> to<00:04:33.500> pump<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.800> water<00:04:33.920> through<00:04:34.540> and

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
and starts to pump the water through and

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.570 
and starts to pump the water through and
then<00:04:35.660> we<00:04:36.290> can<00:04:36.410> plug<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:36.710> in<00:04:36.830> right<00:04:36.950> here<00:04:36.980> you

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
then we can plug it in right here you

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.470 
then we can plug it in right here you
see<00:04:37.820> how<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.030> works

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
see how it works

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.850 
see how it works
there<00:04:38.780> you<00:04:38.900> go<00:04:39.050> you<00:04:39.350> can<00:04:39.470> see<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.620> water

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
there you go you can see the water

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.070 
there you go you can see the water
starting<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.250> flood<00:04:40.460> up<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:40.850> it'll<00:04:41.780> flood<00:04:41.960> up

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
starting to flood up and it'll flood up

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.950 
starting to flood up and it'll flood up
to<00:04:42.200> the<00:04:42.290> point<00:04:42.560> of<00:04:42.760> these<00:04:43.760> right<00:04:44.270> here<00:04:44.630> where

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
to the point of these right here where

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.530 
to the point of these right here where
it<00:04:45.020> will<00:04:45.110> drain<00:04:45.410> off<00:04:46.090> so<00:04:47.090> it's<00:04:47.240> really<00:04:47.420> a

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
it will drain off so it's really a

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.480 
it will drain off so it's really a
simple<00:04:47.870> aquaponic<00:04:48.560> system<00:04:48.860> it's<00:04:49.010> best<00:04:49.220> you

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
simple aquaponic system it's best you

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.090 
simple aquaponic system it's best you
can<00:04:49.610> really<00:04:49.940> think<00:04:50.060> of<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.330> as<00:04:50.420> just<00:04:50.450> like<00:04:50.720> a

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
can really think of it as just like a

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.670 
can really think of it as just like a
continual<00:04:52.100> flood<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:52.550> drain<00:04:52.930> with<00:04:53.930> fish's

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
continual flood and drain with fish's

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.290 
continual flood and drain with fish's
nutrient<00:04:55.070> source<00:04:55.280> that's<00:04:55.670> really<00:04:55.910> all<00:04:56.090> that

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
nutrient source that's really all that

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.510 
nutrient source that's really all that
it<00:04:56.390> is<00:04:56.570> so<00:04:57.350> this<00:04:57.470> would<00:04:57.650> fit<00:04:57.830> on<00:04:57.950> top

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
it is so this would fit on top

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.550 
it is so this would fit on top
eventually<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.690> roots<00:04:59.870> would<00:05:00.020> drop<00:05:00.290> down

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
eventually the roots would drop down

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.120 
eventually the roots would drop down
into<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:00.980> system<00:05:01.540> right<00:05:02.540> in<00:05:02.690> there<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.130> you

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
into the system right in there and you

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.220 
into the system right in there and you
have<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.610> whole<00:05:04.760> thing<00:05:04.970> going<00:05:05.300> so<00:05:05.570> I<00:05:05.840> just

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
have the whole thing going so I just

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.540 
have the whole thing going so I just
wanted<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.500> give<00:05:06.620> this<00:05:06.770> quick<00:05:06.980> tour

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
wanted to give this quick tour

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.400 
wanted to give this quick tour
it's<00:05:07.700> the<00:05:07.880> aqua<00:05:08.210> farm<00:05:08.420> you<00:05:08.870> can<00:05:08.990> actually<00:05:09.260> grab

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
it's the aqua farm you can actually grab

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.200 
it's the aqua farm you can actually grab
it<00:05:09.530> on<00:05:09.620> Amazon<00:05:10.040> or<00:05:10.070> back<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:10.580> roots<00:05:10.760> calm

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
it on Amazon or back to the roots calm

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.780

the<00:05:17.660> blog<00:05:17.810> post<00:05:17.840> about<00:05:18.320> it<00:05:18.380> and<00:05:18.740> you<00:05:19.190> can

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
the blog post about it and you can

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.590 
the blog post about it and you can
expect<00:05:19.580> me<00:05:19.670> to<00:05:19.730> grab<00:05:19.910> a<00:05:19.940> new<00:05:20.120> beta<00:05:20.360> and

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
expect me to grab a new beta and

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.920 
expect me to grab a new beta and
hopefully<00:05:21.230> not<00:05:22.030> accidentally<00:05:23.030> kill<00:05:23.270> him<00:05:23.450> this

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
hopefully not accidentally kill him this

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.040 
hopefully not accidentally kill him this
time<00:05:23.990> that<00:05:24.650> would<00:05:24.740> be<00:05:24.860> really<00:05:25.370> helpful<00:05:25.490> for<00:05:25.700> me

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
time that would be really helpful for me

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.000 
time that would be really helpful for me
but<00:05:27.050> I'll<00:05:27.140> be<00:05:27.230> doing<00:05:27.320> to<00:05:27.470> grow<00:05:27.620> along<00:05:27.860> with

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
but I'll be doing to grow along with

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.250 
but I'll be doing to grow along with
this<00:05:28.190> so<00:05:28.820> if<00:05:28.940> you're<00:05:29.090> really<00:05:29.480> curious<00:05:29.870> about

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
this so if you're really curious about

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.540 
this so if you're really curious about
aquaponics<00:05:30.560> and<00:05:30.950> how<00:05:31.130> you<00:05:31.190> would<00:05:31.460> start

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
aquaponics and how you would start

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.910 
aquaponics and how you would start
getting<00:05:31.910> into<00:05:32.120> it<00:05:32.210> I<00:05:32.450> don't<00:05:33.350> really<00:05:33.590> see<00:05:33.890> a

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
getting into it I don't really see a

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.440 
getting into it I don't really see a
more<00:05:34.190> basic<00:05:34.490> way<00:05:34.850> than<00:05:35.060> this<00:05:35.180> especially

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
more basic way than this especially

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.450 
more basic way than this especially
because<00:05:35.780> it's<00:05:36.080> about<00:05:36.230> 70<00:05:36.770> bucks<00:05:36.980> which<00:05:37.280> is

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
because it's about 70 bucks which is

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.130 
because it's about 70 bucks which is
pretty<00:05:37.730> cheap<00:05:37.790> it's<00:05:38.210> way<00:05:38.510> cheaper<00:05:38.540> than<00:05:38.930> you

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
pretty cheap it's way cheaper than you

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.360 
pretty cheap it's way cheaper than you
would<00:05:39.260> probably<00:05:39.500> be<00:05:39.530> able<00:05:39.590> to<00:05:39.740> do<00:05:39.890> it<00:05:39.980> yourself

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
would probably be able to do it yourself

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.360 
would probably be able to do it yourself
so<00:05:41.150> give<00:05:41.870> it<00:05:41.900> a<00:05:41.990> shot<00:05:42.020> if<00:05:42.320> you<00:05:42.410> want<00:05:42.590> to<00:05:42.800> if<00:05:42.980> not

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
so give it a shot if you want to if not

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.710 
so give it a shot if you want to if not
that's<00:05:43.610> cool<00:05:43.730> but<00:05:44.150> I'm<00:05:44.240> still<00:05:44.390> gonna<00:05:44.480> be<00:05:44.630> doing

that's cool but I'm still gonna be doing

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.600 
that's cool but I'm still gonna be doing
