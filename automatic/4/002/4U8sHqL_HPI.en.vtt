00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.880 
here's the view of the subwoofer and it
has<00:01:51.760> the<00:01:52.060> port<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.780> make<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.200> sound<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.680> little

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
has the port to make the sound a little

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.880 
has the port to make the sound a little
better<00:01:54.670> it's<00:01:55.030> not<00:01:55.390> right<00:01:55.659> like<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:55.930> said<00:01:56.170> this

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
better it's not right like I said this

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.240 
better it's not right like I said this
chair<00:01:57.160> does<00:01:57.370> fold<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:57.850> half<00:01:58.560> which<00:01:59.560> makes<00:01:59.979> it

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
chair does fold in half which makes it

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.730 
chair does fold in half which makes it
easier<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.360> move<00:02:01.540> in<00:02:01.720> stores<00:02:02.050> down<00:02:02.410> here<00:02:02.650> at

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
easier to move in stores down here at

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.540 
easier to move in stores down here at
the<00:02:02.860> bottom<00:02:03.180> there<00:02:04.180> is<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.390> pin<00:02:04.869> that<00:02:05.550> releases

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
the bottom there is a pin that releases

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.100 
the bottom there is a pin that releases
I<00:02:06.670> didn't<00:02:06.850> have<00:02:06.940> some<00:02:07.119> trouble<00:02:07.450> getting<00:02:07.479> in<00:02:07.990> it

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
I didn't have some trouble getting in it

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.330 
I didn't have some trouble getting in it
first<00:02:08.350> if<00:02:09.070> you<00:02:09.250> release<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:09.580> pin<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:11.350> it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
first if you release that pin and it

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.449 
first if you release that pin and it
folds<00:02:12.640> in<00:02:12.730> half<00:02:12.760> quite<00:02:13.209> nicely<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.280> does

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
folds in half quite nicely and it does

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.510 
folds in half quite nicely and it does
make<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.790> it's<00:02:16.300> still<00:02:16.600> quite<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.080> big<00:02:17.410> chair<00:02:17.770> but

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
make it it's still quite a big chair but

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.800 
make it it's still quite a big chair but
it<00:02:18.640> doesn't<00:02:18.880> make<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.150> little<00:02:19.330> easier<00:02:19.690> to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
it doesn't make it a little easier to

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.520 
it doesn't make it a little easier to
move<00:02:19.959> around<00:02:21.660> okay<00:02:22.660> now<00:02:22.810> we'll<00:02:23.020> look<00:02:23.170> at<00:02:23.410> all

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
move around okay now we'll look at all

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.050 
move around okay now we'll look at all
the<00:02:23.680> cords<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.220> everything<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:24.670> came<00:02:24.790> with

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
the cords and everything that came with

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.660 
the cords and everything that came with
this<00:02:25.810> cord<00:02:26.110> right<00:02:26.140> here<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.709> what<00:02:27.040> hurt<00:02:27.220> hooks

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
this cord right here is what hurt hooks

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.690 
this cord right here is what hurt hooks
from<00:02:28.000> your<00:02:28.180> TV<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.200> chair<00:02:29.620> here<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
from your TV to the chair here is the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.810 
from your TV to the chair here is the
audio<00:02:30.900> output<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.290> goes<00:02:32.440> from<00:02:32.620> your<00:02:32.709> TV<00:02:33.010> and

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
audio output that goes from your TV and

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.490 
audio output that goes from your TV and
I<00:02:33.880> say<00:02:34.090> it's<00:02:34.209> probably<00:02:34.450> about<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.630> six<00:02:34.989> or<00:02:35.170> seven

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
I say it's probably about a six or seven

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.710 
I say it's probably about a six or seven
foot<00:02:35.739> long<00:02:35.920> cord<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:36.910> can<00:02:37.150> see<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.510> quite<00:02:37.690> a

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
foot long cord so you can see it quite a

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.870 
foot long cord so you can see it quite a
ways<00:02:37.900> away<00:02:38.140> from<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.470> TV<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.040> then<00:02:39.670> this

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
ways away from the TV and then this

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.030 
ways away from the TV and then this
green<00:02:40.209> one<00:02:40.450> which<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.050> color-coded<00:02:41.410> this

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
green one which is color-coded this

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.470 
green one which is color-coded this
plugs<00:02:42.310> right<00:02:42.519> into<00:02:42.730> here<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:45.100> also<00:02:45.250> has<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
plugs right into here it also has the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.050 
plugs right into here it also has the
wall<00:02:46.690> outlet<00:02:46.959> so<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:47.800> have<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.250> be<00:02:48.430> maybe<00:02:48.700> six

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
wall outlet so you have to be maybe six

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.550 
wall outlet so you have to be maybe six
feet<00:02:49.269> away<00:02:49.360> from<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.690> wall<00:02:49.900> which<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.350> some

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
feet away from a wall which for some

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.620 
feet away from a wall which for some
people<00:02:50.860> might<00:02:51.100> not<00:02:51.130> work<00:02:51.400> out<00:02:51.640> too<00:02:51.670> well<00:02:51.910> if

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
people might not work out too well if

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.840 
people might not work out too well if
you<00:02:52.810> are<00:02:52.959> in<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.140> very<00:02:53.350> large<00:02:53.590> room<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.580> you<00:02:54.670> plug

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
you are in a very large room so you plug

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.750 
you are in a very large room so you plug
this<00:02:55.150> into<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.019> wall<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.590> then<00:02:57.010> right<00:02:57.549> into

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760
