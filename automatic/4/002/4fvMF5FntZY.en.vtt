and<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.780> I'm<00:01:24.900> not<00:01:25.049> mistaken<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:26.009> upcoming

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
and if I'm not mistaken this upcoming

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.140 
and if I'm not mistaken this upcoming
2015<00:01:27.330> III<00:01:27.869> will<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.560> hosted<00:01:29.009> jun<00:01:29.400> 16th<00:01:30.000> through

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
2015 III will be hosted jun 16th through

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.870 
2015 III will be hosted jun 16th through
the<00:01:30.360> 18th<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.710> goes<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.009> say<00:01:32.310> beta<00:01:32.610> is

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the 18th then it goes on to say beta is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.179 
the 18th then it goes on to say beta is
beta<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.079> assuming<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> beta

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
beta so that's assuming that the beta

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.700 
beta so that's assuming that the beta
will<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.670> coming<00:01:35.939> after<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.509> 2015<00:01:37.229> III

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
will be coming after this 2015 III

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.499 
will be coming after this 2015 III
convention<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> tweet<00:01:39.270> says<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
convention and then the tweet says a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.020 
convention and then the tweet says a
game's<00:01:39.900> con<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.439> nearly<00:01:40.920> finished<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.670> I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
game's con is nearly finished and I

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
game's con is nearly finished and I
could<00:01:42.270> be<00:01:42.450> wrong<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.049> think<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.470> game's

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
could be wrong but I think that game's

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.889 
could be wrong but I think that game's
con<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.369> sometime<00:01:44.909> between<00:01:45.090> August<00:01:45.659> ninth

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
con is sometime between August ninth

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.139 
con is sometime between August ninth
through<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> 12<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.220> definitely<00:01:47.670> sometime<00:01:48.030> in

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
through the 12 so definitely sometime in

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.210 
through the 12 so definitely sometime in
the<00:01:48.210> August<00:01:48.600> time<00:01:48.840> realm<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.860> saying

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the August time realm so this is saying

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.730 
the August time realm so this is saying
that<00:01:50.670> III<00:01:51.090> will<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.299> coming<00:01:51.540> first<00:01:51.840> then<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
that III will be coming first then the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.800 
that III will be coming first then the

the<00:03:29.269> Ember<00:03:29.569> teaser<00:03:29.840> spans<00:03:30.680> through<00:03:31.009> I<00:03:31.040> believe

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
the Ember teaser spans through I believe

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.360 
the Ember teaser spans through I believe
nineteen<00:03:31.939> ninety<00:03:32.599> all<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.959> way<00:03:33.049> up<00:03:33.199> to<00:03:33.229> 20<00:03:33.739> 65

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
nineteen ninety all the way up to 20 65

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.879 
nineteen ninety all the way up to 20 65
and<00:03:34.729> all<00:03:35.329> of<00:03:35.509> us<00:03:35.599> is<00:03:35.750> occurring<00:03:36.169> in<00:03:36.349> different

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
and all of us is occurring in different

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.219 
and all of us is occurring in different
years<00:03:37.099> and<00:03:37.459> in<00:03:37.609> different<00:03:37.759> time<00:03:38.120> periods<00:03:38.629> so

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:39.229 
years and in different time periods so

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.559 
years and in different time periods so
again<00:03:39.680> this<00:03:39.829> is<00:03:39.979> absolutely<00:03:40.790> no<00:03:40.970> coincidence

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
again this is absolutely no coincidence

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.110 
again this is absolutely no coincidence
the<00:03:42.019> number<00:03:42.319> six<00:03:42.650> dot<00:03:43.040> 21<00:03:43.459> has<00:03:43.759> to<00:03:43.970> mean

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
the number six dot 21 has to mean

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.330 
the number six dot 21 has to mean
something<00:03:44.229> so<00:03:45.229> given<00:03:45.769> that<00:03:45.799> we<00:03:46.009> have<00:03:46.040> the

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
something so given that we have the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.129 
something so given that we have the
tweet<00:03:46.519> from<00:03:46.669> david<00:03:47.000> vonderhaar<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.720> the

tweet from david vonderhaar and the

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.920 
tweet from david vonderhaar and the
number<00:03:48.439> six<00:03:48.859> to<00:03:49.370> one<00:03:49.639> in<00:03:49.819> the<00:03:49.970> Ember<00:03:50.299> teaser<00:03:50.569> it

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
number six to one in the Ember teaser it

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.719 
number six to one in the Ember teaser it
is<00:03:51.319> very<00:03:51.560> possible<00:03:51.829> that<00:03:52.370> we<00:03:52.639> could

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:52.729 
is very possible that we could

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.640 
is very possible that we could
potentially<00:03:53.239> be<00:03:53.329> seeing<00:03:53.599> be<00:03:53.959> black<00:03:54.199> ops<00:03:54.470> the
