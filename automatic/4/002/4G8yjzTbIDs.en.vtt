00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello very good to all youtube people 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.140
 here the vice gamer me and I will show you 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.599
 some curiosities and even the ex of 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.790
 famous game and much loved by many if 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.650
 I'm talking about bully a title 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.750
 awesome which every time what 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.270
 we play we can not help thinking about the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.460
 saga grand theft auto 'but I'll save myself 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.850
 criticisms so let's proceed with the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.850
 video 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.539
 well let's start with something very easy 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.369
 let's start with the typical references 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.829
 that rockstar puts at his own game 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.989
 as for example they are visited in local and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.390
 dragset which in Spanish means drugs 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.969
 easy has a logo very similar to that of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.250
 rockstar in the basement of the local 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.320
 comics dragon swing comics we can see 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.239
 some hanging toy ships that look 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.809
 suspiciously similar to those of 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.809
 game starfox 64 x must also in that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.940
 basement we find many things a book 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.159
 entitled how to attract ladies the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.949
 nets need love too but what 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.989
 xd assholes of a very curious thing is 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.090
 that when we give the 6 transistors 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.340
 to the vagabond this weapon something not 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.009
 we can see immediately is abducted 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.560
 by aliens this generated controversy for the 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.659
 fans and there are many videos analyzing this 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.939
 also in this video I will mention other 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.770
 jazztel ex that generated controversy and I will see 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.170
 if I can analyze them in another video 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.960
 there is also a book called a guide 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.450
 coding for complete nuts too 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.700
 a joystick is found next to a pc 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.140
 and a portable console similar to the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.240
 micro game boy 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.310
 notice that the recurring symbol in 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.130
 bull worth academy is a fist in front 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.290
 in this part of the map we find a 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.540
 ship half sunk and someone dressed 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.940
 of pirate the funny thing is that if 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.250
 we lie down they give us a pirate costume xd 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.560
 I think that when we finish the game they give us 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.150
 a photo in the album which is the only 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.070
 once we see the face of your new 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.619
 stepfather in the photo or postcard that 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.750
 send the mother in this part of blue ski 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.310
 it is industrial part we find a house 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.770
 particular since if we place ourselves 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.960
 glued to the door sounds 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.509
 of pork and a chainsaw which 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.399
 obviously it makes us think of pixie one 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.679
 of the heads of the sea together one another 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.209
 rockstar game and curiously one of 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.209
 the most expensive ones that can be unlocked 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.370
 is a pig also in the mission 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.680
 assault on the fortress when so we 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.860
 says the code of the door this one turns out 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.910
 be 1,138 and it's a nod to the movie of 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.920
 george lucas thx 1138 in block c of the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.570
 Asylum up and balls asylum there is a 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.430
 radiography on the floor with what 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.620
 it looks like the head of an alien and a 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.230
 skeleton also with a pretty skull 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.800
 not human we could assume that only 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.570
 is a 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.460
 little finished model but in the 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.950
 room design already and another skeleton and 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.050
 we see that the disguise that is 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.000
 use jimmy during the mission halloween is 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.790
 a nod to those who use cobra cais 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.920
 in the movie karate kid the clock of the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.600
 Tom Hall Hall is always nailed 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.050
 at almost the time of the one that appears on the 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.270
 movie of going back to the future werewolf 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.830
 it is a lamentably false myth and it 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.680
 propagated because one of the x-rays 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.330
 in the api bags and looks little human with 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.300
 a rare head and with the column 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.680
 vertebral horizontal like a quadruped 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.780
 it was also speculated that Gary Smith 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.610
 could be that lycanthrope because he had 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.350
 a scar on the face just like 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.170
 has the wolf mask that can be 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.090
 get the arcade future video game 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.150
 street racer that in Spanish means 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.740
 future runner or something like that x de luce 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.350
 as a tribute to the racing 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.130
 futurists of the nintendo 64 as per 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.290
 example wipeout 64 and aero gauge when 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.510
 we hide in a basket sometimes 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.040
 rectors tell us the common phrase eats 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.460
 out or play that in Spanish means 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.470
 let's go out and play and it's a classic line 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.290
 from the movie the warriors casual 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.510
 also a rockstar game when 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.280
 we practice boxing the location of the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.130
 camera and that the simi body is 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.450
 make and transparent make us remember 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.180
 inevitably the classic super punch 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.650
 out in the mission phono use funk in a 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.690
 part we have to go through a 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.550
 simulated cemetery full of traps and 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.380
 the appearance of the place and the location of 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.390
 the camera that transforms it into a scroll 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.670
 horizontal seems to indicate a tribute 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.830
 something sustainable wins one of the costumes 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.620
 quirky that we can unlock is 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.810
 the eightieth that rock road fit attire 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.700
 of musicians from air metal bands and by 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.040
 so maybe it's a nod to the 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.400
 vice city lobbies most of the 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.230
 Patents on cars say bbr 529 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.240
 same as the blues mobile of the 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.520
 movie the blues brothers when 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.830
 we attend a workshop class we see in 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.770
 that workshop to two cars from the gt to a 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.600
 regina and a devil stallion the manager 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.640
 cleaning the school store 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.919
 He usually says strange things and if we look 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.260
 carefully his face resembles that of the 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.180
 poster of the movie creepy watcher that 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.250
 it looks at the hollywood cinema word voucher 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.380
 in bulworth town there is a local 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.070
 automotive parts called sweet 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.650
 digging 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.950
 means sweet life obvious allusion to the 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.950
 vagina 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.460
 well those were all I found 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.620
 I hope you liked it, like it and
