00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 what we are going to do today is a 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.179
 makeup style cat eyes eyes well 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.760
 delineated with liner pen liner 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.320
 from lancÃ´me 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.890
 and I will explain the technique to 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.289
 achieve this eye I will start delineating 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.869
 the eye 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.730
 with a hypnosis waterproof cabbage crayon 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.130
 black color 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.119
 I'm going to delineate well well attached to 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.119
 birth of the eyelashes 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.600
 and later 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.600
 inside the eye 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.190
 following the part of the eye contour 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.269
 I am going to mark 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.269
 with a concealer 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.910
 like drawing a line so that I 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.910
 help to make the tail of the eye well 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.910
 I'm going to use the pen line to 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.910
 delineate 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.500
 above 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.700
 we support well 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.530
 we follow above the delineated with 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.530
 crayon 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.380
 Now following this line 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.380
 and we stretch up 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.010
 and we join this part with this one 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.380
 again with the crayon col 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.159
 let's delineate pegadito the eyelashes 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.710
 from below to pass the liner plum by 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.470
 above 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.130
 we support the birth and we make a 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.130
 straight line 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.240
 we join this part of here 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.620
 and this part is well finished 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.620
 we fill with black 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.980
 to achieve this makeup many times 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.410
 we are going to have to go over and over again 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.410
 until it is well neat and even 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.610
 I'm going to use leaf nose dollars 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.540
 to create a well-charged look for 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.540
 accompany this delineated 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.550
 I'm going to use a subtle blush blush and I'll 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.500
 to apply on the cheekbone 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.500
 from back to front 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:26.530
 for these very defined eyes I will use 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:26.530
 a blog without a transparent logo 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.140
 this one that has a few flashes of 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.140
 colour 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.890
 with a lot of brightness 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.750
 very good to accompany these eyes 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.760
 they want to learn more of these 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.120
 makeup can take courses in my 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.120
 school
