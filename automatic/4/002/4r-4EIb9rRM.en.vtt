00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
on of course that is connected to the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.080 
on of course that is connected to the
wall<00:01:29.200> sometimes<00:01:30.200> you<00:01:30.560> feel<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:31.040> like<00:01:31.280> yeah

wall sometimes you feel that like yeah
what<00:01:32.330> water<00:01:32.660> never<00:01:33.020> finished<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:33.710> just

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
what water never finished you just

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.300 
what water never finished you just
stopped<00:01:34.280> at<00:01:34.460> one<00:01:34.670> point<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.240> know<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.770> now

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
stopped at one point you know and now

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.250 
stopped at one point you know and now
it's<00:01:37.610> still<00:01:37.820> going<00:01:38.150> going<00:01:38.480> but<00:01:38.780> when<00:01:38.990> some

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
it's still going going but when some

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.010 
it's still going going but when some
mother<00:01:39.620> either<00:01:40.130> by<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.700> ratio

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
mother either by the ratio

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.460 
mother either by the ratio
which<00:01:42.799> is<00:01:42.950> kind<00:01:43.220> of<00:01:43.340> really<00:01:44.299> schizophrenic<00:01:45.140> I

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
which is kind of really schizophrenic I

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.280 
which is kind of really schizophrenic I
mean<00:01:45.979> this<00:01:46.280> epic<00:01:46.729> separation<00:01:47.390> is<00:01:47.509> is<00:01:47.899> after

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
mean this epic separation is is after

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.889 
mean this epic separation is is after
fish<00:01:48.530> somebody<00:01:49.159> maybe<00:01:49.399> sees<00:01:50.149> that<00:01:50.420> as<00:01:50.869> a

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
fish somebody maybe sees that as a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.469 
fish somebody maybe sees that as a
natural<00:01:51.500> thing<00:01:51.710> but<00:01:52.580> for<00:01:52.790> me<00:01:52.970> that<00:01:53.210> is<00:01:53.450> like

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
natural thing but for me that is like

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.100 
natural thing but for me that is like
the<00:01:54.460> really<00:01:55.460> monstrous<00:01:56.030> construct<00:01:56.840> of

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
the really monstrous construct of

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.840 
the really monstrous construct of
politics<00:01:57.890> that<00:01:58.070> we<00:01:58.250> had<00:01:58.460> in<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.700> late

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
politics that we had in the late

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.419 
politics that we had in the late
eighties<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.689> beginning<00:02:00.229> of<00:02:00.350> 90s<00:02:00.860> so

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
eighties and beginning of 90s so

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.070 
eighties and beginning of 90s so
probably<00:02:01.820> when<00:02:02.000> they<00:02:02.149> said<00:02:02.479> that<00:02:02.509> there<00:02:03.049> are

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
probably when they said that there are

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.950 
probably when they said that there are
like<00:02:03.649> two<00:02:04.220> different<00:02:04.789> monsters<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.539> will<00:02:05.750> say

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
like two different monsters I will say

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.620 
like two different monsters I will say
that<00:02:06.229> there<00:02:06.470> are<00:02:06.679> not<00:02:06.890> two<00:02:07.340> there<00:02:07.700> are<00:02:07.729> three

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
that there are not two there are three

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.350 
that there are not two there are three
even<00:02:08.989> four<00:02:09.069> different<00:02:10.069> posters<00:02:10.700> it's<00:02:10.940> three

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
even four different posters it's three

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.890 
even four different posters it's three
different<00:02:11.900> cultural<00:02:12.860> Heritage's<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:14.630> can

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
different cultural Heritage's you can

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.039

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
watch that has no fortune as being rich

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.820 
watch that has no fortune as being rich
because<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.590> have<00:02:18.769> all<00:02:18.950> this<00:02:19.190> diversity<00:02:19.730> in
