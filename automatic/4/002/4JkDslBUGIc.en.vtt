00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.630 

okay<00:00:01.879> this<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:03.000> my<00:00:03.149> Jinnah<00:00:03.540> 284<00:00:04.400> with<00:00:05.400> the

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
okay this is my Jinnah 284 with the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.860 
okay this is my Jinnah 284 with the
front<00:00:06.150> axle<00:00:07.160> lifted<00:00:08.160> off<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.700> ground<00:00:09.710> okay

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
front axle lifted off of the ground okay

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.650 
front axle lifted off of the ground okay
and<00:00:13.580> we'll<00:00:14.580> go<00:00:14.700> ahead<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.880> put<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.179> down<00:00:15.330> into

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
and we'll go ahead and put it down into

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.420 
and we'll go ahead and put it down into
two-wheel<00:00:16.020> drive<00:00:18.109> so<00:00:19.109> if<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.039> look<00:00:20.220> really

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
two-wheel drive so if you look really

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.269 
two-wheel drive so if you look really
carefully<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:21.410> notice<00:00:22.410> as<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.680> spin<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> front

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
carefully you notice as I spin the front

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.259 
carefully you notice as I spin the front
tire<00:00:23.490> or<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.900> other<00:00:25.019> tire<00:00:25.289> turns<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.830> rear

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
tire or the other tire turns to the rear

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.790 
tire or the other tire turns to the rear
but<00:00:27.269> if<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.510> watch<00:00:27.689> really<00:00:28.019> closely<00:00:28.260> when<00:00:28.769> I

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
but if you watch really closely when I

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.640 
but if you watch really closely when I
spin<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.310> stop<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:30.689> other<00:00:30.840> tire<00:00:31.109> coasts<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
spin it and stop the other tire coasts a

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.510 
spin it and stop the other tire coasts a
little<00:00:31.859> bit<00:00:32.009> after<00:00:32.340> I've<00:00:32.489> stopped<00:00:35.989> okay<00:00:37.520> when

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
little bit after I've stopped okay when

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.310 
little bit after I've stopped okay when
I<00:00:38.579> apply<00:00:38.820> torque<00:00:39.120> through<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.450> wheel<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
I apply torque through this wheel the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.360 
I apply torque through this wheel the
torque<00:00:40.590> takes<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.950> path<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.309> least

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
torque takes the path of least

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.660 
torque takes the path of least
resistance<00:00:42.590> that<00:00:43.590> path<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.190> case<00:00:44.430> is

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
resistance that path in this case is

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.060 
resistance that path in this case is
through<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> opposite<00:00:45.480> tire<00:00:45.860> but<00:00:46.860> when<00:00:47.039> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
through the opposite tire but when I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.369 
through the opposite tire but when I
stop<00:00:47.430> suddenly<00:00:47.760> its<00:00:48.510> momentum<00:00:51.379> keeps

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
stop suddenly its momentum keeps

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.080 
stop suddenly its momentum keeps
applying<00:00:52.829> torque<00:00:53.070> from<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> other<00:00:53.579> side<00:00:53.850> so

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
applying torque from the other side so

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.569 
applying torque from the other side so
when<00:00:54.239> I've<00:00:54.360> stopped<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.899> wheel<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:56.430> other

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
when I've stopped this wheel the other

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.880 
when I've stopped this wheel the other
tire<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.180> still<00:00:57.600> spinning<00:00:57.960> slightly<00:00:58.530> that's

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
tire is still spinning slightly that's

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.520 
tire is still spinning slightly that's
when<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> front<00:00:59.460> drive<00:00:59.640> shaft<00:00:59.670> is<00:01:00.090> turning<00:01:00.530> so

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
when the front drive shaft is turning so

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.070 
when the front drive shaft is turning so
that's<00:01:01.890> two-wheel<00:01:02.280> drive<00:01:02.629> let's<00:01:03.629> put<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> into

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
that's two-wheel drive let's put it into

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.080 
that's two-wheel drive let's put it into
four-wheel<00:01:04.379> drive<00:01:04.619> oh<00:01:06.049> right<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.229> cool<00:01:08.090> I'm

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
four-wheel drive oh right in cool I'm

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.730 
four-wheel drive oh right in cool I'm
also<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.600> neutral<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> gearbox<00:01:10.530> now<00:01:12.740> when

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
also in neutral in the gearbox now when

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.490 
also in neutral in the gearbox now when
I<00:01:13.770> spin<00:01:15.110> you'll<00:01:16.110> notice<00:01:16.409> there's<00:01:16.590> no<00:01:16.740> coasting

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
I spin you'll notice there's no coasting

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.490 
I spin you'll notice there's no coasting
and<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.280> also<00:01:20.400> hear<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.700> clunk<00:01:21.320> I'm<00:01:22.320> also

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and you can also hear a clunk I'm also

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.030 
and you can also hear a clunk I'm also
hearing<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.920> clunk<00:01:23.189> from<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> rear<00:01:23.729> drivetrain

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
hearing a clunk from the rear drivetrain

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.210 
hearing a clunk from the rear drivetrain
okay

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
okay

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.130 
okay
that's<00:01:26.759> because<00:01:27.180> now<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:28.020> in

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
that's because now that it's in

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.940 
that's because now that it's in
four-wheel<00:01:28.500> drive<00:01:29.720> alright<00:01:32.270> any<00:01:33.829> chance<00:01:34.829> to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
four-wheel drive alright any chance to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.030 
four-wheel drive alright any chance to
apply<00:01:35.280> torque<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.970> blocked<00:01:36.479> because<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.829> rear

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
apply torque is blocked because the rear

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.710 
apply torque is blocked because the rear
tires<00:01:38.280> are<00:01:38.509> hard<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> ground<00:01:41.509> rule<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.630> an

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
tires are hard on the ground rule of an

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.870 
tires are hard on the ground rule of an
open<00:01:42.990> differential<00:01:43.549> if<00:01:45.020> any<00:01:46.020> one<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.470> locked

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
open differential if any one is locked

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.090 
open differential if any one is locked
the<00:01:47.880> other<00:01:48.030> two<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.420> turn<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.810> any<00:01:49.710> two<00:01:49.950> are

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
the other two can turn if any two are

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.630 
the other two can turn if any two are
locked

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
locked

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.389

the third one cannot so that was in
neutral<00:01:56.659> it<00:01:57.659> doesn't<00:01:57.930> make<00:01:58.020> any<00:01:58.140> difference

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
neutral it doesn't make any difference

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.740 
neutral it doesn't make any difference
we<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.860> put<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.159> gear<00:01:59.600> because<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
we can put it in gear because the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.410 
we can put it in gear because the
gearbox<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.380> not<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.549> path<00:02:02.759> between<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:14.370 
front axle and the rear axle works
exactly<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.170> same

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.690 

clunking<00:02:15.380> you<00:02:15.530> here<00:02:16.240> is<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:18.530> slack<00:02:18.980> being<00:02:19.370> taken

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
clunking you here is a slack being taken

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.780 
clunking you here is a slack being taken
up<00:02:19.820> between<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.690> front<00:02:20.900> differential<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
up between the front differential the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.000 
up between the front differential the
driveshaft<00:02:23.060> ends<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.860> rear
