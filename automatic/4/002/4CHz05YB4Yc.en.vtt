 market and universal has it 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.449

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.490
 yes then just see a piece of the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:19.090
 trainer idea it is indeed in 3d 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.670
 all of them with the web three 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.190
 minor problems July is not a traffic jam 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.180

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.530
 of universal pictures' with it looks 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.390
 there is really simple good aleah and it 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.680
 nice thing about this movie is the bad guy 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.780
 is only half 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.450
 so we are grundy the man says it 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.369
 really does the most awful things and 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.439
 as an audience we can finally 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.390
 way to a hug and enjoy 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.490
 and this movie is also really fun for both 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.990
 the elderly as little ones often is one 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.850
 animation film fun for the little ones and 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.929
 parents can do watch it but 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.909
 often sit on a watch after an hour 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.979
 how long should i have this movie 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.380
 is also really nice for the elderly and 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.630
 yes it's a this is about one 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.920
 and villains that are actually midway through the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.539
 the movie finds out that you also have a good one 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.530
 side because he has three cute 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.390
 orphan girls 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.590
 encounter who see something in him that even 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.470
 has never seen anyone in him 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.549
 namely a potential dad and yes that 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.470
 is the story of the 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.910
 film becomes villain the daddy of that 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.860
 orphan girls yes or no 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.390
 and he manages to steal the moon 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.860
 because that is actually the main purpose of 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.940
 that movie really a very nice movie for that 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.560
 young and old well we like that 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.910
 I thrilled to like as I 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.290
 know that it looks like double bottom 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.910
 that you as an adult that also a hefty 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.620
 yes it definitely says that you can 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.910
 Yes absolutely there is humor in which 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.959
 grip on adults 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.940
 whose children have something like that 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.650
 what is this about but we you 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.180
 smile then there are equally long hair 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.010
 hairy yes have to remember is 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.209
 are all from tomorrow cinema now and 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.010
 then you brought another 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.510
 yes that is the movie boreth and that is 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.790
 actually all that 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.730
 and that stands for their tiers extremely 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.160
 dangerous I had there in the we see one 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.720
 number of ex cia agents 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.060
 played by and not the least actors 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.079
 on Bruce Willis Morgan Freeman John 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.480
 malkovich 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.040
 and yes the surprise of this movie hell and 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.750
 lies that we all know as 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.280
 you the queen from the movie of the same name 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.420
 a few years ago she also 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.459
 oscar for won 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.109
 and yes for hasi way for the first time 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.450
 walking around with a machine gun and also 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.459
 it is very convincing and in it 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.019
 this film is about having the cia 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.000
 a new director 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.620
 and who actually wants the old agents 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.510
 knowing too much about the secrets of the past 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.160
 but those old agents turn that off 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.690
 later a pressure did not happen that find 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.220
 it's great that they have their old box and again 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.230
 turn on often can pick up 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.900
 and year together they fight 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.329
 and that is very funny indeed 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.209
 nice the interaction between those actors 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.110
 which is very well done is a real one 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.390
 super cast 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.530
 and certainly with a bruce willis that yes that 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.549
 you can sometimes notice the difference 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.000
 that that many videos on the 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.980
 vending machine 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 she does pilots but in this movie you can 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.980
 just see that he has a lot of fun 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.210
 made in making the film was one 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.420
 I always say Bruce Willis 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.110
 similar role yes yes the region news 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.340
 surprisingly 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.750
 yes it is surprising because he is now 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.890
 more to show its comic side 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.820
 often my only see him the 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.140
 action hero 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.959
 and now we see that in him too 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.820
 good come I sit and yes we saw that out 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.320
 I used to be in the moonlighting series 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.790
 where you were n't on TV then was mega 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.500
 and his films that is never really bad 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.510
 emerged but now it is really one 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.040
 very nice movie and yes I had there 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.050
 same feeling as I used to 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.459
 for films as a liter weapon or torch as 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.709
 a die-hard that really comes with a 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.480
 feeling the cinema out of yes that was 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.019
 really kick and let those two already 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.060
 come 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.140
 only yes it is so good you naturally too 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.570
 what makes me so much more special 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.940
 releasing 50 you say is in that we will 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.410
 the story in the seven is 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.910
 archer's what you have been up to in recent years 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.950
 a lot of that is with films like that 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.600
 very much the emphasis is placed on 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.500
 the effects he mainly the computer 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.970
 effect it and have yet to 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.580
 see more spectacular than the on than the 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.750
 other film yes and with this the 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.490
 really emphasize the characters 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.930
 yes so you will start thinking along 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.410
 sympathize with the people you see 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.240
 gets 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.220
 yes that also gives those action scenes 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.900
 filmed impact because yes we have 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.000
 finally seen the action scenes 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.140
 nowadays so yes and so fresh repeat 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.940
 that is no longer interesting 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.440
 if you have their character you already have a brand 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.669
 what you can feel yes makes it is 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.960
 lots and lots of fun and you got it right 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.940
 pay attention to this movie 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.370
 well you make it enormously exciting I have 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.110
 wanting to go luxury and luxury 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.370
 beats with 30 years found time and again 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.370
 of course thank you very much
