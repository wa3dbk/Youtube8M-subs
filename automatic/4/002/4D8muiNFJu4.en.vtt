 xiaomi power bank per 10 thousand amperes from 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.270
 new equipment brand new power 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.900
 bank from xiaomi supply such white 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:17.529
 we have a box on the left side here 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.419
 barcode authentication code that is 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.619
 authenticity can be verified on the site 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.939
 when we wipe over here marking here 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.669
 in the center of us the logo is not 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.609
 in the back we also have mikom and from the right 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:34.960
 aside from the characteristic of 10 amps you 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:38.730
 part of a volt per 10 thousand amps 6 with 250 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:43.320
 amp 5 1 volt type 1 a 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.550

 support, that is, you can charge any 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.590
 the device needs only a frame here 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.780
 here comes such a box in 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.180
 In principle, an ordinary cardboard box with us 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.160
 here instructions how to check 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.049
 cable authenticity and nothing more 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.479
 not 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.630
 we have a new cable dime than 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.570
 before all of us were all like that 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.759
 the size of the plate that is half 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.530
 less and was not here such here 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.249
 glossy coating as a principle on 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.069
 iPhones 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:23.859
 on the chargers here iphone here 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.850
 us marking yusbi here we have lightning 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.210
 charging 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:34.020
 this white glossy silicone 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:36.969
 white cable about 20 centimeters 25 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.130
 he cook the bank statement to verify 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.920
 authenticity of powerbank 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.209
 and what a fan on and husband does not give up and 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.009
 how to use this 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.020
 this thing comes out like this xiaomi 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.229
 power bank 10 thousand amps good 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.959
 little handy in hand here with us 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.770
 serial information 10 thousand amps all that 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:03.539
 the same is duplicated as on the box 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:08.259
 here on top of the sticker to 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:10.830
 remove verse 1 he points out that 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.930
 new item here we have a button 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.000
 to turn off four indicators 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.990
 it is one hundred percent that is to say 25 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.820
 percent on each indicators 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.730
 curvature import and usb port for charging 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:29.010
 that is, we connected the usb charger cable and 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.290
 You can also turn on the micro usb phone 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.190
 charge apple phones 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.740
 from apple there and any other devices and 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.110
 so on like is much less than 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.640
 the fact that 10,000 milliamps as you can see in 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.950
 arm very comfortable and light in principle 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.050
 much better than before 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.970
 there is of course one port wrong 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.200
 as in 16000 I am empire but pretty 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.400
 convenient and you can take wherever you want 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.440
 on the back of my.com logo 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.740
 can be seen at an angle before and here at 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.459
 us 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:09.810
 logo not all contacts are exactly 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.060
 there is if you see kosyachok if yusb ports 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.970
 stand not exactly that is at an angle that is 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.660
 this means that you may be 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.510
 or fake or bad dry factory 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.670
 assembly but in principle there is no such 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.310
 original ciao my power bank bad 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.840

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.510
