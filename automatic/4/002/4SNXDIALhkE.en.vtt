00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the fact that Nintendo cleared a game

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.539 
the fact that Nintendo cleared a game
like<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.720> slapped<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.650> name<00:01:34.890> Metroid

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
like this and slapped the name Metroid

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.850 
like this and slapped the name Metroid
Prime<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.299> even<00:01:36.420> though<00:01:36.689> there's<00:01:36.930> no<00:01:37.560> clear

Metroid Prime this also angers fans due

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.639 
Metroid Prime this also angers fans due
to<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.240> fact<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.960> missing<00:01:52.259> many

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
to the fact that it's missing many

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.950 
to the fact that it's missing many
elements<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.430> instead<00:01:54.060> looks<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> bland

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
elements and instead looks like a bland

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.490 
elements and instead looks like a bland
FPS<00:01:55.560> more<00:01:56.280> than<00:01:56.490> anything<00:01:56.759> else<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:58.229> amount

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
FPS more than anything else the amount

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.440 
FPS more than anything else the amount
of<00:01:58.590> comments<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.189> received<00:01:59.640> saying<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.299> this

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
of comments I received saying that this

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.660 
of comments I received saying that this
was<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> spinoff<00:02:01.079> were<00:02:01.770> pretty<00:02:02.040> large<00:02:02.369> though

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
was a spinoff were pretty large though

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.120 
was a spinoff were pretty large though
and<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.360> made<00:02:03.509> me<00:02:03.659> question<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.200> perhaps<00:02:04.409> it

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and it made me question that perhaps it

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.370 
and it made me question that perhaps it
was<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.909> spin-off<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.930> was<00:02:07.079> getting

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
was just a spin-off and I was getting

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.410 
was just a spin-off and I was getting
upset<00:02:07.500> over<00:02:07.829> nothing<00:02:07.970> but<00:02:08.970> then<00:02:09.090> another

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
upset over nothing but then another

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.900 
upset over nothing but then another
person<00:02:09.780> commenting<00:02:10.590> saying<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.160> Nintendo

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
person commenting saying that Nintendo

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.309 
person commenting saying that Nintendo
also<00:02:12.120> did<00:02:12.540> spin-offs<00:02:12.989> of

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
also did spin-offs of

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.289 
also did spin-offs of
other<00:02:13.439> games<00:02:13.650> but<00:02:14.129> always<00:02:14.549> have<00:02:14.999> something

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
other games but always have something

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.869

these spin-offs were not confusing names
that<00:02:28.439> made<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> person<00:02:29.129> think<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.549> was<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> new

that made a person think this was a new

that made a person think this was a new
entry<00:02:30.389> into<00:02:30.689> the<00:02:30.780> series<00:02:31.019> instead<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.099> a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
spinoff people also stated the biggest

argument<00:02:37.379> for<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.769> game<00:02:38.040> was<00:02:38.519> not<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.939> judge

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
argument for this game was not to judge

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.030 
argument for this game was not to judge
it<00:02:39.329> before<00:02:39.689> it<00:02:39.780> was<00:02:39.900> released<00:02:40.139> now<00:02:40.859> I<00:02:40.889> think

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
it before it was released now I think

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.309 
it before it was released now I think
that's<00:02:41.370> pretty<00:02:41.700> hypocritical<00:02:41.939> in<00:02:42.629> my<00:02:42.810> eyes<00:02:43.049> if

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
that's pretty hypocritical in my eyes if

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.699 
that's pretty hypocritical in my eyes if
you<00:02:43.799> say<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.669> someone<00:02:44.999> who<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.049> judging<00:02:46.319> game

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
you say to someone who is judging game

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.190 
you say to someone who is judging game
before<00:02:47.159> it's<00:02:47.280> released<00:02:47.639> that<00:02:48.180> you're<00:02:48.750> telling

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
before it's released that you're telling

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.379 
before it's released that you're telling
them<00:02:49.379> not<00:02:49.919> to<00:02:49.980> speak<00:02:50.370> their<00:02:50.579> opinions<00:02:51.180> about

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
them not to speak their opinions about

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.439 
them not to speak their opinions about
the<00:02:51.900> way<00:02:52.319> they<00:02:52.949> think<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.400> game<00:02:53.609> is<00:02:53.639> before

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:54.449 
the way they think the game is before

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:57.409 
the way they think the game is before
it's<00:02:54.599> released<00:02:55.049> if<00:02:55.349> we<00:02:56.280> did<00:02:56.459> not<00:02:56.609> judge<00:02:57.060> things

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
it's released if we did not judge things

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.240 
it's released if we did not judge things
based<00:02:57.719> on<00:02:57.930> their<00:02:58.109> trailers<00:02:58.560> there<00:02:59.010> would<00:02:59.219> be

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
based on their trailers there would be

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.490 
based on their trailers there would be
no<00:02:59.549> incentive<00:02:59.730> to<00:03:00.239> buy<00:03:00.419> anything<00:03:01.019> day<00:03:01.199> one

that<00:03:14.040> would<00:03:14.400> have<00:03:14.579> been<00:03:14.760> real<00:03:15.000> if<00:03:15.299> the

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
that would have been real if the

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.099 
that would have been real if the

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
community had not been so upset about it

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.379 
community had not been so upset about it
and<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.560> vocal<00:03:20.099> about<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.699> was<00:03:21.030> reversed

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
and so vocal about it it was reversed

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.390 
and so vocal about it it was reversed
and<00:03:21.659> now<00:03:21.840> we<00:03:21.900> have<00:03:22.139> a<00:03:22.169> system<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.709> Microsoft

and now we have a system that Microsoft

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.309 
and now we have a system that Microsoft
seems<00:03:23.669> to<00:03:23.819> be<00:03:23.909> putting<00:03:24.150> effort<00:03:24.689> into<00:03:24.870> making

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
seems to be putting effort into making

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.189 
seems to be putting effort into making
instead<00:03:25.949> so<00:03:26.790> judging<00:03:27.299> something<00:03:27.599> before<00:03:28.139> it

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
instead so judging something before it

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:34.729 
instead so judging something before it
comes<00:03:28.439> out<00:03:28.620> does<00:03:29.009> have<00:03:29.310> its<00:03:29.549> place<00:03:33.530> one<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.650> the
