that's<00:00:59.809> kind<00:01:00.020> of<00:01:00.050> in<00:01:00.170> a<00:01:00.230> wave<00:01:00.440> shape<00:01:00.710> that<00:01:00.890> run

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
that's kind of in a wave shape that run

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.610 
that's kind of in a wave shape that run
choose<00:01:01.309> a<00:01:01.340> heel<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:02.050> most<00:01:03.050> of<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.260> forefoot

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
think you guys get the idea again you

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.990 
think you guys get the idea again you
get<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:14.479> wave<00:01:14.690> technology<00:01:14.930> on<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:16.000> inside

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
get that wave technology on the inside

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.330 
get that wave technology on the inside
as<00:01:17.180> well<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:18.530> also<00:01:18.680> is<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:18.950> little<00:01:19.130> bit<00:01:19.220> lighter

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
as well it also is a little bit lighter

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.469 
as well it also is a little bit lighter
weight<00:01:19.580> than<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.820> other<00:01:19.939> running<00:01:20.180> shoes<00:01:20.450> i

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
weight than the other running shoes i

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.810 
weight than the other running shoes i
believe<00:01:20.810> it's<00:01:20.930> a<00:01:20.990> boat<00:01:21.229> just<00:01:22.220> over<00:01:22.460> 10<00:01:22.640> ounces

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
believe it's a boat just over 10 ounces

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.410 
believe it's a boat just over 10 ounces
so<00:01:23.210> it's<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.479> fairly<00:01:24.200> lightweight<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:25.460> lot

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
so it's a fairly lightweight and a lot

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.700 
so it's a fairly lightweight and a lot
of<00:01:26.450> support<00:01:26.869> for<00:01:26.960> what<00:01:27.110> you're<00:01:27.229> getting<00:01:27.530> for

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710

what<00:01:27.890> uh<00:01:29.380> how<00:01:30.380> light<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.070> is<00:01:33.580> has<00:01:34.580> this<00:01:34.729> unique

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
what uh how light it is has this unique

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.370 
what uh how light it is has this unique
heel<00:01:36.070> area<00:01:37.070> of<00:01:37.460> you<00:01:37.840> looks<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.930> little<00:01:39.140> bit
