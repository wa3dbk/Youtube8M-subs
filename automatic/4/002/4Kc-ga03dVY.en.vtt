all<00:00:00.870> right<00:00:00.989> we're<00:00:01.110> gonna<00:00:01.199> cover<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.530> steps<00:00:01.770> on

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
all right we're gonna cover the steps on

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.919 
all right we're gonna cover the steps on
how<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.190> replace<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.580> screen<00:00:03.090> on<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.510> window

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
how to replace a screen on a window

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.010 
how to replace a screen on a window
screen<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:05.400> first<00:00:05.640> step<00:00:05.879> is<00:00:06.150> we<00:00:06.660> need<00:00:06.870> to

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
screen and the first step is we need to

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.820 
screen and the first step is we need to
find<00:00:07.319> where<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.010> spline<00:00:08.420> starts<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.830> will

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
find where the spline starts and will

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.289 
find where the spline starts and will
start<00:00:11.300> removing<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.780> here<00:00:13.099> and<00:00:14.099> if<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
start removing it here and if you have a

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.990 
start removing it here and if you have a
really<00:00:15.750> old<00:00:15.780> screen<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.220> spline<00:00:17.609> is

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
really old screen and the spline is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.050 
really old screen and the spline is
really<00:00:18.720> dried<00:00:19.020> out<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.500> broken<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.550> can<00:00:20.730> just

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
really dried out and broken you can just

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.599 
really dried out and broken you can just
pull<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.779> out<00:00:21.930> with<00:00:22.260> what<00:00:22.949> he<00:00:23.039> suggests<00:00:23.430> still

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
pull it out with what he suggests still

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.620 
pull it out with what he suggests still
like<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> screwdriver<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:26.210> can<00:00:27.210> pull<00:00:27.390> out<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
like a screwdriver you can pull out the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.330 
like a screwdriver you can pull out the
old<00:00:27.660> spline<00:00:28.170> but<00:00:28.740> if<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.099> good<00:00:29.130> shape

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
old spline but if it's in good shape

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.160 
old spline but if it's in good shape
like<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:30.029> you're<00:00:30.359> just<00:00:30.420> gonna<00:00:30.720> remove<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
like this you're just gonna remove it

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.770 
like this you're just gonna remove it
and<00:00:31.439> keep<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> old<00:00:32.460> spline<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.600> way<00:00:33.719> you

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
and keep the old spline that way you

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.450 
and keep the old spline that way you
don't<00:00:33.989> even<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.440> buy<00:00:34.620> anything<00:00:35.100> new<00:00:35.250> and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
don't even have to buy anything new and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.000 
don't even have to buy anything new and
it's<00:00:35.610> gonna<00:00:35.730> fit<00:00:36.059> into<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.540> screen<00:00:37.290> perfectly

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
it's gonna fit into the screen perfectly

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.340 
it's gonna fit into the screen perfectly
and<00:00:38.579> we're<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.570> remove<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.170> old

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
and we're just going to remove the old

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.750 
and we're just going to remove the old
screen<00:00:41.180> and<00:00:43.040> then<00:00:44.040> at<00:00:44.190> your<00:00:44.219> local<00:00:44.520> hardware

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
screen and then at your local hardware

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.779 
screen and then at your local hardware
store<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.780> them<00:00:46.079> cut<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> piece<00:00:46.950> to

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
store you can have them cut a piece to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:58.420 
store you can have them cut a piece to
size<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:54.239> Elle's<00:00:55.170> got<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> piece<00:00:55.739> cut<00:00:56.100> here

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.690 

and<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.579> clamp<00:00:59.879> at<00:01:00.090> each<00:01:00.239> corner<00:01:00.649> okay<00:01:04.700> nice

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and you clamp at each corner okay nice

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.520 
and you clamp at each corner okay nice
and<00:01:05.970> tight<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.630> need<00:01:09.780> four<00:01:10.049> corners

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
and tight so you just need four corners

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.010 
and tight so you just need four corners
with<00:01:11.010> put<00:01:11.220> three<00:01:11.430> clamps<00:01:11.790> through<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> corner

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
with put three clamps through the corner

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.840 
with put three clamps through the corner
dating<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> start<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.220> don't<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.670> put<00:01:14.820> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
dating the start you don't have to put a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.050 
dating the start you don't have to put a
clamp<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.360> okay<00:01:15.869> great<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:19.759> now<00:01:20.759> we're<00:01:20.880> just

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
clamp on okay great and now we're just

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.130 
clamp on okay great and now we're just
reusing<00:01:21.420> our<00:01:21.630> old<00:01:21.810> spline

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.880 

you<00:01:26.710> just<00:01:26.890> start<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:27.610> with<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:27.760> spline<00:01:28.150> roller

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
you just start it with a spline roller

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.980 
you just start it with a spline roller
okay<00:01:29.890> if<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:30.729> put<00:01:30.880> your<00:01:31.030> finger<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.810> there's

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
okay if you put your finger and there's

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.420 
okay if you put your finger and there's
a<00:01:32.050> little<00:01:32.290> groove<00:01:32.530> where<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.770> spine<00:01:33.010> goes<00:01:33.220> put

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
a little groove where the spine goes put

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.399 
a little groove where the spine goes put
your<00:01:33.580> finger<00:01:33.909> in<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.060> groove<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:35.050> little<00:01:35.290> bit

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
your finger in that groove a little bit

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.410 
your finger in that groove a little bit
so<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:35.619> pressing<00:01:35.890> it<00:01:36.159> down<00:01:36.190> pressing<00:01:36.760> the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
so you pressing it down pressing the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.899 
so you pressing it down pressing the
roller<00:01:37.630> down<00:01:37.930> at<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.200> same<00:01:38.409> time<00:01:38.740> okay<00:01:39.670> great

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
roller down at the same time okay great

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.450 
roller down at the same time okay great
and<00:01:40.560> now<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:41.619> don't<00:01:41.770> care<00:01:42.070> too<00:01:42.250> much<00:01:42.280> about

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
and now you don't care too much about

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.210 
and now you don't care too much about
the<00:01:42.990> screen<00:01:43.990> in<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.380> beginning<00:01:44.770> it's<00:01:45.130> not

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
the screen in the beginning it's not

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.640 
the screen in the beginning it's not
there<00:01:45.490> at<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.580> first<00:01:45.850> side<00:01:46.060> no<00:01:46.540> wait<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.560> get

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
there at the first side no wait to get

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.410 
there at the first side no wait to get
to<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:47.920> opposite<00:01:48.340> side<00:01:48.550> once<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:48.909> work<00:01:49.090> up<00:01:49.270> to

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
to the opposite side once you work up to

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.620 
to the opposite side once you work up to
the<00:01:49.540> plant<00:01:49.840> take<00:01:50.140> off<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.440> clamp<00:01:50.680> okay<00:01:51.630> your

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
the plant take off the clamp okay your

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:02.700 
the plant take off the clamp okay your
corner

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.410 

and<00:02:03.710> you're<00:02:03.829> just<00:02:03.920> kind<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.280> feeding<00:02:05.270> it

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
and you're just kind of feeding it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.700 
and you're just kind of feeding it
forward<00:02:05.780> with<00:02:05.899> your<00:02:06.020> hand<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.560> then<00:02:06.680> just

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
forward with your hand and then just

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.800 
forward with your hand and then just
pushing<00:02:07.189> it<00:02:07.310> in<00:02:07.399> when<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.789> roller<00:02:08.179> we're

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
pushing it in when the roller we're

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:26.420 
pushing it in when the roller we're
already<00:02:09.110> on

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.310 

so<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.550> your<00:02:27.700> last<00:02:27.880> edge<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.930> important<00:02:29.260> to

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
so on your last edge is it important to

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.380 
so on your last edge is it important to
pull<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:29.590> tight<00:02:29.890> or<00:02:30.220> it'll<00:02:30.940> do<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.180> myself

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
pull this tight or it'll do it myself

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.260 
pull this tight or it'll do it myself
the<00:02:31.930> roller<00:02:32.170> will<00:02:32.380> do<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.650> work<00:02:32.830> okay<00:02:33.640> just

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
the roller will do to work okay just

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.790 
the roller will do to work okay just
make<00:02:34.450> sure<00:02:34.600> your<00:02:34.810> finger<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.440> groove<00:02:35.710> a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
make sure your finger is in a groove a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.950 
make sure your finger is in a groove a
little<00:02:36.040> bit<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.850> lead<00:02:37.060> finger<00:02:37.600> is<00:02:37.660> kind<00:02:37.900> of
