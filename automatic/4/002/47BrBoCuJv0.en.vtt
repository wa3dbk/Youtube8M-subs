head<00:00:27.510> wrap<00:00:27.689> stay<00:00:28.619> tuned<00:00:35.510> I'm<00:00:36.510> using<00:00:36.960> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
head wrap stay tuned I'm using a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.400 
head wrap stay tuned I'm using a
stocking<00:00:37.800> cap<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.370> cover<00:00:38.820> my<00:00:39.120> locs<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:40.379> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
stocking cap to cover my locs because I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.040 
stocking cap to cover my locs because I
find<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.280> without<00:00:41.879> using<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.510> stocking<00:00:42.870> cap

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
find that without using the stocking cap

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.709 
find that without using the stocking cap
my<00:00:43.260> locs<00:00:43.469> get<00:00:43.770> pretty<00:00:44.010> wild<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.579> frizzy<00:00:45.000> so

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
my locs get pretty wild and frizzy so

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.080 
my locs get pretty wild and frizzy so
this<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.350> an<00:00:46.440> optional<00:00:46.920> step<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.820> new

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
this is an optional step if you have new

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.540 
this is an optional step if you have new
locks<00:00:48.360> or<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.200> want<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> hold<00:00:50.190> your<00:00:50.399> hair

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
locks or you just want to hold your hair

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.029 
locks or you just want to hold your hair
down<00:00:50.760> while<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.210> tire<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.500> fabric

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
down while you tire so with the fabric

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.799 
down while you tire so with the fabric
that<00:00:53.219> you're<00:00:53.399> gonna<00:00:53.579> use<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> outside<00:00:54.539> I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that you're gonna use on the outside I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.689 
that you're gonna use on the outside I
particularly<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.530> jersey<00:00:55.860> fabric<00:00:56.129> because

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
particularly have jersey fabric because

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.939 
particularly have jersey fabric because
it's<00:00:56.879> stretchy<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.989> want<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.350> fold<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.829> in

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
it's stretchy you want to fold it in

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.670 
it's stretchy you want to fold it in
half<00:00:58.980> and<00:01:00.649> take<00:01:01.649> your<00:01:02.190> scissors<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.140> then<00:01:04.140> cut

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
half and take your scissors and then cut

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.280 
half and take your scissors and then cut
about<00:01:05.780> six<00:01:06.780> inches<00:01:07.409> from<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.820> elbow<00:01:09.299> maybe

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
about six inches from the elbow maybe

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.080 
about six inches from the elbow maybe
about<00:01:10.560> eight<00:01:10.770> inches

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.050 

so<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.869> gotta<00:01:16.200> cut<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.440> in<00:01:16.590> half<00:01:16.770> almost<00:01:17.340> 3/4

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
so you gotta cut it in half almost 3/4

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.200 
so you gotta cut it in half almost 3/4
of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> way<00:01:19.520> taking<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> fabric<00:01:21.030> that's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
of the way taking the fabric that's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300 
of the way taking the fabric that's
going<00:01:21.510> underneath<00:01:22.080> particularly<00:01:22.860> I'm<00:01:23.070> using

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
going underneath particularly I'm using

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.249 
going underneath particularly I'm using
a<00:01:23.610> cotton<00:01:23.940> fabric<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.780> fridge<00:01:24.990> inch<00:01:25.140> on

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
a cotton fabric with the fridge inch on

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.480 
a cotton fabric with the fridge inch on
the<00:01:25.409> side<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.830> really<00:01:25.920> doesn't<00:01:26.310> matter

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the side it really doesn't matter

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.969 
the side it really doesn't matter
because<00:01:27.450> underneath<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.590> fullness<00:01:28.920> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
because underneath just for fullness you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.130 
because underneath just for fullness you
want<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.580> take<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.940> half<00:01:30.240> way<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:30.780> fold

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
want to take it half way and then fold

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.639 
want to take it half way and then fold
two<00:01:31.409> inches<00:01:31.710> down<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:33.030> put<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:34.170> fabric

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
two inches down and then put the fabric

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.380 
two inches down and then put the fabric
from<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.220> center<00:01:35.580> on<00:01:35.790> your<00:01:35.940> head<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.330> then

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
from the center on your head and then

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.440 
from the center on your head and then
give<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> some<00:01:37.409> twists<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.700> tension<00:01:39.240> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
give it some twists for tension it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.910 
give it some twists for tension it
doesn't<00:01:39.659> really<00:01:39.780> need<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.110> too<00:01:40.470> tight<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
doesn't really need to be too tight and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.560 
doesn't really need to be too tight and
then<00:01:41.549> fold<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.360> half<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:43.020> then<00:01:44.060> roll<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.330> up

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
then fold it in half and then roll it up

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.350 
then fold it in half and then roll it up
to<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> top<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.860> your<00:01:47.009> head<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.000> how

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
you're going to get the height of the

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.399 
you're going to get the height of the
wrap<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.240> don't<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> lot<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.140> hair
