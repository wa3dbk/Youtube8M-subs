00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 welcome to another video I'm from lice 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.460
 of Pokémon as you like to call it very good 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.220
 this time I bring another chapter of 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.870
 the liked series pokémon x 6 mystery 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.880
 unresolved and good for all those 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.240
 they do not know and for those who do in this 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.350
 series we raise certain mysteries that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.600
 There are inside our cartridges 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.510
 pokemon xc and certain funny things 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.090
 certain mysterious things certain 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.859
 mysteries certain dilemmas certain things 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.990
 that make us wonder if they were 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.730
 put by mistake or were put with 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.560
 some intention to joke with us 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.899
 are part of nintendo or just 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.910
 were put because in some future in 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.550
 some other occasion we will know exactly 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.620
 what good is concerned and this time 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.510
 I wanted to bring a pretty ministry 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.210
 interesting and what makes it interesting to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.239
 this mystery to enter flat with 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.789
 he is that we will talk about a place and a 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.980
 place that is not uncommon in itself for the place 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.770
 which is if it's not weird because there's 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.109
 absolutely nothing in this place of what 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.149
 that it should be, that is, there is not something 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.579
 make us feel comfortable with this place 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.150
 let us feel sure what 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.240
 there is 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.410
 it should have or will be in this place 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.810
 but it also makes us think 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.580
 enough things and good without more than if 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.760
 let's show an image directly 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.480
 of this place and to comment it if we 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 we headed to route 22 more itself in the 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.380
 secret part of this route to which 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.990
 can only be accessed with the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.060
 knowledge of this waterfall we can 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.400
 find us this little cave which 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.490
 It called the abaqua stay this 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.250
 Vacuate stay is very similar which 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.890
 makes the rare dungeon very strange 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.260
 where can we find youtube together 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.290
 with half x today and depending on 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.229
 our games and the thalasia cave 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.030
 these two places have something in common 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.670
 in the guinea pig mentioned in the dungeon 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.010
 rare we can find a pokémon 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.020
 legendary and in the thalasia cave 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.150
 we can find equal to 3 pokémon 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.979
 legendary at 3 at 3 a vélez in 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.540
 several to be more precise but 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.119
 strangely in this cave there is no 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.040
 absolutely no legendary pokemon 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.950
 the most notorious thing that we can 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.830
 find him is inside this cave 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.739
 let's find for example the table 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.470
 terror and the magnetite if we go from the 8 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.680
 at 9 and then on absolutely no 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.080
 there is nothing else for this cave which is 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.819
 they asked and what does he really have 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.110
 weird so it's weird that this cave 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.370
 have the exact measurements that the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.250
 two other caves where they appear 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.830
 legendary is strange that I have a 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.030
 cave a proper name for this cave 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.099
 when in this cave there is no 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.130
 absolutely nothing else to do want 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.650
 pick up two small objects is a bit 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.200
 I miss the truth if it 's good, you have to 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.480
 give it not even a little but good 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.790
 now here what remains the question is 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.040
 If here at first you should have 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.260
 some legendary pokemon that does not 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.750
 they put on anything or in their 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.810
 defect here is going to be some pokemon 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.360
 legendary at some future time 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.010
 I really do not know, let's hope that if there was 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.709
 some pokemon here or if there should have been 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.510
 some pokemon here because that was very 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.340
 wrong since we ran out of that pokemon 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.170
 legendary that would appear here 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.540
 and if a pokemon will appear here 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.220
 some event of nintendo anything 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.440
 in this style we hope that very soon 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.080
 we can meet this pokemon 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.569
 legendary we can use it and good 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.010
 this would be all for this chapter of 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.739
 pokemon eckstein unresolved mysteries 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.150

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.090
 mystery that we talk about to be a 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.370
 little more mysterious and also a one 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.400
 video where we analyze a team 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.989
 button peace where we analyze how to create it 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.540
 giving the sets of each one because we see that 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.549
 we carry with him giving as 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.690
