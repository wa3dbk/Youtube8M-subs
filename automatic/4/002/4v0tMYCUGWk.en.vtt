leaves<00:00:08.269> the<00:00:09.269> two<00:00:09.480> main<00:00:09.719> types<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.440> if<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.429> get

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
leaves the two main types and if you get

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.400 
leaves the two main types and if you get
online<00:00:11.730> you'll<00:00:12.540> read<00:00:12.780> different<00:00:13.170> things

online you'll read different things
about<00:00:13.710> different<00:00:14.809> leaves<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.049> may<00:00:16.170> sound

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
about different leaves and it may sound

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.870 
about different leaves and it may sound
like<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> more<00:00:16.949> than<00:00:17.160> two<00:00:17.310> types<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:17.760> they're

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
like the more than two types but they're

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.300 
like the more than two types but they're
only<00:00:17.970> really<00:00:18.240> two<00:00:18.869> kinds<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.650> potato<00:00:20.039> leaf

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
only really two kinds is the potato leaf

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.480 
only really two kinds is the potato leaf
which<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.350> most<00:00:22.350> prevalent<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:23.189> the

there's no scalloping on the leaf and

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.640 
there's no scalloping on the leaf and
the<00:01:03.120> final<00:01:03.600> Brandywine<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.049> grow<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the final Brandywine I grow is the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.840 
the final Brandywine I grow is the
suited<00:01:05.010> stream<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.810> you<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:07.020> see<00:01:07.610> with<00:01:08.610> that

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
suited stream and you can see with that

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.910 
suited stream and you can see with that
also

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
also

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.469

there's no scalloping on the leaf and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.530 
there's no scalloping on the leaf and
that's<00:01:13.110> typically<00:01:13.939> what<00:01:14.939> they<00:01:15.119> mean<00:01:15.330> by<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that's typically what they mean by a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.870 
that's typically what they mean by a
potato<00:01:16.049> leaf<00:01:16.350> tomato<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:20.189> other<00:01:20.340> kind<00:01:20.700> of

potato leaf tomato the other kind of

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.170 
potato leaf tomato the other kind of
leaf<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.360> your<00:01:21.600> standard<00:01:22.080> leaf<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:24.030> is

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
leaf is your standard leaf and it is

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.270 
leaf is your standard leaf and it is
scalloped<00:01:25.909> here<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.509> Baxter's<00:01:28.500> bush<00:01:28.799> cherry

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
scalloped here is a Baxter's bush cherry

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.429 
scalloped here is a Baxter's bush cherry
and<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.750> look<00:01:31.220> at<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.460> leaf<00:01:33.290> you're<00:01:34.290> good

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and if you look at that leaf you're good

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.359 
and if you look at that leaf you're good
to<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:35.060> it's<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.210> smooth<00:01:37.250> there's<00:01:38.250> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
to see it's not smooth there's a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.990 
to see it's not smooth there's a
scalping<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:40.250> now<00:01:41.250> where<00:01:41.430> things<00:01:41.790> get

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
scalping to it now where things get

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.840 
scalping to it now where things get
tricky<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.899> standard<00:01:43.409> tomato<00:01:43.740> leaf<00:01:44.369> like

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
tricky is the standard tomato leaf like

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.749 
tricky is the standard tomato leaf like
you're<00:01:45.030> looking<00:01:45.270> at<00:01:45.390> now<00:01:46.399> can<00:01:47.399> come<00:01:47.610> in

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
you're looking at now can come in

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.109 
you're looking at now can come in
different<00:01:48.240> shapes<00:01:49.579> but<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.790> keep<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.090> mind

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
different shapes but just keep in mind

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.550 
different shapes but just keep in mind
you<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> potato<00:01:51.810> leaf<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.200> has<00:01:52.290> no

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
you have the potato leaf that has no

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.649 
you have the potato leaf that has no
scalping<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.250> smooth<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.450> have

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
scalping it's smooth and then you have

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.230 
scalping it's smooth and then you have
the<00:01:54.780> standard<00:01:55.259> leaf<00:01:55.969> there's<00:01:56.969> another

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the standard leaf there's another

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.929 
the standard leaf there's another
standard<00:01:57.810> leaf

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
standard leaf

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.770 
standard leaf
this<00:01:59.939> one<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:01.020> think<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.189> cherry

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
this one is I think it's just a cherry

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.580 
this one is I think it's just a cherry
yeah<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> basic<00:02:04.770> cherry<00:02:05.040> tomato

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.869 

and<00:02:08.590> you<00:02:08.679> can<00:02:08.830> see<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.069> scalp<00:02:09.310> leaf<00:02:09.580> again

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:22.530 

here<00:02:15.879> is<00:02:16.090> an<00:02:16.390> ox<00:02:16.720> heart<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:22.180> leaf<00:02:22.390> of

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
here is an ox heart and the leaf of

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.270 
here is an ox heart and the leaf of
scalp<00:02:22.840> but<00:02:23.049> it's<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.260> little<00:02:23.470> more<00:02:23.590> pointy<00:02:23.799> so

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
scalp but it's a little more pointy so

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.680 
scalp but it's a little more pointy so
you<00:02:24.400> start<00:02:24.640> getting<00:02:24.670> changes<00:02:25.299> in<00:02:25.480> how<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
you start getting changes in how the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.369 
you start getting changes in how the
tomato<00:02:26.530> leaf<00:02:27.420> scalp<00:02:28.420> looks<00:02:28.720> some<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.140> them<00:02:29.230> are

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
tomato leaf scalp looks some of them are

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.119 
tomato leaf scalp looks some of them are
more<00:02:29.530> rounded

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
more rounded

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.020 
more rounded
some<00:02:30.519> of<00:02:30.610> them<00:02:30.730> are<00:02:30.849> more<00:02:31.000> pointed<00:02:31.450> and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
some of them are more pointed and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.650 
some of them are more pointed and
there's<00:02:34.030> another<00:02:34.299> variation<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:36.660> the
