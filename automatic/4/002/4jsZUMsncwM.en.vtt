00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.649
 Let's start the assembly of our tree 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:11.820
 the trunk of ours we will use five 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:15.450
 cd that is the silver and us 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.750
 People use twenty-two dvds. 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.199
 are these more the only x to stay 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:37.829
 different trunk with the forces to spend 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:40.440
 good movies or in the middle that the pomegranate only 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.789
 this quest told the king's house to stay 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.559
 so now almost being born first 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.770
 gets ready for way you think more 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.770
 harmonious and then glue hot glue 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:02.750
 feel a pine turkey come in but 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.750
 lose your taste 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.689
 now we're going to make a star put 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.170
 our tree 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:18.420
 I am using in that if these 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:30.150
 plastic pot lids that reason to 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:37.799
 first law for people here I have one 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:40.310
 here the hand prevents someone from 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.680
 hurt with mistrust when 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.369
 put these 10 travel art for alone 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.200
 to be easier to visualize 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.189
 so now we're going to try our 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.189
 star using the stained glass amaro 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.930
 who does so 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.910
 now the time this star talks 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:23.670
 star on the top, so I put 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:25.340
 hot glue here is a little piece of 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.480
 help 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:35.760
 also removed from the styrofoam tray suffered 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:48.450
 to enter higher is that again 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:51.030
 the front glue and our star 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.209
 only we 'll play like that in the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:01.560
 tips 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:03.540
 now that it had already placed in 2 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.650
 little piece of cardboard I want her 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.650
 stay with the team 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:31.210
 and thus we finalize our tree of 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:36.280
 christmas made of dvds and cds and the star 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:40.450
 made with pot lids of 12 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.310
 if you suddenly have a lot of space 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.510
 little one can ride the tree because 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.880
 does not have space 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.900
 is a great option for you to put in the 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.440
 wall 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.340
 Congratulations, and see you later. 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.340
 thank you very much
