00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.260
 Hi, how are I ? 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.680
 I have a tutorial on how to hack 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.780
 our prince olivera good let's go to 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.860
 do the following the links are handled 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.860
 of the description of the video 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.220
 and once the two have been downloaded 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:23.859
 files but the different links we go 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.859
 to extract the file pirate psp 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:33.170
 ok and once extracted we will be in 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.630
 a folder and inside it see another 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.680
 call game that folder king we're going to 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.470
 put in our prince 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.250
 let's go to our country 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.250
 my team 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.970
 and even one inside once inside 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.980
 the root of the prince 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.440
 ps 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.180
 that folder called game we 're going to 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.180
 come to the folder called psp 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.230
 ok is going to tell us that if we want it 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 replace the door that you give him 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.080
 that if nothing happens 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.080
 that was already replaced 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.810
 and now we're going with the next one with 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.770
 the next winrar file we are going to 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.579
 give extract here 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.289
 and we will extract another folder 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:30.229
 plate identifier what is it used for 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.659
 this this serves to verify if 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:37.800
 we do not have a suitcase plate 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:42.120
 depending on our version ok 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.130
 and well, this file verifies us 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.240
 that of plates we have 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.130
 here are the ones that can not be hacked 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.030
 and those that can be hacked or 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.049
 free or have with pandora or chicken 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:02.260
 and well, that president is going to 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.230
 see equal to the gay folder of the cafes 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.740
 we drag it 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.740
 okay 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:20.500
 and then I see them with the good pcpe and a 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.270
 Once inside the pp we are going to go to the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.620
 folder games 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:29.070
 we are going to open four files p esp 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.070
 did not 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.569
 product of that young man and if pl flash is 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.000
 the first one that we are going to execute is going to be 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.610
 provoked with the x key 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.420
 it arrives once executed, it appears 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.010
 a black screen we will give you in 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.549
 x 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.760
 ok let's give in x after again we 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.640
 will ask for x and ok once done 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.550
 that already be able to wipe their games 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.550
 but if you have 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.670
 if you were to remove or be 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.290
 the skin fell or it came to them 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.270
 to download they will execute fatzer cover and ok 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:24.960
 for those who do not have damn plate 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:27.990
 can run the cpl flyer so that he 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:33.130
 the pcpe s is totally pirated already 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.990
 forever and thus taking away your memory 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.720
 and nothing happens 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.000
 nothing happens by taking away his memory with 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.160
 the flash because it already keeps him pirate from 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.720
 permanently but if you have the 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:50.200
 damn plate you will not be able to run this 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.260
 because you give yourself a component 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.180
 decomposes and so good to verify 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.690
 our damn device does not exist in the 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.590
 video I told them an image of what psps if 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.430
 They can be released and what not this is 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.780
 to check your model 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.780
 let's wait for him to run 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.650
 okay 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:21.100
 ok and once here we are going to go to 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.930
 look where the asterisks are 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.570
 blue 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.360
 let's find where it says woman word 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.910
 model and there we can see our model 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.680
 as you can see good I do not know if what 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.250
 they learn to see says 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.250
 torch 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.240
 0 79 1 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.850
 and to get out of here they give him in the dance 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.670
 in the description I will leave the image 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.710
 what psps can flash 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.020
 permanently to be able to play their 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.930
 games without worrying about taking them 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.820
 the battery or the memory and so good we 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.680
 we see inside the tutorial 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:08.800
 well here once having returned from 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.970
 pirate the psp with version 6.60 pro 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.970
 from 10 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.710
 here are the ones that can not be left 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.680
 pirated 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.610
 permanently that would be of the tea 085 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.570
 b2 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.300
 down below those portable stations do not 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.599
 they can leave 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.060
 as I explain, you can not leave 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.740
 pirated permanently because 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.460
 supposedly has a damn dish and 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.740
 if you were to install the flash 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.069
 they came to manufacture and it's as if 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.810
 they had a cell phone of yesteryear in 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:47.560
 you without long sheet or games and 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.150
 would hold and then I recommend that 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.940
 only do it with the notions that 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.280
 they are in green 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.740
 with those who are on the green train and who 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.370
 those islands can hack ok 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.370
 until next time
