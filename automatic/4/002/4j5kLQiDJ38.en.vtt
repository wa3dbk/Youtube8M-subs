the pressure of the automatic system in

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.589 
the pressure of the automatic system in
the<00:02:51.099> terminal<00:02:51.519> is<00:02:51.700> regulated<00:02:52.420> by<00:02:52.450> a

the terminal is regulated by a

stable<00:02:54.760> between<00:02:55.719> 35<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.319> 40<00:02:56.920> psi<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:59.049> this<00:02:59.079> is

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
stable between 35 and 40 psi so this is

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.289 
stable between 35 and 40 psi so this is

you haven't seen the fills video of the

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
coal terminal yet I'd recommend that one

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.520 
coal terminal yet I'd recommend that one
too<00:03:15.669> there<00:03:16.090> are<00:03:16.180> some<00:03:16.359> hilarious<00:03:16.659> shots<00:03:17.260> in<00:03:17.439> it

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
too there are some hilarious shots in it

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.120 
too there are some hilarious shots in it
thanks<00:03:18.340> for<00:03:18.430> watching<00:03:18.790> bye
