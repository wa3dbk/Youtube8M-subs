00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.969
 Fashion is a laboratory a laboratory

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:09.639
 can 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.269
 and then of course there are the possibilities that is fashion designers yet 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.609
 Designing something that may not necessarily come now then comes yours 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.649
 so happens beyond the portable lies 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:26.049
 nevertheless, an interpretation of the body means percent and there 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.009
 lived for one 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:30.999
 and the future is exceeded 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:34.019
 months of work went up in the students' designs 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:38.109
 Above all, they should find their own handwriting 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:43.700

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.700
 also clearly in 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.319
 anyway or maybe borders have been crossed and that's it 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.060
 our students and every good designer try to push the boundaries 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:05.799
 and that can then have the effect that with his work the whole 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.059
 Fashion world changes facts 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:11.059
 gone pledges 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:17.000
 The carnival is a word for me when it comes to the young designers 

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:20.279
 The boundaries between fashion and art will increasingly blur in the future 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.289
 Anyway, at the show they have proven that they have their designs 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.699
 Looks like it's not just for a few minutes yet 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.129
