there and just print it off but I really

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.460 
there and just print it off but I really
don't<00:02:46.860> recommend<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:48.570> probably<00:02:48.900> should

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
don't recommend that you probably should

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.050 
don't recommend that you probably should
have<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.650> press<00:02:50.040> because<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.490> really<00:02:50.760> need<00:02:50.910> to

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
have a press because you really need to

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.320 
have a press because you really need to
hold<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:52.050> t-shirt<00:02:52.740> down<00:02:53.460> and<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:54.030> want<00:02:54.210> to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
hold that t-shirt down and you want to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.010 
hold that t-shirt down and you want to
have<00:02:54.750> your<00:02:54.870> screen<00:02:55.170> land<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.770> right<00:02:55.950> spot

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
have your screen land in the right spot

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.700 
have your screen land in the right spot
especially<00:02:58.020> if<00:02:58.080> you're<00:02:58.170> making<00:02:58.410> more<00:02:58.530> than

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
especially if you're making more than

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.480 
especially if you're making more than
one<00:02:58.890> t-shirt<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.930> then<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.800> can<00:03:02.070> print<00:03:02.340> it

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
one t-shirt and then you can print it

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:20.150 
one t-shirt and then you can print it
and<00:03:02.670> it's<00:03:02.820> easy<00:03:18.440> well<00:03:19.440> first<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.770> have<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.980> dry

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
and it's easy well first you have to dry

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.940 
and it's easy well first you have to dry
the<00:03:20.220> ink<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:21.380> basically<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.530> just<00:03:22.560> need<00:03:22.830> to

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
the ink and basically you just need to

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.220 
the ink and basically you just need to
expose<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:25.550> maybe<00:03:26.550> 340<00:03:27.420> degrees<00:03:27.510> roughly

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
expose it to maybe 340 degrees roughly

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.010 
expose it to maybe 340 degrees roughly
and<00:03:28.730> heat<00:03:29.730> set<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.030> ink<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.600> then<00:03:30.720> it'll<00:03:30.900> be

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
and heat set that ink and then it'll be

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:40.910 
and heat set that ink and then it'll be
wash<00:03:31.440> fast<00:03:31.740> and<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.070> can<00:03:32.250> wear<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.490> uh<00:03:39.920> not

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
wash fast and you can wear it uh not

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.890 
wash fast and you can wear it uh not
really<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.760> much<00:03:41.820> in<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.300> clothes<00:03:42.540> dryer<00:03:42.570> I

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
really so much in the clothes dryer I

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.020 
really so much in the clothes dryer I
wouldn't<00:03:43.530> recommend<00:03:44.010> doing<00:03:44.070> that<00:03:44.400> that's

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
wouldn't recommend doing that that's

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.510 
wouldn't recommend doing that that's
going<00:03:45.240> to<00:03:45.330> make<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.510> huge<00:03:45.990> mess<00:03:46.880> you<00:03:47.880> can<00:03:48.030> use<00:03:48.240> a

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
going to make a huge mess you can use a

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.490 
going to make a huge mess you can use a
