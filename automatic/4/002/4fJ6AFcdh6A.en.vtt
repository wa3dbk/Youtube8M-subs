00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
trying to get to at the end of a story I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.050 
trying to get to at the end of a story I
could<00:01:34.799> turn<00:01:35.009> myself<00:01:35.189> into<00:01:35.460> sort<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.789> a<00:01:35.909> machine

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
could turn myself into sort of a machine

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.819 
could turn myself into sort of a machine
that<00:01:36.270> would<00:01:36.509> write<00:01:36.659> these<00:01:36.810> stories<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.530> wasn't

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
that would write these stories it wasn't

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:38.989 
that would write these stories it wasn't
about<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.039> stories<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:38.609> about<00:01:38.850> like

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
about the stories it was about like

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.550 
about the stories it was about like
getting<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> process<00:01:39.719> right<00:01:39.929> and<00:01:39.960> once<00:01:40.409> I

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
getting the process right and once I

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.289 
getting the process right and once I
figured<00:01:41.069> out<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.249> process<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.819> both<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
figured out the process and both the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.179 
figured out the process and both the
Machine<00:01:42.630> then<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.229> stories<00:01:43.560> would<00:01:43.710> would

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
Machine then the stories would would

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.239 
Machine then the stories would would
come<00:01:44.399> my<00:01:45.149> idea<00:01:45.509> was<00:01:45.719> like<00:01:45.929> if<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.799> had<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.069> read

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:47.249 
come my idea was like if I had just read

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:49.099 
come my idea was like if I had just read
hundreds<00:01:47.609> of<00:01:47.729> stories<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.450> surely<00:01:48.960> like

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
hundreds of stories then surely like

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.109 
hundreds of stories then surely like

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
good reasons I see now by the time I was

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.580 
good reasons I see now by the time I was

pretty upset about and I think it was
1999<00:02:50.590> or<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.850> stories<00:02:52.510> were<00:02:52.630> in

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
1999 or so that the stories were in

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.080 
1999 or so that the stories were in
drawn<00:02:52.990> and<00:02:53.170> quarterly<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:54.310> stories<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.760> then

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
around that time I also sent five

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.980 
around that time I also sent five
stories<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.280> Dave<00:02:57.460> Eggers<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.180> McSweeney's
