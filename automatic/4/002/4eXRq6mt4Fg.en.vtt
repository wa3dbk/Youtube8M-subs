00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:05.250
 To reach this goal I hope that the study is very well 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.610
 his messages in which my time there was a side effect and about color 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.200
 of hair that I bring 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.459
 but first of all to say 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.930
 only the fact of bringing very dramatic colors has triumphed 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.560
 because they are not high attention one has to give them maintenance to make them look 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.999
 hermosillo are - logic then I like 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:32.800
 everything this idea more natural my normal hair 6 chestnut bush 1 and I 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.179
 I have gone for everything except and in a 6 honey or two weeks that are perfect 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.330
 for me because they are low maintenance 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.930
 Tarragona to prevent you from suddenly hiking 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.819
 much more one of them really starts 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:52.979
 and the rest of the hair a little brighter and this I do at home 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.400
 there are many types like this for example 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.300
 the one who has someone 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.890
 10 that are especially for the magazine I like because it feels very fast 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.020
 they do not do an activity called commission all 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.990
 and so so but the grace iniesta ellis have chosen the color 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.500
 I recommend you go to all much clearer than your hair tone 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.260
 unless she is preparing a black root for good black hair 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.000
 those tones are pretty much easier for natural blondes too 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.320
 it's more for the two adulterated sides like mine that already do as a 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.030
 chestnut ita there miguel ojeda only that sometimes costs a little the letter in this 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.030
 case the ejido a musical chestnut has achieved 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.539
 here it is 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.979
 the tone of this color that is not even perfect and not less once on the street 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.430
 it really looks like the lights 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.610
 they are continuing and this makes my challenge that I have to do it of lights 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 or four months later without any worry 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.649
 these kits what I like is that they come with everything you have why they do 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.889
 his blows and all this has good because I imagine that this period has been 

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:11.089
 well the color 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.319
 if the third act 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.189

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.439
 the evening the hair keeps looking luminous 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.760

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.859
 any 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.079
 now I usually 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.050
 cost 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.440

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.690
 I will be the root and so so and I'll take the 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.990
