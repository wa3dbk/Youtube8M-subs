00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.179
 today we look at the dark side 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.480
 cooking 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.410
 or rather today we talk a little about 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.389
 spices 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.619
 or which ones I like to call them all the same 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.930
 let's start with the most common 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.359
 black pepper simple spices 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.250
 how many people I know at least 80 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.820
 percentage uses ground black pepper 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.780
 as soon as you grind knocks 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.380
 or in the mill right in the dish it will be 1 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.629
 5 frames from it are more tasty than ground 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.340
 used not only in meat and fish 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.710
 and vegetable dishes 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.170
 can also be used in small doses 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.210
 in the manufacture of gingerbread chic 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.710
 suitable for cooking Odessa 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.449
 coffee with milk 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.640
 Lavruk I will not tell today 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.510
 to the fact that you use laurels each 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.809
 day everywhere 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.030
 she is good in soups she is good in vegetables 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.610
 dishes and in meat and also in pickles 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.470
 pickles and dumplings to 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.229
 following one of the main options 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.740
 spices is coriander this is a grain 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.770
 cilantro 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.140
 after the hops-suneli can say 2 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.320
 spice in Georgian cuisine 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.939
 used in vegetables meat mainly but 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.140
 also you know him well by 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.030
 Borodino bread has a very bright 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.130
 Aron taste quite nice to use 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.740
 and flax in the form of a hammer so that it does not 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.780
 stood out so bright otherwise it turns out there 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.320
 the explosions of taste next let's 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.320
 will consider 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.090
 allspice unlike black 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.520
 his place in the kitchen and in fish is insane 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.070
 emphasizes it on the one hand on the other 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.780
 sides it can also be used in 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.460
 sweet dishes and or marinades 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.290
 cinnamon i understand that most of you 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.300
 associated with apples 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.420
 but it is so cinnamon madly suited to 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.730
 apple in addition to this mulled wine 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.680
 without cinnamon it's just some kind of boiled 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.310
 wine and it also fits well 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.040
 an orange 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.730
 which can be mixed with chicken can 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.740
 say that to the bird and a little to its meat 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.330
 can use completely small 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.610
 doses otherwise she will score the rest 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.150
 flavor and also used in gingerbread and 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.450
 sweet in any dishes Baden 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.610
 many know him as anise his other 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.180
 the name you will not call Annis because 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.050
 anise 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.800
 this herb has a very very strong 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.990
 aroma and 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.030
 and no less strong taste which 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.220
 reminds you all sorts of pharmacy 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.920
 drugs possibly in childhood I had 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.590
 more pleasant and from such associations I have 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.380
 it is not very pleasant to use it 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.930
 all sweets 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.690
 and also in fish dishes it is good 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.500
 combination with cinnamon but put it 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.930
 less otherwise he will hammer it 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.390
 carnation consists of two parts 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.380
 hats so small which 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.460
 crumbles onto powder and tight legs 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.220
 the foot is more commonly used for 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.900
 cooking marinades and or let's say in 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.570
 fish in small quantities while 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.850
 cap is much better suited for 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.040
 cooking sweets she softer 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.830
 what else can you say about the carnation she 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.330
 very, very strong in flavor and taste 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.840
 so use at minimum 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.110
 quantities 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.170
 begin to beat the rest of the world 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.350
 used in vegetables in meat more 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.120
 degree insanely well suited to let 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.620
 and so if you cook stew 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.400
 cabbage or even cabbage soup 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.270
 put tweak not on will not regret zira 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.340
 she's jira she's the same cumin tell one 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.650
 of the main 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.880
 spices in Central Asian cuisine you her 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.570
 you know of course 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:59.110
 on pilaf because pilaf is without zira and i don't 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.720
 I know how to soup without beets from this conclusion 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.620
 it comes to meat bird if you 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.080
 cook indian dishes there as well without 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.210
 she can not do 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.820
 fennel seeds have exactly the same 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.209
 taste like fennel onion 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.220
 but it can be added in smaller 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.709
 quantities it is easier to find yes and 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.820
 it is stored for a couple of years longer 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.210
 also used along with 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.160
 cumin and rezero and and cumin in meat and 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.810
 vegetables 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.210
 addition to this has wonderful 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.870
 this digestion properties 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.290
 therefore, in India, grain is often served in 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.780
 Filip's Day is straight with sugar after a meal 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.930
 no Georgian dish managed surnames 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.030
 from meat or vegetables was not talking about 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.310
 to cope is not complete without hops-suneli 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.120
 if you want to make art what you 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.320
 need hops suneli if you want 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.190
 do ussuri now you need 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.850
 hops suneli 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.260
 your dish will be transformed by these 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.140
 flavors and flavors because 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.300
 hops suneli is a mixture of herbs and some 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.480
 spices that grow in the region of Georgia 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:13.580
 besides, the more herbs are tastier 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:16.740
 be sure to watch though who will tell you 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.800
 I have long tried to remember the name of this 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.950
 spices you remembered and called sumah 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 also came to us from the foothills of the Caucasus 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.660
 and imagine yourself sour ground 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.640
 berries I used to think that pomegranate but no 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.950
 I was told that it is not so good 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.400
 suitable for cooking pilaf kebabs 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:38.040
 and all sorts of other local dishes paprika 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.380
 unlike hot red pepper and her 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.900
 can there be many very well suited to 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.780
 vegetables and meat dishes 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.260
 is the basis of almost ryan 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:52.820
 body taste Kulish and tomatoes and 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.690
 it is paprika that make Hungarian cuisine 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.900
 not so much in taste as suppose 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.330
 carnation 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.300
 or cinnamon therefore some amount 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:06.400
 can be added for tinting 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.960
 dishes let's say turmeric dumplings 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.930
 in Asia, meets left and right 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.090
 the reason for having 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:18.140
 antiseptic properties so if 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.260
 are you cooking something asian in asia then 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.270
 there is no know when she was murdered 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.550
 add to perfect fit in principle 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.530
 to any vegetable and meat and fish dishes 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.390
 what is it used for most often 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.880
 to tint something because 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.250
 that it turns everything into yellow very 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.020
 much so if you do not have enough light 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.520
 in the sauce, add a little turmeric on 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.520
 at the same time ibiza grow and 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:05.220
 it 's almost coconuts in coconut phase
