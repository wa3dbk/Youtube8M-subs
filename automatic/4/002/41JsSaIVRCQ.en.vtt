so<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:44.969> has<00:00:45.210> changed<00:00:46.100> primarily<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.760> far<00:00:48.059> as

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
so what has changed primarily as far as

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.880 
so what has changed primarily as far as
the<00:00:48.480> diesel<00:00:48.840> market<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.320> concerned<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
the diesel market is concerned the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.479 
the diesel market is concerned the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
bigger intercoolers those things we do

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.370 
bigger intercoolers those things we do
and<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.320> well<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.240> really<00:01:18.240> pride<00:01:18.600> myself

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and we do well but I really pride myself

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.530 
and we do well but I really pride myself
in<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> fact<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.670> we're<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
in the fact that we're in the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.590 
in the fact that we're in the
electronics<00:01:22.110> business<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.820> speaking

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
electronics business I see and speaking

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.380 
electronics business I see and speaking
of<00:01:24.659> electronics<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:26.220> have<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> new<00:01:26.790> program

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
of electronics you have a new program

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.539 
of electronics you have a new program
that<00:01:27.420> even<00:01:28.049> applies<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.619> gas<00:01:28.829> engines<00:01:29.400> I

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
that even applies to gas engines I

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.819 
that even applies to gas engines I
understand<00:01:30.060> yeah<00:01:30.390> we're<00:01:31.259> into<00:01:31.470> methanol

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
understand yeah we're into methanol

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.090 
understand yeah we're into methanol
injection<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> new<00:01:33.509> idea<00:01:33.829> but<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
injection it's not a new idea but the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.350 
injection it's not a new idea but the
way<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.490> control<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.540> completely<00:01:37.110> new<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
way we control it is completely new and

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.990 
way we control it is completely new and
most<00:01:39.360> people<00:01:39.750> have<00:01:39.869> used<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> past<00:01:41.000> for

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
most people have used it in the past for

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.249 
most people have used it in the past for
just<00:01:42.509> pure<00:01:42.899> power<00:01:43.850> we're<00:01:44.850> currently<00:01:45.570> working

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
just pure power we're currently working

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.700 
just pure power we're currently working
on<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.130> Pikes<00:01:47.460> Peak<00:01:47.610> project<00:01:48.530> which<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.680> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
on a Pikes Peak project which is a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.609 
on a Pikes Peak project which is a
freightliner<00:01:50.340> detroit<00:01:50.790> diesel<00:01:51.000> powered

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619

10,000<00:01:52.619> pound<00:01:52.860> race<00:01:53.579> truck<00:01:54.170> we're<00:01:55.170> taking<00:01:55.320> up

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
10,000 pound race truck we're taking up

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.600 
10,000 pound race truck we're taking up
Pikes<00:01:55.829> Peak<00:01:57.049> it's<00:01:58.049> 2400<00:01:58.860> horsepower<00:01:58.890> and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
Pikes Peak it's 2400 horsepower and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.359 
Pikes Peak it's 2400 horsepower and
we're<00:02:00.600> adding<00:02:00.840> another<00:02:00.990> 400<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.189> with<00:02:02.340> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
we're adding another 400 just with a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.499 
we're adding another 400 just with a
methanol<00:02:02.880> Wow<00:02:03.540> yeah<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.920> powerful<00:02:05.310> stuff

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
methanol Wow yeah so it's powerful stuff

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.589 
methanol Wow yeah so it's powerful stuff
but<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.780> reduce<00:02:07.079> emissions<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.829> improve

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
but you can reduce emissions and improve

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.839 
but you can reduce emissions and improve
fuel<00:02:09.599> efficiency<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:10.619> well<00:02:10.800> okay<00:02:11.790> so

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
fuel efficiency with it as well okay so

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.400 
fuel efficiency with it as well okay so
pick<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.569> choose<00:02:12.810> if<00:02:13.200> you

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
pick and choose if you

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.460 
pick and choose if you
economy<00:02:13.920> or<00:02:14.100> power<00:02:14.310> yeah<00:02:14.820> uh<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:16.050> you're<00:02:16.260> into

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
economy or power yeah uh if you're into

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.880 
economy or power yeah uh if you're into
the<00:02:16.560> environmental<00:02:17.460> movement<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.030> am

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
the environmental movement and I am

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.350 
the environmental movement and I am
that's<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.070> component<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.730> always<00:02:21.180> like<00:02:21.330> to

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
that's the component I always like to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.330 
that's the component I always like to
have<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.990> any<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.260> our<00:02:22.380> products<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:22.950> got<00:02:23.190> to

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
have and any of our products it's got to

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.810 
have and any of our products it's got to
be<00:02:23.460> clean<00:02:24.110> okay<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.170> we've<00:02:26.100> got<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> best<00:02:26.610> of

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
be clean okay so we've got the best of
