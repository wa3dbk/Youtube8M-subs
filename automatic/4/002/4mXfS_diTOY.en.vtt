out of the ways you can tell it's way

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.399 
out of the ways you can tell it's way
above<00:01:32.310> their<00:01:32.460> back<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.780> only<00:01:33.930> dawned<00:01:34.229> on

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
above their back but if I only dawned on

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.469 
above their back but if I only dawned on
me<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:35.040> order<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> fence<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.060> remain

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
me in order for the fence to remain

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.880 
me in order for the fence to remain
intact<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.079> didn't<00:01:37.290> cut<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.680> way<00:01:37.829> to

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
intact I didn't cut it all the way to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.530 
intact I didn't cut it all the way to
the<00:01:38.040> bottom<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.490> left<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> strip<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> fence

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the bottom I left the strip of the fence

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.030 
the bottom I left the strip of the fence
intact<00:01:39.960> at<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> bottom<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.799> would<00:01:40.920> hold

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
intact at the bottom so it would hold

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.670 
intact at the bottom so it would hold
its<00:01:41.280> shape<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.840> finally<00:01:43.020> occurred<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.530> me

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
its shape and it finally occurred to me

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.130 
its shape and it finally occurred to me
they<00:01:43.890> didn't<00:01:44.130> want<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.310> cross<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.729> fence<00:01:45.140> so

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
they didn't want to cross that fence so

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.710 
they didn't want to cross that fence so
I<00:01:46.439> had<00:01:46.890> an<00:01:47.009> old<00:01:47.159> piece<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.579> piece<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.630> a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.330 
homemade pallet that we had laying
around<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.560> said<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.770> need<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.009> make<00:01:53.130> them<00:01:53.220> a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
around I said I need to make them a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.840 
around I said I need to make them a
bridge<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.200> went<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.799> put<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.430> piece

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
bridge so I went and put to that piece

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.639 
bridge so I went and put to that piece
of<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.060> pallet<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:57.840> see<00:01:58.079> I'm<00:01:58.530> gonna

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
of a pallet that you can see I'm gonna

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.139 
of a pallet that you can see I'm gonna
get<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> little<00:01:58.979> closer<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.759> see<00:01:59.850> it

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
get a little closer so you can see it

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.090 
get a little closer so you can see it
and<00:02:00.450> they've<00:02:00.659> actually<00:02:00.869> moved<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.590> from<00:02:01.890> where

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
and they've actually moved it from where

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.429 
and they've actually moved it from where
I<00:02:02.130> originally<00:02:02.579> had<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.180> had<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.750> all<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.110> way

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
I originally had it I had it all the way

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.950 
I originally had it I had it all the way
in<00:02:04.649> here<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.729> right<00:02:05.969> up<00:02:06.149> over<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.659> edge<00:02:06.810> of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
in here just right up over the edge of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
in here just right up over the edge of
the<00:02:07.049> fence<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.590> put<00:02:07.829> feet<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.069> top<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
the fence and I put feet on top of the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.880 
the fence and I put feet on top of the
planks<00:02:09.239> well<00:02:09.660> guess<00:02:10.050> what<00:02:10.229> lickety-split

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
planks well guess what lickety-split

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.380 
planks well guess what lickety-split
here<00:02:11.099> they<00:02:11.250> came<00:02:11.430> one<00:02:12.330> right<00:02:12.510> out<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.780> other

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
here they came one right out the other

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.059 
here they came one right out the other
their<00:02:13.600> way<00:02:13.720> across<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.050> board<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.710> in<00:02:14.830> this

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
their way across that board and in this

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.390 
their way across that board and in this
garden<00:02:15.430> spot<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:17.050> can<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.680> train<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:17.950> pig<00:02:18.220> to

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
garden spot so can you train a pig to

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.000 
garden spot so can you train a pig to
hotwire<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:20.050> train<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.319> pig<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.740> hotwire

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
hotwire you can train a pig to hotwire

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.520 
hotwire you can train a pig to hotwire
and<00:02:21.520> remember<00:02:22.420> don't<00:02:22.900> put<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.290> somewhere

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
and remember don't put it somewhere

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.350 
and remember don't put it somewhere
where<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:24.069> eventually<00:02:24.370> want<00:02:24.790> them<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.060> cross

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
where you eventually want them to cross

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.960 
where you eventually want them to cross
because<00:02:26.080> they<00:02:26.350> won't<00:02:26.560> go<00:02:26.770> well<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.670> guess<00:02:27.850> they

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
because they won't go well I guess they

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.220 
because they won't go well I guess they
will<00:02:28.150> eventually<00:02:28.660> but<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.840> got<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.140> get

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
will eventually but you got to get

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.670 
will eventually but you got to get
creative<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.800> get<00:02:29.950> them<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.190> go<00:02:30.340> oh<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:32.470> got<00:02:32.650> a

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
creative to get them to go oh we got a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.250 
creative to get them to go oh we got a
venturous<00:02:33.610> one<00:02:33.820> now<00:02:36.600> he's<00:02:37.600> checking<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.140> out

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
venturous one now he's checking it out

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.890 
venturous one now he's checking it out
so<00:02:38.500> that's<00:02:38.709> good<00:02:38.950> they'll<00:02:39.250> be<00:02:39.459> at<00:02:40.360> home<00:02:40.660> in

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
so that's good they'll be at home in

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.770 
so that's good they'll be at home in
here<00:02:41.050> for<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.290> while<00:02:42.120> rains<00:02:43.120> coming<00:02:43.450> I'll<00:02:43.660> have

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
here for a while rains coming I'll have

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.910 
here for a while rains coming I'll have
to<00:02:43.870> come<00:02:43.989> back<00:02:44.110> out<00:02:44.230> here<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.500> make<00:02:44.620> sure<00:02:44.739> that

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
to come back out here and make sure that

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.620 
to come back out here and make sure that
they<00:02:45.069> cross<00:02:45.370> back<00:02:45.670> in<00:02:47.400> anyway<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.700> there's

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
they cross back in anyway so there's

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.840 
they cross back in anyway so there's
that
