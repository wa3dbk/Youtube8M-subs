00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.010 

look<00:00:53.160> for<00:00:53.340> lower<00:00:53.460> prices<00:00:53.760> that's<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:54.930> I'm

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
look for lower prices that's what I'm

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.000 
look for lower prices that's what I'm
doing<00:00:56.090> keep<00:00:57.090> your<00:00:57.210> powder<00:00:57.360> dry<00:00:57.829> wait<00:00:58.829> for

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
doing keep your powder dry wait for

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.560 
doing keep your powder dry wait for
those<00:00:59.100> lower<00:00:59.309> prices<00:00:59.789> if<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.030> want<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.329> sell

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
those lower prices if you want to sell

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.439 
those lower prices if you want to sell
and<00:01:00.899> come<00:01:01.590> back<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> risky

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
and come back in that is a risky

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.969 
and come back in that is a risky
maneuver<00:01:05.540> because<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:07.530> you're<00:01:07.710> selling

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
maneuver because if you're selling

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.870 
maneuver because if you're selling
physical<00:01:08.159> there's<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.689> spread<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.369> huge

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
physical there's the spread is so huge

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.910 
physical there's the spread is so huge
you<00:01:12.479> need<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.760> three<00:01:15.150> dollar<00:01:15.180> move

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
you need to see like a three dollar move

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.649 
you need to see like a three dollar move
for<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> actually<00:01:17.880> start<00:01:18.299> seeing<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
for you to actually start seeing a

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.770 
for you to actually start seeing a
profit<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.700> would<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.900> suggest<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.780> look

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
profit so I would not suggest a one look

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.719 
profit so I would not suggest a one look
for<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.530> trade<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.220> have<00:01:26.430> if

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
for that kind of trade if you have if

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.760 
for that kind of trade if you have if
you're<00:01:27.360> obviously<00:01:27.689> trading<00:01:28.140> SLV<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you're obviously trading SLV and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.160 
you're obviously trading SLV and
something<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.159> obviously<00:01:29.840> then<00:01:30.840> fine

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
something like that obviously then fine

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.319 
something like that obviously then fine
there<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.890> no<00:01:32.040> overhead<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:34.700> physical<00:01:35.700> there

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
there is no overhead but physical there

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.450 
there is no overhead but physical there
is<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.470> you're<00:01:37.710> looking<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.340> those

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
is so you're looking for that of those

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.730 
is so you're looking for that of those

eighteen dollars and eighty cents that

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.910 
eighteen dollars and eighty cents that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
starts to fall I'm going to see silver

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.699 
starts to fall I'm going to see silver
fall<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> little<00:02:10.560> bit

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
fall a little bit

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.610 
fall a little bit
probably<00:02:12.709> going<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.010> stop<00:02:13.280> around<00:02:13.700> 12<00:02:14.620> not

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
probably going to stop around 12 not

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.259 
probably going to stop around 12 not
well<00:02:15.860> but<00:02:15.890> $13<00:02:17.769> that's<00:02:18.769> where<00:02:19.489> some<00:02:19.760> solid

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
well but $13 that's where some solid

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.289 
well but $13 that's where some solid
support<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:21.230> don't<00:02:21.500> see<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.129> going<00:02:22.340> past

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
support is I don't see it going past

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.670 
support is I don't see it going past
that<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:24.230> far<00:02:24.620> but<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:25.610> could<00:02:25.760> be<00:02:25.879> wrong<00:02:26.680> it

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
that so far but it could be wrong it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.020 
that so far but it could be wrong it
should<00:02:28.069> stop<00:02:28.489> at<00:02:28.670> 1450<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:31.000> stayed<00:02:32.000> there

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
should stop at 1450 and and stayed there

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.180 
should stop at 1450 and and stayed there
for<00:02:32.450> about<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.629> day<00:02:32.870> or<00:02:33.019> two<00:02:33.230> but<00:02:33.829> then<00:02:34.010> it's

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
for about a day or two but then it's

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.280 
for about a day or two but then it's
probably<00:02:34.459> going<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.790> once<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.659> market<00:02:36.019> starts

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
probably going to once the market starts

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.080 
probably going to once the market starts
to<00:02:36.409> fall<00:02:36.620> apart<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:37.670> probably<00:02:37.909> going<00:02:38.030> to

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
to fall apart it's probably going to

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.119 
to fall apart it's probably going to
break<00:02:38.269> through<00:02:38.569> that<00:02:39.970> so<00:02:40.970> look<00:02:41.840> for<00:02:42.049> that<00:02:42.170> look

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
break through that so look for that look

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.069 
break through that so look for that look
for<00:02:43.340> those<00:02:43.489> anything<00:02:44.120> under<00:02:44.359> fourteen<00:02:44.750> fifty
