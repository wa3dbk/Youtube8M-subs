00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
nice little small Julie box so what I

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.050 
nice little small Julie box so what I
look<00:00:21.119> at<00:00:21.240> today<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.840> um<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.550> steps<00:00:23.850> I'm<00:00:24.000> going

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
look at today is um the steps I'm going

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.740 
look at today is um the steps I'm going
to<00:00:24.240> take<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.869> fill<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.210> these<00:00:27.210> lungs<00:00:27.420> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
to take to fill up this these lungs and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.450 
to take to fill up this these lungs and
basically<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.529> logs<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:29.039> cut<00:00:29.250> them<00:00:29.340> into

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
basically the logs I cut them into

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.069 
basically the logs I cut them into
roughly<00:00:30.330> between<00:00:31.140> 24<00:00:32.040> inch<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.489> 36<00:00:33.420> inch

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
roughly between 24 inch and 36 inch

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.530 
roughly between 24 inch and 36 inch
lengths<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:34.860> they're<00:00:35.550> manageable<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
lengths so they're manageable on the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.950 
lengths so they're manageable on the
bandsaw<00:00:37.640> nothing<00:00:38.640> too<00:00:38.820> long<00:00:39.059> right<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:39.660> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
bandsaw nothing too long right now and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.049 
bandsaw nothing too long right now and
and<00:00:40.500> because<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.399> know<00:00:41.460> I'm<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.850> make<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
and because I know I'm going to make a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.119 
and because I know I'm going to make a
small<00:00:42.750> jewelry<00:00:43.020> box<00:00:43.230> out<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.500> it

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
small jewelry box out of it

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.459 
small jewelry box out of it
I<00:00:44.160> kept<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.120> link<00:00:45.300> small<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.230> they're<00:00:46.350> more

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
I kept the link small so they're more

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.119 
I kept the link small so they're more
manageable<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.940> let's<00:00:48.180> look<00:00:48.329> take<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> look<00:00:49.129> so

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
manageable so let's look take a look so

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.500 
manageable so let's look take a look so
the<00:00:50.340> first<00:00:50.579> thing<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.789> need<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.360> made

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the first thing I need to do is I made

the first thing I need to do is I made
these<00:00:51.660> three<00:00:51.899> support<00:00:52.320> blocks<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:52.860> just

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
these three support blocks that are just

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.639 
these three support blocks that are just
some<00:00:53.160> scrap<00:00:53.460> plywood<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.379> then<00:00:55.379> I've<00:00:55.500> got

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
some scrap plywood and then I've got

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.180 
some scrap plywood and then I've got
another<00:00:55.949> piece<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> half-inch<00:00:56.910> scrap<00:00:57.329> ply

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.040 
another piece of half-inch scrap ply
that's<00:00:59.190> basically<00:00:59.699> eighteen<00:01:00.239> inches<00:01:00.480> wide<00:01:00.719> by

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
that's basically eighteen inches wide by

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.950 
that's basically eighteen inches wide by
40<00:01:01.500> inches<00:01:01.710> long<00:01:02.180> so<00:01:03.180> what<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> need<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.780> now

is basically secure this link this log
this<00:01:08.189> round<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> plywood<00:01:10.320> using<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
this round to the plywood using the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.859 
this round to the plywood using the
support<00:01:11.760> block<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.360> I'm<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.570> lining

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
support block so here I'm just lining

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.410 
support block so here I'm just lining
them<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:14.790> them<00:01:14.880> all<00:01:14.970> screwed<00:01:15.299> down

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
them up and I get them all screwed down

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.719 
them up and I get them all screwed down
so<00:01:15.930> I'm<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.320> getting<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> last<00:01:16.770> support

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so I'm just getting the last support

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.010 
so I'm just getting the last support
block<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.450> place<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:20.000> these<00:01:21.000> blocks<00:01:21.540> they're

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
block in place and these blocks they're

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.469 
block in place and these blocks they're
about<00:01:22.229> 1/2<00:01:22.680> inches<00:01:22.950> wide<00:01:23.220> by<00:01:23.759> 3<00:01:24.060> inches<00:01:24.240> long

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
about 1/2 inches wide by 3 inches long

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.410 
about 1/2 inches wide by 3 inches long
and<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.170> screw<00:01:25.470> them<00:01:25.530> together<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:27.240> what's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and I just screw them together so what's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.120 
and I just screw them together so what's
that<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.689> there<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:27.900> place<00:01:27.960> I'm<00:01:28.500> basically

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
that in there in place I'm basically

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.910 
that in there in place I'm basically
lining<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.030> center<00:01:30.479> pith<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.229> log<00:01:31.470> off

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
lining up the center pith of the log off

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.969 
lining up the center pith of the log off
the<00:01:32.820> outside<00:01:33.659> edge<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> piece<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.799> plywood

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the outside edge of the piece of plywood

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.160 
the outside edge of the piece of plywood
so<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.610> checking<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.299> let's<00:01:37.020> say

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
so I'm just checking that and let's say

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.859 
so I'm just checking that and let's say
that<00:01:37.200> measurement<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.340> far<00:01:38.610> side<00:01:38.880> was<00:01:39.119> say

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that measurement on the far side was say

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.899 
that measurement on the far side was say
13<00:01:40.290> inches<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.950> I'm<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.340> near<00:01:41.640> side

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
13 inches so I'm on this near side

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.520 
13 inches so I'm on this near side
checking<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.659> making<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> sure<00:01:43.409> it's

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
checking that and making it sure it's

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.800 
checking that and making it sure it's
the<00:01:43.590> same<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.100> by<00:01:45.000> doing<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.390> I'm<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.720> to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the same and by doing this I'm going to

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.740 
the same and by doing this I'm going to
get<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.079> straight<00:01:46.439> cut<00:01:47.299> so<00:01:48.299> people<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.689> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
get that straight cut so people get a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.560 
get that straight cut so people get a
straight<00:01:49.049> edge<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> nice<00:01:50.159> cut<00:01:51.060> off<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
straight edge and get a nice cut off the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.170 
straight edge and get a nice cut off the
piece<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.930> plywood<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.820> once<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.939> get<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
piece of plywood and once I get that

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.580 
piece of plywood and once I get that
secured<00:01:54.540> down<00:01:54.720> I'm<00:01:54.899> ready<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.259> go<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
secured down I'm ready to go to the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.920 
secured down I'm ready to go to the
bandsaw<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.299> that<00:01:57.299> would<00:01:57.390> be<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> next<00:01:57.780> step

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
bandsaw and that would be the next step

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.520 
bandsaw and that would be the next step
to<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.509> here<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> bandsaw

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
to that so here at the bandsaw

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.740 
to that so here at the bandsaw
I<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> resaw<00:02:02.340> baton<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.180> about<00:02:03.329> 1<00:02:03.509> inches

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
I have a resaw baton it's about 1 inches

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.130 
I have a resaw baton it's about 1 inches
wide<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.380> 2<00:02:04.680> teeth<00:02:04.979> per<00:02:05.310> inch<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.960> I'm<00:02:06.960> just

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
wide and 2 teeth per inch and I'm just

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.380 
wide and 2 teeth per inch and I'm just
checking<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.560> height<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.250> my<00:02:08.369> blade<00:02:08.940> support

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
checking the height of my blade support

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.330 
checking the height of my blade support
that<00:02:09.750> make<00:02:09.899> sure<00:02:10.050> that's<00:02:10.289> clear<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.739> log<00:02:10.920> that

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
that make sure that's clear the log that

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.120 
that make sure that's clear the log that
I'm<00:02:11.489> be<00:02:11.670> pushing<00:02:12.150> through<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.140> bandsaw

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
I'm be pushing through the bandsaw

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.650 
I'm be pushing through the bandsaw
now<00:02:14.400> once<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.880> done<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.300> next<00:02:15.420> thing<00:02:15.510> to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
now once that is done the next thing to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.840 
now once that is done the next thing to
check<00:02:15.720> my<00:02:16.020> fence<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:17.310> make<00:02:17.580> sure<00:02:17.610> it's

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
check my fence so make sure it's

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.030 
check my fence so make sure it's
adjusted<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.390> proper<00:02:18.840> position<00:02:19.440> and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
adjusted to the proper position and

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.500 
adjusted to the proper position and
before<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.850> go<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.090> make<00:02:21.150> sure<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.420> have

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
before you go and make sure you have

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.310 
before you go and make sure you have
your<00:02:21.600> safety<00:02:22.350> glasses<00:02:22.500> on<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:23.040> course<00:02:23.250> and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
your safety glasses on of course and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
your safety glasses on of course and
basically<00:02:25.320> on<00:02:25.470> your<00:02:25.500> band<00:02:25.740> sawing

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
basically on your band sawing

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.070 
basically on your band sawing
it's<00:02:26.850> all<00:02:27.000> about<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:27.420> know<00:02:27.450> having<00:02:27.840> proper

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
it's all about you know having proper

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.520 
it's all about you know having proper
position<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.150> watching<00:02:30.150> your<00:02:30.240> feed<00:02:30.540> rate<00:02:30.870> so

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
position and watching your feed rate so

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.810 
position and watching your feed rate so
basically<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.190> don't<00:02:32.310> want<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.490> be<00:02:32.550> pushing

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
basically you don't want to be pushing

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.020 
basically you don't want to be pushing
this<00:02:33.770> big<00:02:34.770> log<00:02:35.010> through<00:02:35.280> too<00:02:35.460> quickly<00:02:35.760> and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
this big log through too quickly and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.750 
this big log through too quickly and
forcing<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:37.650> make<00:02:37.770> make<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.340> force<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
forcing to make make the force on the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.700 
forcing to make make the force on the
bait<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.000> make<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.240> cut<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.720> basically<00:02:40.470> want

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
bait to make the cut you basically want

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
bait to make the cut you basically want
to<00:02:40.860> see<00:02:41.460> how<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.670> saw<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.420> cutting<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.050> just

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
to see how the saw is cutting and just

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.210 
to see how the saw is cutting and just
let<00:02:44.730> let<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.090> saw<00:02:45.300> cut<00:02:45.690> at<00:02:45.990> its<00:02:46.200> pace<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:47.130> now

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
let let the saw cut at its pace so now

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.520 
let let the saw cut at its pace so now
here<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.490> am<00:02:47.520> halfway<00:02:47.880> through<00:02:48.300> my<00:02:48.390> cut<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
here I am halfway through my cut and the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.660 
here I am halfway through my cut and the
nice<00:02:49.680> thing<00:02:49.860> about<00:02:49.920> band<00:02:50.220> saws<00:02:50.490> are

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
nice thing about band saws are

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.920 
nice thing about band saws are
relatively<00:02:51.000> safe<00:02:51.240> just<00:02:51.480> gotta<00:02:51.630> watch<00:02:51.780> your

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
relatively safe just gotta watch your

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.500 
relatively safe just gotta watch your
fingers<00:02:52.380> clear<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.040> blade<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.490> once<00:02:54.330> I'm

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
fingers clear the blade and once I'm

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.360 
fingers clear the blade and once I'm
past<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.900> halfway<00:02:55.170> point<00:02:55.350> I<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.800> walk<00:02:56.010> around

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
past the halfway point I can walk around

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.020 
past the halfway point I can walk around
and<00:02:56.750> finish<00:02:57.750> my<00:02:57.900> cut<00:02:58.110> by<00:02:58.260> pulling<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:59.340> I'm

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
and finish my cut by pulling it and I'm

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.360 
and finish my cut by pulling it and I'm
just<00:03:00.270> finishing<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.750> board<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.320> get<00:03:02.220> my

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
just finishing the board and get my

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.860 
just finishing the board and get my
first<00:03:02.640> straight<00:03:03.090> edge<00:03:03.270> off<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.570> this

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
first straight edge off of this

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.550 
first straight edge off of this
particular<00:03:04.470> link<00:03:05.460> so<00:03:06.000> voila<00:03:06.510> there<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.320> and

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
particular link so voila there it is and

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.330 
particular link so voila there it is and
so<00:03:07.970> far<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.090> looking<00:03:09.150> great<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:10.340> here

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
so far it's looking great so here

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.370 
so far it's looking great so here
basically<00:03:11.520> I'm<00:03:11.880> repositioning<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.870> log<00:03:13.080> on

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
basically I'm repositioning the log on

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.060 
basically I'm repositioning the log on
to<00:03:13.950> get<00:03:14.070> my<00:03:14.160> second<00:03:14.870> face<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.560> remove<00:03:16.890> those

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
to get my second face so I remove those

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.530 
to get my second face so I remove those
plywood<00:03:17.640> blocks<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.180> I'm<00:03:18.240> going<00:03:18.450> to

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
plywood blocks and I'm going to

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.840 
plywood blocks and I'm going to
remeasure<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.620> follow<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.070> same<00:03:20.250> steps<00:03:20.310> as<00:03:20.790> I

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
remeasure and follow the same steps as I

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.170 
remeasure and follow the same steps as I
did<00:03:21.180> earlier<00:03:21.330> in<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.630> video<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:22.080> get<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:23.180> log

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
did earlier in the video to get this log

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.210 
did earlier in the video to get this log
secured<00:03:24.960> to<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.290> plywood<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:25.800> second

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
secured to the plywood for the second

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.510 
secured to the plywood for the second
cut<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:27.180> there<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.390> am<00:03:27.420> making<00:03:27.750> my<00:03:27.840> second<00:03:28.230> head

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
cut so there I am making my second head

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.340 
cut so there I am making my second head
again<00:03:29.520> just<00:03:30.300> basically<00:03:30.750> watch<00:03:30.930> your<00:03:31.140> feed

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
again just basically watch your feed

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.100 
again just basically watch your feed
rate<00:03:31.560> have<00:03:32.130> good<00:03:32.370> position<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.150> just<00:03:33.480> slowly

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
rate have good position and just slowly

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.930 
rate have good position and just slowly
make<00:03:34.470> your<00:03:34.500> cut<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:36.680> get<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.830> done<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.430> on

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
make your cut and get that done and on

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.570 
make your cut and get that done and on
the<00:03:39.030> next<00:03:39.360> step<00:03:39.900> here<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.890> can<00:03:41.010> see<00:03:41.280> I'm

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
the next step here you can see I'm

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.420 
the next step here you can see I'm
getting<00:03:42.030> my<00:03:42.210> third<00:03:42.480> face<00:03:42.950> roughed<00:03:43.950> out<00:03:44.160> and

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
getting my third face roughed out and

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.010 
getting my third face roughed out and
basically<00:03:45.210> I<00:03:45.360> don't<00:03:45.450> need<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.690> plywood

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
basically I don't need the plywood

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.320 
basically I don't need the plywood
anymore<00:03:46.350> because<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.640> have<00:03:47.670> two<00:03:48.000> straight

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
anymore because I have two straight

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.630 
anymore because I have two straight
edges<00:03:48.600> now<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.320> can<00:03:49.500> use<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:50.250> reference

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
edges now that I can use the reference

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.970 
edges now that I can use the reference
and<00:03:50.850> basically<00:03:51.510> just<00:03:51.840> pass<00:03:52.050> through<00:03:52.410> saw<00:03:52.710> as

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
and basically just pass through saw as

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.050 
and basically just pass through saw as
is<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.900> finally<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.930> have<00:03:55.260> my<00:03:55.440> fourth<00:03:55.910> side<00:03:56.910> to

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
is and finally I have my fourth side to

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.090 
is and finally I have my fourth side to
be<00:03:57.150> cut<00:03:57.330> I'm<00:03:57.450> adjusting<00:03:57.750> my<00:03:57.990> guard<00:03:58.620> support

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
be cut I'm adjusting my guard support

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.950 
be cut I'm adjusting my guard support

of<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:07.740> I'll<00:04:08.010> have<00:04:08.480> my<00:04:09.480> log<00:04:09.660> we'll<00:04:09.870> have<00:04:09.960> four

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
of this I'll have my log we'll have four

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.900 
of this I'll have my log we'll have four
good<00:04:10.470> sides<00:04:10.800> where<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.370> can<00:04:11.580> write<00:04:11.700> for<00:04:11.880> example

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
good sides where I can write for example

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.750 
good sides where I can write for example
anybody<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:13.020> go<00:04:13.190> so<00:04:14.190> now<00:04:14.310> I'm<00:04:14.430> going<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.640> take<00:04:14.730> a

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
anybody to go so now I'm going to take a

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.610 
anybody to go so now I'm going to take a
look<00:04:14.970> at<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.090> end<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.240> the<00:04:15.390> board<00:04:15.600> of<00:04:16.230> this<00:04:16.410> log

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
look at the end of the board of this log

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.800 
look at the end of the board of this log
and<00:04:16.950> I<00:04:17.010> just<00:04:17.130> want<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.310> see<00:04:17.540> we're<00:04:18.540> going<00:04:18.750> to

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
and I just want to see we're going to

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.630 
and I just want to see we're going to
cut<00:04:18.930> this<00:04:19.049> one<00:04:19.170> it<00:04:19.320> either<00:04:19.590> cut<00:04:19.920> the<00:04:20.100> boards

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.020 
here you want to basically add a coat of
paint<00:05:41.050> to<00:05:41.260> seal<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.620> ends<00:05:41.800> up<00:05:42.040> and<00:05:42.250> that's

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
paint to seal the ends up and that's

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.880 
paint to seal the ends up and that's
really<00:05:43.240> important<00:05:43.720> because<00:05:43.810> you<00:05:44.110> don't<00:05:44.710> want

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
really important because you don't want

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.640 
really important because you don't want
the<00:05:44.950> end<00:05:45.100> start<00:05:45.340> checking<00:05:45.610> and<00:05:45.850> cracking<00:05:46.300> and

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
the end start checking and cracking and

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.409 
the end start checking and cracking and
while<00:05:47.650> you're<00:05:47.860> having<00:05:47.979> this<00:05:48.220> air<00:05:48.970> dry<00:05:49.000> you're

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
while you're having this air dry you're

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.180 
while you're having this air dry you're
going<00:05:49.450> to<00:05:49.570> stickered<00:05:50.229> which<00:05:50.770> are<00:05:50.890> the<00:05:50.979> pieces

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
going to stickered which are the pieces

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.070 
going to stickered which are the pieces
of<00:05:51.310> plywood<00:05:51.550> are<00:05:51.880> equally<00:05:52.270> spaced<00:05:52.570> one<00:05:52.840> on<00:05:52.960> top

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
of plywood are equally spaced one on top

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.080 
of plywood are equally spaced one on top
of<00:05:53.200> the<00:05:53.260> other<00:05:53.500> this<00:05:54.190> is<00:05:54.340> important<00:05:54.850> to<00:05:54.970> allow

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
of the other this is important to allow

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.409 
of the other this is important to allow
the<00:05:55.150> air<00:05:55.360> flow<00:05:55.630> between<00:05:56.200> each<00:05:56.500> board<00:05:56.860> and

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
the air flow between each board and

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.659 
the air flow between each board and
it'll<00:05:58.419> allow<00:05:58.600> it<00:05:58.750> to<00:05:58.960> season<00:05:59.770> properly<00:06:00.460> and

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
it'll allow it to season properly and

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.640 
it'll allow it to season properly and
slowly<00:06:01.330> and<00:06:01.720> I'll<00:06:01.960> think<00:06:02.110> about<00:06:02.169> a<00:06:02.320> year

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
slowly and I'll think about a year

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.640 
slowly and I'll think about a year
before<00:06:03.510> this<00:06:04.510> wood<00:06:04.720> is<00:06:04.840> fully<00:06:05.050> seasoned<00:06:05.530> and

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
before this wood is fully seasoned and

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.730 
before this wood is fully seasoned and
ready<00:06:05.710> to<00:06:05.919> be<00:06:06.100> worked<00:06:06.360> and<00:06:07.360> the<00:06:08.260> final<00:06:08.590> thing

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
ready to be worked and the final thing

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.080 
ready to be worked and the final thing
just<00:06:09.040> before<00:06:09.400> I<00:06:09.430> start<00:06:09.640> cutting<00:06:09.760> arrested

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
just before I start cutting arrested

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.060 
just before I start cutting arrested
logs<00:06:10.300> that<00:06:10.750> I<00:06:10.780> have<00:06:11.050> you<00:06:11.620> want<00:06:11.710> to<00:06:11.830> show<00:06:12.010> you
