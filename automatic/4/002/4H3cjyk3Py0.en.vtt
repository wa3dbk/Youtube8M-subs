00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.080
 ay that transacts fleshly that yesterday here and 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.900
 welcome is this what is 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.710
 -uruguay georg mind this is the demo 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.769
 I hardly think it was public today 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.900
 March 26, 2013 when with everything 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.929
 taste and good there as you can see and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.329
 as soon as they left delaying breaking 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.789
 mother is a kit fit itself is was a quad 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.839
 but they stole the other kill and here not 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.210
 I know what happened to my audio 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:36.960
 capturing is not the subject of all that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.580
 I focused and a nice profile as not with 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.250
 all tastes here headless 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.380
 I do not know what mothers and well now yes 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.810
 I will explain this how to play 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.450
 overrun the overon game mode here 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.610
 as you can see I already know how they appear 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.370
 of low cost touching here are sea 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.560
 appearing as co and there are the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.040
 good the four coves is that of doctor 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.950
 scout and web engineer is the engineer and 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.990
 he is the one who can put the centric and 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.670
 you can change classes , you know 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.640
 when he dies not here to the before 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.390
 start the game and good 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.210
 this green what you have is a yesterday like 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.909
 pistolita, I do not know how to use a blowtorch 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.340
 game so you can say to weld and 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.610
 repair rather what are wake 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.380
 centris good not more defenses 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.290
 of the crazy because the centric ones do not 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.690
 can repair these have a limit of 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.640
 time and good to come explaining rather 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.540
 how it goes here this comes here as they can 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.190
 see the hawks have to protect this 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.780
 I'm talking about the game mode of 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.190
 You know, I know I went for all of the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.340
 more great games that come in the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.119
 play in the complete game rather in 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.039
 the end this is going to be different this 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.470
 is or brown what is in the demo 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:57.090
 and good those who have to defend the 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.710
 What is the emergency hole called? 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.780
 the son parks obviously, therefore, a 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.810
 You already know that children tell me in 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.410
 crazy but if the locust manage to destroy 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.269
 the emergency hole win the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.459
 departure and good rather the first 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.910
 round because you can take it up to me 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.330
 It seems 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.910
 up to three rounds and is that they dominate the 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.280
 the low cost have the have a little 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.950
 more difficult the low cost this to the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.250
 principle but right now they will see how not 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.170
 It is difficult the truth and good this here 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.360
 what I do is put my center is 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.630
 repair the fortifications still 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.490
 are in a position that does not cover 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.210
 much the one for example this one that is here 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.550
 does not cover much I choose because they can 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.930
 throw grenades and shoot them the 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.760
 grenadiers without any problem like 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.340
 you can see here I have four rooms 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.410
 in front of me and suddenly I have three 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.500
 there is no problem because we have 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.200
 our fortifications they can not 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.330
 move forward if you do not destroy that and look here 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.820
 I have three I go is for me alone I have 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.830
 my center and list already knew that they were going to 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.140
 throwing grenades and that's what 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.000
 makes them move because they think and I 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.700
 remove when in itself nothing else I moved 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.500
 little bit to put power in my 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.270
 wheat or that those guys look at my 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.190
 team arrived without any problem not 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.260
 you're going to die one over there and suddenly 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.240
 pressure nothing more quietly is 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.740
 fixed the fortification 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.690
 they must worry a lot about 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.250
 fix them all with just one and the 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.140
 centrist that's what will help them 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:35.010
 because if they get too much if they worry 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.990
 a lot to repair the fortifications is 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.170
 you are going to lose time so josh 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:43.640
 howard george meant is such as in good 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:47.010
 rather in horror this is to play 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.110
 intelligently and play as a team that 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.660
 that you can see here is the hole 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.760
 emergency can not repair that if 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.400
 they damage it in a way that is due to 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.400
 concentrating more is on not advancing the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.290
 locus and be able to put this and repair the 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.170
 the defenses that are here like the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.010
 pinches peaks that's what should be 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.120
 to fix when they are this from the box like this 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.910
 how good you can see here these 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.440
 parties wanted me again to fight not 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.230
 they could by the central and simple and 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.709
 you just have to fix this 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.750
 at what time to put your centric for 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.790
 that can take off the crazy without 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.420
 no problem when they are grenadiers 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:30.970
 snipers the maulers are very difficult to 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.280
 of killing less than with coke that is 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.000
 the one who has like a hummer guy this 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.400
 point well because the grenades can be 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.870
 say to the sides of the mother and what can 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.060
 destroy without any problem although the 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.730
 moulder are very very difficult to kill 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.920
 here because apart from that his shield turns 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.890
 and apart they have their grenade is therefore not 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.780
 there are if they get damn good that like 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.760
 can see we won the round they could not 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.650
 destroy the emergency hole and 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.630
 So the hammer of dawn fell 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.110
 you know and that means that as 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.300
 us this as a team we won and we 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.300
 are going to change from Asia the low cost and 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.330
 now we have to destroy the hole 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.910
 emergency and good here a little bit of 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.250
 a fast camera and you say 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.550
 they shoot to defend it's always easier 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.860
 when they are crazy and they put themselves to the shot and 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.680
 They know how to destroy and how to get to 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.660
 objective being a team then 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.570
 Sometimes I think it is not necessary to obtain 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.950
 a blame and if you are smart you alone 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.760
 you can do a lot of damage to 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.410
 notifications and this to the local ones the 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.260
 good take them in this case are the 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.570
 enemies the grenades are very powerful 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.120
 as you can see this they have grenades 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.100
 infinite the grenadiers like 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.470
 those who have this infinite centers 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.990
 nothing more than as you can see there is certain 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.790
 time for them to reappear or 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.500
 good rather so they can go back to 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.320
 have the grenades or the sentence be 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.480
 low cost here and good here what they should 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.970
 to do is to take your distance and 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.430
 destroy the fortifications because if 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.010
 they are going crazy is George guards watching 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.080
 good rather and will not see can not go out 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.129
 crazy is not going to be guagua a zeros 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.800
 unless it was up to him 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:18.139
 of the game mode but who does not see rum 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.789
 there is not going to be anyone doing their 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.830
 nonsense you have to be total and 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.869
 absolutely intelligent as they can 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.669
 see here in less than almost I do not know how much 

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:28.580
 time passed but we were already 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:31.189
 destroying the emergency hole without 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.379
 no problem the campus can shoot 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:35.779
 and at the same time it can heal us 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:37.759
 us this how can you see good here 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:39.319
 He was already healing us and we 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.959
 no problem shooting in the hole 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:43.610
 of emergency eris can not 

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:45.830
 repair is what I was saying 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.479
 here to 20 grenades and more 13 4 and without 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.429
 no problem treated is good was 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:51.349
 trying to repair it and nothing happens 

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:53.179
 carnal here was that comment of 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:56.119
 josh howard george men's demo end 

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:58.279
 in pee so they see and we won good and 

00:06:56.119 --> 00:07:00.259
 when they win as the first round the 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:02.959
 they win as it ends and the second as 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:04.669
 locust win the game as it channels 

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:07.629
 but who enjoys this comment and we 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:07.629
 we see after
