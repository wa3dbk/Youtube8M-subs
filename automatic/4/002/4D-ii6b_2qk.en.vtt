that's<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:52.110> khamar<00:04:53.970> this<00:04:54.970> is<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:56.730> LR<00:04:57.730> tree

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
that's the khamar this is the LR tree

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:05.280 
that's the khamar this is the LR tree
and<00:05:02.730> of<00:05:03.730> course<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.510> first<00:05:04.720> love

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
and of course the first love

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.790 
and of course the first love
the<00:05:05.950> tundra<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:07.000> can<00:05:07.240> compare<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:07.960> sizes<00:05:08.560> of

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:18.750 
the tundra you can compare the sizes of
them<00:05:13.350> so<00:05:14.350> I<00:05:14.380> think<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:17.130> Hummer<00:05:18.130> h1<00:05:18.370> is<00:05:18.729> a

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
them so I think the the Hummer h1 is a

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:26.780 
them so I think the the Hummer h1 is a
good<00:05:22.320> kind<00:05:23.320> of<00:05:23.500> a<00:05:23.820> yeah<00:05:24.820> I<00:05:25.000> think<00:05:25.300> it's<00:05:25.450> a<00:05:25.570> very
