 wb 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.470
 chicago and midway games chicago is the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.150
 when you go to pick up your copy of the

 revenge of the sith dvd you 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.810
 probably will not get to the tail 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.090
 from the box without falling into a kiosk or 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.760
 screen lid to beat it front second 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.010
 its simultaneous launch is a bit 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.620
 sneaky marketing typical of all 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.239
 things of star wars most likely is 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.770
 what will make this game a great 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.020
 commercial success despite 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.810
 your regular game design is erratic 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.060
 ccoo texts and an interface completely 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.490
 amateur point that yes like his 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.040
 predecessor battlefront second is not very 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.750
 well done is clearly what is missing 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.970
 It is that people mean when 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.520
 spread the old story about if 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.200
 a game is polished is like a suit 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.570
 furry big bolkiah with a close 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.550
 bright running down the middle there 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.830
 flaws and errors in the gameplay and 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.540
 graphics which are clearly 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.610
 victims of having to work too 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.500
 in a playstation 2 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.930
 the graphics have a flat appearance 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.710
 covered with a sticky layer of gloss 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.270
 ideal for images or without problems but 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.000
 Gives the game a real look 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.400
 curiously muffled movement is 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.049
 feels strangely uneven something done 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.390
 almost intolerable in the servers 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.700
 full of robots running shoulder with 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.190
 shoulder with skating the players that 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.170
 they are deformations Bunny jumping zig 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.690
 zag and spray the blaster fire of 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.790
 any way a quick note to 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.800
 Server eyes where I'm afraid 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.880
 to set the number of players in 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.800
 the iaa 0 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.830
 the rest of us will appear 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.900
 soon good friends up here the top 10 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.780
 wait for the next top that will be the 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.780
 number 3 but good friends goodbye
