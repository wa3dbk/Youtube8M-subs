decks hatchling which has 13 attack and
12<00:01:41.520> speed<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.570> makes<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.259> stronger<00:01:43.619> than

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
12 speed so it makes it stronger than

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.190 
12 speed so it makes it stronger than
the<00:01:44.070> other<00:01:44.159> ones<00:01:44.399> because<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.030> has<00:01:45.180> two<00:01:45.960> more

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
the other ones because it has two more

speed and it has 142 HP so that is the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.999 
speed and it has 142 HP so that is the
number<00:01:53.939> six<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.570> number<00:01:54.630> five<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.649> are<00:01:55.770> going

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
number six and number five we are going

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.649
