 returning to our program nor do I understand anything at all 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.060
 the broken heart we have accumulated 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.859
 between these fats 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.460
 there are two types of fat accumulation 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.579
 fairly common 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.820
 our civilization the stress and accumulated tension 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.700
 as a sector 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.540
 there is tension for a long time 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.540
 signal by your body 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.330
 a way to react which is the following yes because you had difficulties 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.530
 prolonged 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.330
 only he does not speak so look at this person reporting him hurt of some 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.439
 way is now starving because this story of humanity 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.080
 all that I may have passed 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.830
 seemed like a deferral default history of humanity the history of 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.070
 famine of injury 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.050
 always then that you go through a difficult yet emotional 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.740
 prolonged his body that leads a substance called tanning 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.130
 and the cortisol that moves with the information mechanisms of the organism and it lies 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.259
 with a mechanism of energy accumulation 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.350
 for being an organism he speaks look happen person 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.619
 Are you going to stay or are you hungry? 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.329
 he takes two strikes the first of them made with 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.180
 lots of energy with a single media 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.590
 and it is in this region 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.540
 and some women in this region 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.680
 so it is very important that a person 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.620
 is team already tried to have to floor that already tried to lose only localized fat 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.650
 can not get that effect and the game will 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.009
 and begins its state 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.289
 of cortisol is that this hormone that accumulates with emotional tension 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.009
 with chronic chronic stress for at least two three years 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.320
 the acs cortisol has commentator we have how to evaluate from the clinic 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.249
 you have to treat 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:17.769
 at the same time perhaps in the first place that gypsy of the organism because 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:18.389
 if no 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.520
 every time you lose fat 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.310
 You confirm to your brain, you see how that person is going. 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.380
 hungry the next time it will accumulate 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.719
 it's the double 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.099
 and why women have 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.619
 but stressed 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.619
 looks 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.560
 the woman accumulates more because she was procreative not naturally 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.230
 she went 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.289
 she was preparing 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:50.239
 her own practice on children and that she has to accumulate in the candle she should have 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.359
 a fat 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.879
 efe ready to treat any moment that gets pregnant 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.580
 she has her regeneration input there for many leaders of the past and 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.219
 equipment 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.600
 20 30 years ago me so much time like this 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.200
 we'll see what's changed 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.359
 it was the culture 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.699
 because the woman who was good slow paced was that it was redundant at the time she had 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:13.720
 144 maringÃ¡ for example here who has 46 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.049
 another would not pass in English 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.579
 there is a problem she would not be able to sign in with the stf 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.810
 has 76 in glory counts 46 as well as beautiful 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.159
 he can also be so at his mercy 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.529
 of the advertising round 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.679
 of the requirement given to cargo plane advertising and a profile 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.550
 pre-established every woman has in March her beauty has to enjoy 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.980
 your contract may up to now unhealthy 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.470
 the rooster may even have excess fat which will cause health damage now 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.810
 if you look in the mirror and appreciate your own beauty is part 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.059
 has a maturity of a wisdom 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:52.769
 but in Brazil this Brazilian index is difficult for every ten women who 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:53.780
 they prefer beer 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.059
 meanwhile the index 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.150
 eighteen does not conform to the body that has the being because it creates 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.790
 but rather have any important if the unwanted fat turns to the elite 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.919
 it's just a direct question of aesthetics 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.060
 whether or not it is a health issue if it is a health issue 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.989
 go back they will look for the cause that can treat here in a way 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.209
 definitive statement also refers to the 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.789
 You can prevent today. 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.239
 it is so much crisis you have substances that you administer 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.650
 including to decrease inflammation is common when safety with muricy 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.569
 that the person begins to get involved for example cellulite 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:32.080
 is because the pilot cortisol curi mexico information the person begins 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.300

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.409
 and the heat and cellulite the word information kit so dreaded lite cellulite 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:38.900
 appendicitis 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.670
 every woman has the following 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.110
 that does not improve with nothing already made of everything does not improve look I have of victor 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.729
 information behind 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.159
 have to take care of this information and behind this inflammation must have a 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:55.499
 excess cortisol we also have to treat something interesting research 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:58.210
 fund seeks the real cause 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.880
 Do not you just wear makeup, it's no good just to have that fat 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.510
 come back 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.760
 no use you just do with a question of aesthetics there has to be 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.860
 concern with health along with aesthetic poverty and seeks the real cause 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.529
 What is behind today we have a refuge for this. 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:17.369
