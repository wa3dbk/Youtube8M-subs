 [Music] 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.889
 very good guys and girls today you 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.690
 I bring a new video tutorial and I 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.539
 I come to teach how to download 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.650
 a new great game if from when to speak 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.779
 of a new great game forgiveness of those of the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.019
 chain of the simulator or that these 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.779
 games that simulate parts or works 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.730
 everyday and things like that already good 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.370
 I bring the game car mechanics simulator 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.649
 that just came out a little bit and now 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.710
 it's like you could say in pirate or 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.809
 free 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.590
 it's a pretty good game for me 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:50.920
 it seems like the best simulator with the one 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:52.750
 merge that of the doctor and he paints for 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.630
 updates and new versions 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.040
 Really 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.230
 so well we go with the installation 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.880
 of today that is not complicated for 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.350
 nothing good we are going to copy the link that goes 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.750
 until the description of the video that you 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.170
 they are going to copy it I already have it here 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.780
 open as you can see is this mega I'm going 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.240
 to close this here 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.180
 they are pure downloads and you can see what is 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.010
 a file that weighed 600 megs ok the 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.500
 which event you double-click and you 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.180
 start downloading ok when you get 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.520
 double click and have finished what it will do 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.810
 will simply drag it to what 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.130
 I was doing on our desk 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.560
 here how can we help I have it 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.270
 dragged well let's explore a 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.759
 little what this would have inside is 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.750
 just an iso as you can see what 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.759
 I'm going to take it out just like that 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.200
 and here he asks us for the password that as 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.630
 you know it is already known that we copy it and the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.330
 we stick in what is being the one 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.140
 weird or we read yes and it's going to 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.899
 unzip and we will throw the is ok 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.429
 here we can see err and ellis ok the iso 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.880
 that has good inside simply 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:58.390
 has an exe point that would be the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.760
 game installation 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:06.220
 and the one who is the crack so 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:11.310
 we will do the we will apply our own and 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.489
 We are going to give you an extract and we give 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.470
 to the desk where you want to move 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.720
 what only to take it out and have the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.959
 hand and as you can see it was already downloaded and 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.000
 the castro 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.950
 once we left the desk 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.440
 we double- click on the let's say 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.360
 extracts files I was temporary diffuses 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.310
 what we give him if he is going to extract 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.250
 I would start what I'm making a 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.380
 installation as they are similar to those of 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.800
 xabi we give to the language that you 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.980
 want 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.739
 in this Spanish case itself out as 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.739
 you can see here we give you next 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.969
 eye with this that you have it 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.530
 learn to at least be guided a little 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.900
 from here we are going to paste what is 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.299
 doing it I think it must be red dot 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.760
 game that is the most important thing we're going 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.469
 to next any red dot game 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.599
 because the main folder to get 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.930
 to obviously play here you can put it 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.700
 anchor in the bar and all those things 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.790
 create direct access in this case I do not 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.800
 I want and they give it to install ok ok it's 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.250
 a pretty pretty download 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.710
 in pretty fast since it 's a game 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.840
 that demands so many 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.120
 requirements and that makes it pretty good 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.130
 in my opinion because it is not that I have 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.740
 a lousy chart if not a good game 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.640
 and bearable 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.319
 and has enough as 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.090
 in railings within the game 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.770
 you have enough things to do and for 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.170
 the same you do not get bored so fast that 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.060
 that's important the games so that 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.060
 so you can play it and keep playing 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.900
 so well I'll bet the video and 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.320
 we come back as soon as this is finished 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.320
 installation 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.660
 good guys when you have finished the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.000
 installation will seem to them if they want 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.739
 download direct you can see that 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.319
 yes or no, I just really stay 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.120
 because I've already installed it and we're going to 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.209
 give to finalize because they ask us here 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.580
 line a group spice but these days well 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.819
 that they do not have to, not if we record the main 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:21.829
 nothing more and good 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:24.530
 let me look for something ok no was created 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.120
 any 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.120
 no how can you see here 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.200
 so we have to look for us like this 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.960
 how good are we going to what would come 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.750
 being our local disk files 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.580
 of network program dot game yr 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.240
 every mechanism within 2014 we recorded 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.169
 double click and here inside we will do 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.600
 when the first thing we will do is 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.580
 copy what is inside the 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.010
 propet folder ok 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.310
 prophet these files and we will give 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:01.010
 to copy and we will paste them into the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.500
 card mechanic simulator ok let's paste 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.440
 we are going to replace files in the 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.290
 destination that we are going to do with all 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.050
 in continue and ready 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.390
 there you can see that the 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.979
 game and now what will we do will this be the 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.380
 cms 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.390
 excel we give you right click and what 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.340
 we send to the desk that once 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.200
 We send to the desk to tell me 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.420
 I control Acosta because here is the 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.160
 game let's say 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.650
 give right click we are going to go to 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.840
 properties and here inside the 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.270
 compatibility run this program 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.370
 how do I manage this so that I do not 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.050
 have to give the can of now straw 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.580
 whatever they want to call it by clicking 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.410
 right and execute them always but that 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.320
 double click and the game is going to 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.280
 pull the scooter as it administers 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.530
 you know that yes 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:54.389
 all right guys here is the proof 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.430
 obviously the game would be like that 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.870
 how good we are with what would come 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.570
 being the test of the game here what 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.650
 can you see you are obviously 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.110
 configuring it 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.870
 as you can see it works pretty well 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.620
 in my case 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.939
 As I had already told you, it does not demand so many 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.760
 requirements or anything like that so 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:20.880
 You can do it pretty easy 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.280
 and that and that more than all that is what 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.190
 Overall, I'm a general 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:29.430
 constant good if you like cars or 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.140
 you want to winnow in this you can 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.640
 start with this game perfectly 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.140
 well here what is the game about 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.529
 mind all about about I would have being 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.499
 the car 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:40.629
 and obviously you have to fix everything 

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:42.429
 kind of mistake that I have that equal you 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:45.369
 helping a little always helping a 

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:46.779
 little bit points out that what is wrong 

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:49.389
 is what is good because they can 

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:50.679
 fix and that tells us what is wrong and 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:54.959
 you just have to go doing 

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:54.959
 all these little things 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.070
 and that, guys, is this about these 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.130
 games to fix cars and after 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.250
 study them and test them and everything else 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.410
 okay 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.810
