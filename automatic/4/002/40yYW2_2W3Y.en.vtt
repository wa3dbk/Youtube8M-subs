00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
put that snowplow switch mechanism into

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.010 
put that snowplow switch mechanism into
place

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020

okay so I'm going to shoot that right up

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.840 
okay so I'm going to shoot that right up
into<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.390> bottom<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> dash<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.320> then

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
into the bottom of the dash and then

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.160 
into the bottom of the dash and then
stick<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.950> snowplow<00:00:41.300> switch<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:44.149> yeah

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170

stick that snowplow switch on that yeah
shoot<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.260> few<00:00:46.410> check<00:00:46.649> screws<00:00:46.980> into<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.489> right

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.670 

I'll<00:01:19.610> break<00:01:19.869> everything<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:21.259> it's<00:01:21.439> right

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
I'll break everything and it's right

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.090 
I'll break everything and it's right
here<00:01:22.509> it's<00:01:23.509> very<00:01:23.600> close<00:01:24.140> for<00:01:24.500> me<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.680> reach<00:01:24.860> up

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
here it's very close for me to reach up

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.700 
here it's very close for me to reach up
and<00:01:25.250> just<00:01:25.549> be<00:01:26.000> able<00:01:26.119> to<00:01:27.579> I've<00:01:28.579> got<00:01:29.380> this<00:01:30.380> twitch

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
and just be able to I've got this twitch

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.380 
and just be able to I've got this twitch
pops<00:01:31.039> out<00:01:31.310> by<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.579> way<00:01:31.759> I<00:01:31.789> don't<00:01:32.000> think<00:01:32.270> it's

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
pops out by the way I don't think it's

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.200 
pops out by the way I don't think it's
supposed<00:01:32.539> to<00:01:33.189> but<00:01:34.189> it<00:01:34.310> does<00:01:34.520> but<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:34.909> might<00:01:35.090> not

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
supposed to but it does but it might not

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.060 
supposed to but it does but it might not
be<00:01:35.299> a<00:01:35.330> bad<00:01:35.509> thing<00:01:35.570> in<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.110> summertime<00:01:36.619> she

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
be a bad thing in the summertime she

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.969 
be a bad thing in the summertime she
wasn't<00:01:37.340> using<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.759> just<00:01:38.270> leave<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:38.630> out<00:01:38.979> but

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
wasn't using that just leave it out but

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.380 
wasn't using that just leave it out but
basically<00:01:40.880> that<00:01:41.979> raises<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.100> plow<00:01:43.390> that

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
basically that raises the plow that

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.169 
basically that raises the plow that
lowers<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.590> then<00:01:45.729> you<00:01:46.729> can<00:01:46.880> push<00:01:47.060> this

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
lowers it and then you can push this

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.870 
lowers it and then you can push this
little<00:01:47.390> locking<00:01:47.840> thing<00:01:48.079> down<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:49.490> the

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
little locking thing down and the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.430 
little locking thing down and the
gravity<00:01:50.330> would<00:01:50.479> just<00:01:50.630> let<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:50.869> sit<00:01:51.049> there<00:01:51.229> so

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
gravity would just let it sit there so

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.649 
gravity would just let it sit there so
it's<00:01:51.560> not<00:01:51.590> prone<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:51.979> fall<00:01:52.340> out<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.970> like<00:01:53.360> safe

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
it's not prone to fall out and like safe

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.320 
it's not prone to fall out and like safe
in<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.799> winter<00:01:54.979> time<00:01:55.159> I<00:01:55.220> could<00:01:55.549> pop<00:01:56.119> this

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
in the winter time I could pop this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.350 
in the winter time I could pop this
thing<00:01:56.390> out<00:01:57.399> sit<00:01:58.399> in<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.580> -<00:01:58.759> over<00:01:59.119> there<00:01:59.209> and

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
thing out sit in the - over there and

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.480 
thing out sit in the - over there and
wouldn't<00:01:59.539> even<00:01:59.569> have<00:01:59.780> it<00:01:59.899> here<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:00.490> that's

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
wouldn't even have it here so that's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.480 
wouldn't even have it here so that's
pretty<00:02:01.670> cool<00:02:02.590> yeah<00:02:03.590> also<00:02:03.979> another<00:02:04.220> good<00:02:04.429> thing

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
pretty cool yeah also another good thing

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.029 
pretty cool yeah also another good thing
about<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:05.000> location<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:05.780> plow<00:02:06.170> although

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
about the location of that plow although

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.440 
about the location of that plow although
I<00:02:07.069> didn't<00:02:07.280> plan<00:02:07.490> it<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.640> way<00:02:07.789> it<00:02:08.090> just<00:02:08.119> worked

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
I didn't plan it that way it just worked

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.289 
I didn't plan it that way it just worked
out<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:08.690> when<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.470> slide<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:10.700> seat<00:02:10.970> forward

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
out that when I slide that seat forward

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.470 
out that when I slide that seat forward
it<00:02:11.709> clears<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:13.069> bottom<00:02:13.459> of<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.670> thing<00:02:13.730> so

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
it clears the bottom of that thing so

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.349 
it clears the bottom of that thing so
that<00:02:14.630> works<00:02:14.840> out<00:02:15.080> good
