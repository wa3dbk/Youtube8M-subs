 this is not an agreement class 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.679
 in this class we are going to see a bit how you can do an improvisation with 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.619
 intervals with more tension with more amplitude than normal for example 6th 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.150
 7th accepted 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.989

 has played with jumps of rope that grows with rope jumps will have to 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.350
 play first with Palestinian strings or with strings to paint only with those 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.530
 so we're going to force intervals with more stations in the network 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.220
 let's see how they are the result of playing with your usual style more

 what will sound different 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.439
