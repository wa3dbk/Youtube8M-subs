take it off so what I would say is why
can<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.610> not<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:09.179> stop<00:02:09.390> lying<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:10.110> us

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
can you have not just stop lying to us

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.320 
can you have not just stop lying to us
why<00:02:11.069> don't<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.520> give<00:02:11.700> us<00:02:11.819> booking<00:02:12.209> in

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
why don't you just give us booking in

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.220 
why don't you just give us booking in
times

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
times

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.430 
times
for<00:02:13.680> their<00:02:13.770> accurate<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:15.780> not<00:02:15.959> much<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.319> ask

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
for their accurate it's not much to ask

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.490 
for their accurate it's not much to ask
is<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.940> idea<00:02:17.970> would<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:19.440> is

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
is it so the idea would be this is
