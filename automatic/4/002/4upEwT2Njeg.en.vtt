 played for ps3 and the game was released 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.779
 For pc the guys so I bought the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.820

 tÃ¡ me on this shit I make a 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.989

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.070
 and go out with him and try to win and I 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.250
 I have a car through shit I do not know I 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.800
 I only have one home, I know I have one. 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.190
 million, six hundred and eighty eight thousand 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.170
 so I'll soon take this money and 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.150
 bear but let's do something 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.010
 people and then I'll bring several videos 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.229
 so you guys like it if you really 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.880

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.680
 content that is going to be fun and goes 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.369
 It's good when it 's time to do it, so I 'm going 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.340
 seek occurred and I'll be right back guys 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.200
 to turn off bruce j, guys, beauty, I 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.350
 I went into a random race here. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.299
 20 thousand guys who will play then 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.509
 will likely have a lot of punches I 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.850
 I think it's a thing in the sea then 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.560
 It's probably going to hit the beach, I know. 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.950
 off road vehicles 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.500
 I do not like off-road vehicles though 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.270
 It is nice if guys so let's see who gives 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.360
 Which is our choice? 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.360
 vehicle and then let's start this race 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.540
 Marotta, it's only beauty, can we? 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.030
 choose the boston vehicles i left 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.270
 Of course I think I'm going on a motorcycle because 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.040
 bike is style is connected to sanches 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.729
 probably because it 's a time bike 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.299
 And let's go from sanchez rosa galera let 's 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.759
 motoca rosa because motoca is stiller a 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.830
 boy I just download the gta to 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.300
 pc then got the visual bugs with 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.010
 these black lines of the guy I think 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.620
 have to update the video card and go 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.570
 updating the game will look perfect but 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.310
 finally guys let's go a bit 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.600
 to give the one warm I have to 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.400
 do a lot of what I told you 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.070
 I have not played gta 5 since last year. 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.260
 when I made the videos so I promised 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.690
 and I'll have to buy a house with 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.490
 garage to buy cars and make cars and 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.200
 I want to do everything on video here at 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.570
 channel that will be very cool and also 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.120
 flying races because I want to kill 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.220
 very deco and sef will be funny and 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.050
 I also want to play with the case if you 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.610
 they ask for much since then 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.760
 I think it's going to be fine then dilma 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.250
 peace play peace, just have motoca roÃ§a galera 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.840
 So it's on the sea I do not 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.060
 I do not even know today after staying in 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.230
 Last but I will appreciate this view of the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.330
 beautiful sea 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.270
 Let's see this ball guys catch that one. 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.940
 bush already in the beginning of the 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.520
 I love you in fifth 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.320
 It does not come in a better position the face 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.660
 bus will want to play for the brand and 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.730

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.310
 enough people came in then he did not 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.980
 it's so bad araxa running on the beach 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.560

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.390

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.880
 Let's take that steep turn to win. 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.980
 speed and we will continue in third 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.459
 because third on account of the time goes 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.080

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.080

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.040

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.840

 You're taking me out and I'm lost. 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.690
 four case positions would give one where 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.460
 this is a circular quicksand 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.370
