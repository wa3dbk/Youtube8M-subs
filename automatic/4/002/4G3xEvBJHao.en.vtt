00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.910
 video just to make a little 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.070
 inbox and what is the mouse that 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.780
 you have helped me to win I believe 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.370
 that most of those who 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.139
 have been attentive to what is my page 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.640
 of facebook in the last days 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.130
 We were about to participate in what 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.859
 It was a contest through the page 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.720
 equally skill online orbit 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.119
 magazine and nothing we were participating 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.289
 for what it was to win the systems and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.539
 thanks to the support of all of you 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.340
 obviously we have won it is already here 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.950
 receives returned to pick it up from them a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.570
 little late just now there is already a 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.040
 little dark and others but I hope not 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.510
 are more or less knowing well is going to be 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.219
 a small video nothing else in which 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.050
 I'm going to unpack and do not do 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.640
 many respect for the mouse I do not know very 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.920
 well about the specifications 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.170
 techniques including not even doing very 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.239
 well on mouse and the technologies that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.489
 they handle and all that I'm just going to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.420
 unpack for obviously 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.250
 share to all of you this 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.230
 I told you that I was going to 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.109
 upload the video of a boxing if it is 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.730
 obviously we won it and all that and for 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.850
 the same thing is that I'm here so 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.460
 good for you 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.570
 it looks very father see we can see it here 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.820
 it is for this 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.619
 and we can observe it so 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.900
 a little bit clearer than the truth that 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.390
 I have not used a gaming mouse ever 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.950
 used I do not really know then one 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.810
 little experience regarding the mouse 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.659
 of economical normal mouse gaming 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.520
 conventional but it's the truth that I 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.190
 I think of being in an experience 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.899
 quite notorious regarding the use that 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.759
 can you can provide it and the two types 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.009
 of bad not so well it's going to be the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.799
 first one to use one comes out I want to see 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.750
 how is it going all this I'm going to take away 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.539
 this face has a few stickers 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.899
 let's remove it from here 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.330
 there they are, let's open this 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.850
 right from here and let's see what 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.130
 it has that inside it is worth it then 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.590
 here comes coming out very well for the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.569
 part of the box really everything already 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.299
 is completely empty and so on 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.490
 it's just like the side I refer and 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.740
 ok here is already just this is going to 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.990
 get out of the little things well here is what 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.369
 that what has the package comes out 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.420
 here below they are coming out 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.880
 a few things 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.650
 let's see key that contains this 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.569
 Very well, guys, we're going to 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.640
 find a little bag one 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.310
 backpack or something like that 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.200
 ok for me I think obviously you can 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.819
 save the magician if all that look is 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.980
 a small bag which is very 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.830
 father very very very cool detail 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.230
 obviously part of tyc sports that are 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.270
 the creators developers of this 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.190
 mouse over here is the guess 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.830
 manuals even maybe some 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.090
 installation disk or one thing for the 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.459
 style which comes within this 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.810
 small soft and obviously already by 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.600
 this side we will have what is the 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.130
 mouse is not going to see let's take this away 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.239
 we are going to remove this because there is a 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.450
 plastic that obviously comes 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.280
 protecting and here you see has 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.410
 obviously the cable take it out to see if what 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.420
 I can take out like that he replied 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.600
 very well already left we are going to put this by 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.519
 here on this side and here is guys see 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.680
 and the good ones is to observe in a way 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.900
 little bit more detailed and all this has made me 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.030
 state is pretty big I would say no 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.530
 he 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.900
 I repeat that you will never have 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.450
 experience use something similar to this 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.240
 far from it but he can say that 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.150
 has it go a pretty distance 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.840
 Nice has a lot of buttons 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.450
 I would say 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.890
 very many I would say I think the good 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.380
 because most are programmable and 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.940
 all this does not have the quality of the cable 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.620
 it's pretty good obviously it's not 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.610
 plastic and has is this coating 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.160
 as crimes and something like that and see the 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.319
 part of the usb is super cool see 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.760
 have here for you to put this or 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.130
 so that not even the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.900
 port and now not us in this one looks 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.660

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.130
