00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.520
 the captain good position welcome to the honoree of the city who has a 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.959
 good day 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:10.959
 save yourself full area 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.389
 all your scheduled flights 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.609
 soon the work of the bid will become much harder 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.609
 because the boats are getting bigger 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.160
 In the Danish shipyard in Odense, a mega container transport is almost 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
 ready 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.790
 the one influenced by minors is 43 meters longer and almost three meters more 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.790
 deep that the great chongo one hundred 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.150
 the most important thing is that it can transport 650 more containers 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.930
 what is the urgency of building bigger and bigger boats 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.400
 the economy 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.020
 hamas containers on the freighter lower the cost of freight per container 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.280
 that's the reason why the workers of the neighboring dry dock 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 will begin the construction of a twin 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.190
 the new ship still unnamed 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.190
 another transport 3 thousand 300 containers 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.280
 three months to complete it 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.590
 if the workers do not delay 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.160
 the work is very difficult but the process is easy to understand 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.970
 how to build a 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.460
 all in the style so distinguished 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.980
 two years to build the boat is a Mexican process we must lose
