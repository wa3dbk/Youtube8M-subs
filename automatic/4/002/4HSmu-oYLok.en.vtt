00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.800
 sweetened by banksy and who will we 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.080

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.970

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.510

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.730
 the dlc 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.880

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.329

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.850
 ya in the game so here is me 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.190
 personally sweeten more than 20 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.780
 missions four multiplayer modes and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.600
 after we get them back up game I 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.309
 have fucked the ass concretely I'm full 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.500
 the ass that all games do that 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.500
 now but personally it makes 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.990
 more than a year I have not bought dlc 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.670
 there to say stop at these glitches of 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.460
 thieves of publishers who sell us 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.490
 more and more shit games is from 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.240
 more and more do this thing so that's 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.490
 bibi it was the studio that the prefect 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.640
 for the halo license this is the game that I 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.600
 prefers the most frankly I am 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.540
 glad they sold the license 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.780
 halo because I say to myself the master chief 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.909
 frankly it would have been a license 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.600
 destroyed the halo license so I'm 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.330
 really glad they sold the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.860
 license because otherwise they would us 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.640
 would have made a big shit like this 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.409
 play by the way so that's done some 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.170
 thing please do not buy the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.740
 dlc or a joke not to this game during 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.799
 a little moment 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.210
 finally hot and at this game it's not 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.320
 need to tell you that there is nobody 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.120
 who plays this shit project 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.920
 so here of course I sell my 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.679
 comment yes sir g awesome me 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.300

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.370
 I see that and I get pissed 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.209
 on four missions of the campaign 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.070

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.140

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.770
 fucking two free maps even 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.970
