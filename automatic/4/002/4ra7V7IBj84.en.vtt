00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello everyone guys are me and I'm here 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.950
 with a short video tutorial about 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.970
 how to play trump 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.780
 I don't know if many of you will know 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.940
 this game but today I will explain it 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.460
 first you have to get one or more 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.070
 friends in this case 19 his friend 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.070
 then take care of yourself 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.789
 the next step is to have a deck of 40 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.050
 cards 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:31.830
 I will use the Tuscan ones and here is in the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.590
 detail how we should give three cards a 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.129
 where one of the various participants in this 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.559
 just me and once given three 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.879
 cards for one now I'll show you 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.640
 very quickly 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.390
 let's imagine a hypothetical game with 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.660
 three players is you are my cards 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.969
 we will have to give a subsequent card but 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.879
 all the cards from you 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.789
 in the middle in this case is the 6 of 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.180
 bricks and now this card will become 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.830
 bari sono what it means for example 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.650
 I now have the 3 of trump the 3d framework 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.860
 this means that a trump card 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.630
 can exceed all the others 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.960
 independently feel that beautiful 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.409
 word regardless of their value 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.830
 for example a 3 that in Tuscany is called 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.200
 regio or in male 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.220
 four points so the king is the card 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.829
 which is worth more 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.220
 after a slow entry then on the net 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.430
 You could eat me example the so-called 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.729
 hunchback that is worth only duels 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.079
 but if we put the case this game is 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.369
 of trump 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.920
 this can take all the cards 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.350
 seems difficult is given to understand why 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.250
 it's really a lot indeed 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.680
 hard to understand 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.229
 with one card he can eat more 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.469
 however visco is a very ancient game a 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.930
 game also based on the absurd is a 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:08.099
 game then that then with which you can 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.009
 absolutely have fun with grandparents with i 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.620
 parents with cousins ​​you can do 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.190
 just about anything you can pass the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.989
 born to play darts 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.280
 summaries they give again this is a game 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.550
 suitable for the whole family 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.860
 and try it anyway, I did this to him 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.370
 short video tutorial I don't do 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.129
 see my face and with that you have 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.170
 already seen if you liked it share 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.300
 anyway on facebook because all the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.670
 motive ray I understand if you liked it 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.660
