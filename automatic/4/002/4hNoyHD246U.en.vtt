00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
yeah I mean it just from the look of it

it seems like it's a lot better than

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.300 
it seems like it's a lot better than
even<00:02:37.209> like<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.510> Ouya<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:40.360> Lea<00:02:40.569> itself<00:02:40.930> o.o<00:02:41.310> it

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
even like the Ouya the Lea itself o.o it

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.539 
even like the Ouya the Lea itself o.o it
has<00:02:43.049> great<00:02:44.049> service<00:02:44.440> but<00:02:45.010> we're<00:02:45.160> also<00:02:45.280> trying

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549
