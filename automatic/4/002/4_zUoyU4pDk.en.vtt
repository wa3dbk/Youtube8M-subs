all<00:00:15.809> those<00:00:16.260> bad<00:00:16.560> things<00:00:16.830> you've<00:00:17.190> heard<00:00:17.460> before

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
all those bad things you've heard before

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.510 
all those bad things you've heard before
but<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:18.900> really<00:00:19.289> true<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:20.160> coconut

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
but is that really true is coconut

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.790 
but is that really true is coconut
really<00:00:20.850> going<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.060> do<00:00:21.210> all<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.510> things<00:00:21.840> well

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
really going to do all this things well

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.359 
really going to do all this things well
today<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.460> are<00:00:23.550> looking<00:00:23.699> at<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.119> fax<00:00:24.330> number

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
today we are looking at the fax number

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.660 
today we are looking at the fax number
one<00:00:26.369> coconut<00:00:27.090> contains<00:00:27.750> lauric<00:00:28.470> acid<00:00:28.670> which

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
one coconut contains lauric acid which

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.299 
one coconut contains lauric acid which
is<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> rare<00:00:30.599> medium<00:00:31.170> chain<00:00:31.380> fatty<00:00:31.439> acid<00:00:32.130> that's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
is a rare medium chain fatty acid that's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.630 
is a rare medium chain fatty acid that's
only<00:00:32.579> found<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.239> breast<00:00:33.510> milk<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.640> these

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
only found in breast milk and these

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.810 
only found in breast milk and these
medium<00:00:36.090> chain<00:00:36.270> fatty<00:00:36.329> acids<00:00:37.020> are<00:00:37.820> important

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
medium chain fatty acids are important

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.670 
medium chain fatty acids are important
because<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.360> majority<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.930> fats<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.410> our<00:00:40.500> diet

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
because the majority of fats in our diet

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.250 
because the majority of fats in our diet
are<00:00:40.800> actually<00:00:41.190> long<00:00:41.520> chain<00:00:42.000> fatty<00:00:42.030> acids<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
are actually long chain fatty acids and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.920 
are actually long chain fatty acids and
those<00:00:43.739> require<00:00:44.160> more<00:00:44.640> effort<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> body<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
those require more effort on the body to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.049 
those require more effort on the body to
break<00:00:46.110> them<00:00:46.320> down<00:00:46.350> whereas<00:00:47.309> these<00:00:47.489> medium

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
break them down whereas these medium

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.150 
break them down whereas these medium
chain<00:00:48.270> fatty<00:00:48.500> don't<00:00:49.500> need<00:00:49.710> any<00:00:49.980> assistance

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
chain fatty don't need any assistance

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610 
chain fatty don't need any assistance
from<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> pancreas<00:00:50.969> they're<00:00:51.570> broken<00:00:51.809> down<00:00:52.020> by

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
from the pancreas they're broken down by

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.520 
from the pancreas they're broken down by
the<00:00:52.680> gastric<00:00:53.640> acid<00:00:54.000> itself<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.079> really

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the gastric acid itself so it's really

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.110 
the gastric acid itself so it's really

fat<00:02:31.230> storage<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:32.100> tissues<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.180> body<00:02:33.300> and

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
fat storage in tissues in the body and

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.360 
fat storage in tissues in the body and
thats<00:02:34.050> related<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.739> study<00:02:34.980> we<00:02:35.160> just

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
thats related to the study we just

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.530 
thats related to the study we just
mentioned<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.290> number<00:02:37.290> seven<00:02:37.680> coconut<00:02:38.220> is

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
mentioned and number seven coconut is

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.330 
mentioned and number seven coconut is
heat-stable<00:02:39.540> coconut<00:02:40.319> oil<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.590> heat<00:02:40.830> stable

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
heat-stable coconut oil is heat stable

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.670 
heat-stable coconut oil is heat stable
so<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.390> can<00:02:42.569> use<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.959> in<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.170> variety<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.590> ways

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
so you can use it in a variety of ways

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.440 
so you can use it in a variety of ways
but<00:02:43.890> especially<00:02:44.400> those<00:02:44.760> high<00:02:44.940> temperatures

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
but especially those high temperatures

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.699 
but especially those high temperatures
and<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.720> don't<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.140> worry<00:02:46.380> about<00:02:46.500> it

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
and you don't have to worry about it

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.710 
and you don't have to worry about it
breaking<00:02:46.890> down<00:02:47.340> or<00:02:47.580> becoming<00:02:47.880> carcinogenic

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
breaking down or becoming carcinogenic

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.660 
breaking down or becoming carcinogenic
like<00:02:49.350> other<00:02:49.650> plant<00:02:50.100> oils<00:02:50.989> can<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:53.130> think

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
like other plant oils can and so think

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.420 
like other plant oils can and so think
about<00:02:53.790> using<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.630> stir<00:02:54.900> Fry's<00:02:55.430> high

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
about using it and stir Fry's high

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.370 
about using it and stir Fry's high
temperature<00:02:56.910> cooking<00:02:57.090> but<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.569> can<00:02:57.720> also<00:02:57.930> use

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
temperature cooking but you can also use

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.220 
temperature cooking but you can also use
it<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.590> smoothies<00:02:59.330> and<00:03:00.330> your<00:03:00.480> baked<00:03:00.750> goods<00:03:00.900> you

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
it to smoothies and your baked goods you

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.440 
it to smoothies and your baked goods you
can<00:03:01.380> use<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.069> as<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.220> one<00:03:02.459> Damone<00:03:02.730> ratio<00:03:03.090> in

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
can use it as a one Damone ratio in

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.600 
can use it as a one Damone ratio in
place<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.690> all<00:03:04.049> oils<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.890> recipe<00:03:05.400> calls
