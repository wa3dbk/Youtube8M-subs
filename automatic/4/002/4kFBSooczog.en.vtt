 what's me now and flash on if 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.250
 this backlight is not visible later 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.890
 video betting him without flash 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.550
 so you can see how the light is illuminated 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.000

 current number current same day of the week 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.480
 here still for beauty because we are 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.810
 contour all here for such black ones 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.030
 blink dots see here but they kind of 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:40.600
 no information carry it done 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.250
 realized for beauty just later if 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.120
 we will have an alarm clock here 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:50.800
 will we have a tick so black stand 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:53.350
 under m if we choose the display mode 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.290
 time 12-hour you if we 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.780
 will be pm here a tick will appear well 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.230
 here still some also seek and 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.080
 11 do not even know what it is 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.870
 press the button we will see this mode and see 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.410
 what we have there is affordable here first 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.980
 pressing it turns out we do get into 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.470
 stopwatch menu means start button well 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.480
 start the stopwatch 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.920
 also the start button we stop it 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.910
 and reset button reset like this 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.030
 can run 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.500
 then press reset will get all sorts 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.540
 intermediate values 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.340
 so the stopwatch has two clicks on 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.680
 fashion button we get into mode 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.510
 alarm clock 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.239
 Well, there is also obtained here can 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.150
 set the alarm clock to turn it on 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.730
 I'll probably find this at times 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.299
 Now if all the checkboxes choose it soon 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.880
 just so that every day the alarm rang 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:58.000
 With the reset button we can switch that 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.890
 we will set the hour or minute to 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.040
 In general, as all as any ordinary 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.030
 electronic clock is nothing special 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.650
 Well, if you press the fashion button three times 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.160
 so then we get to the construction site 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:17.280
 time here we are already setting the time and 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:20.169
 date well here are the functions here in principle 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.940
 on this watch nothing 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.390
 supernatural something just me 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.680
 liked go after it and still this watch 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.710
 written on the site 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.530
 race that they are waterproof but not 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.300
 I know how waterproof they are 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.720
 tempt fate I will not therefore 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.940
 check also will not likely 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.880
 I think they probably still will 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.740
 water permeable can so here but if 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.080
 in the rain with them the protists are not yet 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.229
 feel on as if in a year plunge 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.889
 risen it seems the water will fall because 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:56.259
 I know that constantly these sellers love 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:00.610
 to write to write there all 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:02.620
 But in fact, as if this is not so well 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.830
 what else will show you how then 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.320
 backlight works on this 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.979
 finish the video and you see 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:15.639
 written in 50 meters you can now 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:17.560
 let the underwater okay all there that 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.870
 Now I will show you how 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.780
 backlight works 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:26.590
 so turned on the video without flash and here 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:29.410
 turn on the backlight you see the backlight 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.560
 glows green of course the camera 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.949
 very bad transmits her but she is such here 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.919
 green and nice looking 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:40.630
 does not burn for a second you probably but it 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.760
 enough to make out the time 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.729
 try to focus the camera so that 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.690
 you could see better but not something not 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:52.710
 It turns out not to focus the camera well in 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:56.580
 In general , I liked these watches 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.580
 would even recommend shopping
