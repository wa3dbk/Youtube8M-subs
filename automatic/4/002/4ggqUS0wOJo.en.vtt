00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
taking a bobby pin and I'm just securing

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.020 
taking a bobby pin and I'm just securing
the<00:02:40.440> hair<00:02:40.709> on<00:02:41.569> either<00:02:42.569> side<00:02:43.640> so<00:02:44.640> you're<00:02:44.819> just

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
the hair on either side so you're just

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.740 
the hair on either side so you're just
going<00:02:45.269> like<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:47.660> all<00:02:48.660> right<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.380> that's<00:02:50.099> the

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
going like that all right so that's the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.890 
going like that all right so that's the
first<00:02:51.750> layer<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.560> your<00:02:52.890> bangs<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.760> you'll<00:02:54.750> be

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
first layer of your bangs and you'll be

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.770 
first layer of your bangs and you'll be
able<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.319> again<00:02:55.830> adjust<00:02:56.489> them<00:02:56.760> as<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.239> go<00:02:57.480> up

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
able to again adjust them as you go up

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.120 
able to again adjust them as you go up
but<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:59.100> know<00:02:59.220> they'll<00:02:59.880> be<00:02:59.910> fine<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:00.830> I'm<00:03:01.830> just

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
but you know they'll be fine so I'm just

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.640 
but you know they'll be fine so I'm just
gonna<00:03:02.250> secure<00:03:02.850> this<00:03:03.269> one<00:03:03.720> over<00:03:04.110> here<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.440> little

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.880 
gonna secure this one over here a little
bit<00:03:04.890> because<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:06.030> looked<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.330> little<00:03:06.450> bit<00:03:06.660> loose

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
bit because it looked a little bit loose

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:14.930 
bit because it looked a little bit loose
all<00:03:07.890> right<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.920> see<00:03:11.519> one<00:03:11.790> more<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.910> needs

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.030 
all right and I see one more that needs
to<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.690> pinned<00:03:16.110> in<00:03:17.120> all<00:03:18.120> right

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.290 
to be pinned in all right
alright<00:03:21.040> so<00:03:21.520> I<00:03:21.850> got<00:03:21.970> that<00:03:22.180> layer<00:03:22.720> now<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:24.190> am<00:03:24.940> and

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
alright so I got that layer now I am and

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.270 
alright so I got that layer now I am and
if<00:03:25.360> you're<00:03:25.510> cool<00:03:25.750> with<00:03:25.810> like<00:03:26.350> thin<00:03:26.680> bangs<00:03:26.980> you

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
if you're cool with like thin bangs you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.980 
if you're cool with like thin bangs you
could<00:03:27.460> do<00:03:27.970> one<00:03:28.180> layer<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.690> then<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:28.870> could

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
could do one layer and then you could

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.750 
could do one layer and then you could
just<00:03:29.140> pull<00:03:29.380> this<00:03:29.530> hair<00:03:29.770> back<00:03:29.950> down<00:03:30.190> on<00:03:30.430> itself

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
just pull this hair back down on itself

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.050 
just pull this hair back down on itself
but<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:31.750> kind<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.320> like<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.740> polar<00:03:33.040> banks<00:03:33.730> look

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
but I kind of like the polar banks look

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.810 
but I kind of like the polar banks look
so<00:03:34.870> I'm<00:03:35.110> bringing<00:03:35.290> my<00:03:35.740> next<00:03:36.340> layer<00:03:36.520> of<00:03:36.550> my

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
so I'm bringing my next layer of my

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:44.150 
so I'm bringing my next layer of my
bangs<00:03:37.060> around<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:38.910> actually<00:03:42.030> I'm<00:03:43.030> going<00:03:43.090> to

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
bangs around and actually I'm going to

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.750 
bangs around and actually I'm going to
there<00:03:45.160> we<00:03:45.250> go<00:03:45.960> all<00:03:46.960> right<00:03:47.140> so<00:03:47.620> with<00:03:48.160> this<00:03:48.460> layer

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
there we go all right so with this layer

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.910 
there we go all right so with this layer
is<00:03:49.090> when<00:03:49.300> you<00:03:49.390> want<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:49.660> be<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.810> little<00:03:50.140> bit<00:03:50.440> more

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
is when you want to be a little bit more

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.420 
is when you want to be a little bit more
realistic<00:03:51.820> with<00:03:52.150> it<00:03:52.600> so<00:03:53.260> I'm<00:03:53.560> realizing<00:03:54.370> that

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
realistic with it so I'm realizing that

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.850 
realistic with it so I'm realizing that
if<00:03:54.730> i<00:03:54.820> was<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.030> pin<00:03:55.450> my<00:03:56.050> bank<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.440> down<00:03:56.590> like

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
if i was to pin my bank is down like

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.380 
if i was to pin my bank is down like
that<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:57.400> wouldn't<00:03:57.760> look<00:03:57.850> so<00:03:58.060> realistic

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
that it wouldn't look so realistic

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.630 
that it wouldn't look so realistic
because<00:03:58.720> of<00:03:58.990> the<00:03:59.080> length<00:03:59.260> of<00:03:59.440> my<00:03:59.500> bangs<00:03:59.800> but<00:04:00.460> if

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
because of the length of my bangs but if

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.760 
because of the length of my bangs but if
your<00:04:00.790> bangs<00:04:00.970> are<00:04:01.120> not<00:04:01.300> as<00:04:01.570> long<00:04:02.050> then<00:04:02.500> you

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
your bangs are not as long then you

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.430 
your bangs are not as long then you
really<00:04:03.070> could<00:04:03.280> just<00:04:03.910> pin<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.180> down<00:04:04.440> going

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
really could just pin it down going

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.560 
really could just pin it down going
straight<00:04:05.740> forward<00:04:06.250> so<00:04:06.550> what<00:04:06.760> I'm<00:04:06.940> doing<00:04:06.970> is

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
straight forward so what I'm doing is

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.230 
straight forward so what I'm doing is
I'm<00:04:08.140> going<00:04:08.410> to<00:04:08.500> take<00:04:08.770> my<00:04:09.040> hair<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.580> I'm<00:04:10.000> going

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.030 
to roll it back alright so as you can
see<00:04:12.880> I<00:04:13.090> just<00:04:13.330> pin<00:04:13.630> that<00:04:14.110> row<00:04:14.500> back<00:04:14.770> a<00:04:14.800> little

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
see I just pin that row back a little

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.870 
see I just pin that row back a little
bit<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.900> I'm<00:04:16.900> going<00:04:17.170> to<00:04:17.260> do<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.100> same<00:04:18.370> now<00:04:18.820> you

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
bit and I'm going to do the same now you

bit and I'm going to do the same now you
want<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.269> be<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.390> little<00:04:19.540> bit<00:04:19.690> more<00:04:19.959> patient

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
want to be a little bit more patient

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
the top because if you pin them together

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.250 
the top because if you pin them together
in<00:04:26.650> like<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.970> group<00:04:27.970> or<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.270> clump<00:04:28.690> like<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.080> did

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
the ones underneath then it's going to

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.600 
the ones underneath then it's going to
be<00:04:31.060> easily<00:04:31.830> visible<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.130> you<00:04:33.220> don't<00:04:33.400> want

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610
