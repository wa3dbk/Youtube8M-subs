and on a whim went to look at it it was

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.050 
and on a whim went to look at it it was
reasonably<00:00:22.439> priced<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.160> said<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.640> didn't<00:00:23.880> run

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060

I<00:01:23.240> got<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:24.140> screaming<00:01:24.740> deal<00:01:24.979> on<00:01:25.220> this<00:01:25.369> thing<00:01:25.690> and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
I got a screaming deal on this thing and

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.130 
I got a screaming deal on this thing and
basically<00:01:28.640> all<00:01:28.910> I've<00:01:29.090> done<00:01:29.270> mechanically<00:01:30.110> I

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
basically all I've done mechanically I

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.990 
basically all I've done mechanically I
did<00:01:30.350> change<00:01:30.590> oil<00:01:30.860> but<00:01:31.190> it<00:01:31.310> actually<00:01:31.700> did<00:01:31.880> not

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
did change oil but it actually did not

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.999 
did change oil but it actually did not
need<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.300> be<00:01:32.539> changed<00:01:32.690> because<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.590> oil<00:01:33.800> was

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
need to be changed because the oil was

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.749 
need to be changed because the oil was
fresh<00:01:34.399> in<00:01:34.580> there<00:01:34.789> she<00:01:35.660> had<00:01:35.750> just<00:01:35.960> had<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.759> full

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
fresh in there she had just had a full

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.749 
fresh in there she had just had a full
service<00:01:38.179> done<00:01:38.390> last<00:01:38.599> year<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:38.990> guess<00:01:39.229> so

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
service done last year I guess so

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.540 
service done last year I guess so
this<00:01:41.420> was<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:41.780> deal<00:01:41.959> of<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.200> century<00:01:42.440> I<00:01:42.920> had
