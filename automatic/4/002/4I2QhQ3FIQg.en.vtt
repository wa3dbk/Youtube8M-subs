00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.600 
both excellent but big lack of red skull
in<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.050> movie<00:03:46.350> absolutely<00:03:46.950> none<00:03:47.100> who<00:03:47.370> was<00:03:47.580> a

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
in the movie absolutely none who was a

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.210 
in the movie absolutely none who was a
central<00:03:48.209> point<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.630> comic<00:03:48.959> book<00:03:48.990> story<00:03:49.410> so

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
central point to the comic book story so

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.140 
central point to the comic book story so
I<00:03:50.640> think<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.990> what<00:03:52.260> we<00:03:52.530> have<00:03:52.770> to<00:03:53.040> as<00:03:53.220> fans<00:03:53.760> be

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
I think that what we have to as fans be

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.900 
I think that what we have to as fans be
prepared<00:03:54.780> for<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.980> this<00:03:56.130> is<00:03:56.190> not<00:03:56.550> going

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
prepared for is that this is not going

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.870 
prepared for is that this is not going
to<00:03:57.060> be<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:57.480> civil<00:03:57.810> war<00:03:58.080> that<00:03:58.380> we<00:03:58.830> read<00:03:59.070> I<00:03:59.280> think

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
to be the civil war that we read I think

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.580 
to be the civil war that we read I think
it<00:04:00.090> will<00:04:00.240> have<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.540> heart<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:00.930> but<00:04:01.380> think

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
it will have the heart of it but think

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.880 
it will have the heart of it but think
about<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:02.010> there<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:03.120> no<00:04:03.840> secret<00:04:04.170> identities

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
about this there is no secret identities

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.130 
about this there is no secret identities
in<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.610> Marvel<00:04:05.910> Cinematic<00:04:05.940> Universe<00:04:06.360> tony<00:04:07.020> is
