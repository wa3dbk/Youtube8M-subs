00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.080 

we<00:02:15.500> could<00:02:15.650> better<00:02:15.800> in<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.070> passing<00:02:16.520> game<00:02:16.550> you

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
we could better in the passing game you

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.250 
we could better in the passing game you
know<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.210> think<00:02:17.300> we<00:02:17.570> had<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:17.720> good<00:02:17.900> running<00:02:18.140> game

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.780 
know I think we had a good running game
I<00:02:18.530> think<00:02:18.710> we<00:02:18.860> get<00:02:19.010> better<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.400> passing

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.980 
I think we get better in the passing
game<00:02:19.820> and<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.090> think<00:02:20.300> we've<00:02:20.420> worked<00:02:20.630> hard<00:02:20.720> all

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
game and I think we've worked hard all

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.830 
game and I think we've worked hard all
summer<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.740> that<00:02:22.310> area<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.180> believe<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.660> we

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
summer in that area so I believe that we

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.710 
summer in that area so I believe that we
can<00:02:23.870> get<00:02:24.080> better<00:02:24.260> in<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.470> passing<00:02:24.830> game

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:41.490 

Oh

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.960

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
not really the one thing about our team

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.240 
not really the one thing about our team
