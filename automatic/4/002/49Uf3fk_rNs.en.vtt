 as 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
 party 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.609
 the president attacked with little clothes 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.579
 the protests against the regime 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:25.930
 the parallel dollar 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.630
 that is considered 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.630
 genoa the official dollar highlighting official established game 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.580
 an adjustment mechanism 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.930
 a generator 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.400
 the big businessmen the national audience for 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.490
 let's continue generating alternative sales mechanisms in the national economy, 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.100
 that rather what makes hitting our economy hunter and hit all the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.670
 measures that yesterday have been taking more with the intention of that 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.940
 exchange control that the national government had what we seek is to strengthen 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.950
 our 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.790
 because here 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.410
 is the person who is going to require dollars for his or her 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.550
 have to go at a price 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.740
 mayoral official dollar put merchandise also from the board 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.030
 a dollar that the merchant should not have was that the salvage raise 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.030
 the country's economy 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.410
 who sets the price of the dollar swap 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.860
 I have no idea what everyone has lost 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 today those figures 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.800
 the international markets 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.140
 just big oligopoly 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.270
 and not all achieve capitalist who have 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.950
 what has the open text dollars I do not have the ability to sport is 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.950
 balance the market because balances it has for example 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.430
 there are people out there who have it 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.090
 while two other heads Valencia has 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.140
 but some think before was open 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.440
 the apc plans are implemented because the employment history is taken into account 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.140
 additional 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.250
 he needs to recover 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.380
 pregnancy 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.740
 I think one of the main ones that 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.330
 percent are following us the necessary parameters to acquire the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.179
 Dollars 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.499
 the state 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:15.549
 indicated a specific commission for the for good for trade the 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.169
 industry to access the dollars 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:21.679
 and people vote do not sign we did not meet or parameter they were up to it 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:23.749
 and on the other hand that people also very comfortable 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:27.099
 people also prefer to pay more than they believe it, I need it 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.909
 its surface is light an economy like the Venezuelan where there is a volume 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.749
 important imported products 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:36.599
 every time it happens 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.739
 and not to mention an international transaction 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.739
 you have to talk about some kind of production that contains some element 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:44.690
 imported 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.610
 necessarily the valuation of a swap 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.070
 will impact on the price of that national product I buy a dollar 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.739
 too high 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.169
 afonso 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:01.039
 there that the dollar bought by the person who wants to enter into agreements to follow 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:03.729
 but in the last parallel decade 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:07.379
 in case we are guided by the exchange rate there the real exchange rate 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.890
 established by the central bank established by the government 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:11.860
 I should not have 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.110
 no cancer or unfortunately a very market 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.310
 speculative and obviously that affects the final consumer that supposed 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:28.819
 what I know 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.139
 e the character lend themselves to that is what sells and exchanging the one that the 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.879
 Character takes into account outside 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.670
 and they handle dollar and then do transactions outside the country if the 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:38.869
 people had 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:43.899
 real knowledge of ccoo and how in this colony he uses the delicacy 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:45.099
 talk 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.909
 Coach 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.340
 the tribune a complaint for electoral fraud but the most important 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.199
 for this he regretted the year 2000 to 2008 little more should be should be no 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.209
 estimated liberators 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.399
 do not
