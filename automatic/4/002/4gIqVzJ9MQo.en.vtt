string job if you straighten out all the
strings<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.230> put<00:00:40.530> this

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
strings so what I do is I just put this

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.619

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
