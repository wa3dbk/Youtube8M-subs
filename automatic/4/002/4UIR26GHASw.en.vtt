00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.359
 the new xbox many have a long time on it 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.370
 waited after the ps4 only before 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.790
 Not too long ago her reveal had 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.290
 the new xbox called xbox when exactly how 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.360
 you have it from a third console yourself 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.430
 presented at the press conference of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.560
 Microsoft was mostly shown 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.920
 that you do with the new xbox 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.210
 but can look and do other things 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.640
 that does not matter here 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.949
 it's about the conclusion of the pk namely 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 to call our favorite franchise call of 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.040
 Duty in the case of the latest litter 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.960
 call of duty so one with one 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.309
 making-of i can understand if pc 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.730
 if you have such mice 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.710
 use the story which always top notch 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.500
 im franchise was again from someone 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.940
 written experience with it 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.950
 Wunder mp3 also has a well-known 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.460
 authors worked very well in the game 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.469
 the story should be emotional though 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.090
 at the same time offer action and us new 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.649
 Graphics is shown 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.899
 generation change one must also 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.969
 technology and infinity became one 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.159
 studio always very much worth it 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.439
 graphic has disappointed that here 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.119
 not a new one about something 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.909
 Jump animations after you have been 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.990
 2005 use the same and general 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.360
 new graphics 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.860
 but there is a hook in there 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.689
 Video game area is becoming very much 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.729
 long time first created models 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.360
 which an incredible number of polygons 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.210
 have 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.710
 and then they will be down 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.790
 broken because that's what I find with it 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.409
 would get along 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.750
 whether the whole learn from such a game 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.360
 As you can see here, the scene will be that 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.939
 play is really outside is not coming 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.009
 with these lifeless eyes but now the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.990
 new features of call of duty ghost 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.409
 warrior at least those who showed us 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.049
 were 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.210
 a dog a companion for the player 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.950
 which is supposedly so detailed 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.119
 but no dog in the world but no 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.549
 Extra fur has starfox adventures 2002 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.030
 the fish dodge as soon as you go through 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.030
 Sports 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.200
 interactive environment in multiplayer 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.940
 we'll see that in the game and 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.620
 there is a character editor for the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.750
 multiplayer which is not a bad thing 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.300
 except you jump on the train 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.550
 you get any items for that 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:21.950
 Buy on real money can then 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:24.260
 page has edita yes what a great thing 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.510
 these are the reasons for buying the new cd 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.890
 trailer princess from the gameplay shreds 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.060
 one has seen one can go out 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.530
 that game again one 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.330
 below-average singleplayer 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.790
 The graphics will always be nice 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.440
 But the thing is not help the gameplay 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.580
 and his latest motto effect 2 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.990
 is outdated scripts and then you can 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.520
 few opponents shoot down the again 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.970
 swing and then fit again it works 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.980
 ura people like the gameplay too 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.110
 we see at the latest to e3 but me 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.540
 can tell you everything needed already betrayed it 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.350
 exploded the cutscenes fell playing 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.540
 itself 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.060
 The dog dies at the end and it becomes clear 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.830
 that's the whole time captain price was 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.830
 only with an even thicker bath 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.430
 emotional storyline 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.890
 it could have been worse this 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.320
 cod reveal that would also have moordorf four 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.300
 but can be beside our whole 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.500
 ends is so great they had one more 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.500
 fat fat lie 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.550
 Great many game that was cod4 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.170
 not anymore 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.930
 and that would probably never again 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.370
 reach call of duty is fine now 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.400
 finally for the dogs 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.940
 haha now a few serious words 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.220
 to 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.900
 this idea with the dog is now even 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.580
 not bad i just think that she did it 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.120
 not really good to implement 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.590
 that will mostly be scripted 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.060
 what can and can do and what not 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.950
 and that you only give them in certain 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.630
 situations may be a frequent one 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.330
 situations but not always when the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.170
 player is wants to use and then 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.550
 you can actually do it right now 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.140
 leave out because then it is not 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.970
 great feature then it is still one 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.300
 gimmick like any other call of duty 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.030
 also this new over something 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.400
 jump and the new lead the 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.570
 are both really nice or say 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.000
 Also do not mind that you have to go 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.870
 come because the ea she already has something 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.450
 longer but this is the event for 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.990
 the xbox is you have to show how better 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:56.400
 you are how horny you are how big 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.660
 The jump is from 360 to and you show 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.820
 that one can now suffer in a call 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.990
 of duty at the latest to e3 if we 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.940
 see gameplay and who knows 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.940
 Maybe call of duty dogs
