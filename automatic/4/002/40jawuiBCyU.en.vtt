00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.290
 this can be done in value 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:12.840
 he spoke little by little outside the camp 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.160
 not enough was the place 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.870
 free always 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.370
 not always 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.750
 not always the story 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.600
 [Music] 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.500
 looking at the images for the goal so 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.610
 too much 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.610
 with the situation 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.489
 but because he is dead he was typical 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.380
 they were enough here 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.380
 if he will give us strength 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.470
 let me misunderstand now so with 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.240
 schools I reviewed 10 19 simple 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.829
 I could see it already from Rome because 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.100
 exceeded you ever 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.320
 for work before and semi-teachers 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.780
 the costar pencil was enforceable 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.510
 our 2 but the details happen to me 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.500
 to take sports goals during the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.110
 week 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.979
 maybe it is however like saying better known as 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.979
 I can do it 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.880
 well we happen to share 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.259
 actions and that state of the field e 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.409
 has a job 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:29.190
 so if you decide to power and one 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.270
 person who knows something should and 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:37.120
 since I was one of the few to have 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.510
 initially and I am proud of this 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:45.430
 now struggling to talk to share 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.230
 even sales of a little less if when 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.050
 things have gone but above all 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.530
 what is the city ​​like matera si 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.370
 professes the fifth of the dia 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.920
 it's quite difficult 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:03.090
 and remembered now sincerely makes me a 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.090
 bit sad 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.660
 of course from the rest that I am not here 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.330
 to say that 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.060
 in any case to have in the field 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.319
 I say immediately that it does so 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.310
 an understanding that was going 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.310
 read me but the situation 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.370
 the allowed protect button 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.370
 directional 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.420
 perhaps they were challenging department 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.510
 still a rigor that gave her the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.700
 possibility even of 10 goals and risk 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.430
 doors to the tax office because to know linares 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.020
 father who is now a personal count 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.020
 the final that brings you 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.640
 and will be so many costumes one thing 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.799
 patacca and the road maybe have 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.750
 met so many goalkeepers 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:06.950
 the man I still with the Sicilians 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:10.390
