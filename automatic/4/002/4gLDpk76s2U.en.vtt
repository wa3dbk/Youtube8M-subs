 well then when we click on it, it will open 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.540
 p this other page 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.240
 and we have to wait for the 25 seconds that they look at us 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.940
 the registered filmmaker would be 45 cairo 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.540
 doens we hope a little 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.940
 Well, it's going to look like the download button here, normal download 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.150
 we started to click, our download manager is going to open 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.399
 one day we go there start downloading as the file is wrapped does not weigh anything 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.760
 since this exportable program 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.760
 and well we hope to give open folder 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.109
 we will stay here are 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.109
 in the china 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.350
 we have a little 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.820
 well this file will be left 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.969
 the program is called 2007 then 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.830
 It gives granxa that does not remain 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.230
 then you know how to prove that as such right it was 15 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.670
 well we hope you do not extract our files 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.389
 and it's just going to create us from this one 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.559
 then this icon 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.559
 and what we are going to do is give it two eclipses 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.799
 this program 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.480
 as I say exportable 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.489
 it's very easy to be here, well, I'm going to show you how sanluqueño 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.709
 or to go with once you double-click the program but think it's going 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.179
 to open 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:34.360
 and well what he told them were 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.360
 efe in the image is that appears when we login 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.810
 okay good as I said is what we are going to do to change our 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.799
 image was weighted from the login 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.199
 then we can select one of the ones that the program already brings 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.939
 min here 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.650
 all of us and we want to say nothing in particular, let's see if instead 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.149
 current 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:02.629
 we are going to select 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.879
 where he has the images 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.939
 in depth this every 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.419
 if you keep 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.419
 my images 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.499
 and let's give here accept 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.929
 We are going to look like the images we have 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:24.969
 in this folder 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:28.119
 we wait a bit to load them 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:31.909
 and once the charges are simply selected before that image above 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.199
 this 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.399
 immediately the program is going to put 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:40.389
 or good is going to create a preview of me is what it would look like 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.489
 to apply the changes we will give without tacc and empathic 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.019
 we wait a little 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.319
 in the program 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.589
 or good as it modifies what is 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:58.829
 for the structure of the windows seven 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.829
 It took a bit p 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.569
 let's hope 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.759
 percent while I wanted to tell you 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:14.479
 Well for the clients 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:15.860
 They asked me 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.439
 if I'm the owner of the account too 15 16 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:23.189
 I have all my files here 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:26.379
 Well, like this one they realized, they erased me 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.449
 in the account on youtube 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.449
 and well I'm premiering now 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.080
 well let's wait a little 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.650
 and good this one already the changes were applied 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.020
 obviously I can not show you how it would be 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.240
 because I got tired I would give the video recording that 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.240
 but really they do the changes i with you 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.080
 restart your precede that the image is 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.309
 good for nobody
