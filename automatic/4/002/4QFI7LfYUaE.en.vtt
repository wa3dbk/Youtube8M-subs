00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.360 
gritty that the easiest way to do this
is<00:01:55.760> just<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:56.090> use<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:56.510> plant<00:01:57.229> pot<00:01:57.409> of<00:01:57.590> each<00:01:57.740> so

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
is just to use a plant pot of each so

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.280 
is just to use a plant pot of each so
that's<00:01:58.460> your<00:01:58.700> loan<00:01:58.820> based<00:01:59.060> compost<00:01:59.540> and<00:02:00.229> that

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
that's your loan based compost and that

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.100 
that's your loan based compost and that
should<00:02:00.620> do<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.670> just<00:02:02.659> work<00:02:02.870> these

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
should do it and just work these

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
should do it and just work these
together

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.250 

what's<00:02:08.130> important<00:02:08.880> here<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.229> to

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
what's important here is for you to

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
what's important here is for you to
actually<00:02:10.470> see<00:02:11.180> just<00:02:12.180> hand<00:02:12.510> gritty<00:02:12.960> this<00:02:13.920> looks

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
actually see just hand gritty this looks

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.940 
actually see just hand gritty this looks
it's<00:02:15.270> incredibly<00:02:15.900> well<00:02:16.140> trained<00:02:16.470> it's<00:02:16.710> not

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
it's incredibly well trained it's not

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.770 
it's incredibly well trained it's not
going<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.190> hold<00:02:17.430> any<00:02:17.610> water<00:02:17.820> or<00:02:18.150> any<00:02:18.330> moisture

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
going to hold any water or any moisture

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.260 
going to hold any water or any moisture
this<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.470> what<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:20.250> would<00:02:20.430> get<00:02:20.670> naturally

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
this is what you would get naturally

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.370 
this is what you would get naturally
around<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> Mediterranean

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
around the Mediterranean

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.230 
around the Mediterranean
so<00:02:22.800> for<00:02:23.810> sage<00:02:24.810> rosemary<00:02:25.410> time<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.880> time

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
so for sage rosemary time this is time

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.500 
so for sage rosemary time this is time
this<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.980> lemon<00:02:28.980> time<00:02:29.670> which<00:02:30.120> means<00:02:30.300> that

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
this is a lemon time which means that

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.880 
this is a lemon time which means that
the<00:02:30.660> leaves<00:02:30.870> have<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.080> slight<00:02:31.290> lemony<00:02:31.650> flavor

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
the leaves have a slight lemony flavor

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.070 
the leaves have a slight lemony flavor
this<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:32.880> been<00:02:33.030> growing<00:02:33.240> in<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.540> pot<00:02:33.780> for

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
this it's been growing in this pot for

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.860 
this it's been growing in this pot for
about<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.070> year<00:02:35.310> quite<00:02:35.580> happily<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.570> want<00:02:36.750> this

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
about a year quite happily you want this

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.170 
about a year quite happily you want this
really<00:02:37.440> gritty<00:02:37.950> compost<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> keep

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
really gritty compost and I keep

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.660 
really gritty compost and I keep
emphasizing<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:40.220> we're<00:02:41.220> not<00:02:41.460> gonna

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
emphasizing this we're not gonna

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.210 
emphasizing this we're not gonna
overwater<00:02:42.510> these<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:44.210> very<00:02:45.210> easily<00:02:46.010> we<00:02:47.010> take

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
overwater these so very easily we take

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.130 
overwater these so very easily we take
this<00:02:47.370> cutting<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.850> as<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.060> can<00:02:48.180> see<00:02:48.420> amazing

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
this cutting in as you can see amazing

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.350 
this cutting in as you can see amazing
root<00:02:49.770> system<00:02:50.220> they<00:02:50.310> have<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.520> really<00:02:50.820> extensive

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
root system they have a really extensive

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.420 
root system they have a really extensive
root<00:02:51.660> systems<00:02:52.110> these<00:02:52.290> herbs<00:02:52.530> because<00:02:53.250> they

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
root systems these herbs because they

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.380 
root systems these herbs because they
used<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.820> foraging<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.420> long<00:02:54.630> distance<00:02:56.180> for

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.120 

their<00:03:00.390> feed<00:03:00.720> it's<00:03:01.050> why<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.230> don't<00:03:01.530> overfeed

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
their feed it's why you don't overfeed

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.370 
their feed it's why you don't overfeed
them<00:03:02.430> they<00:03:02.550> used<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.940> hunting<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.450> out<00:03:03.600> and

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
them they used to hunting it out and

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.020 
them they used to hunting it out and
basically<00:03:04.800> we'll<00:03:05.010> just<00:03:05.190> water<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.790> and

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
basically we'll just water that in and

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.540 
basically we'll just water that in and
we<00:03:06.150> can<00:03:06.330> leave<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.990> so<00:03:07.320> we<00:03:08.040> can<00:03:08.280> grow

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
we can leave that so we can grow

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.190 
we can leave that so we can grow
rosemary<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.270> processor<00:03:09.630> arrows<00:03:09.870> we<00:03:10.080> will

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
rosemary this processor arrows we will

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.560 
rosemary this processor arrows we will
just<00:03:10.350> gently<00:03:10.770> cascade<00:03:11.340> over<00:03:11.370> this<00:03:11.790> pot<00:03:12.060> it'll

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
just gently cascade over this pot it'll

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.940 
just gently cascade over this pot it'll
never<00:03:12.720> get<00:03:12.930> as<00:03:13.050> big<00:03:13.200> as<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.410> one<00:03:13.709> we<00:03:13.860> were

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
never get as big as the one we were

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.280 
never get as big as the one we were
growing<00:03:14.130> in<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.430> wall<00:03:14.610> but<00:03:15.450> that's<00:03:15.600> rosemary

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
growing in the wall but that's rosemary

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.430 
growing in the wall but that's rosemary
and<00:03:16.890> we'll<00:03:17.730> go<00:03:17.880> from<00:03:18.030> rosemary<00:03:18.330> onto<00:03:19.140> time

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
and we'll go from rosemary onto time

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.100 
and we'll go from rosemary onto time
which<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:21.200> fourth<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.610> our<00:03:23.610> five<00:03:24.600> culinary

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
which is the fourth of our five culinary

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.320 
which is the fourth of our five culinary
