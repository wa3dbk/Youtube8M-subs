00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello how are you all welcome in your 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.200
 boyfriend of start let's talk about a 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.210
 update that has come out for 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.040
 playstation 4 which has blocked some 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.080
 Digital games is a way to buy 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.580
 much cheaper games than many people 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.620
 is dedicated to selling digital games 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.719
 where you can buy a game of never 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.600
 price in update 2.5 for 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.310
 playstation 4 because today the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.740
 turn on the play after updating 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.300
 it's going to look like a 2.5 update 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.269
 which will block the games that have been 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.130
 how to say ghost games like in 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.170
 colombia are also used what is 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.759
 something that the game is Pamplona or something is 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.530
 uncertain interest in what is this 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.079
 apparently update what is the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.719
 sony says that selling these games well 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.980
 by third parties is illegal so what has 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.750
 fact is to leave an update for 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.670
 playstation 4 which will block all 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.860
 these games at the moment have been blocked 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.590
 70 games with user of time the land 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.879
 lock 70 playstation 4 games make 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.050
 moment they are not pronounced if this 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.300
 update will also come out for 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.829
 playstation 3 no social networks will 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.750
 He talks a lot about how he can possibly 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.690
 leave but nothing is confirmed by 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.100
 they are then at the beginning they did not report 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.489
 I want to spend that since simply 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.810
 they say it is an illegal way of 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.939
 have income then what they have done 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.400
 is that this update 2.5 which 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.530
 to block games or most of the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.960
 digital games that were purchased 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.490
 in a true phantom way so no 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.409
 be pronounced if it will go to the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.299
 playstation3 there to be reporting cars 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.470
 formally I will leave a picture of how they 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.939
 it's going to look like all the people who have 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 bought the digital games of this 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.000
 way you have to clarify that the games 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.650
 that have been shared between 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.630
 two consoles will not have any type 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.460
 of problem this is going to be problems with 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.470
 third parties certain since many people 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.030
 Well, as you know, you could buy a 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.650
 game in the playstation store and it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.840
 could distribute between three others 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.729
 members of a group so from now on 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.579
 from now on playstation 4 only 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.710
 can be downloaded twice in two 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.750
 different consoles then there's a lot 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.250
 people who have lost money and then 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.229
 this is already going to be a problem for the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.850
 who sell digital games and I live 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.049
 We will be informing you later not 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.049
 he saw it in a next video
