00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.800 
yeah why was 167 for sea level to fit on
the<00:02:32.780> grade<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:35.490> height<00:02:36.110> map<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.680> world<00:02:38.810> so

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
the grade the height map of the world so

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.140 
the grade the height map of the world so
that's<00:02:40.230> pretty<00:02:40.500> much<00:02:40.560> how<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:41.730> Everest

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
that's pretty much how that so Everest

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.520 
that's pretty much how that so Everest
is<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.450> like<00:02:42.600> 265<00:02:43.760> mariana<00:02:44.760> trench<00:02:45.240> is<00:02:45.660> at

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
is that like 265 mariana trench is at

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.310 
is that like 265 mariana trench is at
like<00:02:47.280> zero<00:02:47.550> or<00:02:47.670> whatever<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:48.810> just<00:02:49.140> the
