00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.410
 welcome to my little one 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.390
 hare skin 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.369
 other video for you recently 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.619
 ran on rtl the broadcast that 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.990
 Success recipe but you could have a 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.550
 Present a recipe that one for special 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.840
 is innovative and what it is on the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.400
 German market does not exist 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.040
 if I have to go to the 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.110
 the German market is the winner 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.000
 product can now be found in the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.710
 edeka markets, and not just that 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.800
 winner product but also that 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.290
 second-placed product and indeed has 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.809
 won the press but that 's easy 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.540
 a sausage with a free time so 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.879
 a combination of a potter and 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.399
 a pretzel or in other words one 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.190
 sausages in a dressing gown with only one 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.020
 third day instead of a puff pastry like 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.629
 the child and the second place 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.660
 Product is a tomato jam 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.130
 tomatoes dream of my favorite from the beginning 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.860
 the show because I just got the idea 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.410
 awesome finds from a tomato at 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.810
 our common language belongs to vegetables 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.060
 botanically seen but a berry is too 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.039
 to process a jam 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.750
 but I have the tomato jam 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.190
 unfortunately we do not get america with us 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.750
 she probably just gives up there 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.890
 otherwise I would not have them today 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.170
 also shown 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.810
 but maybe we will do it in one 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.649
 video and we are dedicated to that today 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.039
 Press Day 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.690
 and if you can test it until now 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.090
 product that we do in the edeka markets 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.709
 can get on the american 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.030
 market with tim prenzel but longer 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.220
 and now also on the german market 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.740
 It is a frozen product and you 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.289
 get it in the edeka markets at the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.060
 frozen pretzels are in the packaging 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.489
 six pieces and the pack costs three 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.099
 euro 99 and now we want the 

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:57.099
 press unpack and watch guys 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.160
 Here you can see the preetzer 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.140
 hot dog 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.840
 They consist of a small sausage 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.300
 a puzzle around and something 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.340
 cheese sprinkled on it and we will 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.040
 Now prepare according to instructions and 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.290
 For that the sausages have to be 20 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.030
 View minutes at room temperature 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.760
 then they come in the preheated 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.269
 oven at middle stage and become 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.250
 bake at 210 degrees for about 20 minutes until 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.540
 everybody is really brown why in 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.540
 lye dough again 10 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.320
 the letters sausages are finished now 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.850
 baked and really nice 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.920
 it smells right here too 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.080
 Yummy I just got it after that 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.760
 Bake on a slip and given 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.020
 let them cool down for quite a while now 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.460
 not that hot anymore 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:35.660
 and now they 'll just like them 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:38.180
 cut and try here is now 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.940
 the sausage in there 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:46.970
 The going here is the outside of the dough and 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:49.960
 Now we will try it now 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.960
 I'll just try it 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.250
 So that tastes very delicious too 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.660
 Sausage is really nice spicy though 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.720
 the dough from where does not taste 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.950
 pretzel but rather puff pastry 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.239
 So you taste a light yeast note 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.160
 and therefore I would say that it is her 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.900
 a small part of context one 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.650
 mixture of every day and one 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.390
 puff pastry 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.150
 but I think that actually tastes 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.100
 like a sausage in a sleeping jacket delicious 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.120
 but i like to sleep but i sleep 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.310
 would have thought that tastes too 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.840
 bretzel out of only yes yes I think 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.910
 Also that it is not really cheese 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.550
 tastes know already know so there 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.290
 from a sports event and the uni 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.660
 made it yourself and there it was more like that 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.760
 that the crisis you could buy 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.680
 have surfaced and then you will 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.270
 wrapped around it and then 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.860
 right after wesel tasted but 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.200
 tasted as real after 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.330
 puff pastry yeah, that's it 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.160
 a really good idea for the 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.590
 take it with you for a buffet or four 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.480
 kids birthday at that time as well 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.880
 can eat finger food and also very cold 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.820
 tastes good like sausages in a dressing gown 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.500
 It tastes good but I would have 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.140
 now with the names thought that that 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.970
 car breaks down after tastes and tastes 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.070
 a pretzel actually becomes one 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.660
 made blue every day and that 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.700
 clearly makes money very much 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.140
 puff pastry 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:23.920
 I'm looking at the question from behind 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:26.120
 plays here actually wishes 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.210
 Delicious sausages your own skin 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.830
 and oil of caustic soda dough pieces 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.820
 So as I thought, one said 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.520
 clumsy tel 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.979
 You can also taste that clearly 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.530
 that there is no room for you here 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:40.660
 It's a pity, after all, it's longer 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.819
 just like sausages in a sleeping gown 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.770
 but I would have the pretzel outside 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.539
 I will definitely and I will definitely 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.330
 sometimes a homemade recipe 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.490
 fiddle where the dough on the outside also one 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.080
 priest is dough and maybe there is 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.909
 that on my video 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.159
 we could just mean mine now 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:59.169
 Comments write if you press this 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.580
 but have already tasted like you 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.460
 You may taste them in the 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.379
 usa have eaten before and if you 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.479
 a video would like to see the 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:09.069
 do it yourself and how will you do us? 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:12.310
 taste it now before it gets cold 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:14.560
 Will and seems to me the comments 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.860
 takes from trust the tomatoes with you 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.360
 So the tomato jam then that is 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.280
 that is, it's just that it's with us 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.380
 medica is not there and write me 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.780
 Also to where the tomato jam at 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.280
 you stand in the market that would me 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.810
 interested and thank you for 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.810
 attitude until next time
