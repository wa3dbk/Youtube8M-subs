00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 today we prepare the sata cake of 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.150
 zucchini let's see what ingredients do 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:12.719
 it takes 300 g of zucchini 200 g of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.509
 flour 0 30 grams of pecorino 100 ml of 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.240
 peanut oil 4 eggs 2 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.060
 enough teaspoons of salt and butter 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.920
 enough to prepare in ours 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.350
 salted zucchini cake 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.720
 let's start grating the zucchini with 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.279
 a grater with wide holes 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.830
 at this point we put everything in 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.440
 planetary you can use in the absence 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.780
 also a hand whisk or a whisk 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.760
 electric whips we put all the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.320
 planetary ingredients if 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.210
 were to use the planetary not 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.649
 will have importance to the order of 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.660
 inserting the ingredients 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.719
 if instead it should use the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.899
 whips or by hand or electric I advise you 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.160
 to first insert the eggs and the flour e 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.629
 then finally add the zucchini 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.520
 let's work the owner with the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.300
 hook until dough is obtained 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.920
 soft but homogeneous 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.600
 when the mixture is homogeneous 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.700
 we butter a baking pan 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.040
 pour the mixture inside and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.830
 Bake at 180 degrees in the oven 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.570
 preheated ventilated for about 15 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.759
 minutes 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.310
 I recommend it when we have been 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.979
 the dough in the pan beats from a 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.509
 couple of times on the table in such a way as to 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.509
 avoid any air bubbles 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.900
 we verify the cooking of ours 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.470
 savory pie with one 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.470
 toothpick 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.960
 if it should be dry we can 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.610
 remove it eventually we can 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.470
 put it in five minutes under the grill 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.250
 so as to increase it a little 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.590
 color when our savory pie 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.649
 it will be ready remove it from the oven 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.570
 let it intimidate and then serve la7 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.030
 this is the result of the recipe 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.729
 perfect for a dinner but also for a 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.860
