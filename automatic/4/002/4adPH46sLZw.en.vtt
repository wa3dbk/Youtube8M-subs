bowls wagon this happens to be in 1970
but<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.730> think<00:00:14.730> up<00:00:14.849> until<00:00:14.969> about<00:00:15.500> 67<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:17.100> gas

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
but I think up until about 67 the gas

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.760 
but I think up until about 67 the gas
gauge<00:00:17.670> was<00:00:18.000> get<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.510> cheap<00:00:18.690> get<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.050> Jeep<00:00:21.770> as

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
gauge was get the cheap get the Jeep as

gauge was get the cheap get the Jeep as
I<00:00:23.040> was<00:00:23.190> saying<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.180> Volkswagen

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
I was saying you know Volkswagen

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.990 
I was saying you know Volkswagen
originally<00:00:25.050> had<00:00:25.200> a<00:00:25.230> mechanical<00:00:25.980> gas<00:00:26.610> gauge

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
originally had a mechanical gas gauge

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.270 
originally had a mechanical gas gauge
with<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.240> cable<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.080> then<00:00:28.170> they<00:00:28.290> changed<00:00:28.740> like

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280 
with a cable and then they changed like

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.250 
with a cable and then they changed like
every<00:00:29.580> other<00:00:29.700> car<00:00:30.030> to<00:00:30.680> electric<00:00:31.789> gas<00:00:32.789> gauge

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
every other car to electric gas gauge

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.119 
every other car to electric gas gauge
there's<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.499> simple<00:00:35.219> system<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.870> wiper<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.769> a

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
there's a simple system of a wiper and a

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.840 
there's a simple system of a wiper and a
resistor<00:00:38.609> track<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:40.249> the<00:00:41.249> one<00:00:41.429> in<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> car

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
resistor track and the one in the car

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.069 
resistor track and the one in the car
now<00:00:42.409> we<00:00:43.409> were<00:00:43.559> fooling<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.749> after<00:00:45.749> that

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
now we were fooling with and after that

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.889 
now we were fooling with and after that
it<00:00:46.609> the<00:00:47.609> wires<00:00:47.819> and<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> resistor<00:00:48.629> track

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
it the wires and the resistor track

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.720 
it the wires and the resistor track
broke<00:00:49.319> and<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.620> can't<00:00:49.859> explain<00:00:50.159> how<00:00:50.309> that

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
broke and I can't explain how that

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.270 
broke and I can't explain how that
happened<00:00:52.039> so<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.420> substitute<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.870> got<00:00:55.829> from<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
happened so this substitute I got from a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.469 
happened so this substitute I got from a
local<00:00:57.199> full<00:00:58.199> line<00:00:58.609> independent<00:00:59.609> auto<00:00:59.879> parts

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
local full line independent auto parts

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:05.499

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
store and the brand name is gyro max

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.319 
store and the brand name is gyro max
which<00:01:06.509> sounds<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.200> porn<00:01:07.799> movie<00:01:08.210> hit<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
you get the Honda a lot of traffic today

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.640 
you get the Honda a lot of traffic today
on<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.870> street<00:01:16.510> anyway<00:01:17.510> so<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:18.260> can<00:01:18.410> see<00:01:18.530> the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
on the street anyway so you can see the

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.360 
on the street anyway so you can see the
park<00:01:18.890> number

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
park number

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.370

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
high and I'm not sure I want it striking

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
the top of the gas tank so I may reshape

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.870 
the top of the gas tank so I may reshape
this<00:01:55.610> arm<00:01:55.910> or<00:01:56.450> bend<00:01:56.660> these<00:01:56.840> tabs<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.880> prevent

this arm or bend these tabs to prevent
that<00:01:59.119> and<00:02:00.110> I<00:02:00.200> would<00:02:00.380> like<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.740> know<00:02:00.950> precisely

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
that and I would like to know precisely

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.400 
that and I would like to know precisely
when<00:02:02.030> I'm<00:02:02.119> going<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.300> run<00:02:02.509> out<00:02:02.540> of<00:02:02.690> gas

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
when I'm going to run out of gas

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.650 
when I'm going to run out of gas
so<00:02:03.979> I<00:02:04.009> may<00:02:04.190> engage<00:02:04.340> in<00:02:04.700> some<00:02:04.880> adjustment<00:02:05.420> there

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
so I may engage in some adjustment there

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.800 
so I may engage in some adjustment there
of<00:02:06.290> course<00:02:06.410> that's<00:02:06.680> how<00:02:06.830> we<00:02:06.979> ruined<00:02:07.490> the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
of course that's how we ruined the

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.699 
of course that's how we ruined the
previous<00:02:08.810> sender<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:11.270> was<00:02:11.450> about<00:02:11.709> $60

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
previous sender and this was about $60

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.340 
previous sender and this was about $60
now<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.250> local<00:02:13.910> Volkswagen<00:02:14.570> shops<00:02:14.870> had<00:02:15.170> two

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
the wires got the power supply will

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.759 
the wires got the power supply will
create<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.150> ground<00:02:47.510> with<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:47.900> alligator<00:02:48.380> clip

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
create a ground with this alligator clip

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.530 
create a ground with this alligator clip
and<00:02:49.959> at<00:02:50.959> this<00:02:51.110> point<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:52.280> will<00:02:52.790> take<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.330> camera

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
and at this point I will take the camera

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.910 
and at this point I will take the camera
then<00:02:54.500> my<00:02:54.680> assistant<00:02:54.830> will<00:02:55.370> report<00:02:55.850> on<00:02:56.000> the

the<00:03:02.060> car<00:03:03.940> excuse<00:03:04.940> me

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
the car excuse me

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.220 
the car excuse me
I<00:03:05.590> had<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.769> car<00:03:06.980> hooked<00:03:07.250> up<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:08.230> battery

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
I had the car hooked up to a battery

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.670 
I had the car hooked up to a battery
charger<00:03:09.980> for<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:11.620> more<00:03:12.620> consistent<00:03:14.170> test

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.340 

well<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.090> guess<00:03:35.330> we'll<00:03:35.510> have<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.750> wait<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.140> see

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
well I guess we'll have to wait and see

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.030 
well I guess we'll have to wait and see
where<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.680> winds<00:03:37.100> up<00:03:38.530> which<00:03:39.530> could<00:03:39.770> take<00:03:39.980> a

your gas gauge on just about any car is

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.680 
your gas gauge on just about any car is
remarkably<00:04:12.290> reliable<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:13.220> in<00:04:13.910> my<00:04:14.030> experience

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
remarkably reliable and in my experience

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.259 
remarkably reliable and in my experience
they<00:04:14.900> all<00:04:15.050> use<00:04:15.350> a<00:04:15.709> power<00:04:16.070> regulator<00:04:16.730> of<00:04:16.850> some

they all use a power regulator of some
sort<00:04:17.600> this<00:04:18.549> I've<00:04:19.549> never<00:04:19.850> taken<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.329> apart<00:04:20.660> but

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
sort this I've never taken it apart but

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.130 
sort this I've never taken it apart but
I<00:04:20.930> presume<00:04:21.200> it<00:04:21.500> uses<00:04:21.859> points<00:04:22.340> inside<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:23.900> send

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
I presume it uses points inside to send

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.120 
I presume it uses points inside to send
pulses<00:04:24.650> of<00:04:24.800> electricity<00:04:26.320> longer<00:04:27.320> pulses<00:04:27.860> when

pulses of electricity longer pulses when

pulses of electricity longer pulses when
the<00:04:28.400> voltage<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:29.480> low<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:30.140> shorter<00:04:30.919> pulses

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
the voltage is low and shorter pulses

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.970 
the voltage is low and shorter pulses
when<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:31.760> voltage<00:04:32.150> is<00:04:32.390> high<00:04:32.950> for<00:04:33.950> a

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
when the voltage is high for a

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.480 
when the voltage is high for a
consistent<00:04:35.230> power<00:04:36.230> regulation<00:04:36.950> so<00:04:37.310> where<00:04:37.460> to

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
consistent power regulation so where to

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.840 
consistent power regulation so where to
come<00:04:37.790> to<00:04:37.820> rest<00:04:42.340> it's<00:04:43.340> kind<00:04:43.550> of<00:04:43.610> interesting

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
come to rest it's kind of interesting

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.580 
come to rest it's kind of interesting
because<00:04:44.060> this<00:04:44.240> car<00:04:44.479> always<00:04:44.660> ran<00:04:44.990> out<00:04:45.200> of<00:04:45.229> gas

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
because this car always ran out of gas

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.800 
because this car always ran out of gas
when<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.070> was<00:04:46.310> showing<00:04:46.669> almost<00:04:46.850> empty<00:04:47.479> so<00:04:47.660> that

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
when it was showing almost empty so that

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.920 
when it was showing almost empty so that

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.900 
might be more of aspect of the gas gauge
