00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
be on it next year and CA we're gonna be

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.870 
be on it next year and CA we're gonna be
trading<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.769> think<00:00:29.099> he<00:00:29.250> would<00:00:29.400> go<00:00:29.580> for

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
trading to what I think he would go for

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.930 
trading to what I think he would go for
which<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.869> between<00:00:31.230> 50<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.710> 70<00:00:32.250> k<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.489> probably

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
which is between 50 and 70 k so probably

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.080 
which is between 50 and 70 k so probably
the<00:00:33.059> treads<00:00:33.300> around<00:00:33.570> 70<00:00:33.960> k<00:00:34.520> try<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> get<00:00:35.760> there

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the treads around 70 k try to get there

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.670 
the treads around 70 k try to get there
as<00:00:36.120> quick<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:36.480> possible<00:00:36.780> i<00:00:37.200> obviously<00:00:37.469> this

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
as quick as possible i obviously this

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.799 
as quick as possible i obviously this
could<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:38.010> done<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> day<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.820> yeah<00:00:39.660> these

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
could be done in a day and yeah these

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.150 
could be done in a day and yeah these
are<00:00:39.870> some<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> stats<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.590> given<00:00:40.860> him<00:00:40.950> I

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
are some of the stats have given him I

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.779 
are some of the stats have given him I
think<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.480> half<00:00:42.780> Moroccan<00:00:43.410> half<00:00:43.680> Italian<00:00:44.640> so

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
think it's half Moroccan half Italian so

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.459 
think it's half Moroccan half Italian so
we<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.030> play<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.390> any<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:46.110> he<00:00:46.170> has<00:00:46.289> only

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
we can play for any but he has only

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.410 
we can play for any but he has only
played<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.950> game<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.370> Morocco<00:00:47.850> which<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.390> a
