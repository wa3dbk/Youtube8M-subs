00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.779

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.160
 hunter 4 ultimate good 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.250

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.170

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.140

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.950
 of material so we must do a yes 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.040
 I achieved stigma exercise 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.750
 I'm also going to take advantage 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.310
 while we make the house that 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.400
 quietly there we have our 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.090
 built as I like this showed what 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.780
 said while doing here from home I go 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.580
 to comment that Monday on Monday this 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.159
 next week we will upload the videoblog 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.840
 with him 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.150
 well, with our code, the friend 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.650
 to play the monster hunter 4 ultimate 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.650
 there they are doing a ride 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.150
 and if we also leave this weekend 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.170
 so that edu will be doing his 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.000
 videos and that is growing too 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.430
 team because it's not plan to enter the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.970
 on-line 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.070
 naked like the one who says 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.840
 in the video blog we will also explain 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.420
 how will we help to record that is 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.300
 Since he does not have voice chat, we will have 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.410
 than using another means too 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.050
 we will set schedules as we will be with 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.210
 you and all these little things apart 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.430
 apart from that we will not only do 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.620
 games with you to record being 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.920
 we will also do games simply by 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.560
 play for fun I hope that part 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.110
 of I want to play with us to record 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.470
 also want to play with us only 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.470
 for fun 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.890
 well come on let's put a little trampita 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.890
 here 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.190
 we have there is a partner that has placed 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:25.680
 also another trap on the other hand 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.680
 let's see if there are traps combo 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.080
 the question now is that it falls into a 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.300
 there we have it perfect 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.520
 and do not create a place in the first trap 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.520
 and there to give you pleasure 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.269
 taking advantage of the moment there is left 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.269
 of a little jump 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.480
 it seems that this end man had 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.880
 wanting to play the game of the goose because 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.510
 trap trap and hit him because I 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.510
 touches is the new motto of the monster hunter 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.950
 words that has been been very 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.990
 well it has been very well comes out in one of 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.010
 one jump but another forward and you 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.010
 get in the next 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.090
 and well I hope you are taking with 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.909

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.280
 that you already have very good weapons 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.439
 dates armor that does not have 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.360
 It has been a long time but some will 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.220
 will have already put a few hours 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.400
 game already 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.330
 trying to get the best I can 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.330
 up to that point 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.100
 I can if you do not think nice 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.100
 let's see there we have the tail 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.500
 and come 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.860

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.400
 he already had four strokes counted and 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.400
 the vinegar has fallen always gives me a 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.230
 little bit of grief when when I go married 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.519
 for a fate greg but then comes you 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.480

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:14.610
