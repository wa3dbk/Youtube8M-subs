00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
like this finish it's a little bit

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.770 
like this finish it's a little bit
dearer<00:00:31.920> than<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.399> normal<00:00:32.759> concrete<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.690> if

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
dearer than just normal concrete but if

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.120 
dearer than just normal concrete but if
you're<00:00:33.899> paying<00:00:34.140> back<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> look<00:00:35.010> at

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
you're paying back and have a look at

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.479 
you're paying back and have a look at
the<00:00:35.280> normal<00:00:35.610> concrete<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:37.129> versus<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
the normal concrete there versus the the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.729 
the normal concrete there versus the the
driveway<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:39.660> really<00:00:39.870> breaks<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
driveway it just really breaks it up and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.459 
driveway it just really breaks it up and
and<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.489> gives<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.879> new<00:00:42.030> perspective<00:00:42.469> I

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
and and gives it a new perspective I

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.910 
and and gives it a new perspective I
feel<00:00:44.160> anyway<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.750> sets<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.289> place<00:00:46.649> off

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
feel anyway and just sets the place off

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
feel anyway and just sets the place off
the<00:00:47.100> trouble<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:48.059> pavers<00:00:48.360> especially<00:00:49.020> in

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the trouble with pavers especially in

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.889 
the trouble with pavers especially in
the<00:00:49.140> driveway<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:49.770> they<00:00:50.010> move<00:00:50.539> when<00:00:51.539> people

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the driveway as they move when people

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.540 
the driveway as they move when people
are<00:00:52.020> turning<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.530> them<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.829> driving<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.370> them

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
are turning on them and driving on them

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.160 
are turning on them and driving on them
and<00:00:53.870> they<00:00:54.870> also<00:00:56.030> have<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> bit<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.390> air<00:00:58.020> they

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
and they also have a bit of air they

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.849 
and they also have a bit of air they
also<00:00:58.350> cause<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.359> go<00:01:00.359> all<00:01:00.480> black<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.079> discolor

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
also cause a go all black and discolor

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.830 
also cause a go all black and discolor
as<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> black<00:01:02.550> tires<00:01:02.850> drive<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.510> them<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:03.809> I

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
as the black tires drive on them but I

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.140 
as the black tires drive on them but I
find<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.350> stuff<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:05.189> doesn't<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.030> way

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
find this stuff just doesn't go that way

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.840 
find this stuff just doesn't go that way
you've<00:01:06.810> got<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.369> expansion<00:01:08.369> joints<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
you've got the expansion joints and the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.630 
you've got the expansion joints and the
cuts<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.320> hardly<00:01:10.619> even<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:10.920> those<00:01:11.280> cuts

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
cuts you can hardly even see those cuts

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.820 
cuts you can hardly even see those cuts
in<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> concrete<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.780> know<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> fine

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
in the concrete you know just see a fine

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.260 
in the concrete you know just see a fine
line<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.549> that's<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> other<00:01:14.909> thing<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
line there and that's the other thing I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.359 
line there and that's the other thing I
like<00:01:15.479> about<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.930> really<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.830> hides<00:01:17.070> any

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
like about it really just hides any

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.870 
like about it really just hides any
imperfections<00:01:18.439> any<00:01:19.439> cracks<00:01:19.830> anything<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
little bit of class a little bit of

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.539 
little bit of class a little bit of
