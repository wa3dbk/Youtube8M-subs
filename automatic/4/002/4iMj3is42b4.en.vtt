00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.500
 and then everyone here is talking about what the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:14.219
 messi I'm bringing you here one 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:17.310
 new game of pokémon is peace because in 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.720
 pokémon hotels 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.720
 so here is a very cool face game 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.490
 bugged here 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.640
 So people, I was swimming our 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.980
 miss then guys I'm here to bring 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.000
 for you a new series because sex 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.329
 very good 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.789
 good I like 7 of pokémon ot 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.309
 then this means different from the Pokemon 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.239
 others because it's here give it to you like 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.460
 If you can see, drop pokémon out and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.219
 It's also battling Pokemon 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.940
 who are also out 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.920
 poker balls because they are wild 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.220
 so here it is 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.610
 this game only allows you to record six minutes 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.750
 and tooth a few seconds then you want 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.439
 be brief 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.210
 in the explanations for you to evolve your 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.090
 pokémon you need to be on a level 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.250
 determined to evolve my 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.470
 calling for a call and I need to be 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.740
 level 40 I'm at level 8 and not enough 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.530
 be at level 40 or have it is also 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.310
 with fire stone 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.670
 then it's the only bad thing about this game is because 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.340
 need these stones is also have little 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.649
 and dex if I click on my pokémon will 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.509
 show his pokédex showing everything 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.729
 this and most this game it 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.500
 practically controlled by the button 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:02.250
 right mouse is also has 66 not 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:07.190
 sorry new choice of pokémons that is 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:12.720
 the calling of google to launch the listen the 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:17.010
 that one loves tricot is the 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:20.490
 tintin shannon elton I'll show 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.310
 fotinha it to you who is better 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:27.240
 also as it gets near the water to fish 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:31.980
 aquatic pokémons and type also has 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.800
 level of fishing type if I have level 80 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.250
 I have a chance to fish an oi omer that 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.590
 I believe you all know that 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:45.060
 Pokemon is the email 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:53.209
 so people are here too 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:53.209
 chico guides is also total I have 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.760
 should know that they are the Pokémon of 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.020
 first of the second and third 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.590
 generation 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.300
 soon will have the update of Wednesday 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.050
 generation 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.530
 so it will be good for you too 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:16.980
 the majorities are better things in the game 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:21.060
 you need to be premium than to be 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.239
 you need to pay monthly 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:31.560
 or if you want you can put the month yes 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:34.850
 month is not of your choice and buy account 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.650
 It's 30 days premium 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:43.470
 so it's very good it has several types of 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:45.200
 Pokémon also has not only saffron 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.370

 showing you guys but also has 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:58.230
 other other places is for you to speak 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:01.980
 with mps it's kind of unique to 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:06.330
 Nurse Joy It's Just You Talk Ray And 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.250
 press enter to heal 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.799
 pokémons but they have to be inside 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:17.549
 because the good and typing ray and enter and 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:23.020

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:26.169
 bringing you is the 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.710

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:34.990

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.280
 Level step is also because this game 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.060
 there are several things to explain 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.039
 explained but I do not have time because 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:53.110
 it only allows me to record six minutes 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:57.970
 for each video then this is very bad 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.849
 and look at this pokémon he is new I do not 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.190
 I know many new pokémons. 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.419
 I'll get this pokémon to put the 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.270
 my berg 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:10.180
 So I had to put that Pokémon 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.720
 only drag because ball to this location 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.580
 which shows and is a great writing not 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.090
 I need to capture the race because 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.759
 I already have a thank you person who played 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.300

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:29.229
 boss is also stone rock 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.630
 So people, I'm going to stay here. 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:35.919

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:38.349

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:45.330
