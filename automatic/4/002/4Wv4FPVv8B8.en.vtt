00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
your device so just going into control

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.350 
your device so just going into control
center<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.430> make<00:01:08.520> sure<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.909> toggled<00:01:09.270> off

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
center and make sure it is toggled off

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.080 
center and make sure it is toggled off
just<00:01:10.170> there<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.710> uses<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> some<00:01:11.790> sort<00:01:11.939> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
just there it uses a some sort of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.789 
just there it uses a some sort of
different<00:01:12.450> Bluetooth<00:01:12.840> system<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.500> that's<00:01:13.680> who

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
different Bluetooth system so that's who

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.320 
different Bluetooth system so that's who
we're<00:01:13.920> kind<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.220> interfere<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.030> then

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
we're kind of interfere with it then

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.520 
we're kind of interfere with it then
