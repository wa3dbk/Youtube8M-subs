00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.310
 hello at marius are loose today 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.720
 I want a friend again 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.180
 the ears donate studies to me 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.660
 am not 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:23.640
 a passerby like 175 involved with 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:27.119
 a 23 mm hot stupid bead in orange 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.640
 I use a good 70 as a thread 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.600
 in white 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:41.790
 I start with a basic winding 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:46.309
 to hook bow advents in which me 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.309
 again a few fi band from the cocktail 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:06.380
 These will be on the entire length 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:10.369
 bound the rest cut off 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:15.259
 Now let's go for two mfd flash threads 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.490
 or maybe crystal island 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.490
 this one in front 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.960
 Now we turn our bobbin again 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:33.470
 flat thread around our utc thread 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:38.810
 get and bind the flash material 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:47.119
 until the back and go back to 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:52.690
 Then wind it up to the pearl 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.690
 we with the flash our body 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.600
 We go back to the half again 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.230
 always keep it tight and go 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.230
 back to the front 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.900
 of one more two windings and make 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:36.540
 Behind the head we close with two 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:44.250
 unwind and cut the body 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:50.180
 the rest so we have a nice 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.180
 the transparent body in orange 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.870
 we turn our colorful flags again 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.930
 the rather flat is time to 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.920
 Food 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:05.000
 that is, the flat bandage will thread 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.000
 divided in the middle 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.830
 sometimes not so easy 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.690
 now we have it 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:36.290
 we are now laying in these threads 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.290
 some race doping 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:48.950
 this should not be too tight to close 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:57.620
 but very loosely opposite 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:04:02.180
 direction again the thread contract with 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:07.150
 the resulting with it now strangled the 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.150
 filling the thorax behind the head 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:19.940
 we have a bit of soup so far 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.090
 already a finished fly optional who 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:28.639
 could now like the thread 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:40.400
 another match glistening and some 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:47.180
 fever of a cdc as one of a 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:49.900
 cc again of cool deanery in the 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.900
 are loop 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:06.400
 30 30 the character really is off 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:15.400
 them in the loop and to the team 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:19.080
 along with this I now cut up 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.080
 equalize with your finger 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.640
 the band disappear again that the 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:38.850
 help to twist 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:47.890
 some winding tight behind the pearl 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:52.570
 he closes with the weather 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:57.700
 we now the fliers from who like here 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:59.890
 now has a gap between me 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.890
 I do not like that personally 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.520
 me a little while in black 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:08.460
 spins it on the thread and 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.170
 fill me even the smallest gap 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.260
 behind the gold head or the dumbest 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:17.890
 head in different colors and make 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:23.140
 then the second knot and goal with 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:27.970
 this beautiful pearl firmly behind the the 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:32.650
 rest from now on with a world where still the 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:35.860
 fly a bit brushed something 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:38.440
 too long cdc feverish with a bit 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.700
 rightly support the fingernail and 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.700
 finished is the ears stream
