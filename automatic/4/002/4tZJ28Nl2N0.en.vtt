00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
in this baby was that I was in makeup

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.830 
in this baby was that I was in makeup
school<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.670> was<00:01:17.880> using<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.299> quite<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.570> lot

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
school and I was using it quite a lot

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.200 
school and I was using it quite a lot
because<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.680> was<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.830> multitasker<00:01:20.729> sometimes

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
because it was a multitasker sometimes

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.539 
because it was a multitasker sometimes
when<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.960> finishing<00:01:22.320> someone's<00:01:23.100> makeup<00:01:23.400> or

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
when you finishing someone's makeup or

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.700 
when you finishing someone's makeup or
someone<00:01:23.820> finishes<00:01:24.299> doing<00:01:24.630> makeup<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.290> got

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
someone finishes doing makeup on you got

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.830 
someone finishes doing makeup on you got
to<00:01:25.740> take<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.040> off<00:01:26.130> before<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.460> go<00:01:26.580> home<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.450> I

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
to take it off before you go home so I

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.050 
to take it off before you go home so I
actually<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.950> know<00:01:28.979> grabbed<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.610> because

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
actually you know grabbed this because

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.510 
actually you know grabbed this because
it<00:01:30.180> was<00:01:30.270> quick<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:31.229> was<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.439> multitasker<00:01:32.369> so

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it was quick and it was a multitasker so

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.370 
it was quick and it was a multitasker so
it<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> multitasker<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.229> be

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
it is a multitasker in that it can be

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.499 
it is a multitasker in that it can be

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.500 
you have the air conditioning right and
sometimes<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.310> air<00:03:13.459> conditioning<00:03:14.030> tends<00:03:14.299> to

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
sometimes the air conditioning tends to

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.059 
sometimes the air conditioning tends to
separate<00:03:14.989> your<00:03:15.109> foundation<00:03:15.680> because<00:03:15.799> it

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
separate your foundation because it

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.050 
separate your foundation because it
dries<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.609> out

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
dries it out

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.440 
dries it out
and<00:03:17.150> this<00:03:18.139> doesn't<00:03:18.620> dry<00:03:19.220> out<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.880> this

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
and this doesn't dry out and this

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.659 
and this doesn't dry out and this
doesn't<00:03:20.660> separate<00:03:21.169> sorry<00:03:21.470> for<00:03:21.769> for<00:03:22.549> nail

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
doesn't separate sorry for for nail

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.309 
doesn't separate sorry for for nail
polish<00:03:22.880> it's<00:03:23.180> because<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.540> did<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.720> tutorial<00:03:24.079> for

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319

say that that's because of a few reasons

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.339 
say that that's because of a few reasons
is<00:03:39.950> because<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.959> initially<00:03:41.959> got<00:03:41.989> this

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
is because I initially got this

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.189 
is because I initially got this
foundation<00:03:42.919> in<00:03:43.069> natural<00:03:43.639> which<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.569> color

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
I was when I was in makeup school so I

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.809 
I was when I was in makeup school so I
thought<00:03:48.169> I<00:03:48.410> was<00:03:48.650> this<00:03:48.829> color<00:03:49.069> so<00:03:49.370> when<00:03:49.489> I<00:03:49.519> want

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
this color but I came back to Singapore

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.240 
this color but I came back to Singapore
and<00:03:53.870> with<00:03:54.019> natural<00:03:54.260> lighting<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.859> everything

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
and with natural lighting and everything

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.979 
and with natural lighting and everything
like<00:03:55.340> that<00:03:55.400> when<00:03:55.730> I<00:03:55.760> apply<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.150> on<00:03:56.329> my<00:03:56.389> face<00:03:56.720> it

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
like that when I apply it on my face it

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.069 
like that when I apply it on my face it
looks<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.590> lot<00:03:57.709> darker<00:03:58.010> but<00:03:58.970> just<00:03:59.629> to<00:03:59.720> say<00:03:59.870> that

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
looks a lot darker but just to say that

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.449 
looks a lot darker but just to say that
I'm<00:04:00.199> wearing<00:04:00.470> it<00:04:00.620> right<00:04:00.650> now<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.220> it<00:04:01.280> matches

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
I'm wearing it right now and it matches

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.610 
I'm wearing it right now and it matches
my<00:04:01.669> neck<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.510> think<00:04:02.690> my<00:04:03.079> face<00:04:03.319> is<00:04:03.500> actually

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
my neck so I think my face is actually

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.830 
my neck so I think my face is actually
lighter<00:04:04.040> than<00:04:04.190> my<00:04:04.459> neck<00:04:04.669> I<00:04:04.879> am<00:04:05.060> not<00:04:05.329> actually

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
lighter than my neck I am not actually

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.300 
lighter than my neck I am not actually
very<00:04:05.870> sure<00:04:06.290> but<00:04:06.560> you'll<00:04:06.739> see<00:04:06.980> in<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.129> tutorial

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
very sure but you'll see in the tutorial

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.819 
very sure but you'll see in the tutorial
that<00:04:07.730> is<00:04:08.139> obviously<00:04:09.139> darker

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
that is obviously darker

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.860 
that is obviously darker
however<00:04:10.220> I<00:04:10.310> do<00:04:10.430> fix<00:04:10.819> that<00:04:11.030> very<00:04:11.060> well<00:04:11.510> when<00:04:11.780> you

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
however I do fix that very well when you

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.449 
however I do fix that very well when you
blend<00:04:12.079> it<00:04:12.230> out<00:04:12.349> it<00:04:12.560> does<00:04:12.739> actually<00:04:12.980> kind<00:04:13.400> of

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
blend it out it does actually kind of

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.550 
blend it out it does actually kind of
match<00:04:13.669> your<00:04:13.849> skin<00:04:14.060> tone<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.540> then<00:04:15.109> I<00:04:15.139> just<00:04:15.349> put

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
match your skin tone and then I just put

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.039 
match your skin tone and then I just put
powder<00:04:15.799> that<00:04:16.070> is<00:04:16.250> my<00:04:16.459> own<00:04:16.519> skin<00:04:16.880> tone<00:04:17.030> so<00:04:17.449> you

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
powder that is my own skin tone so you

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.349 
powder that is my own skin tone so you
can<00:04:18.260> see<00:04:18.470> that<00:04:18.650> it<00:04:18.829> matches<00:04:19.130> sort<00:04:19.639> of<00:04:19.760> exactly

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
can see that it matches sort of exactly

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.990 
can see that it matches sort of exactly
