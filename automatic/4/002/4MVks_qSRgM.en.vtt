nail<00:01:36.380> art<00:01:36.619> I<00:01:36.770> recommend<00:01:37.340> that<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.549> put<00:01:37.880> on<00:01:38.000> the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
nail art I recommend that you put on the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.230 
nail art I recommend that you put on the
leaves<00:01:38.600> first<00:01:39.110> before<00:01:40.010> you<00:01:40.159> carry<00:01:40.400> on<00:01:40.700> just

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
leaves first before you carry on just

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.210 
leaves first before you carry on just
make<00:01:41.600> sure<00:01:41.840> that<00:01:42.080> your<00:01:42.260> little<00:01:42.440> leaves<00:01:42.890> are

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
make sure that your little leaves are

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.310 
make sure that your little leaves are
going<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.549> fit<00:01:43.760> in<00:01:43.940> quickly<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:45.200> you're

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
going to fit in quickly and that you're

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.410 
going to fit in quickly and that you're
not<00:01:45.470> going<00:01:45.650> to<00:01:45.770> do<00:01:45.920> your<00:01:46.130> three<00:01:46.420> placements

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
not going to do your three placements

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.149 
not going to do your three placements
and<00:01:47.570> then<00:01:47.900> go<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.200> put<00:01:48.380> on<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.619> leaves<00:01:48.799> later

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
and then go to put on the leaves later

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.030 
and then go to put on the leaves later
and<00:01:49.610> find<00:01:49.909> it<00:01:50.450> just<00:01:50.689> doesn't<00:01:51.080> look<00:01:51.110> right<00:01:51.229> the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
and find it just doesn't look right the

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.649 
and find it just doesn't look right the
leaves<00:01:52.280> really<00:01:52.520> don't<00:01:52.820> need<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.119> be<00:01:53.270> big<00:01:53.420> when

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
leaves really don't need to be big when

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.630 
leaves really don't need to be big when
I<00:01:53.720> first<00:01:54.049> tried<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:54.590> designer<00:01:55.010> did<00:01:55.310> leaves

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
I first tried this designer did leaves

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.640 
I first tried this designer did leaves
that<00:01:55.880> were<00:01:56.030> far<00:01:56.240> too<00:01:56.390> big<00:01:56.600> just<00:01:57.140> little<00:01:57.439> leaves

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
that were far too big just little leaves

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.170 
that were far too big just little leaves
is<00:01:57.920> all<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.250> need<00:01:58.460> for<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.760> eyes<00:01:58.939> have

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
just like semi circles and then we're

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.220 
just like semi circles and then we're
placing<00:02:42.610> little<00:02:43.270> tinier<00:02:43.690> flicks

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
placing little tinier flicks

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.660

and<00:02:44.380> then<00:02:44.800> we're<00:02:44.920> just<00:02:44.950> going<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.580> other

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
and then we're just going to the other

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.150 
and then we're just going to the other
parts<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.510> roses<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.110> doing<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.920> same

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
parts of the roses and doing the same

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.030 
parts of the roses and doing the same
and<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.730> first<00:02:49.000> supposing<00:02:49.660> maybe<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.860> looks

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
and it first supposing maybe it looks

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.280 
and it first supposing maybe it looks
good<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.489> kind<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.790> does<00:02:51.970> look<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:52.360> roses<00:02:52.810> but

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
good it kind of does look like roses but

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.500 
good it kind of does look like roses but
the<00:02:53.410> magic<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:54.070> when<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.430> add<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:55.000> two<00:02:55.030> tones

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
the magic is when you add the two tones

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.170 
the magic is when you add the two tones
so<00:02:56.200> now<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.440> move<00:02:56.709> on<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.100> your<00:02:57.220> pale<00:02:57.519> pink<00:02:57.880> and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
so now you move on to your pale pink and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.550 
so now you move on to your pale pink and
you'll<00:02:58.810> pop<00:02:59.019> in<00:02:59.260> your<00:02:59.800> pale<00:03:00.130> colors<00:03:00.670> around

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
you'll pop in your pale colors around

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.729 
you'll pop in your pale colors around
inside<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.670> where<00:03:03.670> you've<00:03:04.420> placed<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:05.290> darker

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
inside of where you've placed the darker

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:06.390 
inside of where you've placed the darker
color<00:03:05.980> pink

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
color pink

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.030 
color pink
so<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:06.819> just<00:03:07.090> eyeball<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.290> with<00:03:08.739> gels

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
so you just eyeball it and with gels

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.030 
so you just eyeball it and with gels
because<00:03:09.519> I've<00:03:09.700> cured<00:03:10.120> each<00:03:11.050> level<00:03:11.650> if<00:03:11.830> we

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
because I've cured each level if we

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.500 
because I've cured each level if we
don't<00:03:12.220> like<00:03:12.340> these<00:03:12.519> we<00:03:12.730> can<00:03:12.880> wipe<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.180> off<00:03:13.300> and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
don't like these we can wipe it off and

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.000 
don't like these we can wipe it off and
we're<00:03:13.630> still<00:03:13.870> live<00:03:14.080> with<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.380> dark<00:03:14.680> pink

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
we're still live with that dark pink

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.360 
we're still live with that dark pink
flecks<00:03:15.459> in<00:03:15.750> petal<00:03:16.750> shapes<00:03:17.050> so<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.709> can<00:03:18.220> you

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
flecks in petal shapes so you can you

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.699 
flecks in petal shapes so you can you
know<00:03:18.400> go<00:03:18.670> ahead<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.209> change<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.200> mix<00:03:20.590> it

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
know go ahead and change it and mix it

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:50.090 
know go ahead and change it and mix it
up<00:03:20.799> as<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.250> like

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.470 

so<00:03:51.100> all<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.460> the<00:03:51.580> light<00:03:51.790> pink<00:03:52.060> has<00:03:52.270> been

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
so all of the light pink has been

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.750 
so all of the light pink has been
applied<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.110> it<00:03:53.410> looks<00:03:53.590> like<00:03:53.800> this<00:03:54.070> now

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
applied and it looks like this now

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.450 
applied and it looks like this now
so<00:03:55.270> we<00:03:55.360> cure<00:03:55.570> that<00:03:55.900> each<00:03:56.410> part<00:03:56.800> we're<00:03:57.070> curing

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
so we cure that each part we're curing

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.090 
so we cure that each part we're curing
under<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.820> LED<00:03:58.300> light<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:58.810> then<00:03:59.440> afterwards

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
under the LED light and then afterwards

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.100 
under the LED light and then afterwards
just<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.670> touch<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.090> up<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.300> little<00:04:01.480> bit<00:04:01.690> go<00:04:01.870> back

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
just to touch it up a little bit go back

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.110 
just to touch it up a little bit go back
over<00:04:02.440> with<00:04:02.590> your<00:04:02.800> dark<00:04:03.100> pink<00:04:03.400> just<00:04:03.730> to<00:04:03.910> check

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
over with your dark pink just to check

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.750 
over with your dark pink just to check
it<00:04:04.690> all<00:04:04.840> looks<00:04:05.140> correct<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:05.980> looks<00:04:06.220> like<00:04:06.490> it's

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
it all looks correct and looks like it's

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.820 
it all looks correct and looks like it's
got<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.150> bud<00:04:07.390> going<00:04:07.810> on<00:04:07.960> because<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.380> darker

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
got the bud going on because the darker

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.440 
got the bud going on because the darker
is<00:04:08.950> kind<00:04:09.250> of<00:04:09.340> in<00:04:09.460> the<00:04:09.550> center<00:04:09.940> of<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.180> flower

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
is kind of in the center of the flower

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.630
