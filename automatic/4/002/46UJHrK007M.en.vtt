 and not breathing 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.920
 as high as possible at the level of the rib cage, therefore at the level of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.370
 side doors maybe even 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.120
 the third breath the clavicle breathing then you approached this 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.370
 operation is going 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.650

 here are the hands in the back the arms are removed round table 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.280
 backward and you have inspired explored several times 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.630
 in flanders rib cage maximum three and five shots the stretch at 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.909
 level of the shoulders at the front of the stars you will shoot the little one and the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.080
 large pectoral 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.540
 always in the same match 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.560
 that is to say to attract the stars you can add to us men of hand 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.680
 additional 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.300
 which will allow you to release all and mobilize more cash 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.630
 thoracic 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.630
 you go on the month before the ribcage and news 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.960
 fold is beautiful knee 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.080
 leaned forward have proposed to undertake who fill but 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.530
 that completes 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.530
 why your coming 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.019
 to enter the coat 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.599
 what we want 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.109
 you breathe 2% 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.109
 make an appointment 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.009
 during this word 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.859
 do your best to equalize the slaughter of the aspiration of the atonement 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.959
 insisted especially on the inspiration to bring a nicolas cage stretch 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:48.739
 thoracic 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.389
 at the shoulders 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.499
 but I strongly advise the fcc and his exercises these two exercises 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:56.599
 previous 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.329
 yes because without soft 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.329
 we are more used to often sitting 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.499
 and although these colors are not followed forward in the nape of the neck and dig 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.439
 blow the arms lose the habit 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:12.459
 so from the sports equity shot often yakubu on which are generated 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.400
 at the shoulders and at the level of the cervical spine only because 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.359
 that there are fillon tensions that develops 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:19.409
 e in this part
