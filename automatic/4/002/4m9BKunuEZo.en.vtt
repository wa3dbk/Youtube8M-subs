00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.500
 Hi guys, in today's video I 'm going 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.920
 show you some little things that 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.440
 I received the cosmetic team law from me 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.690
 is a very very cosmetic company 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.460
 cool I know your company through 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.500
 other bloggers and other videos 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.720
 other bubbles and I really liked the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.210
 cosmetics I really liked the company and 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.650
 they hired me they sent the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.720
 I still had not 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.969
 need then I'll open along with 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.610
 You and I were super excited was 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.010
 inside the box came and fuck here 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.960
 who talks a little about the company said a 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.070
 little of the little things that came 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.500
 package and came this license is super beautiful 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.989
 with super orange oscillation here I 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.910
 I got crazy in this lapse people win 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.360
 this license is like this and it looks cute 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.969
 written McKinney in front is very 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.910
 cute to take for the trip to 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.010
 to carry in the bag is a great 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.260
 super small it very compact then 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.260
 you can take anywhere and 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.900
 Let's see what came from good collection here. 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.350
 the founder has two sides he has a 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.360
 then a cap and hence the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.259
 little thicker lips and pencil more 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.360
 fine 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.939
 so I thought it was cool, the computer is 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.310
 always very useful without this brush here 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.860
 which is the precision face brush and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.900
 They think it's crappy to eliminate who 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.430
 do not know I still did not think, sex 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.950
 But I can tell you that the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.500
 rules are very soft and not only that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.720
 certain as soon as they leave the brush know 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.329
 The one that you barely pulls will go 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.600
 a little out of cedar in your hand the 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.930
 their names on all the brushes too. 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.740
 look their name comes in the brushes too 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.860
 encompasses the making of cosmetics and the brush in 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.160
 like this 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.960
 Hey, a face brush and everyone sees 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.050
 plastificado da gente 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.720
 all of them and he also shows frado pra 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.060
 you have to base the good this essay 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.870
 bevelled is that they have more is a good 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.970
 application 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.970
 we have those base brushes that are 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.440
 more mice instead of being 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.330
 inclined they are all straight as I 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.820
 I think this type of brush on the diagonal 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.670
 it facilitates more application because it 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.260
 best fits the face in the shape of the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.670
 bone it fits better 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.500
 so I think the application with this 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.209
 virus type is much easier 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.730
 the steering wheel are also consistent 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:32.020
 in those and give soft in those of the weak 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:35.410
 are certain very good company name is 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.690
 that the brush then we have 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.810
 universal eyebrow lapses 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.920
 He always makes it easy. 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.510
 just the way he is 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.250
 He is a pencil to the eyebrow to 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.810
 fill eyebrow draw 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.310
 eyebrow and his cool 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.680
 birthday that he takes with the majority 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.260
 two-tone color eyebrow look people 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.450
 It's good that my pencil cap came too. 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.190
 abstained in the pain for the eyes that this 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.640
 here is the normal abstract 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.340
 Let's see his pigmentation. This is the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.590
 pigmentation of the black pencil was also 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.660
 a pencil I prefer to use the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.610
 money than pencils so this here 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.080
 It will help a lot. Let's see that in 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.340
 education also looks like it is pigmented 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.530
 Then came that pen too. 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.260
 eye liner looking at people 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.170
 You saved my life, I have none. 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.320
 delineating pen for super eyes 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.420
 super super pigmented people i always 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.580
 I wanted to test a pen then 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.650
 now I have one from my collection of 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.190
 makeup I will always use because 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.900
 eyeliner pen easier for you 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.680
 apply the outline and now last 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.350
 in the kit is this kit of brushes so much 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.750
 very cute which existential minors is 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.030
 that you can take them in the bag 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.370
 you can take them on that trip 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.670
 so I think it's pretty cool and the essential 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.710
 minors who were in total 8 26 here 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.620
 inside 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.780
 All the tweezers are made of makeup 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.890
 for the eyes except for fancy to 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.530
 the lips 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.170
 then have a potential side and have 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.470
 These are six here looks that are for the 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.720
 eyes with very soft bristles are seeing the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.750
 straight hair straight skirts are fine 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.750
 These easy-to-apply doughs are 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.100
 Great for you to spend on the bottom 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.160
