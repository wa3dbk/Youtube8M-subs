00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
all right I'm gonna show you in my yard

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.059 
all right I'm gonna show you in my yard
which<00:00:04.770> six<00:00:05.520> months<00:00:05.879> ago<00:00:06.259> was<00:00:07.259> riddled<00:00:07.770> with

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
which six months ago was riddled with

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.290 
which six months ago was riddled with
molehill

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
molehill

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.860 
molehill
like<00:00:09.929> about<00:00:10.320> 40<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:10.950> them<00:00:11.300> the<00:00:12.300> moles<00:00:12.540> are<00:00:12.750> now

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
like about 40 of them the moles are now

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.779 
like about 40 of them the moles are now
gone<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:14.089> the<00:00:15.089> grass<00:00:15.269> looks<00:00:15.570> good<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:17.460> I'm

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
gone and the grass looks good and I'm

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.070 
gone and the grass looks good and I'm
going<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.060> show<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.510> set<00:00:18.750> up<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.930> mole

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
going to show you how to set up a mole

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.779 
going to show you how to set up a mole
trap<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.560> can<00:00:19.859> get<00:00:20.010> your<00:00:20.100> yard<00:00:20.460> looking

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
trap so you can get your yard looking

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.220 
trap so you can get your yard looking
just<00:00:21.000> like<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:22.640> as<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:23.910> see<00:00:24.119> here<00:00:24.510> we've

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
just like this as you can see here we've

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.769 
just like this as you can see here we've
got<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.800> mole<00:00:26.250> problem<00:00:27.619> they<00:00:28.619> are<00:00:28.760> getting<00:00:29.779> all

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
got a mole problem they are getting all

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.560 
got a mole problem they are getting all
over<00:00:30.840> our<00:00:31.380> orchard<00:00:31.969> the<00:00:32.969> number<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.390> thing

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
over our orchard the number one thing

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.650 
over our orchard the number one thing
that<00:00:33.600> moles<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> eat<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.440> worms<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.660> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
that moles like to eat is worms and the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.500 
that moles like to eat is worms and the
reason<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.260> many<00:00:37.350> worms<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.920> because

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
reason we have so many worms is because

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.830 
reason we have so many worms is because
this<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.719> northwest<00:00:40.200> red<00:00:40.379> worms<00:00:41.600> anyway<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
this is northwest red worms anyway I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.799 
this is northwest red worms anyway I
said<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> trap<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> other<00:00:43.680> day<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:45.239> let's<00:00:45.690> go

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
said to trap the other day and let's go

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.270 
said to trap the other day and let's go
see<00:00:46.559> how<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.950> did<00:00:51.770> okay<00:00:52.770> it's<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.219> those

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
see how it did okay it's one of those

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.709 
see how it did okay it's one of those
bear<00:00:53.579> claw<00:00:53.789> traps<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.230> has<00:00:55.440> been<00:00:55.680> sprung

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
bear claw traps and it has been sprung

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.630 
bear claw traps and it has been sprung
and<00:00:57.719> let's<00:00:58.559> see<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.920> looks<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.340> got<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and let's see it looks like we got the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.090 
and let's see it looks like we got the
mole<00:00:59.820> all<00:01:00.750> right<00:01:00.989> now<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.469> trick<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.010> in

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
mole all right now the trick to get in

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.359 
mole all right now the trick to get in
this<00:01:02.190> mole<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:03.530> not<00:01:04.530> only<00:01:04.710> need<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.100> use<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
this mole is not only need to use the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.620 
this mole is not only need to use the
bear<00:01:05.519> claw<00:01:06.119> trap<00:01:06.869> because<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.970> moles<00:01:09.360> can

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
bear claw trap because the moles can

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.890 
bear claw trap because the moles can
smell<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.020> human<00:01:10.290> scent<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.460> what<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.670> do

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
smell the human scent on it so what I do

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.149 
smell the human scent on it so what I do
or<00:01:12.900> what<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.140> did<00:01:13.790> was<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:14.909> dug<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.240> out<00:01:16.159> where

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
or what I did was they dug it out where

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.860 
or what I did was they dug it out where
there<00:01:17.340> was<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> tunnel

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.410 

there<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.860> go<00:01:23.010> there's<00:01:23.760> that<00:01:23.910> tunnel<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.240> both

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
there we go there's that tunnel on both

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.640 
there we go there's that tunnel on both
ends<00:01:24.870> and<00:01:25.800> then<00:01:26.310> when<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:27.410> it'll<00:01:28.410> take<00:01:28.620> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
ends and then when I do it'll take a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.680 
ends and then when I do it'll take a
couple<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.980> mothballs<00:01:29.540> put<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.870> each<00:01:31.020> end

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
couple of mothballs put one on each end

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.680 
couple of mothballs put one on each end
which<00:01:33.690> will<00:01:33.810> drive<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.970> mold<00:01:35.970> crazy<00:01:36.300> and<00:01:36.570> what

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
which will drive the mold crazy and what

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.870 
which will drive the mold crazy and what
he's<00:01:36.810> gonna<00:01:36.960> do<00:01:37.370> some<00:01:38.370> of<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> videos<00:01:38.760> will

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
he's gonna do some of the videos will

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.640 
he's gonna do some of the videos will
tell<00:01:39.120> you<00:01:39.270> yeah<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.870> put<00:01:40.110> them<00:01:40.230> off<00:01:40.320> ball<00:01:40.530> in

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
tell you yeah I put them off ball in

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.870 
tell you yeah I put them off ball in
there<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:40.980> the<00:01:41.040> mold<00:01:41.220> will<00:01:41.400> go<00:01:41.520> over<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.730> your

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
there and the mold will go over to your

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.400 
there and the mold will go over to your
neighbors<00:01:42.270> well<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.720> don't<00:01:42.960> want<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.260> that

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
neighbors well I don't want to do that

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.910 
neighbors well I don't want to do that
I'm<00:01:43.590> gonna<00:01:43.680> kill<00:01:43.920> them<00:01:44.070> all<00:01:44.160> and<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.800> do

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
I'm gonna kill them all and so what I do

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.380 
I'm gonna kill them all and so what I do
is<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.190> put<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:47.460> mothballs<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.150> and<00:01:48.300> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
is I put the mothballs in there and the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.510 
is I put the mothballs in there and the
mold<00:01:48.570> wants<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.870> push<00:01:49.050> it<00:01:49.170> back<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.380> where<00:01:50.370> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
mold wants to push it back up where the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.190 
mold wants to push it back up where the
pile<00:01:50.730> was<00:01:51.000> before<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.840> that's<00:01:55.020> where<00:01:55.170> we

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
pile was before and so that's where we

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.650 
pile was before and so that's where we
set<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:55.470> trap<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:57.030> once<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.300> catch<00:01:57.510> the

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
set the trap and once you catch the

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.470 
set the trap and once you catch the
mouse<00:01:57.840> or<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.320> mole<00:01:59.000> put<00:02:00.000> them<00:02:00.090> back<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
mouse or the mole put them back in the

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.420 
mouse or the mole put them back in the
hole<00:02:02.060> cover<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.240> up<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:04.130> it'll<00:02:05.130> keep<00:02:05.220> other

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
hole cover it up and it'll keep other

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.980 
hole cover it up and it'll keep other
moles<00:02:05.640> from<00:02:05.820> coming<00:02:06.090> back<00:02:06.120> for<00:02:06.570> about<00:02:06.660> six

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
moles from coming back for about six

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.340 
moles from coming back for about six
months

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
months

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.470 
months
once<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:07.860> decayed<00:02:08.220> they'll<00:02:09.119> start<00:02:09.360> coming

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
once it's decayed they'll start coming

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.980 
once it's decayed they'll start coming
back<00:02:09.920> if<00:02:10.920> they're<00:02:11.190> around<00:02:11.600> but<00:02:12.600> all<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.810> holes

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
back if they're around but all the holes

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.470 
back if they're around but all the holes
that<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.290> saw<00:02:13.530> showed<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.130> it's<00:02:15.030> probably<00:02:15.180> only

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
that I saw showed you it's probably only

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.740 
that I saw showed you it's probably only
this<00:02:15.750> one<00:02:15.960> mole<00:02:16.490> they're<00:02:17.540> territorial<00:02:18.540> so

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
this one mole they're territorial so

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.750 
this one mole they're territorial so
they<00:02:19.260> basically<00:02:19.650> own<00:02:22.040> all<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.190> holes<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
they basically own all the holes in the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.800 
they basically own all the holes in the
nearby<00:02:24.000> area<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:25.440> what<00:02:25.560> we'll<00:02:25.710> do<00:02:25.890> later<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.810> we

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
nearby area so what we'll do later is we

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.020 
nearby area so what we'll do later is we
will<00:02:28.020> go<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.040> another<00:02:29.130> area<00:02:29.310> where<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.850> holes

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
will go to another area where the holes

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.530 
will go to another area where the holes
are<00:02:30.180> new<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.570> we<00:02:30.959> will<00:02:31.080> catch<00:02:31.260> another<00:02:31.530> mole

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.300 

all<00:02:36.540> right<00:02:36.750> now<00:02:37.500> we're<00:02:37.620> gonna<00:02:37.709> set<00:02:38.010> up<00:02:38.100> another

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
all right now we're gonna set up another

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.370 
all right now we're gonna set up another
mole<00:02:38.670> trap

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
mole trap

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.350 
mole trap
I<00:02:40.380> found<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.190> mole<00:02:41.370> hole<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.580> dug<00:02:41.790> out<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.180> hole

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
I found a mole hole I dug out the hole

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.820 
I found a mole hole I dug out the hole
and<00:02:43.200> we've<00:02:44.160> got<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.820> pretty<00:02:45.720> nice<00:02:45.900> double

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
and we've got a pretty nice double

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.880 
and we've got a pretty nice double
tunnel<00:02:47.720> now<00:02:48.720> I've<00:02:48.840> dug<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.170> out<00:02:49.290> found<00:02:49.709> both

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
tunnel now I've dug it out found both

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.210 
tunnel now I've dug it out found both
tunnels<00:02:50.330> got<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.450> mothballs<00:02:52.010> put<00:02:53.010> them<00:02:53.100> in

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
tunnels got the mothballs put them in

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.660 
tunnels got the mothballs put them in
the<00:02:53.310> tunnels<00:02:56.600> there<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:57.750> go<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:59.400> that'll

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
the tunnels there you go and that'll

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.330 
the tunnels there you go and that'll
start<00:02:59.850> driving<00:03:00.239> your<00:03:00.360> mole<00:03:00.510> crazy<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:02.130> now

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
start driving your mole crazy and now

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.740 
start driving your mole crazy and now
we're<00:03:02.489> gonna<00:03:02.640> use<00:03:02.820> this<00:03:03.860> Bear<00:03:04.860> Claw<00:03:05.100> trap

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
we're gonna use this Bear Claw trap

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.620 
we're gonna use this Bear Claw trap
which<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:06.870> pretty<00:03:07.050> easy<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.410> set<00:03:07.650> up<00:03:08.510> let<00:03:09.510> me

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
which is pretty easy to set up let me

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.440 
which is pretty easy to set up let me
slip<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.440> down<00:03:10.680> here

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:23.660 

all<00:03:16.450> right<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:22.540> have<00:03:22.720> three<00:03:22.960> pieces<00:03:23.140> and

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
all right so you have three pieces and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.800 
all right so you have three pieces and
these<00:03:24.670> are<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.970> handles<00:03:25.330> to<00:03:25.450> set<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.750> trap

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
these are the handles to set the trap

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.010 
these are the handles to set the trap
put<00:03:28.810> this<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:31.240> other<00:03:31.420> side<00:03:33.600> this<00:03:34.600> is<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.870> give

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
put this the other side this is to give

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.410 
put this the other side this is to give
you<00:03:35.110> leverage<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.560> open<00:03:35.800> up<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:35.980> teeth<00:03:39.420> great

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
you leverage to open up the teeth great

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.830 
you leverage to open up the teeth great
oh<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:42.520> there's<00:03:43.450> your<00:03:43.770> little<00:03:44.770> flap<00:03:45.840> all

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
oh and there's your little flap all

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.480 
oh and there's your little flap all
right

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
right

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.510 
right
and<00:03:48.490> now<00:03:48.640> it's<00:03:48.820> set<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.950> this<00:03:51.100> little<00:03:51.310> lever

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
and now it's set and this little lever

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.730 
and now it's set and this little lever
here<00:03:51.820> is<00:03:51.910> for<00:03:52.120> safety<00:03:53.850> but<00:03:54.850> it's<00:03:55.030> not<00:03:55.240> moving

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
here is for safety but it's not moving

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.180 
here is for safety but it's not moving
so<00:03:56.740> what<00:03:56.890> we'll<00:03:57.010> do<00:03:57.160> we're<00:03:58.150> ready<00:03:59.130> we're<00:04:00.130> gonna

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
so what we'll do we're ready we're gonna

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:09.180 
so what we'll do we're ready we're gonna
set<00:04:00.550> this<00:04:00.700> right<00:04:00.760> in<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.180> trap

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.550 

okay<00:04:10.780> push<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:11.960> little<00:04:11.990> bit<00:04:12.260> into<00:04:12.440> the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
okay push it a little bit into the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.800 
okay push it a little bit into the
ground<00:04:12.770> so<00:04:13.010> where<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.310> tongue<00:04:13.550> of<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.510> trap

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
ground so where the tongue of the trap

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.180 
ground so where the tongue of the trap
is<00:04:15.020> about<00:04:15.290> an<00:04:15.940> inch<00:04:16.940> above<00:04:17.420> the<00:04:17.480> soil<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.890> what

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
is about an inch above the soil and what

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.640 
is about an inch above the soil and what
they're<00:04:19.310> gonna<00:04:19.400> do<00:04:20.020> you<00:04:21.020> see<00:04:21.260> you<00:04:21.380> in<00:04:21.410> there

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
they're gonna do you see you in there

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.550 
they're gonna do you see you in there
and<00:04:22.630> they're<00:04:23.630> gonna<00:04:23.750> push<00:04:23.990> that<00:04:24.110> little<00:04:24.290> moth

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
and they're gonna push that little moth

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.530 
and they're gonna push that little moth
ball<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.190> they're<00:04:25.910> going<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.090> try<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.300> push

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
ball and they're going to try and push

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.360 
ball and they're going to try and push
it<00:04:26.690> out<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.770> they're<00:04:27.860> gonna<00:04:27.950> push<00:04:28.160> it<00:04:28.280> right

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
it out and they're gonna push it right

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.790 
it out and they're gonna push it right
into<00:04:28.550> that<00:04:28.700> trap<00:04:28.970> so<00:04:29.570> what<00:04:29.720> I'm<00:04:29.780> gonna<00:04:29.900> do<00:04:30.110> now

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
into that trap so what I'm gonna do now

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.410 
into that trap so what I'm gonna do now
is<00:04:30.830> I'm<00:04:31.160> going<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.340> cover<00:04:31.550> this<00:04:31.790> with<00:04:32.090> this

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
is I'm going to cover this with this

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.380 
is I'm going to cover this with this
plastic<00:04:32.630> bucket<00:04:33.470> that<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.680> have<00:04:34.000> so<00:04:35.000> basically

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
plastic bucket that I have so basically

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.600 
plastic bucket that I have so basically
all<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:36.260> mothball<00:04:37.010> which<00:04:37.250> is<00:04:37.370> made<00:04:37.520> of

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
all the the mothball which is made of

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.640 
all the the mothball which is made of
formaldehyde<00:04:37.910> will<00:04:38.840> just<00:04:39.080> basically

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
formaldehyde will just basically

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.000 
formaldehyde will just basically
fumigate<00:04:40.250> this<00:04:40.460> mole<00:04:41.000> and<00:04:41.690> make<00:04:42.620> it<00:04:42.770> want<00:04:42.920> to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
fumigate this mole and make it want to

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.370 
fumigate this mole and make it want to
push<00:04:43.220> that<00:04:43.370> moth<00:04:43.610> ball<00:04:43.880> out<00:04:44.060> and<00:04:44.930> we'll<00:04:45.260> be

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
push that moth ball out and we'll be

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.470 
push that moth ball out and we'll be
back<00:04:45.590> tomorrow<00:04:45.950> and<00:04:46.160> check<00:04:46.940> see<00:04:47.150> if<00:04:47.180> we<00:04:47.300> caught

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
back tomorrow and check see if we caught

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.500 
back tomorrow and check see if we caught
them<00:04:47.540> all
