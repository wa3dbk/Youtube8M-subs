gonna start twisting okay

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.170 
gonna start twisting okay
and<00:02:10.720> I'm<00:02:11.560> actually<00:02:12.100> twisting<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.700> pieces<00:02:13.030> of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
and I'm actually twisting the pieces of

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:23.910 
and I'm actually twisting the pieces of
hair<00:02:13.330> as<00:02:13.600> I'm<00:02:13.840> going

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.700 

so<00:02:24.790> her<00:02:25.090> son<00:02:25.270> twisting<00:02:25.690> them<00:02:25.810> all<00:02:25.930> up<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.350> took

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
so her son twisting them all up I took

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.430 
so her son twisting them all up I took
my<00:02:26.860> ends<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:27.880> rolled<00:02:28.150> them<00:02:28.390> with<00:02:29.170> a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
my ends and I just rolled them with a

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.230 
my ends and I just rolled them with a
gray<00:02:29.650> perm<00:02:29.890> rod<00:02:30.130> I<00:02:30.160> probably<00:02:30.580> took<00:02:30.790> like<00:02:31.030> big

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
gray perm rod I probably took like big

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.270 
gray perm rod I probably took like big
chunks<00:02:31.600> like<00:02:31.720> maybe<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.260> mini<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:33.040> rolled

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
chunks like maybe this mini and rolled

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.570 
chunks like maybe this mini and rolled
him<00:02:33.459> up<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.900> that

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
him up like that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.010 
him up like that
you<00:02:36.580> think<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.270> ends<00:02:37.600> because<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.840> didn't

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
you think just the ends because I didn't

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.570 
you think just the ends because I didn't
want<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.380> be<00:02:38.500> curly<00:02:38.830> all<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.069> way<00:02:39.160> up<00:02:39.370> and

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
want it to be curly all the way up and

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.120 
want it to be curly all the way up and
then<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.420> just<00:02:40.780> dipped<00:02:41.200> them<00:02:41.380> in<00:02:41.620> boiling<00:02:42.100> water

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
then I just dipped them in boiling water

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.910 
then I just dipped them in boiling water
okay<00:02:43.000> hot<00:02:43.720> water<00:02:43.959> doesn't<00:02:44.440> have<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:44.830> be

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
okay hot water doesn't have to be

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.560 
okay hot water doesn't have to be
boiling<00:02:45.100> hot<00:02:45.430> probably<00:02:45.820> just<00:02:46.000> microwave<00:02:46.420> how

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
boiling hot probably just microwave how

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.570 
boiling hot probably just microwave how
it<00:02:46.630> would<00:02:46.750> be<00:02:46.870> fine<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.950> hair<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.550> I

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
it would be fine and the hair that I

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.520 
it would be fine and the hair that I
used<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.870> Rasta<00:02:50.350> free<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:52.060> thrill<00:02:52.530> 20

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
used is the Rasta free of thrill 20
