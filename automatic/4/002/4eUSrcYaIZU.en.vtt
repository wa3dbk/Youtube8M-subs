00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.840
 the people today I came to make you 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:12.150
 faber's 60 colors ecolapis review 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.800
 castell that arrived here today at home 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.710
 wide I can say that box 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:24.430
 she has seven metallic colors and 2011 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:28.029
 I bought it through the hail site 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:31.240
 I bought in the pre-sale pay 70 reais 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.609
 it's the hail site actually 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.819
 which delivery is a carrier and not 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:39.010
 ran and this carrier is not very 

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:40.120
 careful because the box came out well 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.969
 threatened 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.760
 including summer torn here in 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.510
 the cover and the cover opened inside the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.809
 Cashier 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.049
 and I did not ask for the exchange because it did not come 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.179
 broken ends except for one 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:59.459
 color 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:05.379
 these lots they are a limited edition 

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:09.220
 and they, in fact, like this for those who have the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.310
 40 box of 8 colors are common cohab 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.060
 Metallic 12's day does not pay 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.300
 buy because the only difference in 2011 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.550
 as I had not I bought like you 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.940
 can see it has already been developed 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.640
 exactly for the books you 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.550
 little box comes this book illustration 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.280
 this box she has a box that 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.650
 allows you to leave the new 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.860
 organized following the colors 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.670
 so much is that neither written nor every color 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.470
 so it makes it easy for you to put in place 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.220
 again after use 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.200
 People I can wheel lopes is that I 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.890
 I was a bit disappointed 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:58.450
 colors her some for example that 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.240
 hence the dark red 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.280
 This blue here is one of those greens I 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.630
 I do not remember which ones I 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.269
 I tested them give an effect is a bit of 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.319
 half crayons who when Sebadoh 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.680
 you pass on it even 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:20.299
 I painted this book's secrets. 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.719
 but some macrophytes are approaching 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.849
 well thigh will not leave here anymore 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:30.349
 I stay in sebadoh a little, the color stays 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:34.340
 thick and orange I took that 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:38.180
 say I tested it here is a blue 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.329
 metalized I used and also here 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.629
 looks like it gets thick a medium texture 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.939
 that weird whitish far away 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.519
 to be the same 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:51.859
 so I did not like it and I was disappointed 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.689
 that's exactly why your name was not 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.629
 this the spider I used and that 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:03:00.379
 It happened that I have I'm in 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:03.199
 some facebook groups about garden 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.540
 secret and coloring books and some 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:07.760
 people also said that 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.349
 all selected with these rumors 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.540
 let alone that I found a little 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.780
 sloppy paint 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.069
 Look it's getting I got it today It 's good 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:23.509
 that the carrier is not there 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:26.470
 things but O're also seeing surdinho I 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:29.449
 I do not recommend because I did not like it 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.479
 sincerely I was so have some 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:33.349
 colors that I tested are budget 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.720
 normal 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.729
 I was behind a sand do 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.720
 enough guys that I bought and did not have 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:42.229
 this sand 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.840
 so it's good just to know the colors 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:47.720
 are somewhat weird effects of being by 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.150
 this I do not recommend a cool thing one 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.489
 positive point that it is clear that 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.219
 allows you to leave it faith on the 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:59.829
 table on the surface that you are 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:59.829
 to use to paint it stays in the foot 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.840
 good, it 's cool, this is cool, this is very 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.640
 nice this ball show proposal 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.210
 And these are the colors left up to 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.210
 you will see 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:34.010
 here are the metallized ones 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:38.550
 Let me always put it two 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:41.360
 three four five six seven used 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:45.750
 these two hands 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.930
 good for being a limited edition 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.050
 I expected one more thing something special 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.600
 and the pencils leave a little to be desired 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.060
 so I honestly do not recommend it 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.120
 the easier you buy one out of 48 if you 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.700
 metallised comprises 12 without 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.880
 so hard to find but this one 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:11.070
 I was a little disappointed I saw I have one 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.030
 48 color rate the common cops day and are 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.080
 great 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.220
 in the test is good is this wax effect 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.160
 so I thought it took a while to 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.780
 Wish 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.210
 so this is personal 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.930
 Thank you for watching anything.
