pivoting<00:02:11.830> wheel<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:13.239> we'll<00:02:13.390> climb<00:02:13.599> on<00:02:13.780> board

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
pivoting wheel so we'll climb on board

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.150 
pivoting wheel so we'll climb on board
and<00:02:14.260> take<00:02:14.379> a<00:02:14.440> look<00:02:14.650> at<00:02:14.769> that

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
and take a look at that

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.750 
and take a look at that
it's<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.269> graphite<00:02:16.750> wheel<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.739> right<00:02:18.160> now<00:02:18.340> I'm

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
it's a graphite wheel and right now I'm

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.080 
it's a graphite wheel and right now I'm
on<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.239> starboard<00:02:19.870> side<00:02:19.950> where<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.310> throttle

on the starboard side where the throttle
control<00:02:22.570> is<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.380> can<00:02:23.500> see<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.800> wheel<00:02:24.010> is

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
control is you can see the wheel is

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.900
