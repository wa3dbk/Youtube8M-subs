00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.680
 get encapsulated annually 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.790
 therefore small passage namely like 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:14.370
 keep it and the troupe is about it 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.170
 because they are incredibly wonderful 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.779
 everywhere not landed even gesture would 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.630
 I thought that was right on the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.960
 city to run again then in her 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.740
 advance 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.710
 has yet to take on the place his 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.309
 fleet apparently the good little ds 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.420
 really take out 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.480
 yes, I'll just land the rest 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.710
 my troop same version button 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.570
 he does not work really well there 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.120
 already popular twitter back the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.440
 home port now i am doing my foot 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.730
 So it's only for the guys 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.350
 moral support so want the 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.790
 fighting troops fight first yes 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.470
 not and is already that 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:57.230
 There is little movement in tropical medicine 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:01:00.620
 it's down on the ever fought 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.059
 have three years-won at the moment it 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.470
 I will consider what I am here now 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.850
 behind the vest and now is the river 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.550
 which set in the city and of course 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.229
 Defend these sectors 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.700
 maybe a little better colleague 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.000
 he paints in the city the sector 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.000
 go ahead 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:25.479
 the idea for italy is more important 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.890
 because ever kwp sectors I can accept 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.890
 I know that nobody works 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.759
 to attempt 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.390
 one becomes or 1000 still partially 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.670
 the office is fine 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.229
 sometimes the planes a bit 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.770
 smaller because he is stacking next to this 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.770
 disadvantage 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.400
 a bit confusing 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:14.930
 More we bake down here 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:18.100
 had sent then s then happened 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.730
 now fleet out right here comes 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.920
 So I can not prove that 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.240
 used to stage company is called the computer 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.240
 of control also over the air fleet 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.610
 apocalypse suitable you can do it 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.820
 select in the bmw pacific arminia 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.110
 lirich can control herself 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.010
 but make a copy may 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:52.000
 still the guest role of gp2 after here 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:52.000
 top why is no problem right now 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:01.900
 the fingers are sent to the left all 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.900
 directions 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.690
 So I'll take the opportunity 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.900
 to prove that thq is right 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.900
 fancy 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.280
 the main game principle so central 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.560
 subtle the back towards the rear 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.680
 send 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.599
 well, probably also here 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.800
 support there where it is necessary as is 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.670
 because there are not protected at all 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.720
 if anything would happen 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.180
 how do we take a little time 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:47.170
 his crew probably does not destroy a pity 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:50.769
 drum encapsulate if he has two 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.069
 displayed a facility on time 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.069
 go 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.300
 it stays up again 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:11.040
 that resurrected the fight 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.040
 I'm losing just on the moral advertising 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.680
 so 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.480
 wonderful 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.510
 you've just left my brother 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.860
 here somehow antique kurznews can 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.410
 Sectors also seem to be alive 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.520
 wonderful also means 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.520
 lose a little transmitter 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.070
 modena taken and we try that 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.590
 link here 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.750
 so that can flow here with the 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.950
 Price because I would really no price 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.950
 if i had the port i would 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.610
 So I still have the planes 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.100
 Do not see action like that with it 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.580
 also appreciate up here 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.890
 somehow the organization through very 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.190
 what he is doing a nice battle 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.250
 even relatively completely open and 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.180
 the formal seems to be stopped 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.490
 she also does not understand why we are now 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.260
 here division and hinterland promoted 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.830
 but bad condition and it 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:39.300
 does not have to go back 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.300
 So I think this stupid as bread 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.680
 but as long as here still busy here 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.670
 beggars in summer make good year 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.670
 and the master himself 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.860
 The one in a top condition here was only 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.860
 slowly 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.069
 jo 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:13.560
 so far is it the kripo 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.250
 yes I'm a threat to imagine 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:35.250
 what luck he is just now 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:35.250
 on it and more goal.com poplar 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:45.509
 I do not understand now 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.740
 what does that mean is a difference 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.710
 I'll click my city 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.000
 break something 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.229
 I'll say that because that's what I'm trying to do 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.570
 unfortunately nothing is explained now 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:05.930
 you do not have to try it so well 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.340
 means yes that would have much but why 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.000
 Can I tackle what I mean 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.979
 is it done automatically or who 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.660
 where exactly you have it 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:16.660
 double if you 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:29.159
 and nothing happens 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.620
 rather no topic for the good was 

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.450
 next to nicely advanced so hereby whole 

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.440
 Germany has become here 

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.700
 and that's not so bad 

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.910
 a hundred thousand if they are stuck 

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.910
 roll over
