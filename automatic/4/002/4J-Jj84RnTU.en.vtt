and it looks really cool but there is
the<00:01:48.060> vehicle<00:01:48.420> mode<00:01:48.630> overall<00:01:49.110> very<00:01:49.530> very<00:01:49.649> cool

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
so let's get transformed into his robot

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.340 
so let's get transformed into his robot
mode<00:01:53.549> now<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.390> transformation<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
mode now the transformation for the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.139 
mode now the transformation for the
beast<00:01:55.649> one<00:01:55.829> has<00:01:55.979> Optimus<00:01:56.280> Prime<00:01:56.640> it's

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
beast one has Optimus Prime it's

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.459 
beast one has Optimus Prime it's
actually<00:01:57.420> fairly<00:01:57.570> complex<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.290> feel

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
actually fairly complex and I feel

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.170 
actually fairly complex and I feel
really<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.979> if<00:01:59.490> ever<00:01:59.670> going<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.939> do<00:02:00.060> is

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
really like it if ever going to do is

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.459

together
and<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:56.610> sort<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.820> flip<00:02:57.210> these<00:02:57.450> little<00:02:57.720> gray

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
and just sort of flip these little gray

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.860 
and just sort of flip these little gray
bits<00:02:58.440> back<00:02:58.590> up<00:02:58.800> like<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.460> and<00:02:59.880> then<00:03:00.720> that's

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
bits back up like that and then that's

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.050 
bits back up like that and then that's
done<00:03:01.020> get<00:03:01.800> this<00:03:01.920> out<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.100> way<00:03:02.130> they're<00:03:03.000> not

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
done get this out the way they're not

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.460 
done get this out the way they're not
gonna<00:03:03.150> do<00:03:03.390> is<00:03:03.480> gonna<00:03:03.600> come<00:03:03.780> up<00:03:03.870> here<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.260> then

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
gonna do is gonna come up here and then

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.710 
gonna do is gonna come up here and then
we'll<00:03:04.590> rotate<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:05.160> entire<00:03:05.250> body<00:03:06.240> section

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
we'll rotate the entire body section

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.860 
we'll rotate the entire body section
upper<00:03:07.140> body<00:03:07.320> around<00:03:08.280> like<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:08.820> then<00:03:09.660> what<00:03:09.810> I

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
upper body around like that then what I

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.080 
upper body around like that then what I
can<00:03:09.990> do<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.830> just<00:03:11.010> flip<00:03:11.190> up<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.340> head<00:03:11.610> get

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
can do is it just flip up the head get

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.340 
can do is it just flip up the head get
out<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.330> way<00:03:12.450> let<00:03:12.990> me<00:03:13.020> just<00:03:13.080> take<00:03:13.290> this

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
out of the way let me just take this

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.690 
out of the way let me just take this
piece<00:03:13.500> I'm<00:03:13.680> just<00:03:13.800> gonna<00:03:13.920> Lodge<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:14.490> there

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
peg them right back here I was a little

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.550 
peg them right back here I was a little
bit<00:05:24.520> of<00:05:24.610> storage<00:05:25.000> this<00:05:25.660> is<00:05:25.810> what<00:05:25.930> I<00:05:25.960> tend<00:05:26.260> to<00:05:26.350> do

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
bit of storage this is what I tend to do

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.130 
bit of storage this is what I tend to do
with<00:05:27.340> both<00:05:27.550> of<00:05:27.700> them<00:05:27.820> and<00:05:28.570> he<00:05:28.690> actually<00:05:28.960> looks

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
with both of them and he actually looks

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.890 
with both of them and he actually looks
like<00:05:29.320> he's<00:05:29.470> got<00:05:29.590> a<00:05:29.650> rocket<00:05:30.250> pack<00:05:30.750> they<00:05:31.750> can

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
like he's got a rocket pack they can

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.830 
like he's got a rocket pack they can
actually<00:05:32.050> no<00:05:32.410> launch<00:05:33.370> him<00:05:33.610> so<00:05:34.240> it<00:05:34.570> does<00:05:34.660> have<00:05:34.780> a

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
actually no launch him so it does have a

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.450 
actually no launch him so it does have a
nice<00:05:35.110> amount<00:05:35.380> of<00:05:35.590> weapon<00:05:35.980> storage<00:05:36.220> you<00:05:36.340> can

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
nice amount of weapon storage you can

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.800 
nice amount of weapon storage you can

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.530 
I mean just the size difference and I'm
really<00:06:38.710> glad<00:06:38.890> that

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540 
really glad that

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.440 
really glad that
the<00:06:40.020> voyagers<00:06:40.380> are<00:06:40.410> getting<00:06:40.650> bigger<00:06:40.890> now

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
the voyagers are getting bigger now

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.820 
the voyagers are getting bigger now
because<00:06:42.450> honestly<00:06:42.780> the<00:06:43.020> prime<00:06:43.260> voyagers<00:06:43.650> in

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
because honestly the prime voyagers in

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.380 
because honestly the prime voyagers in
the<00:06:43.890> iodine<00:06:44.340> were<00:06:44.490> really<00:06:44.820> really<00:06:45.000> small<00:06:45.330> and

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
the iodine were really really small and

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.360 
the iodine were really really small and
that's<00:06:45.630> due<00:06:46.050> to<00:06:46.200> this<00:06:46.320> freakin<00:06:46.980> mech-tech

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
that's due to this freakin mech-tech

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.800 
that's due to this freakin mech-tech
weapon<00:06:47.730> now<00:06:47.880> that<00:06:48.000> they<00:06:48.060> stopped<00:06:48.390> doing<00:06:48.480> them

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
weapon now that they stopped doing them

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.630 
weapon now that they stopped doing them
I'm<00:06:49.380> really<00:06:49.680> hoping<00:06:49.830> that<00:06:49.980> the<00:06:50.130> voyages<00:06:50.430> start

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.640 
I'm really hoping that the voyages start

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.850 
I'm really hoping that the voyages start
to<00:06:50.730> go<00:06:50.820> up<00:06:50.940> in<00:06:51.060> size<00:06:51.270> like<00:06:51.540> this<00:06:51.720> one<00:06:51.930> and<00:06:52.800> I

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
to go up in size like this one and I

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.200 
to go up in size like this one and I
haven't<00:06:53.040> got<00:06:53.160> Predaking<00:06:53.550> yet<00:06:53.700> but<00:06:53.910> I<00:06:53.940> hope

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
haven't got Predaking yet but I hope

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.910 
haven't got Predaking yet but I hope
that<00:06:54.240> Predaking<00:06:54.870> is<00:06:55.020> a<00:06:55.170> decent<00:06:55.380> size<00:06:55.530> as<00:06:55.770> well

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920 
that Predaking is a decent size as well

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.640 
that Predaking is a decent size as well
