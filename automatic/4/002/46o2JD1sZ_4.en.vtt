00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
well i think you know having a new

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.650 
well i think you know having a new
defensive<00:01:46.820> coordinator<00:01:46.910> come<00:01:47.360> in<00:01:47.480> coach

defensive coordinator come in coach

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.420 
defensive coordinator come in coach
Thompson<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:48.830> was<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:48.980> bit<00:01:49.130> of<00:01:49.220> an<00:01:49.340> adjustment

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
Thompson it was a bit of an adjustment

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.580 
Thompson it was a bit of an adjustment
for<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.000> defense<00:01:50.390> I<00:01:50.690> know<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.020> offense<00:01:51.320> had

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
for the defense I know the offense had

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.700 
for the defense I know the offense had
were<00:01:52.070> running<00:01:52.550> a<00:01:52.610> faster<00:01:53.120> pace<00:01:53.360> often<00:01:53.900> so<00:01:54.140> we

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
were running a faster pace often so we

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.050 
were running a faster pace often so we
had<00:01:54.830> a<00:01:54.860> lot<00:01:55.010> to<00:01:55.130> work<00:01:55.250> on<00:01:55.430> but<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.700> think<00:01:55.910> it<00:01:56.000> went

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
had a lot to work on but I think it went

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.890 
had a lot to work on but I think it went
really<00:01:56.180> well<00:01:56.360> we<00:01:56.720> got<00:01:57.620> better<00:01:58.780> what<00:01:59.780> do<00:01:59.870> you

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
I think just playing four quarters I

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.730 
I think just playing four quarters I
mean<00:05:42.100> like<00:05:42.520> I<00:05:42.640> said<00:05:42.670> you<00:05:43.390> know<00:05:43.510> we<00:05:43.690> we<00:05:44.470> start

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
mean like I said you know we we start

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.230 
mean like I said you know we we start
our<00:05:44.860> own<00:05:45.190> team<00:05:45.460> today<00:05:45.610> you<00:05:45.730> know<00:05:45.940> start<00:05:46.150> off

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
our own team today you know start off

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.030 
our own team today you know start off
bad<00:05:46.450> then<00:05:46.780> we<00:05:46.870> play<00:05:47.230> good<00:05:47.470> second<00:05:47.920> third

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
bad then we play good second third

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.800 
bad then we play good second third
quarter<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:48.400> we<00:05:48.520> let<00:05:48.700> it<00:05:48.820> go<00:05:48.910> at<00:05:49.090> the<00:05:49.120> end<00:05:49.270> I

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
quarter and we let it go at the end I

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.170 
quarter and we let it go at the end I
think<00:05:50.230> there's<00:05:50.380> been<00:05:50.440> games<00:05:50.770> last<00:05:51.670> year<00:05:51.880> where

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
think there's been games last year where

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.120 
think there's been games last year where
we<00:05:52.300> start<00:05:52.720> off<00:05:52.870> good<00:05:53.080> and<00:05:53.410> we<00:05:53.590> finished<00:05:53.950> bad

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
we start off good and we finished bad

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.860 
we start off good and we finished bad
then<00:05:54.520> we<00:05:54.610> start<00:05:54.940> off<00:05:55.060> at<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:55.390> finish<00:05:55.630> good<00:05:55.840> i

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
then we start off at and finish good i

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.970 
then we start off at and finish good i
think<00:05:56.110> if<00:05:56.170> we<00:05:56.200> can<00:05:56.350> just<00:05:56.440> play<00:05:56.560> all<00:05:56.770> four

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
think if we can just play all four

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.950 
think if we can just play all four
