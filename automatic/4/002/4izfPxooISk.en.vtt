 I greet you on the channel itself girls in 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.510
 In this video I will talk about how to do 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.910
 chaise for dolls we need 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.280
 pencil ruler scissors and old 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.260
 their carton packaging will be required 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.330
 quite a lot of pva glue 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.020
 i'm using acrylic paint 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.420
 Well, you can basically use gouache 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:09.560
 wadded paint and glue brush 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.910
 kinder sticks and egg packs 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.140
 surprise or can use 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.960
 any other four corks 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.979
 same size to begin with 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.759
 we cut out about 5 parts from cardboard 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.690
 measuring 10 by 20 centimeters such 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.960
 rectangles 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.250
 the same number of parts in size 10 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:37.759
 by 11 centimeters and 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.580
 approximately 26 1 in 10 parts 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.479
 centimeters to start take one of 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.119
 rectangles and glue small 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.369
 narrow stripes leaving a distance 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.369
 about 2 millimeters 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.700
 when the item is completely plastered a 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.560
 We start to stick with others 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:11.710
 rectangles to her so that she 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:15.450
 It turned out more dense leave the item 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:19.510
 some time to dry out under load 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.090
 we also paste over the long part and 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.240
 we glue it with the rest of the details with us 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.020
 It turns out 2 such details they need 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.020
 paint it 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.340
 when the paint is dry let's start 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.860
 collect on a chaise we need two 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.860
 cotton swabs from which we cut 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.860
 mata 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.260
 now with hot glue 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.760
 fix them on the bottom of the chaise lounge 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.159
 leave some time for them 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.269
 well dried out 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.799
 if you don't have hot glue 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.829
 you can fix with 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:16.599
 a small piece of plasticine 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.599
 now glue the upper part 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.230
 Now we attach the deck chair legs in 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.250
 as you can use halves 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.730
 from packs 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.700
 for toy kinder surprise 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.590
 but you can use other traffic jams 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.040
 for example from juices or from bottles with 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.840
 water and I will grease with glue if 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.900
 no hot glue can be used 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.360
 another glue that glues plastic 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.360
 and stick him a chaise 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.980
 that's all the template is ready you can send 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.959
