00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
shoes because I think we deserve it for

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.620

me<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> most<00:01:34.710> important<00:01:35.220> thing<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.520> that

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
me the most important thing is that

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.819 
me the most important thing is that
architectural<00:01:36.630> part<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.350> shoe<00:01:37.590> maker

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
architectural part of the shoe maker

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.490 
architectural part of the shoe maker
which<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.220> really<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> last<00:01:39.479> making<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.259> think

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
which is really the last making I think

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.030 
which is really the last making I think
is<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> base<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.270> comfort<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.710> one

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
is the base for the comfort just one

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.149 
is the base for the comfort just one
part<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:45.000> for<00:01:45.240> example<00:01:45.689> very<00:01:46.170> high<00:01:46.470> heel<00:01:46.770> you

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
part like for example very high heel you

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.670 
part like for example very high heel you
normally<00:01:47.610> all<00:01:48.390> your<00:01:48.600> weight<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.990> right<00:01:49.290> here

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
normally all your weight is right here

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.100 
normally all your weight is right here
on<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> metatarsal<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.939> then<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.869> means

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
on the metatarsal and then that means

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.740 
on the metatarsal and then that means
that<00:01:52.290> you're<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.450> very<00:01:54.450> painful

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
that you're going to have a very painful
