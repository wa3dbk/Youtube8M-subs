chairman clay tournament clay has a
negative<00:00:23.580> ionic<00:00:23.820> charge<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.830> it<00:00:25.830> meaning

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
negative ionic charge and it meaning

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.460 
negative ionic charge and it meaning
everything<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.660> lives<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.990> our<00:00:28.109> bodies<00:00:28.439> that

is not healthy not good cells like

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.400 
is not healthy not good cells like
bacteria<00:00:32.070> virus<00:00:32.850> fungus<00:00:33.149> yeast<00:00:33.750> all<00:00:33.989> those

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
bacteria virus fungus yeast all those

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.280 
bacteria virus fungus yeast all those
little<00:00:35.340> bottom<00:00:35.790> feeders<00:00:36.120> have<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.690> positive

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
little bottom feeders have a positive

little bottom feeders have a positive
ionic<00:00:37.680> charge<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.730> term<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.149> play<00:00:39.450> when

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
ionic charge so the term in play when

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.440 
ionic charge so the term in play when
taken<00:00:40.320> internally<00:00:40.500> everyday<00:00:41.399> goes<00:00:41.969> into<00:00:42.329> your

taken internally everyday goes into your
body<00:00:42.629> draws<00:00:43.530> out<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.399> bottom<00:00:44.760> feeder<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
body draws out the bottom feeder or the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.840 
body draws out the bottom feeder or the
bad<00:00:45.570> guy<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> negative<00:00:46.680> charge<00:00:46.980> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
bad guy with the negative charge and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.240 
bad guy with the negative charge and
takes<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.629> out<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.780> your<00:00:48.930> system<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:50.070> good

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
takes it out of your system the good

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.380 
takes it out of your system the good
thing<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.910> has<00:00:51.059> 57<00:00:51.840> trace<00:00:52.110> micro<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.390> macro

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
thing is it has 57 trace micro and macro

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.139 
thing is it has 57 trace micro and macro
minerals<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.520> really<00:00:59.000> with<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
minerals and so it's really with the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.490 
minerals and so it's really with the
minerals<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.750> don't<00:01:00.989> even<00:01:01.199> get<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.410> our

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
minerals that we don't even get in our

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
have discovered is the mask every night

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.080 
have discovered is the mask every night
we<00:01:46.079> make<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.649> tournament<00:01:47.159> clay<00:01:47.460> mask<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.880> just

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
we make a tournament clay mask so just

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.560 
we make a tournament clay mask so just
take<00:01:48.240> about<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.750> much<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.829> clay<00:01:50.070> and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
take about this much of the clay and

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.899 
take about this much of the clay and
just<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.780> little<00:01:52.049> bit<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.530> water<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.670> little

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
just a little bit of water in a little

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.940 
just a little bit of water in a little
dish<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.770> mix<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.219> up<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.950> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
dish and I mix it up just like this and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.030 
dish and I mix it up just like this and
I<00:01:59.100> make<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.460> really<00:02:00.090> thin<00:02:00.509> because<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.350> sleep<00:02:01.860> in

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
I make it really thin because I sleep in

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.580 
I make it really thin because I sleep in
it<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.850> if<00:02:03.090> you're<00:02:03.240> married<00:02:03.509> kind<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:04.469> it

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it so if you're married kind of one it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.710 
it so if you're married kind of one it
looks<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> tan<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.469> take<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.799> it's

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
looks like a tan so then I take it it's

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.410 
looks like a tan so then I take it it's
just<00:02:08.869> like<00:02:09.050> water<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.680> I<00:02:10.100> put<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.550> on<00:02:10.700> my<00:02:11.090> face

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
just like water and I put it on my face

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.200
