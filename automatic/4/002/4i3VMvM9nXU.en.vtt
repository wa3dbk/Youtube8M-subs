to<00:00:45.920> a<00:00:45.949> little<00:00:46.190> bit<00:00:46.309> but<00:00:46.520> with<00:00:47.030> this<00:00:47.149> you<00:00:47.210> it's

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
to a little bit but with this you it's

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.000 
to a little bit but with this you it's
been<00:00:47.629> such<00:00:47.780> a<00:00:47.809> franchise<00:00:48.260> model<00:00:48.530> for<00:00:48.769> us<00:00:48.859> so

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
been such a franchise model for us so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.410 
been such a franchise model for us so
successful<00:00:49.519> we<00:00:49.609> haven't<00:00:49.820> really<00:00:49.969> changed<00:00:50.120> too

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420

much<00:00:50.449> from<00:00:50.780> one<00:00:50.960> year<00:00:51.109> to<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.230> next<00:00:51.320> seems<00:00:52.100> to

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
much from one year to the next seems to

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.470 
much from one year to the next seems to
hit<00:00:52.309> that<00:00:52.399> sweet<00:00:52.640> spot<00:00:52.699> for<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.090> lot<00:00:53.239> of<00:00:53.329> runners

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
so we don't want to tweak in it as much

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.979 
so we don't want to tweak in it as much
as<00:00:55.010> we<00:00:55.190> do<00:00:55.399> some<00:00:55.550> other<00:00:55.850> shoes<00:00:56.149> and<00:00:56.750> what<00:00:56.899> do
