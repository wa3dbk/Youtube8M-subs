00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.109 
I'd amp it up a few notches okay once
again<00:01:50.590> making<00:01:51.009> sure<00:01:51.189> I<00:01:51.250> look<00:01:51.459> like<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:51.640> tent<00:01:52.000> and

again making sure I look like a tent and

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.050 
again making sure I look like a tent and
the<00:01:52.240> tent<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.689> my<00:01:53.110> best<00:01:53.409> all<00:01:54.009> right<00:01:54.189> so<00:01:54.670> what<00:01:54.880> to

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
the tent is my best all right so what to

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.589 
the tent is my best all right so what to
wear

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.359 
wear
my<00:01:55.899> advice<00:01:56.349> is<00:01:56.679> something<00:01:57.340> like<00:01:59.189> that<00:02:00.189> right

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
my advice is something like that right

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.210 
my advice is something like that right
there<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.450> it's<00:02:02.140> not<00:02:02.409> so<00:02:02.649> much<00:02:02.709> about<00:02:02.890> being

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
there so it's not so much about being

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.839 
there so it's not so much about being
trendy<00:02:04.090> like<00:02:04.539> when<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:06.159> go<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.399> meet<00:02:06.670> our

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:06.849 
trendy like when we go to meet our

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.300 
trendy like when we go to meet our
