00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.940
 We continue with the subject of chemistry and in 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.730
 this time we will see how to prepare 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.639
 solutions that express the concentration 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.380
 in the form of percentages 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.260
 next we are presented with solve 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.870
 the next problem 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.550
 a solution is formed by 8 grams 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.890
 of solutes and 250 grams of water 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.820
 knowing that the density of the 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.730
 dissolution is 1.08 grams about 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.890
 cubic centimeter we are asked to calculate 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.560
 the concentration of the solution in 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.480
 grams about a liter 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.310
 reading carefully this problem 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.280
 We observed that the data is 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.860
 providing in units of mass in 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.470
 this case we have the mass that we have 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.070
 absolute and the mass of solvent we have 8 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.540
 grams of solute and 250 grams of water from 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.430
 Then, first of all, we have to 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.340
 to do is calculate the concentration of 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.410
 soluto for it we use the formula 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.940
 to express precisely the 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.340
 concentration as a percentage 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.690
 Mass mass of and then we have to 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.119
 solution that expresses the concentration in 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.190
 mass form mass is that which 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.790
 expresses the absolute concentration by 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.790
 Every 100 units of solvent mass 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.710
 this formula we are going to this kind of 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.110
 dissolution is expressed in the following 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.630
 formula that we see on screen in which 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.530
 the mass concentration percentage mass 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.590
 is going to be equal to dividing the mass that 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.260
 we have solvent between the mass of the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.250
 dissolution all this multiplied by 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.280
 100 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.290
 once we know the type of formula 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.970
 that we must apply to express the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.250
 concentration of this chemical solution 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.110
 the next step we have to do 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.530
 is precisely calculate the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.350
 concentration of this solution for it 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.140
 we have the data that this dissolution 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.770
 or solution is made up of 8 grams 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.630
 of solute and 250 grams of water from there 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.190
 then applying the formula we saw 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.320
 previously we have that the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.530
 concentration expressed as a percentage of 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:18.180
 Mass mass will be equal to divide 8 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.610
 grams between 258 grams eye 258 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.010
 grams come precisely from adding the 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.489
 solute mass and solvent mass 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.270
 in this case the 8 grams of the single shots 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.310
 2 250 grams of water 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.130
 performing this operation and then 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.200
 multiplying percent we have to the 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.819
 express constitution of the percentage plus 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.709
 a mass will be equal to 3 point 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.709
 one percent to say it in a way 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.280
 once we have this data in the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.989
 next step that asks us is 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.120
 precisely calculate the concentration 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.180
 of the solution in the form of grams 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.129
 about the liter for it we use the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.720
 data that is provided to us in which 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.730
 they tell us that the density of the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.290
 dissolution that we have just prepared is 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.510
 of 1.08 grams over cubic centimeter 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.329
 this data of grams over centimeter 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.579
 cubic the first we must convert it to 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.709
 grams over the liter since 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.349
 precisely the result is us 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.000
 asking in grams about the liter 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.370
 for this we use an equation 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.409
 dimensioning a dimensioning equation not 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.720
 is something other than a strip in the 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.540
 which we are going to be placing precisely 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.519
 the data that we want to convert in this 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.120
 case if they are fixed draw the rule 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.459
 we put in a 1.08 grams up and 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.900
 we place the cubic centimeters below 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.359
 precisely because it is what is 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.950
 dividing then we're going to 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.900
 multiply by a conversion factor 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.989
 in this case the conversion factor 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.620
 precisely that one liter equals 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.689
 to a thousand cubic centimeters observe the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.189
 detail is how you placed the data in the 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.829
 conversion factor if I want 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.450
 eliminate cubic centimeters what I'm going 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.750
 to do is place cubic centimeters 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.129
 below and cubic centimeters above and the 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.290
 other units in which I want 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.970
 do the conversion in this case liters 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.800
 more is left in the opposite direction 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.600
 once we have already armed our 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.460
 equation size the next step 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 is to perform the operations for it what 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.280
 only thing we have to do is 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.079
 multiply everything that is 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.030
 above we multiply everything that is 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.820
 find below and then we make a 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.830
 division if they have doubts of how 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.990
 Conversion using 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.610
 precisely dimensional equations I 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.370
 I recommend that someone else come from 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.250
 the videos that we have in this channel 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.520
 finally we have to make the 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.800
 operations 1.0 8 grams about 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.270
 cubic centimeter that is density 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.380
 of expresses in these units also 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:49.840
 Equivalent to 1080 grams on the liter 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.510
 once we have this data the 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.300
 next step is a little reasoning and another 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.190
 little re-apply the formula that 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.100
 we have to express the concentration 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.470
 Mass 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.900
 now that we convert the density of 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.540
 grams over cubic centimeter to grams 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.160
 about the milestone of we see we must 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.490
 calculate the amount of grams of 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.890
 absolute that we have in this solution the 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.440
 logic behind this reasoning is 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.750
 in that if we have a solution that has 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.390
 a certain concentration the 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.370
 density will affect the amount of 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.370
 solute that we have in this solution 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.130
 from there then we must calculate the 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.170
 amount of solute that we have in the 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.170
 dissolution that has a density of 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:39.950
 1080 grams on liter for it 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:42.080
 again we use the equation or 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.350
 of the formula that we use for 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.930
 calculate the mass mass percentage of the 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.390
 concentration of the solution and in this 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.790
 What we are going to do is clear 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.190
 precisely the amount of mass of 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.200
 solute that we have from there then 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.510
 we have that solute mass is going to be 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.430
 equal to multiply precisely the 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.110
 concentration that we have of the solution 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:08.270
 that we just calculated previously that is 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:12.050
 of 3.1 or 3 points 10 0 7% more to massa 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:14.780
 for precisely the mass that we have of 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.520
 the solution in this case and we did the 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.170
 density conversion and we're 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.140
 making the assumption that we have a 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.780
 liter and that a liter therefore has 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.180
 a mass of 1000 80 grams of iu 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.220
 then by multiplying these two data 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.860
 and divide them by 100 will give us 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.540
 precisely the amount of mass that 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:38.700
 we have of solute 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:41.370
 and which is 33 point 48 83 grams 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.920
 now the next step is more logical 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.230
 since precisely as we have calculated 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.380
 the mass amount of absolute that 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:52.860
 we have precisely in a mass of 1080 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.960
 grams and that that mass of 1080 grams is 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.060
 the one found in a liter of 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.400
 solution then we have to the 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.350
 concentration of solute that we are being 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:06.060
 asking in grams about the milestone is going to 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:08.550
 be 33 point 48 83 grams between 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.500
 precisely one liter for the reduction 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.300
 what am I trying to explain in what 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.190
 precisely all the data we made 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.569
 precisely for the mass that is 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:20.210
 contained in a liter of solution 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:22.249
 With this result, we have already 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.600
 solved the problem that we were 

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:27.760
 initially raised
