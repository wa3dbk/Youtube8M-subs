00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:25.800
 welcome as I know 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.760
 that you lose your life and you have no time 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.470
 above all things as a girl 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.660
 about the worst thing that can happen 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.340
 because you do not necessarily want out of that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.450
 go house or changed or you want 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.140
 Namely look like you have 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.140
 sleepily 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.550
 I am concerned about two weeks since 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.410
 not different so every morning me 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.280
 I think I can do every second if not 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.110
 even every morning 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.449
 you have to get up early I come 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.149
 just not out of bed and thereby 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.140
 that I, of course , experience this myself 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.550
 have or even experience every day 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.579
 I thought I'd just give it one 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.260
 few tips how to do it anyway 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.570
 to look reasonably well 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.939
 in the morning and then over a day with 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.909
 number one is and I know it is 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.400
 always difficult and totally annoying and you 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.689
 just have to get used to but people so 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.880
 lifesaver really helps me every night 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.490
 So pick out my clothes 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.860
 you do not have to outfit in detail 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.020
 but just to think about and 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.579
 writes to watch and consider hey 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.689
 what can i wear tomorrow even if 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.689
 you do not know how the weather is going to get 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.979
 just choose an outfit which maybe 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.689
 a little bit who is more than a kind 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.460
 what maybe for a rainy day 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.290
 well, just lay down a few 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.320
 get out of clothes because so is the choice 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.320
 lower in the morning and that saves you 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.970
 a lot of time and as I said that has 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.680
 me the last ones I think the last one 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.869
 week it has me so often mean 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.759
 most valuable rescued that I just 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.590
 still managed to make the train but also 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.530
 just because I'm in my clothes at night 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.740
 have designed 10 02 is in any case 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.120
 smug everything just spices up 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.780
 So even if you do that 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.630
 the sixth of all basic outfits on 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.410
 Jewelry is always an aid 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.730
 find basic outfit and do that 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.200
 Me too, I have to be I am 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.480
 not really that one 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.140
 but always wear so much jewelry if 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.040
 I then always put extra extra 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.400
 jewelery lawyer as pep just come on 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.750
 next comes the make up &amp; play 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.670
 I can only tell you to stroke 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.070
 if your patent and no time has no 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.290
 This is not a good idea because if you 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.170
 has no time and really ten minutes 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.580
 has to get ready 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.920
 then the eyeliner is not good 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.810
 if I but still a bit more 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.640
 wanted to give a bite league start 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.490
 always a good choice 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.690
 and if you have no time 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.400
 elaborate smokie or something to 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.740
 You do not have to do it if you only have ten 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.300
 minutes and she has to finish 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.740
 it's always a good tip that I have on 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.560
 the last week about almost every day 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.209
 made your favorite ones very fast 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.860
 get out palette and then 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.959
 just a little bit on the horse clocks 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.970
 and apply to the eyelid so 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.190
 and then it is too 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.770
 really relatively decent but distributed 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.940
 is that what's out of the eyelid and there is 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.459
 just do not stop like you have 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.130
 but it looks like you have 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.070
 at least a little paid attention 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.920
 or spent a bit of time and in the 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.900
 Bad and have reviled you or so would be 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.400
 be someone who does not eyeliner on the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.560
 can actually do without 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.980
 as I said people believe me when I 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.580
 do not have time then just have to 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.020
 or you have to, of course 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.090
 Of course you can not 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.290
 but then make it always one 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.570
 good compromise 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.100
 instead of emphasizing the eyes, the lips 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.050
 to emphasize and there I have a whole 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.000
 Good trick for you just take one 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.290
 lip care you wear a bit 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.540
 and then take your favorite 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.910
 lipstick does not have to be gaudy either 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.830
 be color but if you have a gaudy 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.540
 colors and just a little bit on the 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.450
 pat lips on it and then the 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.830
 lip care am also smudge a 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.810
 spread a bit on the lips 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.820
 that gives color and it just looks 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.100
 spent an hour in bed as 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.220
 next we come to the hair and 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:26.130
 if you have a hair structure like me 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:27.960
 people big because yes, do not screw up then 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.050
 you have real with such a hair structure 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.460
 lost but I really in 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.340
 last time what you found me out 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.760
 which helps us very well and I would have 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.160
 number one is a very good tip for you 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.350
 that's it already and you know that 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.150
 probably already is on everyone 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:51.660
 case cream to take in this easy 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.010
 weird whatever that is structure 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.050
 because if you just do not have one 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.550
 You can not have time now, too 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.770
 if I can straighten your hair 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.570
 Do not beckon just can not 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.740
 whether that's ten minutes to finish 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.500
 be or maybe even 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.380
 less super nice structure and power 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.250
 even a little bit he so one 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.050
 little beach babes and I have 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.760
 also very often applied in the last one 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.680
 time and has always been very good to me 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.910
 The next tip is if you are 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.830
 maybe even a little bit more time 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.660
 have a quarter of an hour to get ready 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.000
 it also does not mean to be but if 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.980
 your quarter of an hour without ten minutes 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.410
 It's always good before you have time 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.120
 teeth just before you make up 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.660
 Everything looks like something 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.020
 do 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.060
 share your hair just in twelve partie 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.320
 and then you turn them on if you still have one 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.030
 you can have a little more time 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.050
 Of course I also have braiding 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.750
 both already done 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.600
 then he makes them and of course together 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.620
 with ponytails wonderfully pleases 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.220
 can you just have it like that 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.080
 to let 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.540
 I'm not that kind of guy like that 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.889
 very happy to wear two braids and then 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.340
 you just do it as usual 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:59.580
 course quickly we have slept 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.680
 ready and before you leave then you do 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.770
 the hair ties out and then lie your 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.370
 Hair is magical 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:10.250
 It helps me very well and if you can 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.069
 Thinking about it in a hurry it is a very 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.990
 very good trick but if nothing 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:18.139
 helps and you think I can pack 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.080
 have only five minutes my gob the 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:24.669
 Light can be done with mine 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.669
 people's best choice 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:32.690

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.639
 fastest 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.800

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.870

 We can remember my friend there 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.469
