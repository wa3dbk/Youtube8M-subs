00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.679
 the first type of choice then to talk about 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.619
 the choice twin tip I chose the gip and that type 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.269
 yes table structure that allows 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.820
 I have symmetrical features in the use of the kills 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.840
 this uses mainly this is the 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.830
 parka the masters trailers precisely because we have weight balancing 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.270
 perfectly table unit 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.110
 and this leads to maximum stability 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.310
 apart from this 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.600
 also the lamina 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.740
 you are cashier the mosnel which in the temple this to actually carry 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.310
 equal characteristics both with us in our direction and then when 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.309
 let's go in the opposite holistic direction 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.640
 another kind of choice actually gay shemale 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.620
 the Greeks sometimes that kind of shape used mainly freeriders 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.520
 oki on the track precisely because the portal is a table-oriented weapon 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.270
 as they say pieraccioni 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.190
 in the part of the monza here on our part and comfortable for the descent that one 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.680
 leads to certainly facilitating the driving and holding of the curve in the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.910
 our sense 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.560
 limiting the discussion of the part of the Tiber a little 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.530
 this was because it was a table used mainly in the off-piste in the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.620
 limna inna and therefore that must have characteristics of the kind 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.960
 another type of shape 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.490
 so what we have just 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.670
 learned that you see parade understand here is the twin directional greece la 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.790
 to the middle way between two previously explained styles 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.909
 just because 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.450
 guarantees a shape of the table 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.450
 predominantly symmetrical one step 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:16.139
 mainly centered even if every now and then it finds itself of some degree moved 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:16.999
 back 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.530
 but what guarantees klinger aisha brands 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.090
 even if a form 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.540
 totally symmetrical guarantees two cuts of laminate a conduction 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.130
 different 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.360
 between the normal leading direction and those switcher then essence opposite 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.659
 ancient port of sheik therefore fundamental 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.919
 for a table or especially for using a table to understand who 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.880
 orientation is very important for construction 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.229
 which especially in recent years has been an emotion you want scary 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:55.569
 to say the construction can be any type and mainly the 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.059
 tables started with a speech by pont 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:03.439
 the fundamental bridge for the responsiveness of the table at least until this year 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.669
 until new photos have come out of the evolution of the table 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:13.749
 therefore treats paul bay is technology tbt solution which therefore avoids you 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:18.209
 mainly of using the table against the eagle and then allows you 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.960
 the use of the table much more fluid much softer 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.859
 card games - 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.939
 so this attic surface always touches for all the conduction 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.689
 maneuvers with landings the central part of the board 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:38.860
 thanks grooves that arrive until the middle of the speech by harry fox 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.900
 and any maneuver but also the most basic driving on the track 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.939
 effectively avoids the classic mine 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:50.780
 only all the types of all the models as you ask yourself the important thing is that 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:54.149
 other pontes 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.779
 the most innovative system that surely has done this year already 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.100
 last year he was already talking about it 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.540
 banana skate speech 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.569
 skate banana what is 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.449
 it consists mainly of revolutionizing the truth that we have had of the smoc 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.159
 port up to a year ago 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.699
 this is because instead of having a classic bridge we talked about the tables 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.829
 previous therapies powders of any other table eh already anyway 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.849
 the codiponte this word is studied in the opposite sense in a way 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.699
 totally innovative 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.550
 as it is the first table actually studied as smoke or not derived from 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.029
 no other type 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:34.199
 of equipment for the mountain 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:40.960
 this consists of having a rocker such inclination of the opposite table alex 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.950
 classic fairy tales instead of seeing the bridge 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.029
 which gave elasticity first 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:51.279
 the form table is hollowed out as it is actually called banana 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:56.109
 this discourse brings of the sea a proportion of surface only the part 

00:04:56.109 --> 00:05:00.739
 central where the attacks of sweetness intimately support the conduction of 

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:02.870
 weight of the athlete ground ita 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.409
 for the rest, tip and tail 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:10.809
 usually symmetrically they are raised to ensure greater 

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:14.899
 speed of direction changes more lightness and more speed in the 

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:16.050
 movements 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.729
 I bring innovation from Verona to the table that can help you all 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.319
 environmental conditions from fresh snow and the pontehrc expect everyone to arrive 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:30.009
 to the parquet to all the structures that can be used of the taro the park 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.779
 over the shape the construction 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:39.889
 for which of the aforementioned another fundamental principal element of the 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.659
 firearms that difference for various levels 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.149
 speech of the details queues materials used to build board 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:50.100
 the material is essential 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.870
 why 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.120
 the wood 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.569
 It is the first basic element of any sports smoking table 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:00.330
 already validated of a good level because it is the wood to put one activity 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.560
 good reaction 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.680
 a good relationship with the heat and cold of temperature 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:06.719
 and therefore maintains 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.259
 the table as long as possible to its original basic characteristics 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:14.479
 of when it is born and goes out of the manufacturing difficulty 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.630
 in addition to the very important one for further maintenance 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.030
 the duration of the crap to maintain the main characteristics of the 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.819
 table 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.570
 add to the interior of similar materials 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.539
 we attach wadding alternative gifts 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:36.439
 which lighten the structure and therefore keep the board lighter 

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:40.289
 but at the same time reactive the best presstart bike
