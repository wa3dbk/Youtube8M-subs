frame of this thing are going to be

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.970 
frame of this thing are going to be
where<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> crossmembers<00:00:57.570> attached<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.590> that

where the crossmembers attached so that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.939 
where the crossmembers attached so that
means<00:00:59.219> it's<00:01:00.090> not<00:01:00.840> only<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.079> easier<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> set<00:01:01.739> up

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
means it's not only is easier to set up

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.810 
means it's not only is easier to set up
but<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:03.350> provides<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> rigid<00:01:05.339> cages<00:01:05.700> in

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
but it provides one the rigid cages in

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.330 
but it provides one the rigid cages in

the market thicker the steel the fewer

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.460 
the market thicker the steel the fewer
joints<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> fewer<00:01:12.299> bolts<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.200> in

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
joints the fewer bolts you have in

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.410 
joints the fewer bolts you have in
something<00:01:13.950> okay<00:01:14.369> every<00:01:14.909> time<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.090> put<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> ball

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
possible weak point in your design so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.969 
possible weak point in your design so
this<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.700> 3d<00:01:21.570> CAD<00:01:21.900> developed<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.619> where<00:01:22.770> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
this is all 3d CAD developed to where it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.160 
this is all 3d CAD developed to where it
uses<00:01:23.310> as<00:01:23.430> few<00:01:23.670> bolts<00:01:23.909> as<00:01:24.090> possible<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.110> you

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
uses as few bolts as possible so you

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.300 
uses as few bolts as possible so you
have<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> ultimate<00:01:25.530> rigidity<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.580> minimum

top where you can hang chains or bands

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.550 
top where you can hang chains or bands
so<00:02:48.790> they're<00:02:48.970> also

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.319 

the<00:02:52.560> lines<00:02:53.010> were<00:02:53.189> proud<00:02:53.519> about<00:02:53.670> on<00:02:53.969> this<00:02:54.120> is

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
the lines were proud about on this is

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.020 
the lines were proud about on this is
that<00:02:54.980> we<00:02:55.980> have<00:02:56.129> one<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.400> best<00:02:56.519> hooks<00:02:56.849> in

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
that we have one of the best hooks in

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.879 
that we have one of the best hooks in
the<00:02:57.120> industry<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:58.230> hook<00:02:58.439> is<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.709> most

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
the industry the hook is the most

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.739 
the industry the hook is the most
important<00:02:59.280> part<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.519> cage<00:02:59.730> it's<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.569> part

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:00.749 
important part of the cage it's the part

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:02.390 
important part of the cage it's the part
of<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.900> cage<00:03:01.079> that<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.379> user<00:03:01.620> interacts<00:03:02.219> with

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
of the cage that the user interacts with

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.879 
of the cage that the user interacts with
the<00:03:02.579> most<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.109> real<00:03:04.230> hands-on<00:03:04.650> part

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
the most this is the real hands-on part

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.440 
the most this is the real hands-on part
of<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.069> cage<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.819> also<00:03:05.999> the<00:03:06.150> part<00:03:06.329> of<00:03:06.389> the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
of the cage it's also the part of the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.610 
of the cage it's also the part of the
cage<00:03:06.599> it<00:03:06.750> keeps<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.049> user<00:03:07.200> from<00:03:07.349> getting

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
cage it keeps the user from getting

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.580 
cage it keeps the user from getting
injured<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.299> we<00:03:09.540> have<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:10.139> fully

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
injured and in this we have a fully

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.830 
injured and in this we have a fully
welded<00:03:10.769> wraparound<00:03:11.609> design<00:03:11.939> with<00:03:12.389> a<00:03:12.420> window

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
welded wraparound design with a window

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.949 
welded wraparound design with a window
for<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.530> numbering<00:03:13.859> and<00:03:14.430> we<00:03:15.090> also<00:03:15.239> have<00:03:15.389> what

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
for the numbering and we also have what

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.589 
for the numbering and we also have what
most<00:03:16.200> importantly<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.939> space-age<00:03:17.939> polymer

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
most importantly a space-age polymer

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.709 
most importantly a space-age polymer
that<00:03:19.169> is<00:03:19.769> a<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.549> actual<00:03:20.849> contact<00:03:21.269> point<00:03:21.569> so

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:21.719 
that is a the actual contact point so

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:22.729 
that is a the actual contact point so
that<00:03:21.749> way<00:03:21.959> there's<00:03:22.079> no<00:03:22.230> metal<00:03:22.530> on<00:03:22.709> metal

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
that way there's no metal on metal

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.670 
that way there's no metal on metal
contact<00:03:23.489> with<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.700> bar<00:03:23.939> which<00:03:24.540> which<00:03:25.109> preserves

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
contact with a bar which which preserves

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.159 
contact with a bar which which preserves
the<00:03:25.889> knurling<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.549> bar<00:03:26.760> also<00:03:27.569> helps

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
the knurling on the bar also helps

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.839 
the knurling on the bar also helps
absorb<00:03:28.349> some<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.799> impact<00:03:28.859> energy<00:03:29.459> so

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
absorb some of the impact energy so

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.030 
absorb some of the impact energy so
there's<00:03:30.030> less<00:03:30.449> bounce<00:03:30.780> out<00:03:31.079> there<00:03:31.859> is<00:03:31.949> an

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
there's less bounce out there is an

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.449 
there's less bounce out there is an
extended<00:03:32.519> profile<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.719> that<00:03:33.750> way<00:03:34.139> it's<00:03:35.129> it's

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
extended profile so that way it's it's

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.580 
extended profile so that way it's it's
easier<00:03:36.060> for<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.359> user<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.659> find<00:03:37.049> Anna<00:03:37.319> panic

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
easier for the user to find Anna panic

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.500 
easier for the user to find Anna panic
situation<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.280> presents<00:03:38.519> more<00:03:38.849> safety<00:03:39.150> and

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
the wear surface is extended all the way

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.379 
the wear surface is extended all the way
