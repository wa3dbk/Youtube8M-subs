00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.719 
to win one drew Brees I think he can
Buster<00:04:41.570> one<00:04:41.900> win<00:04:42.350> for<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.310> states<00:04:43.550> in<00:04:43.639> the

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
Buster one win for the states in the

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.540 
Buster one win for the states in the
playoffs<00:04:44.120> I<00:04:44.690> think<00:04:45.199> that's<00:04:45.590> it<00:04:45.830> I<00:04:45.860> think<00:04:46.430> it

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
playoffs I think that's it I think it

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.790 
playoffs I think that's it I think it
stops<00:04:46.820> there<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.120> don't<00:04:47.840> think<00:04:48.139> the<00:04:48.259> things<00:04:48.470> I

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
stops there I don't think the things I

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.460 
stops there I don't think the things I
can<00:04:49.400> win<00:04:49.610> on<00:04:49.729> the<00:04:49.850> road<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.509> get<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.229> get<00:04:51.440> it

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
can win on the road and get it get it

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.779 
can win on the road and get it get it
done<00:04:51.710> in<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.919> playoffs<00:04:52.280> on<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.550> world<00:04:52.729> I

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
done in the playoffs on the world I

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.430 
done in the playoffs on the world I
think<00:04:53.030> maybe<00:04:53.180> they<00:04:53.389> beat<00:04:53.599> Philadelphia<00:04:53.840> maybe

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
think maybe they beat Philadelphia maybe

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.719 
think maybe they beat Philadelphia maybe
they<00:04:54.650> beefed<00:04:54.830> it<00:04:54.979> up<00:04:55.130> with<00:04:55.280> them<00:04:55.490> they're

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
they beefed it up with them they're
