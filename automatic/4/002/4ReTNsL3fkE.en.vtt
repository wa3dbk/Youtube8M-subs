00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.260
 Welcome to the tutorial today. 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.900
 approaching the second part of the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.369
 defense relentless tutorials for you that 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.410
 Do not know this video here is the second one. 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.840
 part of another tutorial I did 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.700
 and leave it on the screen if you 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.649
 want to click at this moment you will be 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.540
 this tutorial to 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.460
 Then come back here or you can too. 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.170
 click on the description of this video here and 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.660
 watched a little watch a little bit 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.760
 before that day that you do and 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.440
 I'll come back to see second video here. 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.539
 as said in the previous video the guy 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.770
 I played long ago had good quad and there the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.879
 people went up to him 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.920
 in the first half we were very 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.289
 happy at the marking we even got 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.120
 put some goals there and not take any 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.979
 In this second part of the video I'm going to try 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.479
 address another issue rather than 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.670
 be showing bids extensively 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.229
 explaining in detail for detail I believe 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.909
 that I have already explained a lot in that 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.470
 First video now, I want to show you 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.729
 what else happens in the party 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.560
 of the face 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.659
 let's drop the bids and although he and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.909
 talking about them beauty in this 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.830
 first bid and neymar can give 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.720
 one stop steps and it starts 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.640
 then to see that he's going to have to change the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.040
 his style of play has already managed to steal 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 the ball in the sequence he takes the ball off 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.020
 Come back and play, I 'll see you there. 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.630
 Pulling him I'm trying to steal the ball. 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.369
 with debris and do not give up like I said 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.140
 You have to bring the guy there. 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.450
 of their attack to aid in the defense and 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.159
 then he begins to visualize that taking 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.350
 when his pass and he starts to 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.000
 dribble and will cut the scribbling 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.979
 My saga is cutting by risking 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.659
 including spending to bid again 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.119
 you visualize and that the body behind 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.979
 in order to get his pass but he already 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.180
 starts to stay connected in the second half 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.969
 he'll have to do a thing 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.070
 different to try to win this game 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.020
 Following him comes up I'm 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.240
 fierce defense trying to score the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.459
 I'm starting to worry about him. 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.500
 Bitches on his dribbles I tried 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.770
 take the ball the ball ends up leaving him 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.230
 with 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.060
 follow then make the equitalia goal 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.860
 The market about you has to defend you 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.530
 have to defend well during the 1990s. 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.280
 minutes and can not give a vacillation that goes 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.630
 take goal 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.640
 in this move he came cutting 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.800
 Could you find a space there? I ended up 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.450
 dominating for him made the goal then stay 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.120
 because any chance you 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.800
 should your opponent he will score 30 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.260
 give no chance try to stay in 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.820
 try to find out what to do and 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.890
 always 100 times of course it is very 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.630
 easy to talk is not that simple 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.970
 When are you playing but I stayed? 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.680
 concentrate to defend yourself stays on 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.390
 What are you doing in defense? 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.520
 following him puts the ball now in the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.990
 in front of us will try to do what 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.760
 put our player in front 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.560
 his player but it is for those who do not have 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.480
 no one in the area then he does it 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.280
 tries to cut back and still player 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.290
 who was there in plenty can take 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.120
 As I already explained to you in that 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.190
 first video in this second half 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.810
 I was attacking very well, I no longer 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.300
 more able to defend with such 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.950
 Eni mastery still does that there 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.260
 you can see and put in the area 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.750
 but he crosses badly and our luck 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.610
 had several players on the back plus one 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.310
 now showing yet another bid or 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.990
 From here I'm going to paralyze you, I asked. 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.209
 this ball I almost from my goal when I 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.790
 I tried to steal his ball. I could not 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.220
 this point here when he puts the 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.830
 Ball in front I tried to steal but he 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.930
 protect very well how can you see me there ? 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.850
 I lose my whole game because in 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.310
 sequence what happens 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.410
 he puts it in front and there is no more 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.270
 support of one player per player who 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.280
 selected at that time it will not 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.720
 be able to stop his attack and he 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.190
 very smartly then you can play 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.870
 between my two defenders 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.970
 so you stay very connected as it says 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.500
 for you any mistake can be fatal and 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.600
 realize at the time that I thought I was going to 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.610
 steal his ball and he gave the body to 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.170
 I hit him in his body and in the sequence 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.810
 the guy came in the face of the goal just did not 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.120
 Goal because I got lucky last 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.680
 I'll show you that it shows again 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.540
 started playing much better 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.760
 I happen to know that he in the marking and 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.440
 then attempted to put a player in the 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.270
 front of his kick but was not 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.220
 possible later I had seen that I 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.260
 I had lost the game there, I had to 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.000
 then get a player in position 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.070
 front of his kick but still the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.109
 ball passed and was very dangerous 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.479
 so it 's getting the statistics on the 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.430
 final I gave nine kicks on the target he gave 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.270
 five for those who remember that 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.580
 first match 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.530
 given no kick in the album of the first 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.419
 time including some people there 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.220
 comment in the video saying that if the 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.440
 guy would pick would be much more 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.629
 difficult and marked him or that guy was 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.310
 name and neither of these two things 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.690
 least in my view it was true that he 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.460
 chose not being corner 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.680
 usually the ball goes to the same place 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.330
 and you, if you're tagging coladinho 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.800
 in the face you can get the most 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.020
 so I did not want him to be 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.509
 would be so hard to mark. 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.909
 I'll tell you about sereno unb as you can see in 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.770
 second part the guy had resources in the 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.970
 first time I was able to cancel it and 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.039
 second time he started showing 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.960
 that his tools came up there 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.550
 and had several opportunities to 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.409
 goal and I also stayed on top of the 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.180
 also failed to draw 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.919
 most of his opportunities 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.240
 it also takes advantage of this video signal 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.639
 here to say that you are here is going to be the 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.289
 last tutorial of 14 as I said to 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.139
 you give very very very work 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.270
 bring this kind of video you have to record 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.389
 then edit in a job 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.580
 here organizing to do all the 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.979
 This script, of course, that I 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.449
 I feel very happy after I finish 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.789
 each of these missions 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.620
 but as we are already at the end of fifa 14 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.110
 I do not think it's as valid as that. 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.669
 continue to invest here in the issue of 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.800
 tutorials maybe after bringing some 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.750
 another thing I can use a little better the 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.419
 my time I was thinking of bringing 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.099
 several fifa daily videos but 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.990
 consumes too much I have to 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.180
 Work, you have to study. 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.789
 have fun time of my time 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.560
 family does not roll at least for 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.110
 while I dedicate myself 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.699
 is totally right that maybe someday 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.130
 about the tutorials as I was saying 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.050
 For you, I plan to bring tutorials. 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.639
 there from the beginning of fifa 15 so that the 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.500
 People can go changing the picture, leave. 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.509
 all through fifa so i have 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.919
 sure it will be much cooler than 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.719
 that in this cold here because we're going 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.860
 start tutorials from the beginning of 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.539
 fifa beauty 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.449
 I hope you liked it then. 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.560
 here the relentless defense part 2 waits 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.599
 also that in some way 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.860
 contributed to your game 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.779
 Anything is just leave a comment
