00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.630
 this friends my name is denis boris you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.429
 you are on channel pitfall aif.ru 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.320
 we will talk about exercises now 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.050
 which develops the back surface 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.340
 that of our hip, that is this part 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.960
 this exercise is isolated but 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.460
 called bending on the simulator lying in 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.769
 Generally isolated to work 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.179
 back of the thigh can be 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.790
 to a large extent only a few 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.790
 exercises 2 that comes to me 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.070
 so immediately to the head is bending the legs while standing 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.670
 in the simulator and bending the legs lying in 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.260
 simulator 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.420
 Now we will consider precisely 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.390
 the second option is what is special 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.850
 isolated exercise is what we have 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.489
 the rest of the muscle is shut down 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.989
 groups that is, if we say we do 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.550
 dead pull on straight legs 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.070
 Naturally in this exercise is very 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.930
 we are actively working the same back 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.239
 thigh surface our bicep hips 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.070
 but beyond that a bunch 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.899
 secondary muscle groups such as 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.659
 and buttocks so such as the back 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.890
 here and in general, so a similar 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.150
 exercise is basic 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.700
 polyarticular 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.500
 and if our task is isolated 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.290
 work the back of the thigh then 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.439
 by and large most often the fact that 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.140
 we have the presence of it is just that flexion 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.229
 legs lying in the simulator 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.520
 what is the peculiarity of this exercise 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.939
 feature is that in it 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.180
 it's very hard to do something wrong 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.259
 but if you are not a complete idiot of course 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.390
 the only thing you need to do is 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.960
 Largely it is convenient to configure 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.820
 simulator make so that the roller under 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.670
 which you will thrust your legs 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.049
 was at the right removal in order 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.329
 so we have it rested surface slightly 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.990
 over your heels i mean somewhere here in 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.399
 this place 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.540
 should rest the roller second moment you 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.000
 should take care to 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.520
 distance between platforms on which 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 will lie your quadriceps and between 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.099
 roller was optimal in that regard 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.209
 to 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:15.989
 the knee was hanging a little bit 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.790
 hung over from here this platform here 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.000
 starting point in order for you 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.250
 nothing prevented to reduce in general 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.050
 bend legs 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.690
 the other rules are plus or minus ones 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.120
 that is, you need to exhale on the effort 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.209
 that is, when we bend the leg when 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.819
 us roller goes up you we exhale 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.060
 when the roller goes down we 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.709
 inhale 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.420
 There are various modifications of execution 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.970
 exercise in terms of what is possible too 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.540
 move socks outward move socks 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.019
 inside 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.810
 but I will work in this exercise 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.790
 frankly it's not good i 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.099
 proponent to stick with the classic 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.410
 exercise forms when your 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.549
 legs are parallel and socks 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.329
 accordingly is also 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:08.510
 in parallel how it all looks like we 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:12.200
 we approach the simulator we fall on it and 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.630
 our legs will automatically climb up 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.000
 after that we tightly take on 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.400
 handles press your body 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.510
 simulator so that he does not go up and down 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:28.680
 left right and start performing 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.420
 bending legs look but my socks 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.700
 parallel to each other they don't look 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.900
 at each other they are not deployed in different 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.079
 sides they are parallel at the lowest point i 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.389
 do not let the weight to the end that is, the bottom 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.569
 I have a tension point 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:48.780
 i sort of work inside the amplitude top 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.970
 the point of my shortening is a pause for a second in 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.680
 my lowest point going on 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.130
 stretching again pause for a second 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.019
 for 7 weave movements she 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.569
 by the way very smoothly and as you see y 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.079
 I am constantly under pressure 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.389
 biceps hips and the top point i 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.609
 I can even delay this pause on 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:12.390
 a few seconds to get better 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:17.540
 feel your hip biceps 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.100
 inhale pause inhale-exhale 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:25.970
 pause 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.970
 inhale inhale inhale inhale 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.270
 this is bending the legs in the simulator baby
