00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.640
 Let's think about lunch at the time of the meal, explain. 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.580
 your family likes frying potato dumplings and as careful as you 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.529
 have with cooking oil 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:11.669
 What do you do with it later? 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.209
 how and where he plays out 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.560
 see what people who have had the same doubts have done 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.560
 in the report said leonardo ribeiro 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.439
 the collection point at the door of the community hall 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.039
 just open the trash deposit the bottle and you are ready 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.499
 but in the year of study will have an ecologically correct destination 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.969
 In those years the batteries batteries lamps and an eye now it has a certain 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.980
 existence 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.460
 it's a saw 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.380
 nor is there science that provides assistance that is worth seeing 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.130
 more complete because it facilitates more work the initiative in 305 south has 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.850
 yielded good results 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.680
 since the inhabitants left to throw the oil in the sewage network 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.330
 a contribution to the environment to get an idea a liter of this 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.770
 type of waste is capable of contaminating one million liters of water 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.949
 it's a finger 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.640
 becomes a career collective and helps a lot in the head and also in the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.270
 my mind to lieutenant mÃ¡rio mendes thame this month was taken years only 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.890
 in liters of oils are discarded per month 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.720
 everything goes to those values 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.890
 which are then collected by well-donated careers for recycling 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.080
 besides contributing with 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.380
 1 the environment 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.520
 avoiding what 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.310
 that it degrades even more than it already is personal satisfaction and power 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.430
 contribute 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.970
 without much effort 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.970
 for other people to produce and sell yes 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.170
 have the best livelihood 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.280
 I did not help 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.230
 both for us as scheila dwelling of the varjÃ£o 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.890
 she is one of the members of the career project two years ago receives oil for 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.010
 make soap the process is fast and complements the income 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.190
 each piece sold two reais he was still in the girlfriend's belly outside huh 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.310
 who 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.689
 It's on my mind though a lot of people on Saturday also happen. 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.580
 also 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.809
 it is estimated that on the deck and used with 20 4 million liters of oil per year 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:12.269
 of these 50% are thrown in the sink drain 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.719
 and serve to put ippoo-i of the lake 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.299
 is in a theater this processing the use will not only be in the manufacture of 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.359
 soap as agent in the report teach even in the production of biodisel 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:26.359
 And you know what is better 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.969
 off the water bill 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.969
 the marinate colatto coast tells us how 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.509
 maria emma mejia 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:38.000
 Good morning, this treatment is recycling. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.320
 that you referred to is part of the program recourse and career see who 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.699
 will coordinate as we see there in the report 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:46.980
 one liter of oil 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.689
 which is played in the environment and is able to dir 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:50.519
 the moment 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.809
 million liters of water and 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:55.030
 it's very serious let's start now 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.500
 with the manager of 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.499
 information and demand surveys per day 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:00.860
 as the population 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.119
 but participate in this program 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:04.900
 it's not the part 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.059
 Henrique 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.059
 2007 which is the project 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:10.879
 though 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.699
 began to collect oil from 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:22.439
 he'll look at it to make soap the amount or there was too much - 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.349
 hauer we passed the workshop of the boys of the embrapa 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.219
 in a larger program 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:33.019
 for the production of biodisel, a plant will now be installed. 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.359
 biodisel here in the north region 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.000
 is a pilot plant 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.930
 in partnership with embrapa 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.049
 the federal institute of brasilia and lima terra 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.120
 and let's start making five 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.030
 since then tried at home and has in the kitchen area and wants 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.160
 to transform 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.639
 No one told me you want to do it. 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:53.930
 good 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.490
 to all regional administrations and none 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:04.069
 already has a container for collection from your side so anyone who cares can 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.429
 carry in any kind of 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:10.739
 life is preferable because then it is not a novelty 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.739
 even coming back home 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:17.069
 I'm going to look there 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.320
 no one who 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.919
 have discount on account 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.090
 is what we are already in the final phase of 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.620
 really 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.789
 this new treatment process procedures 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.570
 the eye hand 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.509
 later he 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:36.330
 he 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.900
 one more 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.879
 carol castro e 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:45.520
 treatment is more or less is more expensive so they then 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.979
 Thank you for the information, the contract datafolly here for those who want more 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.420
 program information 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.460
 and you want to participate there by taking risks at home 3 3 4 2 28 8 5
