the<00:05:19.060> same<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:19.510> just<00:05:19.750> don't<00:05:20.200> know<00:05:20.350> why<00:05:20.560> they<00:05:20.740> do

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
the same I just don't know why they do

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.830 
the same I just don't know why they do
that<00:05:20.950> only<00:05:21.550> thing<00:05:22.000> I<00:05:22.060> can<00:05:22.120> think<00:05:22.240> of<00:05:22.570> is<00:05:22.690> to

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
that only thing I can think of is to

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.570 
that only thing I can think of is to
make<00:05:22.990> them<00:05:23.110> thicker<00:05:23.380> but<00:05:24.040> they<00:05:24.190> didn't<00:05:24.490> need

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
make them thicker but they didn't need

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.370 
make them thicker but they didn't need
to<00:05:24.760> be<00:05:24.910> it<00:05:25.300> just<00:05:25.510> lowered<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.900> production

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
to be it just lowered the production

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.350 
to be it just lowered the production
quality<00:05:26.470> the<00:05:27.220> artwork<00:05:27.580> is<00:05:27.700> not<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.000> best<00:05:28.210> but

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
quality the artwork is not the best but

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.600 
quality the artwork is not the best but
it<00:05:28.600> is<00:05:28.720> cute<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.169> rich<00:05:29.470> in<00:05:29.620> detail<00:05:29.740> including

making<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.450> back<00:05:31.600> of<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:31.870> rulebook<00:05:32.229> a<00:05:32.350> map

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
making the back of the rulebook a map

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.800 
making the back of the rulebook a map
