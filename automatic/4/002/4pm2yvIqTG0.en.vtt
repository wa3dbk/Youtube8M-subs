00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.910
 hello to all today we're going 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.099
 follow a tutorial to replace the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.980
 loudspeaker on an iphone 6 so we 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.969
 parlera is used in music mode and 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.590
 in words from a loud speaker well 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.680
 obviously during a call 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.199
 here is the aisle room located just below 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.060
 right of your iphone that's for 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.510
 perform this operation need a kit 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.730
 standard or semi-professional tools 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.170
 lucky of tools recommended by brico phone 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.910
 and of course the speaker 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.559
 if a repair that is very easy it 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.200
 take about 15 minutes and the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.520
 difficulty is noted 2 out of 5 on our 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.180
 website do not forget that you 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.469
 have 10% discount with youtube code 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.239
 continue this tutorial you will need 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.969
 of the boss of the two montages that is 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.670
 offered with your order where we go 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.410
 resume the locations of all 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.070
 cities that we will also remove from 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.750
 small items 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.449
 here you will also see some 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.390
 tips on the back of the eads boss at 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.480
 assembly we will start immediately the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.140
 repair at first well 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.119
 sure we will turn off the iphone here it is 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.369
 mandatory for any good repair 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.200
 obviously the procedure is very simple 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.220
 and we will start by opening the iphone 6 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.950
 it's always the same procedure 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.009
 since the iphone 5 we remove the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.310
 pentalobe currencies noted a1 and a2 on the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.659
 plate of two screwdrivers 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.780
 you can leave side you will have 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.829
 need just at the end when reassembling 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.840
 then we have two methods to open it 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.820
 either with a professional sami tool 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.530
 it's a pair of double suction cups 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.960
 applies on both surfaces of 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.210
 the iphone then we have more than to support 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.250
 on the pliers and that's it open by itself 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.229
 iphone 6 this is very practical 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.670
 it's rather reserved for 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.040
 professionals otherwise in the pack 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.240
 of tools you will find delivered in 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.430
 standard a sucker 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.990
 so there you just have to apply the 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.040
 suction cup above the home button and 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.649
 then with a lever 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.680
 you make the outline of the iphone for 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.579
 eclipsed the screen of the chassis is enough 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.770
 simple one does well the outline not on 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.250
 the world just right on the left and in 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.899
 low 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.760
 and now we will be able to meet 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.920
 the screen so be careful it does not 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.590
 do not raise the screen to more than 90 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.370
 degrees because this one always connected to the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.980
 motherboard the screen tablecloths they 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.810
 are protected by a wafer to a 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.170
 small metal cover that is noted 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.840
 diez 1 so we will unscrew the noted note of 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.000
 b1 to b5 who maintain this plate 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.000
 Metallic screws are cruciform 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.950
 until b5 and then we remove the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.140
 wafer noted diez 1 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.820
 finally we will disconnect the tablecloths 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.800
 the screen to know that two on the iphone 6 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.440
 there are four tablecloths on the screen the tablecloth 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.370
 the home button 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.220
 it's the first one that's all about 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.320
 right 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.590
 then it'll be the tablecloth of the camera 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.900
 before with the proximity sensors and 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.459
 brightness 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.360
 finally the tablecloth of the lcd and the tablecloth 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.620
 touch then used a tool well in 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.209
 plastic 1 to remove these tablecloths 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.620
 especially no metal tool or 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.760
 sharp you could damage the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.340
 motherboard 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.500
 we put the screen block aside and we go 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.209
 now look at the note 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.760
 repair we will unscrew the cash noted 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.799
 dsk which maintained by the f1 and f2 bisses 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.019
 so here we are at the bottom right of 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:40.209
 the iphone here we remove the wafer 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.010
 noted dsk you see there now we see 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:47.860
 well the speaker 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:51.370
 we will disconnect the battery 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:56.820
 dock and finally the small coaxial cable 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.000
 in fact the network cable once we have 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.329
 offline 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.019
 these three layers will be able to withdraw the 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:10.350
 High block external speakers by removing 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.350
 the four vices note 2 h 1 to h4 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.590
 these 4 bis maintain the high block 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.570
 speakers so now we have more than 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.480
 remove with the tweezers the high block 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.050
 speaker he is still there he is held 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.030
 with coaxial cable 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.060
 we have just years of eclipsed the little clip 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.410
 which is on the coaxial cable and 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.610
 now so that you have understood one 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.410
 can pass the party directly 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.600
 reassembly so we'll take our 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:44.419
 new top speakers we will block 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.150
 of course put back in its location 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:50.169
 original 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.430
 first of all we will rectify 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.300
 the metal element that was on the 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.810
 coaxial cable 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.220
 here they are asked it's really very 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.040
 simple as repair is one of 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:09.290
 easier on the iphone 6 we have more than 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:10.850
 to screw it down noted 2 h 1 h 4 then 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.530
 on the video we had removed the vibrator 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.870
 but you did not remove it here is the 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.750
 vibrator reappeared 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.729
 we clip our three tablecloths so the 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.800
 battery the dock connector 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:26.000
 I'm stupid giving back and the 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.220
 coaxial network the battery and finally the 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.190
 little coaxial the network cable this is the 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.270
 more complicated to put back but that 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.530
 presents no difficulties 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.169
 particulars you have to be quite precise 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.610
 for this one you have to hear a 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.610
 little clip that you put it back 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.250
 of course now we are putting the 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:50.620
 wafer noted diez pyatt which is 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.620
 maintained by defects f1 and f2 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.960
 finally we will reconnect the tablecloths 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.830
 the screen so pay attention to 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.930
 screen tablecloths they are 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.350
 relatively fragile especially the 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.130
 connectiques down the tablecloths in question 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.820
 but really there and that connectivity 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.070
 we are in the process of 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.390
 we'll do a little a little topo finally 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.000
 tutorial to explain a little 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.880
 thing compared to the tablecloths of the screen 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:24.690
 for them but on the plate noted 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.690
 with the defects of b1 to b5 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.620
 so we do not accelerate that 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.870
 really represents no difficulty 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.150
 special 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.980
 we re clipping the screen of our iphone in 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.780
 starting with the top and then we 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:42.460
 strongly supports especially around 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:45.970
 the iphone we just have to hand over the 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.470
 vices noted a1 and a2 pentalobe levis so 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.120
 we take our pentalobe screwdriver 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.220

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.200

 report to the tablecloths of the screen if you 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.229
