00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 and there guys who are too news and today 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.970
 show you the jbl sound box 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.970
 extreme 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.980
 good guys there's the canister box 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.449
 of sound 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.910
 You can see that it's sealed. 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.340
 It was very cool, you can also see 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.930
 deep down they have a kind of water and that 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.939
 it means it is water resistant 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.219
 so it's very good for you to take 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.570
 example to the beach or to a 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.969
 where you have a swimming pool where you 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.460
 child playing does not end up looking 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.890
 will not end up breaking the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.629
 sound and here in the lower corner it shows 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.940
 some extra functions that could well that 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.070
 have three can see that it lasts up to 15 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.320
 hours of battery that same 15 hours 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.719
 Direct it also supports the two 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.640
 sbs that it works with the power mode 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.649
 bank so that your cell phone is by 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.680
 For example, the battery is 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.550
 2 plug to the sbt it and so load 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.530
 your cell phone 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.049
 besides, as I already said, it is resistant 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.000
 to the water and another very interesting thing is 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.860
 that if you have another ipod speaker 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.500
 you can see that syncing with it 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.330
 type to use two speakers for one 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.640
 it will be that here on the side the other 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.590
 thing I also found very interesting is 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.790
 which you can easily carry 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.710
 to any corner 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.150
 she comes with extra panties not 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.220
 You can put it there. 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.830
 in case on your shoulder of the sound box 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.270
 then something on there pretty cool since the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.700
 other side of the carton 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.400
 You have there gbl connection is as it already 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.049
 said if you can connect two explains the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.900
 two boxes for a device 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.540
 only then water and also cool 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.790
 and as I said it is splash plouffe that in the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.520
 truth is water resistant is resistant 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.290
 to splashes and here behind the box 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.720
 There's nothing too much about everything I've said. 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.680
 is commenting here behind the box with 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.360
 more details 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.100
 so it's almost there then now 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.060
 Let's go to the important part is that it's the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.560
 boxing 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.159
 of course I have to take this 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.540
 sew here with scissors in hand 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.759
 not alone 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.350
 so it was there and here we can open 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.819
 first take out this plastic alone 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.940
 here boring 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.190
 from time to time it comes out with the box and 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.670
 Here clear that only pull 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.710
 pulls up that part is almost stellar 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.850
 open and now just pull it here 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.770
 practically in this loop and then you can 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.750
 see that there is something that is in front 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.330
 who give a pull with a little strength 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.500
 also arrested 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.160
 I do not want to rip that box too and 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.240
 here it seems that the accessories of the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.120
 explains 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.010
 Let me see until you dropped back here but 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.800
 no problem and here we have the 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.080
 components that come with a sound box 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.060
 We have to let me see what we have. 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.510
 To tell you the truth, we have 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.690
 here is a manual as always important and 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.120
 here I have at least part of the 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.890
 and the sound box and just to have 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.080
 sure we will win 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.300
 something that seems to 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.280
 There is nothing, so let's open this. 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.080
 Other part 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.500
 Let's see what comes with it for sure. 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.200
 have to see the rest of the charger because 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.030
 only a part came and then you can see 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.980
 that has two connectors, depending on the 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.850
 country you live in will need a 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.250
 them and now it's clear in the main 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.040
 where the sound box really is. 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.330
 a little hard to take 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.610
 You can see she left here and it's 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.520
 well, guys, people must have a 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.550
 two pounds is not the sound box 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.770
 more light but remembering that it is super 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.850
 powerful and here we also have to 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.430
 has handle right? 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.010
 you can join in the sound case 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.780
 you want to take it more easily and 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.930
 Now let's get it out of here. 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.480
 here is plastic coating né 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.390
 protection and probably not to 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.610
 scratching does not damage the speaker 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.470
 while it is inside the box 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.210
 and there it almost looks pretty 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.340
 With you, can you see the guys I bought? 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.920
 in blue color, right? 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.170
 but it also has black and 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.630
 Red and here you can see how that 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.190
 it is all right pretty 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.590
 I really liked the size of it too . 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.260
 I think its pretty cool and she's right here. 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.990
 beside 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.030
 You can see that this is the sound 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.250
 stereo on both sides 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.990
 and here from the back we can 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.090
 plug in a micro usb 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.140
 we can plug the cable p 2 né as 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.990
 help 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.730
 We have two usb ports and of course the 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.740
 people have right from the 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.870
 charger to charge the speaker 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.460
 in the upper part we have clear the 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.350
 bluetooth button to turn on the 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.780
 bluetooth and decreases the legal volume 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.350
 Switch off device varies with another box 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.360
 to turn up the volume and pause is the 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.910
 play on some music and now let's 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.440
 do the sound box test I know 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.510
 here youtube you will not know 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.160
 like that quality but at least gives 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.790
 to show you something cool about this 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.790
 speaker 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:28.400
 no man 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:30.110
 and that's it, everybody's base is 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.940
 very very good 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.620
 You're really going to be scared of 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.330
 sound quality that it has a 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.430
 professional quality 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.560
 It's cool too because the box she moves 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.090
 enough at first I thought she 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.220
 could be broken because it was 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.350
 releasing a lot but there were other videos 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.780
 on the internet it is really so then 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.640
 galley is very very good and of course the 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.650
 People have the page to fit the handle 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.900
 both sides to 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.790
 to facilitate this is the 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.620
 and there is the box of punch told his 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.450
 accessories and even né 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.880
 he really really well I liked it 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:05.630
 A lot of it, that's it then guys 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.870
 was the jbl extreme né box of the 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.270
 brand jbl and as always now we are going 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.920
 for the pros and cons in my opinion 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.110
 It's good for me. It has a good design. 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.110
 Nice, I really liked his design. 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.340
 The sound of it guys is high quality 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.450
 mainly the seriousness that is 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.130
 sensational 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.680
 something else that I find very interesting is 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.540
 because it lasts 15 hours of battery life and 15 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.220
 hours for a sound box is very has 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.900
 several other sound boxes that last 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.390
 8 hours 10 hours 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.220
 then 15 hours is really a lot and 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.080
 another thing I did not even expect is that 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.940
 it also doubles as a power bank 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.280
 So you're at the beach have your 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.710
 iphone case and you're with little 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.900
 battery you can plug in it for him 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.730
 It may last a few more hours and now 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.650
 going to the cons a thing that I 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.090
 I do not like it very much because it does not come with 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.440
 no p 2 cable 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.480
 So for example if you do not want to 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.770
 connect with bluetooth and you want to connect 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.450
 with the straight cable 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.850
 you have to have a separate car is 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.710
 especially for p2 on something else 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.690
 That bothers me a little is because he 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.000
 has no protection on the sound output 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.460
 then you end up having the feeling that in 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.050
 part of the buzz that is very fragile and 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.520
 Who's asking me how much I 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.050
 I paid in that box. 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.120
 people did not go to the sound box anymore 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.400
 even because the quality of it is 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.620
 very top but at last I bought in the store 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.240
 of the media markt here in the Netherlands and I 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.280
 I paid 300 euros 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.500
 I know it's very expensive, but I travel 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.320
 I really go out a lot, I go a lot too. 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.420
 to the beach so I always end up missing 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.070
 there a cool little box of 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.200
 to listen in some open corner 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.330
 good staff but that's it who liked the 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.310
 video of that joinha who is not 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.810
 enrolled in the channel click sign up 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.610

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.710
 facebook and do not follow twitter on 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.060
 personal instagram as I live saying here 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.370
 This helps a lot here with the 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.230
 disclosure of the channel I wish for you 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:52.960
 a great week and we'll see you in the 

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.960
 next video here was the voice nelci
