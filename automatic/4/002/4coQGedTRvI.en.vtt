filter water enters through the pipe and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.830 
filter water enters through the pipe and
creates<00:01:04.939> tangential<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.090> swirling<00:01:06.720> motion

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
creates tangential or swirling motion

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.190 
creates tangential or swirling motion
which<00:01:09.090> produces<00:01:10.090> centrifugal<00:01:10.540> force<00:01:10.930> and

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
which produces centrifugal force and

bell siphon back to the floating raft or
something

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.470 

the<00:03:06.530> next<00:03:06.830> part<00:03:07.070> of<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.280> bypass<00:03:08.230> flows

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
the next part of the bypass flows

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.740 
the next part of the bypass flows
through<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:11.690> pipe<00:03:11.990> and<00:03:13.450> enter<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.570> fish

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
through this pipe and enter the fish

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.090 
through this pipe and enter the fish
stock<00:03:15.610> which<00:03:16.610> provides<00:03:17.150> clean<00:03:17.990> water

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
stock which provides clean water

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:26.680 
stock which provides clean water
inhalation<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.760> fish<00:03:25.300> so<00:03:26.300> there<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:26.660> have

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
inhalation to the fish so there you have

inhalation to the fish so there you have
it

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
it

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.430 
it
