tower<00:02:20.640> as<00:02:21.000> my<00:02:21.360> old<00:02:21.569> rig<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.959> full-size<00:02:22.440> tower

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
tower as my old rig is a full-size tower

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.089 
tower as my old rig is a full-size tower
I<00:02:23.130> don't<00:02:23.580> think<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.819> need<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> full-size<00:02:24.569> tower

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
I don't think I need a full-size tower

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.410 
I don't think I need a full-size tower
this<00:02:26.099> will<00:02:26.280> still<00:02:26.610> even<00:02:27.000> what<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.120> want<00:02:27.360> to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
upgrade it to another pestle I

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.330 
upgrade it to another pestle I
configuration<00:02:32.510> we<00:02:33.510> can<00:02:33.690> still<00:02:33.840> do<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:35.040> as

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
configuration we can still do that so as

the motherboard or as you can see it is

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.620 
the motherboard or as you can see it is
the<00:03:42.900> sous<00:03:43.440> x99<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:45.500> five-way<00:03:46.500> optimization<00:03:47.370> ah

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
the sous x99 a five-way optimization ah

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.839 
the sous x99 a five-way optimization ah
so<00:03:48.630> yeah<00:03:48.750> pretty<00:03:49.349> decent<00:03:49.680> motherboard<00:03:50.099> it<00:03:50.639> has

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
so yeah pretty decent motherboard it has
