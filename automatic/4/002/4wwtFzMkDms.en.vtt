large screen form factor of the galaxy
note<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.469> Samsung<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.190> obviously<00:00:44.579> going

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
note and so Samsung is obviously going

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.880 
note and so Samsung is obviously going
to<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.090> another<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.750> them<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.410> Galaxy

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to do another one of them the Galaxy

to do another one of them the Galaxy
Note<00:00:46.920> 2<00:00:47.100> has<00:00:47.550> an<00:00:47.730> even<00:00:47.969> larger<00:00:48.180> screen<00:00:48.750> instead

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
Note 2 has an even larger screen instead

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.160 
Note 2 has an even larger screen instead
of<00:00:49.170> five<00:00:49.680> point<00:00:50.039> three<00:00:50.100> inches<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.910> get<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.170> 5.5

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
of five point three inches we get a 5.5

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.319 
of five point three inches we get a 5.5
inch<00:00:52.469> screen<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.579> here's<00:00:53.820> where<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.300> gets

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
inch screen but here's where it gets

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.049 
inch screen but here's where it gets
interesting<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:55.680> Galaxy<00:00:56.100> Note<00:00:56.129> 2<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.760> less

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
interesting the Galaxy Note 2 is less

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.930 
interesting the Galaxy Note 2 is less
narrow<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.859> bit<00:00:58.980> more<00:00:59.160> tall<00:00:59.430> how<00:00:59.879> do

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
narrow and a little bit more tall how do

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.790 
narrow and a little bit more tall how do
they<00:01:00.180> do<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.420> well<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.170> because<00:01:01.590> they

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
they do that well it's because they

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.939 
they do that well it's because they
change<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.730> screen<00:01:03.059> resolution<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.229> 1280<00:01:04.739> by

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
change the screen resolution to 1280 by

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.840 
change the screen resolution to 1280 by
720<00:01:05.549> instead<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.420> 1280<00:01:07.110> x<00:01:07.380> 800<00:01:07.650> giving<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.729> a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
720 instead of 1280 x 800 giving it a

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.289 
720 instead of 1280 x 800 giving it a
longer<00:01:09.330> 16<00:01:09.930> by<00:01:10.170> 9<00:01:10.380> aspect<00:01:10.670> ratio<00:01:11.670> which<00:01:12.119> will

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
longer 16 by 9 aspect ratio which will

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.670 
longer 16 by 9 aspect ratio which will
be<00:01:12.420> nice<00:01:12.600> when<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.990> watch<00:01:13.140> youtube<00:01:13.650> videos

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
be nice when you watch youtube videos

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.640 
be nice when you watch youtube videos
and<00:01:14.220> other<00:01:14.369> 16<00:01:14.880> by<00:01:15.060> 9<00:01:15.270> content<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:16.200> won't<00:01:16.470> get

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
and other 16 by 9 content you won't get

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.640 
and other 16 by 9 content you won't get
black<00:01:16.950> bars<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.970> galaxy<00:01:18.420> note<00:01:18.450> 2<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.530> that

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
black bars on the galaxy note 2 but that

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.440 
black bars on the galaxy note 2 but that
also<00:01:19.799> means<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> screen<00:01:20.729> density<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
also means that the screen density the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.749 
also means that the screen density the
PPI<00:01:21.840> will<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> little<00:01:22.590> bit<00:01:22.830> lower<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759

original<00:01:24.119> Galaxy<00:01:24.540> Note<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.840> had<00:01:24.990> about<00:01:25.170> 280

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
original Galaxy Note you had about 280

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.160 
original Galaxy Note you had about 280
PPI<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> galaxy<00:01:27.330> note<00:01:27.360> 2<00:01:27.689> you're<00:01:27.960> down

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
PPI and on the galaxy note 2 you're down

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.260 
PPI and on the galaxy note 2 you're down
to<00:01:28.439> about<00:01:29.600> 267<00:01:30.600> 265<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.890> technically<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
to about 267 265 so technically the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.660 
to about 267 265 so technically the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
screen will be slightly less clear but

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.890 
screen will be slightly less clear but
it<00:01:35.759> still<00:01:36.000> should<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.240> quite<00:01:36.450> nice<00:01:36.659> because

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
it still should be quite nice because

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.310 
it still should be quite nice because
it's<00:01:37.200> Super<00:01:37.500> AMOLED<00:01:37.650> HD<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:39.930> no<00:01:40.079> longer

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
it's Super AMOLED HD and it's no longer

it's Super AMOLED HD and it's no longer
pentile<00:01:40.920> which<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> fantastic<00:01:41.689> now<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.899> like

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
pentile which is fantastic now just like

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.050

they have this S Pen

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.470 
they have this S Pen
which<00:02:11.540> did<00:02:11.810> some<00:02:12.230> things<00:02:12.650> but<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.790> its<00:02:14.030> usage

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
which did some things but the its usage

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.990 
which did some things but the its usage
was<00:02:14.630> relatively<00:02:15.290> limited<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:16.280> accuracy<00:02:16.970> of

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
was relatively limited the accuracy of

was relatively limited the accuracy of
the<00:02:17.209> s-pen<00:02:17.690> was<00:02:17.900> never<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.620> amazing<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.430> the

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
the s-pen was never that amazing and the

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.420 
the s-pen was never that amazing and the
use<00:02:20.420> case<00:02:20.690> scenarios<00:02:20.720> really<00:02:21.709> weren't<00:02:22.010> there

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
use case scenarios really weren't there

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.430 
use case scenarios really weren't there
but<00:02:22.910> with<00:02:23.060> galaxy<00:02:23.540> note<00:02:23.690> 2<00:02:23.840> Samsung<00:02:24.319> has

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
but with galaxy note 2 Samsung has

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.960 
but with galaxy note 2 Samsung has
really<00:02:24.650> bumped<00:02:24.980> up<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.130> software<00:02:25.459> which<00:02:25.850> i

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
really bumped up the software which i

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.630 
really bumped up the software which i
think<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.270> going<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.750> be<00:02:26.900> fantastic<00:02:27.640> it's

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
think is going to be fantastic it's

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.910 
think is going to be fantastic it's

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.010 
running on jelly bean Android 4.1 and
it's<00:02:31.160> got<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.340> handful<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:32.030> really<00:02:32.810> cool

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
it's got a handful of really cool

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.660 
it's got a handful of really cool
features<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.740> I<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.250> think<00:02:34.400> will<00:02:34.490> make<00:02:34.610> a

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
features that I just think will make a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.760 
features that I just think will make a
big<00:02:34.880> difference<00:02:34.940> for<00:02:35.690> example<00:02:36.200> little<00:02:36.530> things

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
big difference for example little things

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.949 
big difference for example little things
there's<00:02:37.430> something<00:02:37.670> called<00:02:37.790> pop<00:02:38.090> up<00:02:38.239> note<00:02:38.420> so

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
there's something called pop up note so

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
imagine you are making a phone call and

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.390 
imagine you are making a phone call and
you<00:02:41.239> need<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.540> take<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> note<00:02:42.020> you<00:02:42.709> take<00:02:42.950> out<00:02:43.160> the

stylus on the galaxy note and a little
notepad<00:02:47.360> pops<00:02:47.900> up<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.320> can<00:02:48.440> quickly<00:02:48.680> write

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
also you can draw in a lot more places

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.270 
also you can draw in a lot more places
you<00:03:23.450> can<00:03:23.600> draw<00:03:23.840> right<00:03:24.170> into<00:03:24.500> an<00:03:24.590> EML<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.130> can

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
you can draw right into an EML you can

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.850 
you can draw right into an EML you can

draw right onto your calendar and really

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.160 
draw right onto your calendar and really
take<00:03:28.070> advantage<00:03:28.220> of<00:03:28.700> those<00:03:28.910> natural<00:03:29.390> use<00:03:29.900> case

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
take advantage of those natural use case

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.410 
take advantage of those natural use case
scenarios<00:03:30.200> where<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.280> just<00:03:31.730> want<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.180> write

something down so what do i think about

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.280 
something down so what do i think about
the<00:03:34.519> samsung<00:03:34.730> galaxy<00:03:34.970> note<00:03:35.510> 2<00:03:35.720> I<00:03:35.930> think

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
the samsung galaxy note 2 I think

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.720 
the samsung galaxy note 2 I think
Samsung<00:03:36.739> did<00:03:36.920> exactly<00:03:37.280> what<00:03:37.489> they<00:03:37.610> should

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
Samsung did exactly what they should

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.699 
Samsung did exactly what they should
have<00:03:37.940> done<00:03:38.060> they<00:03:38.510> made<00:03:38.750> something<00:03:39.380> that's

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
have done they made something that's

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.979 
have done they made something that's
great<00:03:40.010> even<00:03:40.370> better<00:03:40.579> by<00:03:40.820> making<00:03:40.970> it<00:03:41.239> faster<00:03:41.480> a

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
great even better by making it faster a

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.930 
great even better by making it faster a
little<00:03:42.440> bit<00:03:42.709> thinner<00:03:42.980> unfortunately<00:03:43.790> it's

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
little bit thinner unfortunately it's

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.150 
little bit thinner unfortunately it's
taller<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:45.049> it's<00:03:45.200> going<00:03:45.410> to<00:03:45.530> be<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.650> little<00:03:45.950> bit

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
taller so it's going to be a little bit

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.620 
taller so it's going to be a little bit
more<00:03:46.310> cumbersome<00:03:46.760> in<00:03:46.880> your<00:03:47.000> pocket<00:03:47.299> than<00:03:47.420> even

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
more cumbersome in your pocket than even

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.210 
more cumbersome in your pocket than even
the<00:03:47.720> original<00:03:48.079> note<00:03:48.230> but<00:03:48.709> most<00:03:48.920> of<00:03:49.100> all

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
the original note but most of all

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.789 
the original note but most of all
they've<00:03:49.489> improved<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.090> software<00:03:50.660> leg<00:03:51.260> should

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
they've improved the software leg should

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.890 
they've improved the software leg should
be<00:03:51.860> gone<00:03:52.160> thanks<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:52.730> jelly<00:03:52.940> bean<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:53.420> the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
be gone thanks to jelly bean and the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.960 
be gone thanks to jelly bean and the
utility<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:54.829> usefulness<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.549> s<00:03:55.700> pen

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
utility and the usefulness of the s pen

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.699 
utility and the usefulness of the s pen
has<00:03:56.360> been<00:03:56.510> dramatically<00:03:57.019> increased<00:03:57.500> because

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
has been dramatically increased because

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.490 
has been dramatically increased because
you<00:03:58.010> can<00:03:58.190> use<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.400> in<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:59.090> lot<00:03:59.390> more<00:03:59.810> places<00:04:00.200> and

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
you can use it in a lot more places and

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.569 
you can use it in a lot more places and
that's<00:04:00.650> really<00:04:00.950> what<00:04:01.130> it<00:04:01.250> should<00:04:01.430> be<00:04:01.459> about

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
that's really what it should be about

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.509 
that's really what it should be about
the<00:04:02.540> Galaxy<00:04:02.959> Note<00:04:02.989> should<00:04:03.440> be<00:04:03.620> about<00:04:03.920> notes

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
the Galaxy Note should be about notes

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.780 
the Galaxy Note should be about notes
and<00:04:04.670> natural<00:04:05.600> interaction<00:04:06.140> and<00:04:06.350> handwriting

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
and natural interaction and handwriting

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.039 
and natural interaction and handwriting
so<00:04:07.790> what<00:04:08.150> do<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:08.299> think<00:04:08.540> about<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.840> samsung
