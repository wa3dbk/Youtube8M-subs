00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
 how are you team today I bring you something 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.640
 different than what we are used to 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.230
 we're going to be looking a bit at echo the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.540
 new champion who manages the time 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.000
 let's start with the passive is called 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.340
 resonance press z every three attacks 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.949
 over the same enemy is going to inflict a 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.500
 extra magic damage and apply slow and if it's 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.779
 about an enemy champion besides that is going to 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.699
 gain movement speed the is 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.010
 which or this passive is very similar to 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.130
 what it does with the state of its raw 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.230
 merz to give an example what is called 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.390
 rewind door of time and it's a kind 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.850
 of boomerang is very similar to the q of 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.100
 cyber is launched in a straight line and then 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.379
 a moment comes back from ccoo doing harm 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.390
 again when hitting enemies with this 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.489
 skill is added a stack of the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.739
 passive one way stack and a stack of 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.960
 turn can lead to a very 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.969
 cute combo applying a basic hit 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.760
 for example to exploit the passive 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.680
 besides this the boomerang puts slow what 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.920
 which makes it even easier to take advantage 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.840
 this combo the w is called convergence 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.270
 parallel has a very passive 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.280
 interesting that your basic attacks are going 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.900
 to inflict additional magic damage to 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.940
 the enemies that are with low 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.830
 so basically what you're going to do 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.530
 A team fight is looking for goals 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.450
 damaged to finish them the active of 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.490
 stability is a kind of bubble 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.470
 that although it takes a long time in 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.510
 explode and cause the effect has 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.490
 very much range and generates vision that 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.200
 It is always very good to exploit the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.480
 bubble the enemies are seen with the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.490
 reduced movement speed but if 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.230
 echo enters the bubble the enemies 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.900
 they are studied and you want a small 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.940
 shield is I think it would be the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.310
 main skill of echo since it has 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.080
 an incredible utility to have so much 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.510
 range you can use it for arrow that 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.550
 Argues to dream the enemy avoid escapes 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.130
 etc 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.320
 lae is called phase jump is a small 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.170
 dash how they have luciano game but then 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.090
 of damaging echo earns an increase in scope 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.220
 in his next basic attack what he 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.970
 allows you to teleport to the target and 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.240
 make him a damage bonus 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.860
 its last and it's called chrono rupture and it's 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.170
 what makes this champion of the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.240
 rest basically on what you can do 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.130
 is to rewind the time back four 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.149
 seconds since this ability is not in 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.940
 cool down you will see a small 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.370
 ghostly following you that shows you your 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.590
 last position four seconds ago if 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.640
 activate the skill at that moment that 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.400
 It's going to be the place where you 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.160
 teleportation rewinding time is 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.750
 a very versatile skill you can use it 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.700
 defensively as well as in a way 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.400
 offensive an example to use it in a 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.380
 defensive could be entering a fight 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.180
 do a lot of damage and before that 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.310
 four seconds pass out 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.040
 squeezing the air since you turn the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.320
 long ago he heals the damage received 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.300
 but in this case I would be losing everything 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.209
 the damage of the last one because when you go back to 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.970
 ghost does terrible area damage 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.010
 to use it offensively you would have 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.870
 to spend 12 more seconds in Latin fight 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.910
 so that your ghost reaches the place 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.400
 where you are fighting to activate your ere 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.190
 cure the damage you have received 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.590
 a lot of damage and keep fighting another 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.960
 offensive way to use it would be you're 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.030
 escaping from a bank of a 30 in line 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.830
 if you do not have the last cool down you 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.450
 ghost should be walking to the side 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.360
 of the enemy and that is the opportunity 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.910
 perfect to turn around and finish it off 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.160
 the surprise factor of this play in what 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.870
 more fun has the champion another of 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.910
 the functions of the last one is to go to 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.040
 base buy everything you need what 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.140
 faster than you can and before 4 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.330
 seconds activate your ere and return to the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.460
 line has an 80-second counter 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.160
 more or less at level 1 so it's not 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.750
 so what is my opinion about him with the 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.490
 comparison of the last champions that 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.650
 they were dating lately as nothing 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.210
 nasir bard for example this I see 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.880
 much better stopped than them when 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.100
 they left if it is true that this is the pp 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.710
 and that changes may arise, let's say in 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.140
 its scale of ap but the mechanics that 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.850
 have the in for example made her a 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.800
 counterattack I write you a study and 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.780
 then he throws himself on you to exploit you 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.300
 I do not see it also to be 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.170
 within the competitive goal but by 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.020
 least for now 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.400
 I like it a lot, it's really fun 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.060
 playing it is something other than what 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.220
 we are used to it 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.930
 if this was like and I hope that there was 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.880
 liked I'll be answering all 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.560
 the messages as always below the 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.660
 video so do not hesitate to leave me your 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.430
 questions or your advice a very welcome 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.510
 big and we're seeing the next 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.510
 voiceover video
