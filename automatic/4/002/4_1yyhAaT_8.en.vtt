00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
about primary and secondary leads and

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.900 
about primary and secondary leads and
really<00:00:08.900> how<00:00:09.049> do<00:00:09.110> you<00:00:09.230> define<00:00:09.500> those<00:00:09.769> a<00:00:10.039> primary

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
really how do you define those a primary

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.000 
really how do you define those a primary
lead<00:00:11.180> is<00:00:11.389> the<00:00:11.450> initial<00:00:12.200> lead<00:00:12.379> you<00:00:12.559> take<00:00:12.770> off

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
lead is the initial lead you take off

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.799 
lead is the initial lead you take off
first<00:00:13.279> base<00:00:13.520> while<00:00:14.059> the<00:00:14.090> pitcher<00:00:14.480> has<00:00:14.629> the

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
first base while the pitcher has the

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.599 
first base while the pitcher has the
ball<00:00:14.959> and<00:00:15.170> he's<00:00:15.320> holding<00:00:15.559> you<00:00:15.680> on<00:00:15.830> that's<00:00:16.460> what

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
ball and he's holding you on that's what

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.519 
ball and he's holding you on that's what
a<00:00:16.640> base<00:00:16.820> stealer<00:00:17.090> will<00:00:17.300> get<00:00:17.539> to<00:00:17.869> when<00:00:18.439> he's

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
a base stealer will get to when he's

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.470 
a base stealer will get to when he's
thinking<00:00:18.680> about<00:00:18.980> stealing<00:00:19.189> base<00:00:19.490> a<00:00:19.760> secondary

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
thinking about stealing base a secondary

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.720 
thinking about stealing base a secondary
lead<00:00:20.720> is<00:00:20.960> after<00:00:21.710> the<00:00:21.800> pitcher<00:00:22.100> picks<00:00:22.370> his<00:00:22.520> leg

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
lead is after the pitcher picks his leg

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.820 
lead is after the pitcher picks his leg
up<00:00:22.760> to<00:00:23.030> go<00:00:23.150> to<00:00:23.180> home<00:00:23.450> it's<00:00:23.810> that<00:00:24.260> it's<00:00:24.680> that

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
up to go to home it's that it's that

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.580 
up to go to home it's that it's that
amount<00:00:25.190> of<00:00:25.340> ground<00:00:26.030> that<00:00:26.240> you<00:00:26.360> gain<00:00:26.690> while<00:00:27.440> the

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
amount of ground that you gain while the

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.140 
amount of ground that you gain while the
ball<00:00:27.740> is<00:00:27.860> going<00:00:28.039> to<00:00:28.250> home<00:00:28.369> plate<00:00:28.640> so<00:00:28.970> you<00:00:29.060> can

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
ball is going to home plate so you can

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.400 
ball is going to home plate so you can
get<00:00:29.270> a<00:00:29.300> good<00:00:29.480> jump<00:00:29.660> to<00:00:29.810> go<00:00:29.900> to<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.050> next<00:00:30.260> base

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
get a good jump to go to the next base

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.049 
get a good jump to go to the next base
and<00:00:30.920> this<00:00:31.010> primary<00:00:31.460> lead<00:00:31.610> is<00:00:31.699> going<00:00:31.760> to<00:00:31.880> be<00:00:31.970> our

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
and this primary lead is going to be our

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.910 
and this primary lead is going to be our
first<00:00:32.270> base<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:32.870> if<00:00:33.050> you<00:00:33.140> notice<00:00:33.440> I'm<00:00:33.590> starting

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
first base so if you notice I'm starting

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.619 
first base so if you notice I'm starting
on<00:00:33.949> the<00:00:34.010> back<00:00:34.280> corner<00:00:34.699> furthest<00:00:35.359> away<00:00:35.480> from

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
on the back corner furthest away from

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.660 
on the back corner furthest away from
the<00:00:35.930> pitcher<00:00:36.289> now<00:00:36.800> I<00:00:36.829> know<00:00:37.100> what<00:00:37.340> they<00:00:37.460> say

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
the pitcher now I know what they say

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.130 
the pitcher now I know what they say
about<00:00:37.700> never<00:00:38.180> cross<00:00:38.510> your<00:00:38.750> feet<00:00:38.870> when<00:00:39.050> you're

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
about never cross your feet when you're

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.350 
about never cross your feet when you're
taking<00:00:39.470> leads<00:00:39.710> but<00:00:39.980> I<00:00:40.190> believe<00:00:40.790> if<00:00:40.940> I<00:00:41.060> want<00:00:41.270> to

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
taking leads but I believe if I want to

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.479 
taking leads but I believe if I want to
get<00:00:41.480> my<00:00:41.660> safe<00:00:41.989> distance<00:00:42.590> I'm<00:00:43.010> going<00:00:43.220> to<00:00:43.280> take<00:00:43.460> a

get my safe distance I'm going to take a

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.299 
get my safe distance I'm going to take a
step<00:00:43.910> with<00:00:44.690> my<00:00:44.840> right<00:00:44.870> foot<00:00:45.050> I<00:00:45.500> can<00:00:45.680> cross<00:00:46.100> over

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
step with my right foot I can cross over

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.040

keep<00:00:46.640> my<00:00:46.820> eye<00:00:46.850> on<00:00:46.970> the<00:00:47.210> pitcher<00:00:47.510> he's<00:00:47.870> not

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
keep my eye on the pitcher he's not

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
position this is roughly a two and a

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.250 
position this is roughly a two and a
half<00:00:54.860> step<00:00:55.160> lead<00:00:55.460> okay<00:00:56.270> where<00:00:56.540> I<00:00:56.570> feel<00:00:56.930> pretty

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
half step lead okay where I feel pretty

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.650 
half step lead okay where I feel pretty
safe<00:00:57.590> if<00:00:57.860> it's<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.550> big<00:00:58.760> slow<00:00:59.030> guy<00:00:59.210> on<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.510> hill

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
safe if it's a big slow guy on the hill

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.540 
safe if it's a big slow guy on the hill
I<00:00:59.870> might<00:01:00.170> get<00:01:00.290> a<00:01:00.350> little<00:01:00.410> bit<00:01:00.649> more<00:01:00.829> if<00:01:01.100> it's<00:01:01.460> a

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
I might get a little bit more if it's a

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.100 
I might get a little bit more if it's a
lefty<00:01:01.910> with<00:01:02.059> a<00:01:02.090> quick<00:01:02.300> move<00:01:02.510> I<00:01:02.660> might<00:01:02.870> shrink

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
lefty with a quick move I might shrink

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.869 
lefty with a quick move I might shrink
it<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:03.379> little<00:01:03.530> bit<00:01:03.739> so<00:01:04.189> once<00:01:04.369> again<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.729> reason

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
it a little bit so once again the reason

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.490 
it a little bit so once again the reason
why<00:01:05.089> I'm<00:01:05.210> coming<00:01:05.449> off<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.689> back<00:01:05.869> corner<00:01:06.289> too

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
why I'm coming off the back corner too

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.450 
why I'm coming off the back corner too
with<00:01:07.070> this<00:01:07.219> one<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:08.440> boom<00:01:09.440> is<00:01:09.770> because<00:01:10.250> when<00:01:10.400> I

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
with this one to boom is because when I

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.580 
with this one to boom is because when I
go<00:01:10.640> back<00:01:10.909> to<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.299> base<00:01:11.450> on<00:01:11.630> a<00:01:11.690> pickoff<00:01:12.080> attempt

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
go back to the base on a pickoff attempt

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.590 
go back to the base on a pickoff attempt
if<00:01:13.040> I<00:01:13.220> come<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.700> back<00:01:13.909> part<00:01:14.150> of<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:14.420> base

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
if I come to the back part of the base

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.780 
if I come to the back part of the base
that's<00:01:15.200> where<00:01:15.440> I<00:01:15.470> came<00:01:15.590> off<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:15.950> that's<00:01:16.520> the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
that's where I came off of that's the

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.490 
that's where I came off of that's the
furthest<00:01:17.150> distance<00:01:17.180> this<00:01:17.690> first<00:01:17.960> baseman<00:01:18.380> has

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
furthest distance this first baseman has

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.250 
furthest distance this first baseman has
to<00:01:19.010> swipe<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.520> tag<00:01:19.729> me<00:01:19.939> out<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:21.020> was<00:01:21.170> the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
to swipe to tag me out so that was the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.460 
to swipe to tag me out so that was the
primary<00:01:21.470> lead<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.520> secondary<00:01:23.240> lead<00:01:23.570> since<00:01:24.320> I

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
primary lead a secondary lead since I

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.109 
primary lead a secondary lead since I
wasn't<00:01:24.740> someone<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.490> was<00:01:25.580> asked<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:25.939> steal

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
wasn't someone that was asked to steal

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.539 
wasn't someone that was asked to steal
bases<00:01:26.330> very<00:01:26.689> often<00:01:27.110> got<00:01:27.890> very<00:01:28.100> few<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:28.430> my

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
bases very often got very few in my

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.320 
big-league career I specialized and
really<00:01:31.040> thought<00:01:31.250> about<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.640> secondary<00:01:32.060> lead

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
really thought about the secondary lead

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.359 
really thought about the secondary lead
I<00:01:32.510> wanted<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:32.990> get<00:01:33.080> a<00:01:33.110> good<00:01:33.439> jump<00:01:33.740> on<00:01:34.159> any

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
I wanted to get a good jump on any

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:35.800 
I wanted to get a good jump on any
ground<00:01:34.640> ball<00:01:34.759> I<00:01:35.119> want<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.479> be<00:01:35.540> able<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.750> go

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
ground ball I want to be able to go

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.960 
ground ball I want to be able to go
first<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.229> third<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:36.979> secondary<00:01:37.460> lead<00:01:37.759> is

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
first a third so a secondary lead is

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.490 
first a third so a secondary lead is
your<00:01:38.210> starting<00:01:38.509> out<00:01:38.630> of<00:01:38.720> your<00:01:38.810> primary<00:01:39.259> and

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
your starting out of your primary and

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.800 
your starting out of your primary and
when<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.250> pitcher<00:01:40.520> picks<00:01:40.729> up<00:01:40.909> his<00:01:41.030> foot<00:01:41.299> I'm

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
when the pitcher picks up his foot I'm

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.980 
when the pitcher picks up his foot I'm
timing<00:01:42.350> my<00:01:42.560> three<00:01:43.189> hops<00:01:43.490> as<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:44.689> ball

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
timing my three hops as the ball

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.690 
timing my three hops as the ball
approaches<00:01:45.560> home<00:01:45.979> plate<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:46.520> looks

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
approaches home plate so it looks

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.230 
approaches home plate so it looks
something<00:01:46.909> like<00:01:47.030> this<00:01:47.329> 1<00:01:48.020> 2<00:01:48.430> 3<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.759> the

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
something like this 1 2 3 and the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.760 
something like this 1 2 3 and the
important<00:01:50.630> part<00:01:50.720> about<00:01:50.960> this<00:01:51.170> is<00:01:51.380> on<00:01:51.590> your

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
important part about this is on your

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.920 
important part about this is on your
third<00:01:52.070> hop<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.970> need<00:01:53.150> to<00:01:53.240> be<00:01:53.329> coming<00:01:53.689> down<00:01:53.869> on

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
third hop you need to be coming down on

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.960 
third hop you need to be coming down on
your<00:01:54.350> right<00:01:54.530> foot<00:01:54.890> if<00:01:55.100> your<00:01:55.460> timing<00:01:55.880> is

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
your right foot if your timing is

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.359 
your right foot if your timing is
perfect<00:01:56.470> right<00:01:57.470> there<00:01:57.500> when<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.130> ball<00:01:58.310> is

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
perfect right there when the ball is

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.880 
perfect right there when the ball is
getting<00:01:59.000> into<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.360> hitting<00:01:59.540> zone<00:01:59.689> so<00:02:00.439> as<00:02:00.649> you

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
getting into the hitting zone so as you

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.639 
getting into the hitting zone so as you
come<00:02:01.070> down<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:02.000> can<00:02:02.210> read<00:02:02.570> what<00:02:03.110> happens<00:02:03.470> if

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
come down you can read what happens if

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.200 
come down you can read what happens if
it's<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:03.829> ground<00:02:04.040> ball<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:04.549> keep<00:02:05.060> your

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
it's a ground ball you keep your

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.210 
it's a ground ball you keep your
momentum<00:02:05.360> going<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.899> second<00:02:06.229> base<00:02:06.350> if<00:02:06.950> it's<00:02:07.159> a

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
momentum going to second base if it's a

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.399 
momentum going to second base if it's a
swing<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.610> miss<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:08.329> got<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.569> stop<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.110> get

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 
swing and miss you got to stop and get

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.530 
swing and miss you got to stop and get
back<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:09.799> first<00:02:09.979> base<00:02:10.099> really<00:02:10.519> quickly<00:02:10.879> so<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
back to first base really quickly so the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.929 
back to first base really quickly so the
key<00:02:11.720> here<00:02:11.959> is<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.469> time<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.919> pitcher<00:02:13.249> get

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
key here is the time the pitcher get

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.610 
key here is the time the pitcher get
your<00:02:14.090> momentum<00:02:14.480> going<00:02:14.749> towards<00:02:15.109> second<00:02:15.590> base

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
your momentum going towards second base

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.800 
your momentum going towards second base
in<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.400> form<00:02:16.639> of<00:02:16.730> three<00:02:16.939> hops<00:02:17.120> and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
in the form of three hops and

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.750 
in the form of three hops and
hopefully<00:02:18.170> you'll<00:02:18.290> time<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.709> perfectly<00:02:19.130> so

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
hopefully you'll time it perfectly so

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.280 
hopefully you'll time it perfectly so
when<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.970> ball<00:02:20.150> is<00:02:20.180> hit<00:02:20.330> when<00:02:20.750> contact<00:02:21.200> is

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
when the ball is hit when contact is

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.880 
when the ball is hit when contact is
made<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:22.130> can<00:02:22.160> go<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.489> second<00:02:22.849> base
