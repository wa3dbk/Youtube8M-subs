launched this product about about three

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.050 
launched this product about about three
and<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.799> half<00:01:29.920> years<00:01:30.159> ago<00:01:30.460> for<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.700> motorhome

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
and a half years ago for the motorhome

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.810 
and a half years ago for the motorhome
industry<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.810> it's<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.130> largest<00:01:33.490> bore

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
industry and it's it's the largest bore

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.149 
industry and it's it's the largest bore
shock<00:01:34.150> absorber<00:01:34.630> available<00:01:35.170> now<00:01:35.799> what<00:01:35.950> is<00:01:36.040> the

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
shock absorber available now what is the

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.620 
shock absorber available now what is the
actual<00:01:36.460> diameter<00:01:36.580> of<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.030> bore<00:01:37.240> this<00:01:37.450> is<00:01:37.600> a

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
actual diameter of the bore this is a

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.050 
actual diameter of the bore this is a
two<00:01:37.900> and<00:01:38.049> five-sixteenths<00:01:38.770> more<00:01:39.010> 2<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.460> 5/16

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
two and five-sixteenths more 2 and 5/16

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.510 
two and five-sixteenths more 2 and 5/16
inches<00:01:40.270> that's<00:01:40.450> available<00:01:40.780> typically<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:42.070> lot

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
inches that's available typically a lot

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.550 
inches that's available typically a lot
of<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.700> shock<00:01:42.909> absorbers<00:01:43.360> will<00:01:43.479> have<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:43.659> 1.5

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
of the shock absorbers will have a 1.5

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.740 
of the shock absorbers will have a 1.5
inch<00:01:45.280> bore<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:45.909> so<00:01:46.060> we're<00:01:46.180> about<00:01:46.330> two<00:01:46.510> hundred

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
inch bore and so we're about two hundred

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.140 
inch bore and so we're about two hundred
seventy<00:01:47.080> two<00:01:47.229> percent<00:01:47.409> more<00:01:48.040> piston<00:01:48.580> surfaces

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
seventy two percent more piston surfaces

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.940 
seventy two percent more piston surfaces
now<00:01:49.720> what's<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.049> advantage<00:01:50.290> of<00:01:50.619> having<00:01:50.740> a

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
now what's the advantage of having a

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.740 
now what's the advantage of having a
larger<00:01:51.310> piston<00:01:51.700> piston<00:01:51.970> surface<00:01:52.479> well<00:01:52.630> when

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
larger piston piston surface well when

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.840 
larger piston piston surface well when
you<00:01:52.840> take<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.080> small<00:01:53.470> bore<00:01:53.740> shock<00:01:54.430> absorber

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
you take a small bore shock absorber

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.429 
you take a small bore shock absorber
that<00:01:54.970> was<00:01:55.090> maybe<00:01:55.299> originally<00:01:55.840> designed<00:01:56.170> for<00:01:56.320> a

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
that was maybe originally designed for a

that was maybe originally designed for a
passenger<00:01:56.950> car<00:01:57.189> or<00:01:57.400> a<00:01:57.460> pickup<00:01:57.790> truck<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.299> used

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
passenger car or a pickup truck and used

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.469 
passenger car or a pickup truck and used
try<00:01:58.869> and<00:01:59.110> put<00:01:59.830> enough<00:02:00.220> force<00:02:00.549> in<00:02:01.000> it<00:02:01.180> to<00:02:01.330> work

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
try and put enough force in it to work

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.120 
try and put enough force in it to work
for<00:02:01.659> these<00:02:01.750> heavy<00:02:01.990> motor<00:02:02.260> homes<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:02.860> you

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
for these heavy motor homes you you

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.250 
for these heavy motor homes you you
start<00:02:03.400> creating<00:02:03.670> huge<00:02:04.360> internal<00:02:04.840> pressures

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
start creating huge internal pressures

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.219 
start creating huge internal pressures
right<00:02:05.950> here<00:02:06.189> okay<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:06.759> so<00:02:06.939> that<00:02:07.240> shock

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
right here okay and so that shock

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.630 
right here okay and so that shock
observer<00:02:08.560> will<00:02:08.679> be<00:02:08.709> working<00:02:09.160> three<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.459> four

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
observer will be working three to four

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.400 
observer will be working three to four
times<00:02:09.790> harder<00:02:10.299> than<00:02:10.479> this<00:02:10.630> woman<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.260> as<00:02:11.380> a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
times harder than this woman and as a

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.699 
times harder than this woman and as a
result<00:02:12.010> they<00:02:12.580> don't<00:02:12.820> produce<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.709> forces

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
result they don't produce the forces

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.410 
result they don't produce the forces
that<00:02:14.739> we'd<00:02:15.010> like<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.280> see<00:02:15.519> in<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.360> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
that we'd like to see in the in the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.900 
that we'd like to see in the in the
forces<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.989> motorhome<00:02:17.410> requires<00:02:18.130> and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
forces that the motorhome requires and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.550 
forces that the motorhome requires and
they<00:02:19.060> wear<00:02:19.299> out<00:02:19.329> quite<00:02:19.750> quickly<00:02:20.049> and<00:02:20.380> then

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
they wear out quite quickly and then

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.740 
they wear out quite quickly and then
you're<00:02:20.680> working<00:02:20.829> on<00:02:21.100> so<00:02:21.280> hard<00:02:21.329> this<00:02:22.329> is<00:02:22.480> an<00:02:22.600> all

a mechanical standpoint well yeah it

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.290 
a mechanical standpoint well yeah it
doesn't<00:02:38.980> cost<00:02:39.130> much<00:02:39.400> more<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.790> make<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.060> pretty

doesn't cost much more to make it pretty

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.570 
doesn't cost much more to make it pretty
yeah<00:02:40.630> yeah<00:02:41.170> but<00:02:41.440> we<00:02:41.650> use<00:02:41.860> features<00:02:42.400> like

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
yeah yeah but we use features like

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.730 
yeah yeah but we use features like
spherical<00:02:43.150> bearing<00:02:43.480> mounting<00:02:43.990> instead<00:02:44.620> of

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
spherical bearing mounting instead of

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.460 
spherical bearing mounting instead of
rubber<00:02:44.920> bushings<00:02:45.690> like<00:02:46.690> most<00:02:46.900> shock<00:02:47.080> absorber

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
rubber bushings like most shock absorber

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.450 
rubber bushings like most shock absorber
manufacturers<00:02:48.100> use<00:02:49.380> we<00:02:50.380> have<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.590> nitrogen<00:02:50.950> gas

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
manufacturers use we have a nitrogen gas

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.850 
manufacturers use we have a nitrogen gas
this<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.570> mono<00:02:52.870> tube<00:02:53.200> design<00:02:53.590> with<00:02:53.830> a

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
this is a mono tube design with a

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.700 
this is a mono tube design with a
nitrogen<00:02:54.190> gas<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:55.780> separated<00:02:56.410> from<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.680> oil

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
nitrogen gas is separated from the oil

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.570 
nitrogen gas is separated from the oil
this<00:02:57.550> is<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> floating<00:02:58.060> piston<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:59.680> chef<00:03:00.010> if

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
this is the floating piston this chef if

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.160 
this is the floating piston this chef if
you<00:03:00.790> were<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.030> fill<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.360> shock<00:03:01.630> full<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:01.990> oil

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
you were to fill the shock full of oil

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.920 
you were to fill the shock full of oil
and<00:03:02.560> try<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.280> push<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.700> shaft<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.690> would<00:03:04.810> be

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
and try to push the shaft in it would be

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.360 
and try to push the shaft in it would be
a<00:03:04.960> hydraulic<00:03:05.500> lock<00:03:05.710> because<00:03:05.950> this<00:03:06.100> just

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
a hydraulic lock because this just

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.270 
a hydraulic lock because this just
displaces<00:03:07.060> volume<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:08.110> this<00:03:08.320> gas<00:03:08.650> piston<00:03:09.130> is

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
displaces volume so this gas piston is

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.750 
displaces volume so this gas piston is
following<00:03:09.670> this<00:03:10.590> yeah<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.890> what<00:03:12.250> we<00:03:12.370> want<00:03:12.640> to

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
following this yeah and what we want to

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.330 
following this yeah and what we want to
do<00:03:12.910> is<00:03:13.210> have<00:03:13.510> pure<00:03:14.050> oil<00:03:14.320> going<00:03:14.980> through<00:03:15.190> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
do is have pure oil going through the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.160 
do is have pure oil going through the
valving<00:03:15.730> we<00:03:16.000> want<00:03:16.240> no<00:03:16.390> air<00:03:16.630> mixed<00:03:16.990> with<00:03:17.140> a

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
valving we want no air mixed with a

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.170 
valving we want no air mixed with a
foaming<00:03:18.130> running<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.460> right<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.870> this

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
foaming running the right this this

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.420 
foaming running the right this this
piston<00:03:22.180> design<00:03:22.360> we<00:03:22.810> use<00:03:22.990> a<00:03:23.020> Teflon<00:03:23.860> bronze

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
piston design we use a Teflon bronze

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.930 
piston design we use a Teflon bronze
impregnated<00:03:25.180> wear<00:03:25.390> band<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:26.730> behind<00:03:27.730> the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
impregnated wear band and behind the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.240 
impregnated wear band and behind the
wear<00:03:28.090> band<00:03:28.360> we've<00:03:28.860> developed<00:03:29.860> this<00:03:29.980> o-ring

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
wear band we've developed this o-ring

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.640 
wear band we've developed this o-ring
and<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:32.500> wear<00:03:32.740> band<00:03:33.010> will<00:03:33.280> wear<00:03:34.590> about<00:03:35.590> a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
and so this wear band will wear about a

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.590 
and so this wear band will wear about a
thousandth<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.310> an<00:03:36.430> inch<00:03:36.520> every<00:03:36.790> 100,000

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
thousandth of an inch every 100,000

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.720 
thousandth of an inch every 100,000
miles<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:38.380> oil<00:03:38.590> ring<00:03:38.830> is<00:03:39.130> pushing<00:03:39.550> out

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
miles and this oil ring is pushing out

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.940 
miles and this oil ring is pushing out
on<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.090> compensating<00:03:40.810> for<00:03:40.960> that<00:03:41.020> wear<00:03:41.350> so<00:03:41.770> as

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
on it compensating for that wear so as

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.980 
on it compensating for that wear so as
it<00:03:42.220> wears<00:03:42.430> it's<00:03:42.670> actually<00:03:42.970> compensating<00:03:43.750> for

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
it wears it's actually compensating for

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.080 
it wears it's actually compensating for
the<00:03:44.170> wear<00:03:44.350> automatically<00:03:45.190> that's<00:03:45.310> right<00:03:45.640> Wow

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
the wear automatically that's right Wow

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.330 
the wear automatically that's right Wow
