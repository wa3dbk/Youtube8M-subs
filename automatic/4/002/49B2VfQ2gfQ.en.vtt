Ministry of Arts and Culture

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.200
Our studio is highlighted
by worthy guests. 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.360
A melting pot of cultures,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.560
resulting from the meeting
between La Batook,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.080
and the band Kalyanga.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.440
Let's welcome our guests&nbsp;from France !

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.000
Well, it requires a deep breath !

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.920
I felt a little sad, now Iâ€™m ok. 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.920
Alright Kalyanga,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.680
Where are they ?
Who wants to speak ?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.040
And the Trumpet will be blown !
