 present on the market since 1959 it was born in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.619
 britain right from the idea of truth there is 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.869
 from which your company takes its name from 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.809
 several years now in Italy 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.390

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.680

 you will find the reviews inside the 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.820
 my blog 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.680
 the two shampoo and hair products 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.800
 defined curly balm that I loved 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.110
 the code for for eventually 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.460
 buy it because interested in the 70 50 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:58.290
 31 70 57 16 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:00.510
 so I repeat 70 50 31 70 57 16 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.530
 I from the first applications if not 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.330
 already from the first I had some results 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.290
 very pleasant I have a fine hat 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.420
 so many new and a nice kinky curly then 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.870
 almost practically untamable I tried 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.880
 a thousand products but probably this 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.100
 it is the first one I really find myself with 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.910
 good because end to the first application 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.220
 the hair is soft and light 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.390
 untangling even in the shower 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.700
 drying the hedgehog slowly takes over 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.150
 forms the application frizz afterwards 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.030
 application practically disappears 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.580
 the curl is started 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.130
 an aspect that remains is defined as full-bodied 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.890
 even after days and hair turns out 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.630
 shiny and nourished polite also 2 after 2 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.200
 3 days after washing 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.709
 I play sports every day in the south 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.690
 in the scalp and I tend to wash them 2 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.780
 bar three times a week 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.360
 in the summer three times so what 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.850
 I'm telling you why I tried it and ne 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.440
 I was extremely satisfied 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.290
 these three products would be from 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.470
 add the modeling spray to her 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.750
 light texture defines long in i 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.519
 hedgehogs that will be more resistant 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.850
 humidity would be the ripple 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.260
 ideal for me to complete the line 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.620
 in fact it is a product that I have to 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.419
 buy from departure to get won 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.550

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.039
 amazement and tiredness 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.960
 I have loved worshiping this 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.990
 product because in reality it is from few 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.740
 weeks that I'm using it though 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.690
 I already see the differences I have to work and 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.460
 take care of my feet a little less 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.949

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:12.569
 with this product slowly to 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:16.409
 dry skin is diminishing I don't have 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:18.659
 particular foot problems if not point 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.699
 to the creation of dry skin on the cut 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:23.219
 on the heel on the flag because of the 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:26.219
 my work and the shoes I use 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:28.680

 perfume this intoxicating scent of 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.719
 lavender that reminds me of the expanses I have 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:39.180
 so I saw it in Provence years ago 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:39.840
 really lasted this product is also 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.370
 this will be 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.910
 one of those purchases when 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.639

 own creams or hair products e 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.419
 I must say that thanks to prostheses or 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.479
