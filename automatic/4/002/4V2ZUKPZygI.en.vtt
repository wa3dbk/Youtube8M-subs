00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
low and strike of a war end with that

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.670 
low and strike of a war end with that
goal<00:02:57.519> what<00:02:58.269> about<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.780> for<00:02:59.050> a<00:02:59.140> strike<00:02:59.350> I'm

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
goal what about that for a strike I'm

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.100 
goal what about that for a strike I'm
gonna<00:02:59.769> give<00:02:59.980> him<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.220> 7<00:03:00.610> out<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.790> 10<00:03:01.060> from<00:03:01.570> my<00:03:01.750> my
