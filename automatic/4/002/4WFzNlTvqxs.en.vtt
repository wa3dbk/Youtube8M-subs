 here we cheerfully go around that is restaurant if that has a few weeks 

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:19.660
 has already suffered a lot in refusing 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.249
 ps of the week 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.580
 about the slaughter of a number of pigs that they have 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.579
 the game was missed behind the restaurant 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.359
 and when the opta put down for this it was natural 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.560
 free-range pigs 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.800
 because they are on the stock exchange 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.749
 and if pre-sale happens the stock market is eaten 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:37.690
 have to pay 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.610
 drunk consciously 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.140
 today there is a tasting 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.710

 6 and that stands in front of the schoolyard for the fourth season and works at nec 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.859
 without fertilizer without herbicides 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.019
 without blaming m also with less debt 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.100
 orange there is nothing 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.270
 but little with the tabloids 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.190
 the cabinet plans 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.880
 hollywood those aren't too 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.460
 an easy few 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.739
 is not everyone's friend 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.670
 anyway 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.700
 what a little true a million euros of fruit 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.600
 after a nice wines 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.710
 that's with the savannah 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.899
 women we make 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.899
 very nice to be able to fully complete my very small audience 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.830
 the shoulder congo you will but unfortunately 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.850
 read it here 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.370
 does not come across too often anyway 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.500
 very often there is a commercial you can imagine as young talents 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.200
 this became commercial for us to drink 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.870
 that you think of this 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.870
 justice in johannesburg 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 it makes me all think well because there is just that 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.740
 it won't 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.650
 Since we have a new type of bucket reaal fund, this may also be officially 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.650
 only be released at the Thursday's place 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.600
 but the Beaujolais scoop on my position 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.350

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.350
 I'm going to have a look at flames at michiel 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.259

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:16.369
 the south tribune illegal merchandiser anp but also during the competition 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.959

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.959

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:26.259

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.259
