don't have to knead it or anything you
just<00:03:07.550> eat<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.670> with<00:03:08.820> your<00:03:08.940> fingers

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:05:00.880 

and<00:04:37.669> that's<00:04:37.880> going<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.240> do<00:04:59.590> even<00:05:00.590> though<00:05:00.710> these

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
and that's going to do even though these

and that's going to do even though these
are<00:05:00.950> nonstick<00:05:01.490> I'm<00:05:01.820> still<00:05:02.060> going<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.270> al<00:05:02.450> them

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
are nonstick I'm still going to al them

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:36.490 
are nonstick I'm still going to al them
you<00:05:03.290> never<00:05:03.500> know<00:05:03.710> I<00:05:03.980> mean<00:05:04.880> I<00:05:04.910> don't<00:05:05.240> know

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:52.640 

I'll<00:05:37.500> them<00:05:37.710> and<00:05:37.980> then<00:05:38.270> you<00:05:39.270> flower<00:05:39.660> them

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:07.029 

you<00:05:53.520> can<00:05:53.669> also<00:05:53.850> use<00:05:54.000> some<00:05:54.330> of<00:05:54.870> it<00:05:54.960> up<00:05:55.110> just<00:05:55.290> use

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
so now i'm going to divide it between

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:38.000 
so now i'm going to divide it between
the<00:06:09.690> two<00:06:10.080> tents<00:06:11.180> i'm<00:06:12.180> not<00:06:12.330> quite<00:06:12.600> sure

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.680 

once<00:06:39.010> instead<00:06:39.310> of<00:06:39.460> tens<00:06:39.730> you<00:06:40.030> just<00:06:40.270> dust<00:06:40.510> it

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
once instead of tens you just dust it

00:06:40.690 --> 00:07:00.170 
once instead of tens you just dust it
with<00:06:40.720> a<00:06:40.900> little<00:06:41.050> bit<00:06:41.200> more<00:06:41.440> flour

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.700 

go<00:07:02.370> now<00:07:03.370> you're<00:07:03.610> going<00:07:03.729> to<00:07:03.820> let<00:07:04.000> this<00:07:04.240> proved

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
go now you're going to let this proved

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.010 
go now you're going to let this proved
for<00:07:05.710> three<00:07:06.220> to<00:07:06.340> five<00:07:06.520> hours<00:07:06.880> basically<00:07:07.479> what
