00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.699
 about a dlc that under my point of view 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.269
 I want it to be something it's nothing 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.880
 confirmed or anything that has leaked 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.770
 just something that I would like it to be 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.039
 put rockstar and something that may 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.590
 It reaches and is set to go online 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.180
 what comes to being as antón north 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.910
 the snowy city as you see here I have 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.649
 my snowy car all snowy I'm going to 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.840
 put it starts to snow and everything like 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.179
 you are going to see and the truth guys is a 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.370
 site that I like very much to go 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:54.589
 many times that entered gta as well as me 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.879
 I love the snow I get there I'm going 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.829
 I put the snow 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.829
 I put that I put a put that starts 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.690
 to snow and I love being out there 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.189
 it's a place that I'm pretty cool 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.690
 leave in the comments you guys 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.090
 would molar the idea that he put 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.640
 a dlc I would love for them to give me a 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.230
 dlc especially from north antón because it is 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.150
 something weird something that is not there in the rest 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.730
 of the map that is snow and molaría that in 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.140
 some place or also for example put 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.510
 snow in the chile hill since it is a 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.880
 mountain then the highest there is 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.070
 put snow on the top or somewhere with 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.960
 snow vale molaría much that norte antón 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.230
 was activated is worth in a next 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.140
 dlc either in exc no of the gene is worth but 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.610
 I do not care whether I care or much 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.830
 that they would take them out I would like very much 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.840
 it's one of the things I've been carrying the most 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.910
 waiting as I told you before 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.760
 go up gta 5 and I'm still waiting for 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.910
 broken of some information some photo 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.730
 confirm that you can confirm that 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.220
 go out north where in some 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.250
 next update of gta 5 online 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.570
 because they will continue to update surely 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.700
 and the truth is something very interesting 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.979
 maybe winning so much because we could 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.080
 find many mysteries you see here 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.180
 for example where I am right now 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.759
 I'm getting good, I just got out of the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.480
 bank you des start the tutorial of the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.060
 campaign and good as you see is a site 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.920
 very beautiful and I love being there in 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.350

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.940

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.840

 Would you like to be put in and some 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.350
 another idea is that you think they can 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.840
 put the next dlc either herbs and 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.100
