those<00:02:09.030> methods<00:02:09.479> will<00:02:09.509> work<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:10.110> possibly<00:02:10.470> get

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
those methods will work and possibly get

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.630 
those methods will work and possibly get
you<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> Ditto<00:02:11.099> if<00:02:11.220> you're<00:02:11.370> having

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you a Ditto if you're having

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.400 
you a Ditto if you're having
difficulties<00:02:12.209> trying<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.660> know

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
difficulties trying that you know

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.190 
difficulties trying that you know
but<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.400> main<00:02:14.580> point<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.330> why<00:02:15.780> not<00:02:15.990> take

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
but the main point it is is why not take

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.710 
but the main point it is is why not take
a<00:02:16.230> step<00:02:16.530> further<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.400> let's<00:02:17.640> turn<00:02:17.820> on<00:02:18.030> let's

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
a step further so let's turn on let's

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.170 
a step further so let's turn on let's
get<00:02:18.870> some<00:02:19.080> super<00:02:19.470> repels<00:02:19.770> going<00:02:20.220> or<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:21.030> use

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
get some super repels going or you use

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.280 
get some super repels going or you use
max<00:02:21.390> repels<00:02:21.720> doesn't<00:02:21.990> matter<00:02:22.110> whatever

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
max repels doesn't matter whatever

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.770 
max repels doesn't matter whatever
whatever<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.830> guys<00:02:22.950> like<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:24.180> if<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.570> know

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
whatever you guys like but if you know

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.110 
whatever you guys like but if you know
how<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:24.990> dexnav<00:02:25.560> chain<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.880> we're

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
how to dexnav chain this is we're

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.070 
how to dexnav chain this is we're
finding<00:02:27.570> dittos<00:02:28.170> become<00:02:28.680> more<00:02:29.370> useful<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:30.810> if

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
finding dittos become more useful so if

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.320 
finding dittos become more useful so if
you<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.410> get<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.710> chain<00:02:32.040> going<00:02:32.430> for<00:02:32.670> dittos

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
you can get a chain going for dittos

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.810 
you can get a chain going for dittos
obviously<00:02:34.170> if<00:02:34.320> your<00:02:34.500> deck<00:02:35.160> snapping<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
obviously if your deck snapping on the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.400 
obviously if your deck snapping on the
island<00:02:36.240> you're<00:02:36.360> gonna<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.660> like<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:37.050> ten

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
island you're gonna have like a ten

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
times easier time doing this but if you

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.540 
times easier time doing this but if you
get<00:02:39.570> stuck<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:39.930> myself<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.280> have<00:02:41.430> the

six you know it's always random luck

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.890 
six you know it's always random luck
depending<00:03:08.820> on<00:03:08.910> what<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.240> but<00:03:09.300> when<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.600> see

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
depending on what it is but when you see

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.230 
depending on what it is but when you see
those<00:03:10.080> max<00:03:10.470> three<00:03:10.740> stars<00:03:11.040> always<00:03:11.340> go<00:03:11.820> for<00:03:12.090> that

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
those max three stars always go for that

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.180 
those max three stars always go for that
ditto<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.870> try<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.410> capture<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:13.950> see

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
ditto and try and capture it and see

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.820 
ditto and try and capture it and see
what<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.490> is<00:03:14.690> because<00:03:15.690> by<00:03:15.900> doing<00:03:15.960> so<00:03:16.290> you're

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
what it is because by doing so you're

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.430 
what it is because by doing so you're
gonna<00:03:16.950> have<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.490> better<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.540> above<00:03:18.959> average

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
gonna have a better and above average

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.130 
gonna have a better and above average
ditto<00:03:19.770> for<00:03:19.890> breeding<00:03:20.610> purposes<00:03:20.900> so<00:03:21.900> that's

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
ditto for breeding purposes so that's

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.390 
ditto for breeding purposes so that's
kind<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.440> main<00:03:22.590> point<00:03:22.890> about<00:03:22.980> getting<00:03:23.340> a

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
kind of the main point about getting a

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.010 
kind of the main point about getting a
Dex<00:03:23.670> name<00:03:23.880> chain<00:03:24.150> going<00:03:24.480> if<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.750> can

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
Dex name chain going if you can

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.840 
Dex name chain going if you can
obviously<00:03:25.620> again<00:03:26.040> like<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.280> said<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.670> island

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
obviously again like I said the island

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.970 
obviously again like I said the island
version<00:03:27.510> will<00:03:27.690> be<00:03:27.780> easier<00:03:28.140> cuz<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.440> Dex

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
version will be easier cuz you Dex
