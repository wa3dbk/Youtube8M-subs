the muffler the pipes are reasonable

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.659 
the muffler the pipes are reasonable
temperature<00:06:12.880> we<00:06:13.780> do<00:06:13.990> offer<00:06:14.260> a<00:06:14.440> heat<00:06:14.740> tape<00:06:15.039> kit

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
temperature we do offer a heat tape kit

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.000 
temperature we do offer a heat tape kit
that<00:06:16.150> can<00:06:16.539> be<00:06:16.690> placed<00:06:17.020> over<00:06:17.320> here<00:06:17.770> for

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
that can be placed over here for

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:24.230 
that can be placed over here for
additional<00:06:18.460> protection

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.219 

yeah<00:06:24.720> the<00:06:24.900> bike<00:06:25.530> has<00:06:25.830> a<00:06:25.860> phenomenal<00:06:26.639> look<00:06:27.479> with

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
yeah the bike has a phenomenal look with

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.860 
yeah the bike has a phenomenal look with
these<00:06:29.070> two<00:06:29.430> mufflers<00:06:29.910> they're<00:06:30.150> powder-coated

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
these two mufflers they're powder-coated

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.379 
these two mufflers they're powder-coated
but<00:06:31.410> it<00:06:31.530> the<00:06:31.800> main<00:06:32.039> reason<00:06:32.550> that<00:06:32.729> we<00:06:33.120> have<00:06:33.270> the

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
but it the main reason that we have the

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:36.860 
but it the main reason that we have the
muffler<00:06:33.750> is<00:06:33.810> here<00:06:34.229> and<00:06:34.410> not<00:06:35.190> here<00:06:35.669> is<00:06:35.850> to<00:06:36.509> allow

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
muffler is here and not here is to allow

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.140 
muffler is here and not here is to allow
for<00:06:37.350> the<00:06:37.530> better<00:06:37.740> off-road<00:06:38.310> capabilities

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
for the better off-road capabilities

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.360 
for the better off-road capabilities
with<00:06:39.780> the<00:06:39.810> standard<00:06:40.350> mufflers<00:06:40.800> which<00:06:41.160> look

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
with the standard mufflers which look
