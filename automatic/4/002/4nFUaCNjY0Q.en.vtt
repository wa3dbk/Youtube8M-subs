00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.130
 render 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:10.370
 I limit how irie char now and Token cockfighting not the constitutionality 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.930
 Maximum 15 bullets 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.970
 It was a bit harsh since I was afraid and I bought a book but I decided 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.410
 I wonder if Lee is good 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.890
 Because I had not used it since ancient times 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.890
 Pre 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.570
 Hmmm 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:38.790
 Maki Fan I 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.790
 Rio y-Coed or with the autumn leaves One Two with a fine technique 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.550
 Planning to get 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.780
 During 2 which fell down 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.920
 What it's Lily Would not it good to be aware of the lateral movement 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.439
 I'm in a backlash 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.439
 I do not blame the ball Opening that 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.770
 Pan 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:22.649
 Brutalism to back also but is sputum rises and crispy 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.880
 Now the Tekken pigeons are still standing around with their members and this is the regulation this time 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.920
 Ne 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.810
 When the Well who is not me up to the top 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.810
 Hey, since you do not go up because I like a 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.780
 Ha ha ha 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.550
 Such a fine person- 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:48.070
 I moved to that side and used it 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:50.480
 I think it will go up quite easily if you put in a trick 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.310
 rename 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.460
 Naa him is nothing but only Asuka 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.460
 Ah 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.259
 Say it on your pet 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.320
 Ah ah ah 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.030
 Well what do you think? 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:20.450
 I think this is not so much well north I can beat suddenly 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.980
 I do not use it so much, but I understand that I will use the special a little while in the dark 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.630
 I also feel like 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.600
 I do not know how to use it 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:32.410
 I am not good at the timing when the time to use it goes wild 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:37.670
 I can not use it very much, but I hardly use it 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:41.709
 It sounds like it 's in the middle of nowhere , but have it 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.709
 I think I will grow a little more when I can use it well 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.500
 There are many 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:58.860
 Wow I have to remember that I have a current Atami . 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.340
 Mystery judgment 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.340
 there is no 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.090
 1 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.620
 I'm waiting 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.489
 OK 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.489
 Madan 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.349
 I'm trouble 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.349
 Chris Tell 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.610
 In 2 minutes this got stronger 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.319
 And the person of the person is the side movement departure 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:32.530
 Maemaru This is this one 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.530
 It was a simple combo that made me feel sorry 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.530
 I wasn't trying to do this differently , but it's okay. 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.500
 It is an oly result 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.770
 n ame 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.130
 I 'm wrapped in Asuka today. 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.130
 Well one 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:58.220
 I really want the character to increase with the next sound patch 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.220
 You have 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.319
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.319
 5 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.450
 I could not confirm the hit 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:28.940
 Well the first four stages of beginners 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:32.200
 Nde not'm a few times because chose it I think it's a guide 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:37.420
 Well, normally it is up to the edge 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:41.620
 Because you win only drawback Kana thin word that say in the lateral movement is it chosen by the data 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:45.660
 I wonder if such a lucky cafe 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.660
 It is good to hit this Hosokawari 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:57.540
 With're right beside year Nde not do any spring calm 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:01.880
 Well it depends on the character but 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.880
 The basics from now on are such fine techniques 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.939
 I think one move with Japan movement 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.620
 A voice man 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.620
 Nde me gradually hit 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:21.409
 When I am taxing this time, I can not enter the previous text 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:31.280
 I got up, got up and got down, but I was squatting and slightly shifted 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.280
 Grenade and Conkey 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.860
 I wonder if it will be at the end of the table 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.860
 Do 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:49.570
 For now 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:51.180
 Ano Tekken number or the like of the arcade borders of Arcade Arcade tax Toka Shiroganedai-up of the side 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.260
 And asked door 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:06:00.050
 No more moving, so no more 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.050
 The line release of the next tag update is impossible, is n't it? 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.280
 Hmm 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:13.390
 So is it or 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:18.810
 While talking 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.810
 Ritsu struck back flip walked to where I Na or come out hand tut 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.500
 This is an occasional counter at the counter 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.650
 I think 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.160
 This is a plan 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:39.460
 Hi-ranker 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.460
 Kana Yes not let any guide year eh 

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:51.310
 I am 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.910
 This com 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.910
 There was 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.340
 The 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:05.430
 Have 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.430
 If you eat that lower part and try to move sideways 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:15.129
 Lateral movement because this kind of technique stings 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.849
 This Iutoko It is this kind of the way now 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:17.849
 To you only want 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:26.630
 How Qasr and also remember assess the place where the enemy is say Na still it seems to attack 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.630
 I think
