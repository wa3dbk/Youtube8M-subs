00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:04.410
 the city of Athens was a populous man in whose narrow streets 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.110
 small and poor houses coexisted with large and luxurious buildings 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:14.009
 a set of houses discovered near the acropolis does not serve to realize 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.999
 a hypothetical reconstruction of one of them from the end of the period 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:19.310
 classical 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.499
 on the plane 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.889
 We can see that the arrangement of the houses has an irregular shape, being that of 

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:28.249
 much more serious middle with ten rooms on the ground floor and a 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.069
 large patio 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:34.230
 access to housing was through a small corridor that 

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:39.059
 the large central courtyard that was the true heart of the house 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.320
 place the altar for sacrifices to family gods 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.960
 around the patio the different rooms were arranged 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.260
 on the other side of the patio there is a room with mosaic pavement probably for 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.750
 make receptions 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.960
 this stay gives access to a rear dependency of unknown use 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.320
 going through the patio again 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.830
 We arrive at the men's dining room the androni or banquet hall 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.870
 in this room the men celebrated the symposium a very popular private banquet 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.540
 in Athens 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.340
 the guests reclined on some facts called crime 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.640
 standing before them some small tables to have at their reach food 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.280
 and lives 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.010
 the upper floor of the building houses the rooms 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.590
 in this difficult or gynoecium the part of the house reserved for the wife 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.180
 daughters and the maidservants was to be placed at the top 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.240
 the windows are scarce and you get Kenyan 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.909
 the master bedroom just like the rest of the rooms had very 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.100
 few furniture 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.530
 obama and some stool jibao them 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.140
 the walls of the house 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.190
 they were made a hundred supported on a stone plinth 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.200
 the roofs covered with terracotta tiles were sustained by living 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.580
 of wood 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.520
 we do not know what the walls looked like 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.090
 although many houses had their walls and were lucid and generally painted in 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.450
 red color the most popular with a white socket
