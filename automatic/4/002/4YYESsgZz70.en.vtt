suspension or shock here as well so it's

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.380

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
of long distance rides rides maybe go

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.250 
of long distance rides rides maybe go
out<00:00:43.760> two<00:00:43.940> or<00:00:44.030> three<00:00:44.210> hours<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:44.690> then<00:00:44.900> I<00:00:45.050> want

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
out two or three hours and then I want

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.560 
out two or three hours and then I want
to<00:00:45.320> train<00:00:45.560> then<00:00:45.770> after<00:00:46.190> work<00:00:46.370> or<00:00:46.670> train<00:00:47.390> back

in<00:00:47.720> the<00:00:47.780> evening<00:00:47.900> and<00:00:49.000> so<00:00:50.000> I'm<00:00:50.120> not<00:00:50.210> really

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
in the evening and so I'm not really

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.050 
in the evening and so I'm not really
concerned<00:00:50.540> so<00:00:50.840> much<00:00:50.900> about<00:00:50.990> the<00:00:51.200> full<00:00:52.060> comfort

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
concerned so much about the full comfort

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.000 
concerned so much about the full comfort
I<00:00:53.450> also<00:00:53.870> like<00:00:54.110> to<00:00:54.200> write<00:00:54.350> fairly<00:00:54.710> quickly

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
I also like to write fairly quickly

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.720 
I also like to write fairly quickly
though

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
though

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.200 
though
and<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.870> 20-inch<00:00:57.200> wheels<00:00:57.650> here

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
and so the 20-inch wheels here

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.450 
and so the 20-inch wheels here
high-pressure<00:00:59.210> fairly<00:01:00.140> clean<00:01:00.380> wheels<00:01:00.620> do

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
high-pressure fairly clean wheels do

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.840 
high-pressure fairly clean wheels do
allow<00:01:01.700> for<00:01:01.940> very<00:01:02.120> efficient<00:01:02.630> riding<00:01:03.850> pretty

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
allow for very efficient riding pretty

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.620 
allow for very efficient riding pretty
good<00:01:04.970> I<00:01:05.570> also<00:01:06.460> like<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.880> fact<00:01:07.909> that<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.450> neck

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
good I also like the fact that the neck

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.480 
good I also like the fact that the neck
here<00:01:08.869> can<00:01:09.049> be<00:01:09.170> adjusted<00:01:09.650> I<00:01:09.740> can<00:01:09.890> actually<00:01:10.040> take

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
here can be adjusted I can actually take

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.630 
here can be adjusted I can actually take
this<00:01:10.640> position<00:01:11.119> and<00:01:11.560> lower<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.189> I<00:01:13.219> can<00:01:13.520> be

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
this position and lower it so I can be

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.429 
this position and lower it so I can be
in<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.759> very<00:01:13.969> aggressive<00:01:14.090> riding<00:01:14.570> position<00:01:14.990> or

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
in a very aggressive riding position or

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.410 
in a very aggressive riding position or
I<00:01:15.469> can<00:01:15.740> raise<00:01:15.950> it<00:01:15.979> up<00:01:16.219> like<00:01:16.460> this<00:01:16.700> so<00:01:17.299> the

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
I can raise it up like this so the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.810 
I can raise it up like this so the
handlebars<00:01:17.840> are<00:01:18.020> up<00:01:18.140> here<00:01:18.439> in<00:01:18.649> a<00:01:18.950> very<00:01:19.159> relaxed

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
handlebars are up here in a very relaxed

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:34.029 
handlebars are up here in a very relaxed
and<00:01:19.939> right<00:01:20.570> position<00:01:21.109> okay

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.919 

but<00:01:34.670> then<00:01:34.819> again<00:01:34.909> it<00:01:35.179> does<00:01:35.329> fold<00:01:35.539> up<00:01:35.689> fairly

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
but then again it does fold up fairly

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.300 
but then again it does fold up fairly
quickly<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.499> can<00:01:36.649> pop<00:01:36.770> on<00:01:36.889> the<00:01:36.979> train<00:01:37.159> and

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
quickly so I can pop on the train and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.020 
quickly so I can pop on the train and
bring<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:37.520> home<00:01:37.639> how<00:01:38.329> exactly<00:01:38.719> does<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:38.929> pull

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
bring it home how exactly does it pull

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.090 
bring it home how exactly does it pull
first<00:01:41.030> thing<00:01:41.179> you<00:01:41.240> want<00:01:41.359> to<00:01:41.389> do<00:01:41.509> is<00:01:42.100> release

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
first thing you want to do is release

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.859 
first thing you want to do is release
the<00:01:43.130> front<00:01:43.340> brake<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:44.030> that's<00:01:44.329> fairly<00:01:44.689> easy

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
the front brake and that's fairly easy

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.359 
the front brake and that's fairly easy
because<00:01:45.229> you<00:01:45.499> just<00:01:45.740> push<00:01:46.009> down<00:01:46.159> on<00:01:46.249> this

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
because you just push down on this

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.309 
because you just push down on this
button<00:01:46.579> here<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.359> pull<00:01:47.600> up<00:01:47.719> and<00:01:48.079> then<00:01:48.200> your

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
button here and pull up and then your

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.629 
button here and pull up and then your
brake<00:01:48.469> is<00:01:48.619> released<00:01:48.920> then<00:01:49.819> you<00:01:50.630> have<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:51.639> take

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:52.639 
brake is released then you have to take

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:55.480 
brake is released then you have to take
off<00:01:52.819> your<00:01:52.969> front<00:01:53.119> tire

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.490 

and<00:01:56.490> we'll<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:56.690> set<00:01:57.690> that<00:01:57.960> right<00:01:58.200> there<00:01:58.260> for

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
and we'll just set that right there for

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.020 
and we'll just set that right there for
a<00:01:58.740> second<00:02:00.080> come<00:02:01.080> around<00:02:01.290> here<00:02:01.620> and<00:02:01.850> then<00:02:02.850> we're

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
a second come around here and then we're

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.859 
a second come around here and then we're
going<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:05.330> release<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:07.530> rear<00:02:07.680> shock<00:02:07.979> here<00:02:08.869> for

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
going to release the rear shock here for

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.830 
going to release the rear shock here for
