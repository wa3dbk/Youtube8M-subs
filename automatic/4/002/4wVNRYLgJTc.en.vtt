00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.240 

so<00:00:02.399> this<00:00:02.730> is<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.879> quick<00:00:03.179> demo<00:00:03.659> on<00:00:03.840> how<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:04.250> shear

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
so this is a quick demo on how a shear

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.390 
so this is a quick demo on how a shear
lock<00:00:05.460> works<00:00:05.720> currently<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:07.130> don't<00:00:08.130> have<00:00:08.280> any

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
lock works currently I don't have any

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.120 
lock works currently I don't have any
power<00:00:08.610> going<00:00:08.940> out<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:10.280> you'll<00:00:11.280> notice

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
power going out to it you'll notice

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.570 
power going out to it you'll notice
doesn't<00:00:14.130> work<00:00:15.529> nothing<00:00:16.529> nothing<00:00:17.279> going<00:00:17.490> on

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
doesn't work nothing nothing going on

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:29.939 
doesn't work nothing nothing going on
right<00:00:17.640> there<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:19.550> will<00:00:20.550> apply<00:00:21.180> power

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.520 

so<00:00:30.949> now<00:00:31.130> we're<00:00:31.340> currently<00:00:31.760> sending<00:00:32.200> 24<00:00:33.200> volts

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
so now we're currently sending 24 volts

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.090 
so now we're currently sending 24 volts
DC<00:00:34.059> out<00:00:35.059> to<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:35.480> shear<00:00:35.750> lock<00:00:35.960> you'll<00:00:36.739> notice

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
DC out to the shear lock you'll notice

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.190 
DC out to the shear lock you'll notice
if<00:00:38.090> we<00:00:38.210> bring<00:00:38.420> it<00:00:38.570> down

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
if we bring it down

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:49.420 
if we bring it down
off<00:00:39.730> to<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:40.760> left<00:00:42.579> off<00:00:43.720> to<00:00:44.720> the<00:00:44.840> right<00:00:48.430> still

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
off to the left off to the right still

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.299 
off to the left off to the right still
does<00:00:49.699> not<00:00:49.879> energize<00:00:50.600> properly<00:00:51.170> if<00:00:51.860> you<00:00:52.100> look

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
does not energize properly if you look

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.850 
does not energize properly if you look
on<00:00:52.550> this<00:00:53.120> magnet<00:00:53.660> this<00:00:54.050> is<00:00:54.199> what<00:00:54.410> will<00:00:54.559> sit

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
on this magnet this is what will sit

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.820 
on this magnet this is what will sit
inside<00:00:55.129> of<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.580> door<00:00:55.760> itself<00:00:56.350> this<00:00:57.350> magnet

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
inside of the door itself this magnet

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.189 
inside of the door itself this magnet
reacts<00:00:58.430> with<00:00:58.730> a<00:00:58.790> door<00:00:59.540> contact<00:00:59.750> that's

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
reacts with a door contact that's

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.530 
reacts with a door contact that's
located<00:01:01.190> on<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.519> inside<00:01:01.820> of<00:01:01.940> this<00:01:02.030> mag<00:01:02.299> lock

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
located on the inside of this mag lock

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.969 
located on the inside of this mag lock
itself<00:01:03.190> once<00:01:04.190> you<00:01:04.339> line<00:01:04.519> them<00:01:04.699> up<00:01:05.680> using<00:01:06.680> this

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
itself once you line them up using this

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.210 
itself once you line them up using this
unless<00:01:07.610> it's<00:01:08.510> kind<00:01:08.720> of<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.869> guide<00:01:09.100> once<00:01:10.100> you

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
unless it's kind of a guide once you

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.990 
unless it's kind of a guide once you
match<00:01:10.400> those<00:01:10.610> up<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:12.130> get<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.190> nice<00:01:13.460> strong

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
match those up you get a nice strong

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.230 
match those up you get a nice strong
connection<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:16.520> you'll<00:01:16.640> notice<00:01:16.939> there's

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
connection and you'll notice there's

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.510 
connection and you'll notice there's
play<00:01:17.630> on<00:01:18.080> this<00:01:18.350> back<00:01:18.650> part<00:01:18.920> that's<00:01:19.220> kind<00:01:19.400> of

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
play on this back part that's kind of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.750 
play on this back part that's kind of
what<00:01:19.729> allows<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.659> door<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.990> work<00:01:21.140> properly

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
what allows the door to work properly

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.649 
what allows the door to work properly
when<00:01:22.760> it's<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.030> energized

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
when it's the energized

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.039 
when it's the energized
it<00:01:24.260> will<00:01:24.439> allow<00:01:24.700> this<00:01:25.700> magnet<00:01:26.240> part<00:01:26.540> to

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
it will allow this magnet part to

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.810 
it will allow this magnet part to
actually<00:01:27.320> sit<00:01:27.590> lower<00:01:27.799> allow<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.460> door<00:01:28.729> to

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
actually sit lower allow the door to

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.429 
actually sit lower allow the door to
close<00:01:28.939> properly<00:01:29.330> once<00:01:30.259> it's<00:01:30.439> engaged<00:01:32.439> sucks

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
close properly once it's engaged sucks

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.260 
close properly once it's engaged sucks
right<00:01:33.650> up<00:01:33.830> nice<00:01:34.130> against<00:01:34.550> it<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.850> allows<00:01:35.150> the

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
right up nice against it and allows the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.810 
right up nice against it and allows the
door<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.450> work<00:01:35.630> properly<00:01:36.160> I'll<00:01:37.160> remove<00:01:37.520> power

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
door to work properly I'll remove power

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.100 
door to work properly I'll remove power
and<00:01:39.220> you<00:01:40.220> can<00:01:40.340> see<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:40.640> actually<00:01:41.030> came<00:01:41.900> off

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
and you can see it actually came off

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.010 
and you can see it actually came off
just<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.650> little<00:01:42.830> bit<00:01:42.950> here<00:01:43.220> but<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.720> allows

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
just a little bit here but it allows

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.390 
just a little bit here but it allows
doors<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.260> be<00:01:48.380> open<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:48.770> closed<00:01:48.980> once<00:01:49.280> you

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
doors to be open and closed once you

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.120 
doors to be open and closed once you
remove<00:01:49.610> power<00:01:50.200> powered<00:01:51.200> up<00:01:51.320> again<00:01:51.620> just<00:01:51.650> show

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
remove power powered up again just show

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.710 
remove power powered up again just show
you<00:01:52.190> how<00:01:53.380> how<00:01:54.380> quickly<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.770> can<00:01:54.830> lock<00:01:55.040> back<00:01:55.250> up

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
you how how quickly you can lock back up

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:08.730 
you how how quickly you can lock back up
with<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.900> right<00:01:57.250> magnet

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.740 

Thanks
