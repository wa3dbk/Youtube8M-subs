00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
inverter with it and you're using a

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.100 
inverter with it and you're using a
laptops<00:00:19.960> computers<00:00:20.920> and<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:22.630> don't<00:00:22.870> worry

about that surge with the honda suit you
know<00:00:25.150> that's<00:00:25.510> one<00:00:26.110> thing<00:00:26.140> Honda's<00:00:26.710> got<00:00:26.920> it<00:00:27.070> all

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250

covered<00:00:27.550> in<00:00:27.730> is<00:00:27.850> that<00:00:28.030> inverter<00:00:28.620> keeps<00:00:29.620> all

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
covered in is that inverter keeps all

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.220 
covered in is that inverter keeps all
that<00:00:29.860> stuff<00:00:30.400> safe<00:00:30.760> and<00:00:31.060> I<00:00:31.570> want<00:00:31.690> to<00:00:31.810> talk<00:00:31.990> to

you a little bit about a little things
on<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.230> frontier<00:00:35.739> like<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.070> echo<00:00:36.370> throttle

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
on the frontier like the echo throttle

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.340 
on the frontier like the echo throttle
switch<00:00:37.510> right<00:00:37.900> here

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
switch right here

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.620 
switch right here
if<00:00:38.800> you<00:00:39.070> somewhere<00:00:39.489> and<00:00:39.550> you're<00:00:39.940> using<00:00:40.210> a<00:00:40.450> lot

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
if you somewhere and you're using a lot

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.870 
if you somewhere and you're using a lot
of<00:00:40.660> power<00:00:40.989> and<00:00:41.500> then<00:00:41.620> our<00:00:41.800> sudden<00:00:42.190> Richard<00:00:42.700> it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
of power and then our sudden Richard it

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.120 
of power and then our sudden Richard it
hits<00:00:43.360> you<00:00:43.780> don't<00:00:43.960> need<00:00:44.170> as<00:00:44.380> much<00:00:44.560> power<00:00:44.860> of

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
hits you don't need as much power of

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.290 
hits you don't need as much power of
this<00:00:45.250> thing<00:00:45.460> a<00:00:45.489> throttle<00:00:46.060> down<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:48.300> more

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
this thing a throttle down and more

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.299 
this thing a throttle down and more
power<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:49.870> needs<00:00:49.899> in<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.410> throttle<00:00:50.829> up<00:00:50.950> that

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
power it needs in a throttle up that

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.160 
power it needs in a throttle up that
saves<00:00:51.579> a<00:00:51.700> lot<00:00:51.820> of<00:00:51.970> guys<00:00:52.149> you<00:00:52.540> know<00:00:52.870> you<00:00:52.930> won't

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
saves a lot of guys you know you won't

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.930 
saves a lot of guys you know you won't
get<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.380> lot<00:00:53.440> more<00:00:53.770> wrong<00:00:53.950> time<00:00:54.250> out<00:00:54.489> it<00:00:54.640> yeah

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
get a lot more wrong time out it yeah

get a lot more wrong time out it yeah
and<00:00:56.610> you've<00:00:57.610> got<00:00:57.790> the<00:00:57.940> charging<00:00:58.420> system<00:00:58.630> with

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
and you've got the charging system with

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.940 
and you've got the charging system with
it<00:00:59.230> if<00:01:00.219> you<00:01:00.370> want<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.640> charge<00:01:00.850> 12-volt

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
it if you want to charge 12-volt

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.180 
it if you want to charge 12-volt
batteries

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190

you<00:01:16.030> there's<00:01:16.270> no<00:01:16.420> way<00:01:16.600> Richard<00:01:17.020> you<00:01:17.139> can<00:01:17.350> do

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
you there's no way Richard you can do

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.440 
you there's no way Richard you can do
anything<00:01:17.859> with<00:01:18.039> stereo<00:01:18.490> you<00:01:18.639> cannot<00:01:18.999> blow<00:01:19.270> it

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
anything with stereo you cannot blow it

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.840 
anything with stereo you cannot blow it
up<00:01:19.569> I<00:01:19.780> run<00:01:19.959> it<00:01:20.109> low<00:01:20.289> and<00:01:20.319> over<00:01:20.619> this<00:01:21.249> generator

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
up I run it low and over this generator

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.099 
up I run it low and over this generator
will<00:01:22.119> not<00:01:22.450> run<00:01:23.219> if<00:01:24.219> you<00:01:24.369> don't<00:01:24.579> have<00:01:24.819> all<00:01:25.109> and

brief something but yeah you can stop a
lot<00:02:03.819> of<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.090> theory<00:02:04.359> skater<00:02:05.139> yeah<00:02:05.679> that's

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
lot of in theory skater yeah that's

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.919 
lot of in theory skater yeah that's
right<00:02:06.189> also<00:02:06.520> but<00:02:06.909> I<00:02:07.090> think<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.630> if<00:02:07.749> we're

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
right also but I think to if we're

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.350 
right also but I think to if we're
outside<00:02:08.020> watching<00:02:08.530> maybe

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
outside watching maybe

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.840 
outside watching maybe
watch<00:02:09.479> some<00:02:09.660> TV<00:02:10.220> tailgating<00:02:11.220> at<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.370> football

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850

games or whatever this is not going to

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.010 
games or whatever this is not going to
be<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> loud<00:02:14.520> unit<00:02:14.910> they<00:02:15.120> are<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.390> my<00:02:15.510> fifty<00:02:15.840> nine
