00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.850

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.730

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.980
 homemade bread as with nuts whole 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.350
 very tasty but before you start one 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.660
 small announcement from next week 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.480
 So from Monday there is one 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.140
 valentines week with the lord of 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.280
 there are still a lot of desires for the canal 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.729
 american multi-core de and cook 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.239
 So my little thing does not turn on anything 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.239
 miss 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.479
 so for our bread we need more that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.530
 I have already won by water 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:22.860
 salt sugar yeast some oil one 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.020
 box shape if you have to stupid can 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.650
 one also in a springform make whoever 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.930
 it likes around and johannes probably 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.060
 So much 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.440
 First, we take the yeast with us 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.640
 put some water and sugar on it 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.180
 furthermore, we take two 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.670
 tablespoon of flour surrounded up to that 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.600
 yeast mixed and make us 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.689
 a prettily pretty everything, so to speak 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.430
 stir smoothly and we let that short 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.340
 about 15 minutes 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.990
 let me cover someday 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:07.380
 warm places are so pretty you the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.550
 like the yeast also like to be called 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.940
 little grown 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:17.030
 So it has been activated nicely now 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.030
 we add the whole to our flour 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.110
 then also the salt 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.210
 oil but not everything please let go 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.160
 1 tablespoon still in there because that need 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.850
 we to brush against it and that 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.850
 remaining water 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.070
 now we will knead it 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.830
 I have my great mixa again 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.750
 who have no or who do not mixa with 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.560
 knead in the morning half mid hangs 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:02.980
 so your consistency should look like 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.890
 very sticky still have something like that 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.510
 just a little bit more now 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:14.140
 strip off the edges and then we leave 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.440
 the whole in a warm place covered 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.990
 for about 45 minutes to an hour 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.480
 So he should double himself 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.760
 to have 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.730
 our dough has gone well 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.460
 wonderfully perfect and so beautifully fluffy 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:35.370
 was so I looked now my 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:38.200
 Work surface already dusted with flour 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.740
 We are now supporting the dough on the 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.740
 working surface 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:52.500
 nice to take the countries of the so 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.250
 further we take the back 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.590
 part then the other part of same 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:03.050
 another page 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:08.630
 and bang a bit a knead 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:11.760
 therefore you are very soft you have to 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.680
 but not too much kneading 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:22.190
 We want him to stay like that 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:22.190
 roll out a bit with your fingers 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.659
 that's the form you have to please 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.659
 a smear with oil 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:05:00.280
 So next we want to do the dough 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:05:06.960
 a beautiful and in shape brings for our 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:14.770
 then box your hands with bfb 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:20.560
 set dust with flour and now 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:22.830
 Gently in the form of something smooth 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.830
 to brush 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:33.600
 take a knife last and across 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.600
 in the dough third pure cut 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.389
 so are the heated oven itself for 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:45.070
 180 degrees upper lower heat we leave 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:48.620
 times as our rest for ten minutes 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:54.910
 after that he will be around 35 to 40 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.910
 baked and that 's it 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.550
