00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
was basically filtered water hem seats

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.370 
was basically filtered water hem seats
some<00:02:08.880> stevia<00:02:09.210> and<00:02:09.720> some<00:02:10.140> scent

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
some stevia and some scent

we're going to have full spectrum
minerals<00:02:15.570> in<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:15.900> ice<00:02:16.050> cream<00:02:16.290> mineral<00:02:16.980> ice

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
minerals in this ice cream mineral ice

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.350 
minerals in this ice cream mineral ice
cream<00:02:17.490> so<00:02:17.670> basically<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.030> way<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.240> I've

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
cream so basically the way that I've

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.390 
cream so basically the way that I've
known<00:02:18.870> as<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.380> we'll<00:02:19.710> just<00:02:19.830> say<00:02:20.070> them<00:02:20.220> all

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
known as I like we'll just say them all

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.030 
known as I like we'll just say them all
in<00:02:20.580> separate<00:02:21.120> statements<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.900> know<00:02:22.040> so

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
in separate statements you know so

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.230 
in separate statements you know so
you're<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.250> going<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.520> leave<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.670> rolling<00:02:24.090> on

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
you're just going to leave a rolling on

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.900 
you're just going to leave a rolling on
okay<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.930> first<00:02:25.050> we<00:02:25.260> do<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.560> here's<00:02:25.830> yes<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.580> I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
okay so first we do that here's yes so I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.700 
okay so first we do that here's yes so I
got<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> camera<00:02:28.080> woman<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.940> epic<00:02:30.330> okay<00:02:30.960> we're

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
got a camera woman so epic okay we're

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.980 
got a camera woman so epic okay we're
starting<00:02:31.860> with<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.340> base<00:02:32.520> making<00:02:33.240> enough<00:02:33.630> for

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
starting with the base making enough for

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.920 
starting with the base making enough for
two<00:02:34.110> people<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.860> basically<00:02:35.490> we<00:02:36.390> have<00:02:36.540> to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
two people so basically we have to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.160 
two people so basically we have to
almost<00:02:37.500> full<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.820> ski<00:02:39.360> trips<00:02:39.660> or<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.960> few

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
almost full I ski trips or the few

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.840 
almost full I ski trips or the few
missing<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.070> should<00:02:41.250> be<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:41.400> perfect

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
missing so that should be just perfect

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:50.180 
missing so that should be just perfect
actually<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:47.400> we<00:02:47.610> got<00:02:47.760> our<00:02:47.790> ice<00:02:48.270> in<00:02:48.480> here<00:02:49.190> the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
actually so we got our ice in here the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.030 
actually so we got our ice in here the
idea<00:02:50.490> of<00:02:50.700> politics<00:02:51.180> works<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.560> have

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
idea of politics works is that you have

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.520 
idea of politics works is that you have
ice<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.580> then<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.090> add<00:02:54.240> enough<00:02:54.660> powders<00:02:55.260> and

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
ice and then you add enough powders and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.100 
ice and then you add enough powders and
oil<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.030> when<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.450> blend<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.020> all

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
oil so that when you blend it all

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.770 
oil so that when you blend it all
together<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.830> makes<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.370> consistency<00:03:00.210> of<00:03:00.240> ice

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
together it makes the consistency of ice

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.420 
together it makes the consistency of ice
cream<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.410> always<00:03:01.620> want<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.830> add<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.100> powders

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
cream you always want to add the powders

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.520 
cream you always want to add the powders
in<00:03:02.580> first<00:03:02.940> because<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.870> moment<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.260> have<00:03:04.410> the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
in first because the moment you have the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.740 
in first because the moment you have the
liquids<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.220> starts<00:03:05.460> melting<00:03:05.640> ice<00:03:06.030> away<00:03:06.240> so

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
liquids in it starts melting ice away so

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.410 
liquids in it starts melting ice away so
here<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.740> magic<00:03:08.250> ingredient<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:09.030> cocoa

actually about one gram of sugar in this

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.810 
actually about one gram of sugar in this
ice<00:04:03.110> cream<00:04:03.380> so<00:04:03.770> we're<00:04:03.860> putting<00:04:04.010> about<00:04:04.130> two<00:04:04.520> to

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
ice cream so we're putting about two to

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.250 
ice cream so we're putting about two to
three<00:04:04.850> dropper<00:04:05.390> poles<00:04:05.600> in<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.810> stevia<00:04:06.200> in

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
three dropper poles in the stevia in

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.380 
three dropper poles in the stevia in
there<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:06.800> then<00:04:06.920> we<00:04:07.160> got<00:04:07.340> our<00:04:07.490> head<00:04:07.760> milk<00:04:08.000> we

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
there and then we got our head milk we

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.820 
there and then we got our head milk we
probably<00:04:08.600> won't<00:04:08.780> use<00:04:08.960> this<00:04:09.170> much<00:04:09.440> but<00:04:09.710> it's

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
probably won't use this much but it's

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.260 
probably won't use this much but it's
always<00:04:10.010> good<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.190> make<00:04:10.310> a<00:04:10.370> little<00:04:10.490> bit<00:04:10.700> more<00:04:10.940> so

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
always good to make a little bit more so

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.480 
always good to make a little bit more so
you<00:04:11.360> can<00:04:11.510> keep<00:04:11.660> added<00:04:12.080> if<00:04:12.440> your<00:04:12.830> ice<00:04:12.950> cream<00:04:13.250> is

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
250 first then last but not least we're

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.760

for everything body's made out of

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.030 
for everything body's made out of
microbes<00:04:29.270> ninety<00:04:30.260> percent<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.710> cells<00:04:30.920> in

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
microbes ninety percent of the cells in
