loyal to the headphones that came with

my phones from Apple and for a while I

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.289 
my phones from Apple and for a while I
was<00:01:34.229> content<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:34.890> listening<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.939> wired

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
was content with listening to wired

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.600 
was content with listening to wired
headphones<00:01:36.829> even<00:01:37.829> though<00:01:37.920> every<00:01:38.159> once<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.520> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
headphones even though every once in a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.600 
headphones even though every once in a
while<00:01:38.670> my<00:01:39.509> arm<00:01:39.810> would<00:01:40.079> catch<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.890> I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
while my arm would catch on it and I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.080 
while my arm would catch on it and I
would<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.790> upset<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:43.100> think<00:01:44.100> why<00:01:44.460> don't<00:01:44.909> they

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
would be upset and think why don't they

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.359 
would be upset and think why don't they
make<00:01:45.270> Bluetooth<00:01:45.899> headphones<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:47.250> would

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
make Bluetooth headphones that would

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:47.899 
make Bluetooth headphones that would
actually<00:01:47.700> work

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
actually work

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.639 
actually work

since<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.470> thought<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:15.040> get<00:03:15.250> them<00:03:15.489> again<00:03:16.950> but

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
since I thought to get them again but

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.569 
since I thought to get them again but
they<00:03:18.340> do<00:03:18.669> suffice<00:03:19.209> they<00:03:20.139> sound<00:03:20.560> really<00:03:20.739> clear

proof<00:04:05.379> I<00:04:05.620> will<00:04:05.829> be<00:04:06.010> testing<00:04:06.549> that<00:04:06.579> out<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.150> if

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
proof I will be testing that out and if

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.080 
proof I will be testing that out and if
for<00:04:07.449> any<00:04:07.540> reason<00:04:07.660> that<00:04:08.109> doesn't<00:04:08.680> hold<00:04:09.489> up<00:04:09.819> I

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
for any reason that doesn't hold up I

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.629 
for any reason that doesn't hold up I
will<00:04:10.599> let<00:04:10.810> you<00:04:10.930> guys<00:04:11.109> know<00:04:11.500> immediately<00:04:11.799> but

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
will let you guys know immediately but

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.280 
will let you guys know immediately but
it<00:04:12.760> seems<00:04:13.030> a<00:04:13.180> little<00:04:13.329> bit<00:04:13.510> more<00:04:13.720> rubberized

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
it seems a little bit more rubberized

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.140 
it seems a little bit more rubberized
than<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:14.919> version<00:04:15.099> that<00:04:15.400> they<00:04:15.489> had<00:04:15.730> before

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
than the version that they had before

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.439 
than the version that they had before
which<00:04:16.389> had<00:04:16.630> a<00:04:16.660> tacky<00:04:17.099> chrome<00:04:18.099> diamond<00:04:19.000> on<00:04:19.239> the

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
which had a tacky chrome diamond on the

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.469 
which had a tacky chrome diamond on the
front<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:20.320> this<00:04:20.560> one<00:04:20.849> seems<00:04:21.849> to<00:04:22.030> be<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.270> little

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
front so this one seems to be a little

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.230 
front so this one seems to be a little
bit<00:04:22.659> more<00:04:22.900> watertight<00:04:23.650> or<00:04:24.130> sweat<00:04:24.700> tight<00:04:25.000> if

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
bit more watertight or sweat tight if

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.240 
bit more watertight or sweat tight if
you<00:04:25.630> want<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:25.840> think<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.229> that<00:04:26.409> way

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
you want to think of it that way

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.900 
you want to think of it that way
as<00:04:27.970> if<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:28.360> um<00:04:28.900> just<00:04:29.140> looking<00:04:30.100> at<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.490> top<00:04:30.730> of

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
as if you um just looking at the top of

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.510 
as if you um just looking at the top of
the<00:04:30.970> device<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:32.320> is<00:04:32.350> a<00:04:32.560> little<00:04:33.010> bit<00:04:33.160> bigger

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
the device it is a little bit bigger

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.160 
the device it is a little bit bigger
than<00:04:33.850> you<00:04:34.030> would<00:04:34.150> think<00:04:34.180> from<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.720> original

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
than you would think from the original

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.530 
than you would think from the original
powerbeats<00:04:35.680> but<00:04:35.920> not<00:04:36.100> too<00:04:36.370> much<00:04:36.610> it<00:04:37.060> is<00:04:37.120> not

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
powerbeats but not too much it is not

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.080 
powerbeats but not too much it is not
overly<00:04:38.080> heavy<00:04:38.410> and<00:04:38.800> it's<00:04:39.430> good<00:04:39.640> that<00:04:39.790> it<00:04:39.880> wraps

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
overly heavy and it's good that it wraps

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.660 
overly heavy and it's good that it wraps
around<00:04:40.240> your<00:04:40.480> ears<00:04:40.720> so<00:04:40.900> all<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.230> weight

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
around your ears so all the weight

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.180 
around your ears so all the weight
whatever<00:04:42.670> weight<00:04:43.030> this<00:04:43.240> does<00:04:43.510> have<00:04:43.840> is

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
whatever weight this does have is

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.060 
whatever weight this does have is
distributed<00:04:45.190> evenly<00:04:46.440> inside<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.590> box<00:04:47.830> you

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
distributed evenly inside the box you

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.120 
distributed evenly inside the box you
get<00:04:48.250> a<00:04:48.630> charging<00:04:49.630> cable<00:04:49.900> as<00:04:50.290> you<00:04:50.470> see<00:04:50.680> here<00:04:50.950> and

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
get a charging cable as you see here and

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.680 
get a charging cable as you see here and
you<00:04:51.190> also<00:04:51.490> get<00:04:51.820> three<00:04:52.510> other<00:04:54.000> earbud<00:04:55.000> options

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
you also get three other earbud options

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.260 
you also get three other earbud options
for<00:04:56.020> your<00:04:56.170> different<00:04:56.650> sized<00:04:56.890> ears<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:58.150> you're

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
for your different sized ears so you're

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.659 
for your different sized ears so you're
not<00:04:58.390> stuck<00:04:58.840> with<00:04:59.080> only<00:04:59.290> one<00:05:02.070> at<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.220> end<00:05:03.400> of

this<00:05:03.790> little<00:05:04.210> loop<00:05:04.480> here<00:05:04.510> you<00:05:05.020> get<00:05:05.230> something

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
this little loop here you get something

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.510 
this little loop here you get something
to<00:05:06.250> tie<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.930> strap<00:05:08.320> down<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:09.220> it's<00:05:09.370> not

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
to tie the strap down so it's not

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
in the comment section below I'd say

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.990 
in the comment section below I'd say
they're<00:07:18.360> a<00:07:18.390> little<00:07:18.780> bit<00:07:18.990> expensive<00:07:19.500> at<00:07:19.740> 199<00:07:20.730> 95

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 
they're a little bit expensive at 199 95

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.480 
they're a little bit expensive at 199 95

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 
but I think that these ones feel the

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.660 
but I think that these ones feel the
best<00:07:27.270> while<00:07:27.720> wearing<00:07:28.140> them<00:07:28.410> I've<00:07:29.310> seen

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:29.670 
best while wearing them I've seen

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.240

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.250 
another option for 130 dollars but I

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.450 
another option for 130 dollars but I
