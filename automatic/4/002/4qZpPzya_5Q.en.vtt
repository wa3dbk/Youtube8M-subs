there are threaded quarter-twenty holes
and<00:02:10.050> non-threaded<00:02:11.050> order<00:02:11.680> 20<00:02:11.950> holes<00:02:12.130> why

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
and non-threaded order 20 holes why

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.940 
and non-threaded order 20 holes why
non-threaded<00:02:13.120> sometimes<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:14.080> put<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.410> an

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
non-threaded sometimes you put a an

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.560 
non-threaded sometimes you put a an
accessory<00:02:15.490> in<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:15.730> screw<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.480> it's

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
accessory in you screw it in and it's

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.520 
accessory in you screw it in and it's
facing<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.990> wrong<00:02:17.110> way

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
facing the wrong way

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.040 
facing the wrong way
so<00:02:18.010> with<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.340> non<00:02:18.610> threaded<00:02:19.150> hole<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.810> can

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
so with the non threaded hole you can

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.410 
so with the non threaded hole you can
bolt<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.950> through<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.430> then<00:02:21.520> face<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:22.330> know

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
bolt it through and then face you know

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.850 
bolt it through and then face you know
the<00:02:22.570> light<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.020> microphone<00:02:23.530> or<00:02:23.620> whatever
