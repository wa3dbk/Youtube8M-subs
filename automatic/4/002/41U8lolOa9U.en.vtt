00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
you know you can have it like this way

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.460 
you know you can have it like this way
but<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.360> course<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:28.020> you're<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.380> be

putting in your your pocket it's going
to<00:01:31.619> get<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> way<00:01:32.130> because<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.700> know

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
to get in the way because you know

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.149 
to get in the way because you know
you're<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> happen<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.950> of

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
you're going to happen like that but of

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.940 
you're going to happen like that but of
course<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.909> flip<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.299> around<00:01:36.650> of<00:01:37.650> course

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
course if you flip it around of course

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.219 
course if you flip it around of course
then<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.509> that's<00:01:39.900> probably

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
then you can have it and that's probably

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.020 
then you can have it and that's probably
the<00:01:40.409> only<00:01:40.439> way<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.610> fit<00:01:41.909> in

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the only way you can you know fit in

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.490 
the only way you can you know fit in
that<00:01:42.090> 45<00:01:42.689> degree<00:01:42.720> angle<00:01:43.820> adapter<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.180> there

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
that 45 degree angle adapter in there

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.280 
that 45 degree angle adapter in there
okay<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:47.100> was<00:01:48.030> something<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.450> say<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.840> you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
okay but was something like say do you

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.260 
okay but was something like say do you
can<00:01:49.500> flip<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.799> around<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.549> because<00:01:51.060> of

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
can flip it around like this because of

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.149 
can flip it around like this because of
the<00:01:51.540> fact<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.439> little<00:01:52.619> X<00:01:52.890> bit

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the fact that you have that little X bit

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.240 
the fact that you have that little X bit
of<00:01:53.310> cord<00:01:54.240> slack<00:01:54.570> here<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.710> wrap<00:01:56.070> it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
of cord slack here so you can wrap it

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.100 
of cord slack here so you can wrap it
around<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.509> gets<00:01:57.630> out<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> way

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
around so that it gets out of the way

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.410 
around so that it gets out of the way
and<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:58.770> even<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> 45<00:02:00.270> degree

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
and then even if you have a 45 degree

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.499 
and then even if you have a 45 degree
angle<00:02:01.189> adapter<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.610> still<00:02:02.939> plug<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.329> in

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
angle adapter you can still plug it in

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.749 
angle adapter you can still plug it in
without<00:02:04.170> any<00:02:04.469> problems<00:02:04.890> okay<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.430> won't<00:02:05.610> get

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
without any problems okay and won't get

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.630 
without any problems okay and won't get
in<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.909> way<00:02:06.469> okay<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.950> course<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.489> can

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
in the way okay and of course you can

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.999 
in the way okay and of course you can
flip<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.879> around<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:10.500> same<00:02:10.709> kind<00:02:10.950> of

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
flip it around and the same kind of

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.250 
flip it around and the same kind of
thing<00:02:11.190> happens

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
thing happens

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.449 
thing happens
so<00:02:13.260> that's<00:02:13.470> one<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.830> nice<00:02:14.010> things<00:02:14.040> about

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
so that's one of the nice things about

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.660 
so that's one of the nice things about
having<00:02:14.700> something<00:02:15.120> like<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:15.510> rather<00:02:15.989> than

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
having something like this rather than

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.670 
having something like this rather than
something<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.909> has<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.239> fixed<00:02:18.750> 45<00:02:19.319> degree

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
something that has a fixed 45 degree

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.149 
something that has a fixed 45 degree
angle<00:02:20.069> adapter<00:02:20.280> head<00:02:20.750> ok<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:23.010> demonstrate

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
angle adapter head ok so to demonstrate

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.539 
angle adapter head ok so to demonstrate
that<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.879> works<00:02:24.060> really<00:02:24.329> well<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:25.129> am<00:02:26.129> going<00:02:26.340> to

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
that it works really well I am going to

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:32.089 
that it works really well I am going to
plug<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.879> into<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.299> music<00:02:28.079> dock<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.920> I'm<00:02:31.920> just

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
plug it into a music dock and I'm just

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:46.430 
plug it into a music dock and I'm just
going<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.659> turn<00:02:33.659> it<00:02:33.810> on<00:02:43.849> and<00:02:44.849> this<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.959> stereo

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
going to turn it on and this is a stereo

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.280 
going to turn it on and this is a stereo
music<00:02:46.650> talk<00:02:47.069> that<00:02:47.549> I<00:02:47.609> got<00:02:47.790> me<00:02:47.940> Randall<00:02:48.329> so<00:02:48.959> on

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
music talk that I got me Randall so on

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.500 
music talk that I got me Randall so on
able<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.950> demonstrate<00:02:50.519> that<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.090> works<00:02:51.269> pretty

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
able to demonstrate that it works pretty

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.860 
able to demonstrate that it works pretty
well<00:02:51.659> face<00:02:52.500> arrest<00:02:52.769> for<00:02:53.010> my<00:02:53.129> part<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.840> you

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
well face arrest for my part is so you

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.119 
well face arrest for my part is so you
can<00:02:55.019> demonstrate<00:02:55.349> that<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.799> works<00:02:55.950> really
