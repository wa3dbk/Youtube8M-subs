10<00:02:28.450> years<00:02:28.630> ago<00:02:28.810> we<00:02:29.110> had<00:02:29.290> some<00:02:29.500> fleets<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.070> now

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
10 years ago we had some fleets and now

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.120 
10 years ago we had some fleets and now
it's<00:02:30.820> incredible<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.720> know<00:02:32.290> this<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.739> the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
it's incredible I know this is the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.640 
it's incredible I know this is the
beginning<00:02:33.280> for<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.090> kind<00:02:34.959> of<00:02:35.080> phenomena

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
beginning for this kind of phenomena

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.510 
beginning for this kind of phenomena
that<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.250> unexplainable

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
that is unexplainable

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.010 
that is unexplainable
so<00:02:39.520> now<00:02:39.730> we<00:02:39.790> are<00:02:39.910> wondering<00:02:40.510> are<00:02:40.960> we

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
so now we are wondering are we

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.080 
so now we are wondering are we
confronting<00:02:41.710> a<00:02:41.830> new<00:02:41.950> phenomena<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.820> sign

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
confronting a new phenomena and you sign

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.840 
confronting a new phenomena and you sign
what<00:02:43.960> could<00:02:44.170> this<00:02:44.290> meaning<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:45.280> what<00:02:45.640> could

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
what could this meaning that what could

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.230 
what could this meaning that what could
this<00:02:46.000> group<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.980> strange<00:02:47.980> luminous<00:02:48.730> figures

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
this group of strange luminous figures

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.100 
this group of strange luminous figures
with<00:02:50.170> humanoid<00:02:50.680> shape<00:02:50.860> mean<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:52.240> this<00:02:52.390> week<00:02:52.630> a

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
with humanoid shape mean to this week a

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.630 
with humanoid shape mean to this week a
new<00:02:53.200> sign<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:55.980> we<00:02:56.980> have<00:02:57.190> several

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
new sign so we have several

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.060 
new sign so we have several
interpretations<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.660> know<00:02:58.780> could<00:02:59.710> this<00:02:59.740> be

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
interpretations you know could this be

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.570 
interpretations you know could this be
some<00:03:00.100> kind<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.760> beans<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.330> life
