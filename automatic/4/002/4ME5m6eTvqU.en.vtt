thing<00:02:24.500> about<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:25.100> ultracapacitor<00:02:25.580> is<00:02:26.270> we're

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
thing about the ultracapacitor is we're

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.050 
thing about the ultracapacitor is we're
all<00:02:26.630> familiar<00:02:26.990> with<00:02:27.380> rechargeable<00:02:28.370> batteries

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
all familiar with rechargeable batteries

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.760 
all familiar with rechargeable batteries
and<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.300> problems<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:30.050> happen<00:02:30.470> with<00:02:30.620> those

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
and the problems that happen with those

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.830 
and the problems that happen with those
over<00:02:31.100> time<00:02:31.370> which<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.970> batteries<00:02:32.510> lose

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
over time which is the batteries lose

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.750 
over time which is the batteries lose
the<00:02:33.140> ability<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.560> hold<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.920> charge<00:02:33.950> that

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
the ability to hold a charge that

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.550 
the ability to hold a charge that
doesn't<00:02:35.300> happen<00:02:35.630> with<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.080> ultracapacitor

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
doesn't happen with the ultracapacitor

the ultracapacitor has a lifespan of 10

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.449 
the ultracapacitor has a lifespan of 10
years<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.930> idea<00:02:42.350> of<00:02:42.440> course<00:02:42.770> is<00:02:43.010> in<00:02:43.190> 10

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
years so the idea of course is in 10

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.790 
years so the idea of course is in 10
years<00:02:43.820> some<00:02:44.510> new<00:02:44.810> device<00:02:45.200> will<00:02:45.440> have<00:02:45.590> come

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
years some new device will have come

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.199 
years some new device will have come
along<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:46.100> will<00:02:46.430> have<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.850> know<00:02:46.880> main

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
along that will have you know main

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.570 
along that will have you know main
you're<00:02:47.690> curing<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.410> much<00:02:48.680> easier<00:02:49.130> but

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
you're curing that much easier but

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.100 
you're curing that much easier but
you're<00:02:49.730> not<00:02:49.850> worried<00:02:50.239> about<00:02:50.300> replacing<00:02:50.840> a

when they're in the body there's a glass
light<00:03:15.320> guide<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.400> have<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.850> provide<00:03:17.150> a

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
light guide and you have to provide a

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.680 
light guide and you have to provide a
real<00:03:17.780> strong<00:03:18.200> boost<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.610> LEDs<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.450> get<00:03:20.570> the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
real strong boost to the LEDs to get the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.660 
real strong boost to the LEDs to get the
light<00:03:20.930> energy<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.560> move<00:03:21.769> from<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.310> into<00:03:22.580> the

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
of a strain on the battery increases

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.819 
of a strain on the battery increases
power<00:03:28.519> consumption<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.510> other<00:03:30.110> thing<00:03:30.470> is

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
power consumption the other thing is

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.160 
power consumption the other thing is
that<00:03:31.070> having<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.790> LEDs<00:03:32.239> right<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.690> tip<00:03:32.959> and

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
that having the LEDs right the tip and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.410 
that having the LEDs right the tip and
not<00:03:33.530> having<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.100> use<00:03:34.190> all<00:03:34.370> that<00:03:34.519> power<00:03:34.790> also

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
not having to use all that power also

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.740 
not having to use all that power also
means<00:03:36.049> less<00:03:36.590> heat<00:03:37.100> less<00:03:37.790> heat<00:03:38.060> developed<00:03:38.600> on

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
means less heat less heat developed on

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.560 
means less heat less heat developed on
the<00:03:38.989> LEDs<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:40.010> because<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.880> LEDs<00:03:41.329> are<00:03:41.540> going

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
the LEDs and because the LEDs are going

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.390 
the LEDs and because the LEDs are going
to<00:03:41.810> be<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.110> know<00:03:42.230> right<00:03:42.500> next<00:03:42.799> to<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.160> tooth

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
to be you know right next to the tooth

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.270 
to be you know right next to the tooth
that<00:03:43.700> then<00:03:44.269> means<00:03:44.540> less<00:03:44.840> heat<00:03:45.170> transfer<00:03:45.860> from

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
that then means less heat transfer from

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.420 
that then means less heat transfer from
the<00:03:46.400> LEDs<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.690> tooth<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.320> that<00:03:49.130> then

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
the LEDs to the tooth and that then

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.850 
the LEDs to the tooth and that then
means<00:03:49.730> less<00:03:50.329> chances<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:51.019> any<00:03:51.140> kind<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.470> Popol

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
means less chances of any kind of Popol

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.470 
means less chances of any kind of Popol
inflammation<00:03:52.519> whether<00:03:52.730> reversible<00:03:53.360> or

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
inflammation whether reversible or
