there's three bases and there in like a
triangle<00:02:16.170> thingy<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.490> went<00:02:17.700> straight<00:02:18.150> to

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
triangle thingy and I went straight to

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.640 
triangle thingy and I went straight to
the<00:02:18.390> end<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.780> recorded<00:02:19.290> about<00:02:19.440> halfway

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650

through we win this it's 1230 820 right
now<00:02:26.150> but<00:02:27.150> would<00:02:27.300> actually<00:02:27.600> make<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.750> little<00:02:28.080> bit

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
now but would actually make a little bit

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.500 
now but would actually make a little bit
of<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.380> comeback<00:02:28.760> for<00:02:29.760> some<00:02:29.910> reason<00:02:30.150> alliance

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
mistakes just because everyone hits

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
resilience so yeah um took me two and a

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.430 
resilience so yeah um took me two and a
half<00:05:22.830> days<00:05:22.979> to<00:05:23.160> level<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.490> 85<00:05:23.760> um<00:05:24.240> yes<00:05:25.169> I<00:05:25.320> did

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
half days to level to 85 um yes I did

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.659 
half days to level to 85 um yes I did
sleep<00:05:26.810> but<00:05:27.810> I<00:05:27.840> did<00:05:28.139> have<00:05:29.070> to<00:05:29.130> go<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:29.400> class<00:05:29.580> and

basically went to hyjal Intel 81 and

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.390 
basically went to hyjal Intel 81 and
then<00:05:57.720> went<00:05:57.870> to<00:05:57.900> vast<00:05:58.110> year<00:05:58.320> to<00:05:58.650> 82<00:05:59.210> d<00:06:00.210> poem<00:06:00.479> 283

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
then went to vast year to 82 d poem 283

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.960 
then went to vast year to 82 d poem 283
oldham<00:06:02.400> 284<00:06:02.910> and<00:06:03.560> twilight<00:06:04.560> hands<00:06:04.890> 285<00:06:05.669> I

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
oldham 284 and twilight hands 285 I

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.510 
oldham 284 and twilight hands 285 I
pretty<00:06:06.720> much<00:06:06.840> did<00:06:07.080> this<00:06:07.200> just<00:06:07.500> to<00:06:07.650> get<00:06:08.400> the

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
pretty much did this just to get the

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.190 
pretty much did this just to get the
major<00:06:08.700> questing<00:06:09.180> hubs<00:06:09.360> out<00:06:09.479> of<00:06:09.570> the<00:06:09.630> way<00:06:09.750> hot<00:06:10.020> a

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
major questing hubs out of the way hot a

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.400 
major questing hubs out of the way hot a
little<00:06:10.530> dry<00:06:10.830> um<00:06:11.960> and<00:06:12.960> I<00:06:13.050> think<00:06:13.260> that's

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
little dry um and I think that's

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.540 
little dry um and I think that's
probably<00:06:13.590> what<00:06:13.830> made<00:06:13.919> the<00:06:14.070> leveling<00:06:14.340> a<00:06:14.370> little

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
probably what made the leveling a little

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.090 
probably what made the leveling a little
bit<00:06:14.669> faster<00:06:14.960> although<00:06:15.960> I<00:06:15.990> did<00:06:16.229> get<00:06:16.380> screwed<00:06:16.919> at

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
bit faster although I did get screwed at

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
about three percent and oldham before

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.170 
about three percent and oldham before
the<00:06:20.010> level<00:06:20.220> before<00:06:20.340> you<00:06:20.520> go<00:06:20.610> to<00:06:20.669> Highland<00:06:21.030> so<00:06:21.120> i

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
the level before you go to Highland so i

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.450

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
ended up grinding for it for a drop that

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.120 
ended up grinding for it for a drop that
unlocks<00:06:23.820> the<00:06:23.820> next<00:06:24.150> questing<00:06:24.510> zone<00:06:24.860> so<00:06:25.860> that

unlocks the next questing zone so that

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:29.500 
really nice I guess a sweep or the

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.590 
really nice I guess a sweep or the
opportunity<00:07:30.250> strikes<00:07:30.550> is<00:07:30.790> really<00:07:31.300> fucking

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:31.600 
opportunity strikes is really fucking

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.940 
opportunity strikes is really fucking
nice<00:07:31.720> although<00:07:31.960> it<00:07:32.110> doesn't<00:07:32.230> hit<00:07:32.440> hard<00:07:32.680> as

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:32.950 
nice although it doesn't hit hard as

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.850 
nice although it doesn't hit hard as
hard<00:07:33.669> i<00:07:33.880> should<00:07:34.030> say<00:07:34.210> um<00:07:34.419> as<00:07:35.230> mortal<00:07:35.620> strikes

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
hard i should say um as mortal strikes

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.890 
hard i should say um as mortal strikes
but<00:07:36.310> maybe<00:07:37.270> because<00:07:37.570> they're<00:07:37.660> not<00:07:37.750> as<00:07:37.870> a

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:37.900 
but maybe because they're not as a

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.990 
but maybe because they're not as a
parent<00:07:38.290> or<00:07:38.350> resilience<00:07:38.680> or<00:07:38.889> something<00:07:39.220> but

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 
parent or resilience or something but

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.700 
parent or resilience or something but
they<00:07:40.090> do<00:07:40.210> show<00:07:40.419> up<00:07:40.450> a<00:07:40.690> lot<00:07:40.960> like<00:07:41.260> all<00:07:41.440> over<00:07:41.470> the

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:41.710 
they do show up a lot like all over the

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.560 
they do show up a lot like all over the
place<00:07:41.800> i<00:07:43.860> think<00:07:44.860> that<00:07:45.180> 7800<00:07:46.180> was<00:07:46.360> a

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:46.570 
place i think that 7800 was a

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.170 
place i think that 7800 was a
opportunity<00:07:47.410> strikes<00:07:47.680> so<00:07:48.430> it<00:07:48.700> does<00:07:48.940> do<00:07:49.090> a<00:07:49.120> lot

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:49.180 
opportunity strikes so it does do a lot

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.760 
opportunity strikes so it does do a lot
of<00:07:49.330> damage<00:07:49.570> pretty<00:07:50.020> quickly<00:07:50.230> at<00:07:50.530> the<00:07:50.560> right

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:50.770 
of damage pretty quickly at the right

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.010 
of damage pretty quickly at the right
times<00:07:50.980> and<00:07:51.300> there's<00:07:52.300> my<00:07:52.450> battle<00:07:52.750> for<00:07:52.900> good

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:53.020 
times and there's my battle for good

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.169 
times and there's my battle for good
nice
