going to demonstrate today is an idea I

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.690 
going to demonstrate today is an idea I
had<00:00:06.000> for<00:00:06.270> some<00:00:06.810> at<00:00:06.990> home<00:00:07.189> fitness<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.370> stems

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
had for some at home fitness that stems

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.610 
had for some at home fitness that stems
from<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.150> background<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.719> climbing<00:00:10.260> and

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
from a background in climbing and

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.890 
from a background in climbing and
gymnastics<00:00:11.280> basically<00:00:12.059> there's<00:00:12.269> entire<00:00:12.719> to

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
gymnastics basically there's entire to

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.419 
gymnastics basically there's entire to
just<00:00:13.049> using<00:00:13.230> rings<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.980> high<00:00:14.130> bar<00:00:14.400> for

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
just using rings and a high bar for

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.760 
just using rings and a high bar for
doing<00:00:15.150> pull-ups<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.809> thought<00:00:16.049> be<00:00:16.260> cool<00:00:16.500> too

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
doing pull-ups and thought be cool too

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.099 
doing pull-ups and thought be cool too
very<00:00:17.100> step<00:00:17.460> up<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.820> vertical<00:00:18.390> pull<00:00:19.080> a

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
very step up with the vertical pull a

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.650 
very step up with the vertical pull a
bar<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.680> basically<00:00:20.010> came<00:00:20.490> up<00:00:20.609> with<00:00:20.789> these<00:00:21.000> PVC

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
bar so basically came up with these PVC

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.980 
bar so basically came up with these PVC
pipes<00:00:22.619> as<00:00:22.949> hanging<00:00:23.670> vertical<00:00:24.449> pull-up<00:00:24.779> bars

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
pipes as hanging vertical pull-up bars

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.589 
pipes as hanging vertical pull-up bars
and<00:00:25.369> they're<00:00:26.369> pretty<00:00:26.550> neat<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.119> use<00:00:27.390> them

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and they're pretty neat you can use them

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:36.560 
and they're pretty neat you can use them
to<00:00:27.750> do<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:27.900> basic<00:00:28.500> pull-ups<00:00:35.300> you<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.450> do

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
to do just basic pull-ups you can do

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.970 
to do just basic pull-ups you can do
some<00:00:36.719> core<00:00:36.960> strengthening<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.649> them<00:00:37.829> and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
some core strengthening with them and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.010 
some core strengthening with them and
note<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.460> they're<00:00:38.640> loose<00:00:39.210> wobbly<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:39.930> it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
note that they're loose wobbly so it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.209 
note that they're loose wobbly so it
makes<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> size<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> lot<00:00:41.010> more

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
makes you have a size a lot more

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.360 
makes you have a size a lot more
shoulder<00:00:41.700> stability<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:43.040> strength<00:00:44.040> through

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
shoulder stability and strength through

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.880 
shoulder stability and strength through
upper<00:00:44.700> body<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:45.989> some<00:00:46.200> me<00:00:46.379> or<00:00:46.649> leg

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
upper body so you can do some me or leg

00:00:46.890 --> 00:01:00.529 
upper body so you can do some me or leg
raises

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.209 

given<00:01:01.539> that<00:01:01.660> they're<00:01:01.809> kind<00:01:02.019> of<00:01:02.109> long<00:01:02.320> you<00:01:03.070> can

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
given that they're kind of long you can

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.580 
given that they're kind of long you can
actually<00:01:03.250> do<00:01:03.760> a<00:01:04.150> dyno<00:01:04.809> which<00:01:05.140> is<00:01:05.290> a<00:01:05.320> movement

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
actually do a dyno which is a movement

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.710 
actually do a dyno which is a movement
from<00:01:05.920> climbing<00:01:06.310> where<00:01:06.460> you<00:01:06.580> jump<00:01:07.299> up<00:01:07.450> higher

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
from climbing where you jump up higher

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.450 
from climbing where you jump up higher
so<00:01:08.470> if<00:01:08.590> you<00:01:08.680> start<00:01:08.920> at<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.070> bottom<00:01:09.399> of<00:01:09.549> them

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
so if you start at the bottom of them

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.960 
so if you start at the bottom of them
you<00:01:12.460> can<00:01:12.610> pull<00:01:12.790> up<00:01:12.930> pull<00:01:13.930> up<00:01:14.580> side<00:01:15.580> back<00:01:15.789> down

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
you can pull up pull up side back down

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.880 
you can pull up pull up side back down
it's<00:01:16.659> almost<00:01:16.869> like<00:01:17.049> a<00:01:17.080> progression<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.680> do<00:01:17.860> a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
it's almost like a progression to do a

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.560 
it's almost like a progression to do a
muscle<00:01:18.130> up<00:01:18.460> in<00:01:18.820> terms<00:01:19.000> of<00:01:19.180> that<00:01:19.299> dynamic

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
muscle up in terms of that dynamic

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.149 
muscle up in terms of that dynamic
ballistic<00:01:20.560> lift<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.750> build<00:01:22.930> those<00:01:23.229> all<00:01:23.920> you

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
ballistic lift so to build those all you

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.020 
ballistic lift so to build those all you
need<00:01:24.899> with<00:01:25.899> a<00:01:26.020> lil<00:01:26.320> pair<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.710> um<00:01:26.890> I<00:01:27.220> just<00:01:27.880> need
