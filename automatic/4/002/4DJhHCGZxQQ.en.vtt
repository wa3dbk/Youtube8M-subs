00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 piranhas in the northern dvina river predator 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.350
 caught a resident of Arkhangelsk a man like 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.139
 usually went fishing but this 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.780
 the catch day turned out to be shockingly hooked 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.400
 caught a fish with huge teeth fisherman 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.210
 I gave it for examination and specialists 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.300
 stated 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.400
 it is a piranha and a particularly dangerous species 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.779
 which even in tropical rivers 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.150
 you meet infrequently 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.730
 how the toothy predator hit the north 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.939
 latitude and what other surprises to expect 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.279
 local people figured out Alexei Knor for 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.219
 resident of arkhangelsk alexander korobova 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.200
 fishing is a way of life from childhood 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.840
 releases the bait and very well 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.570
 knows what kinds of fish are found in the north 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.200
 dvina such a catch man does not 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:52.020
 expected kind of. 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.660
 I order a friend 's hand to what kind 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.760
 refers caught fish alexander and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.620
 I did not understand the usual login in the same 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.719
 day reported to local fisheries but also 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.570
 is difficult to answer that immediately 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.130
 it is in shape 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.880
 knop 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.649
 scratch by the presence of fatty fin it 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.930
 very similar to salmon 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:20.619
 all ha in form only one does not happen 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.960
 In addition he had a scale teeth 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.390
 human understand who 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.429
 exactly caught the bait of Archangel 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.890
 the fisherman had to using a special 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.600
 literature on tropical fish fauna 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.880
 spectrum andrew blush looked 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.220
 several books and found out most likely in 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.099
 northern dvina caught purple pacu 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.530
 one of the most dangerous south american 

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:44.819
 river predators it is artificial 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:51.729
 carnivorous she eats nuts she and joules 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:54.670
 hitting the seeds can attack the animal 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.649
 may on 5 key for the final 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.209
 the verdict of the river predator sent 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.490
 expert of the Arkhangelsk branch 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:03.399
 Polar Institute of Marine Fisheries 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.610
 management and oceanography after inspection 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.459
 scientists made sure it 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.980
 south african piranha pacu 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.569
 but how predatory and very dangerous fish could 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.569
 be in the north dvina 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.700
 scientists put forward two versions according to 1 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.950
 piranha this year released into the river 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.520
 owner of an exotic aquarium 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.710
 decided for some reason 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.810
 get rid of the predator in that case 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.020
 residents of Arkhangelsk fear more 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.650
 nothing to fault conditions for such a fish 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.840
 extensive 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.670
 absolutely unacceptable the only thing that 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.680
 she could hardly live to see 7 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.470
 The only catch piranhas did not have 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.480
 sleepy while desperately fighting for life 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.640
 recalls the fisherman Alexander Boxes and 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.800
 apparently absolutely not going 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.630
 die 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.150
 this fact made scientists consider and 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.520
 another version and what if tropical 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.320
 the fish has mutated and somehow 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.960
 managed to adjust to low 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.910
 temperatures it is likely that piranha 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.340
 dwells in the river not the first year because 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.730
 it is not known exactly when pacu was released 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.880
 the length 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.980
 however it is not clear whether the other one is dangerous 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.660
 predator ruled in northern waters 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.790
 or there were several in Arkhangelsk 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.400
 Fishery Inspection Inspectorate ascertains 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.780
 now they will have to organize 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.770
 additional species control river 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.840
 fauna if the worst predictions come true then 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.600
 2015 swimming in the northern dvina can 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.400
 ban Alexei KNOR Dmitry Shtokolov
