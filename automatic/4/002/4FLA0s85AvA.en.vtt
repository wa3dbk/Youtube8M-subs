00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
and then what was looking into moving

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.440 
and then what was looking into moving
and<00:00:43.680> starting<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> new<00:00:44.460> complex<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.180> was<00:00:45.270> like

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and starting a new complex I was like

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.389 
and starting a new complex I was like
where<00:00:46.289> should<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.559> go<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:46.920> looked<00:00:47.129> into

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
where should I go and I looked into

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.400 
where should I go and I looked into
Raleigh<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.969> Raleigh<00:00:48.450> seemed<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.079> one<00:00:49.320> of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
Raleigh and Raleigh seemed like one of

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.139 
Raleigh and Raleigh seemed like one of
the<00:00:49.469> fastest<00:00:49.860> growing<00:00:50.010> economy<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.610> America

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
and when I looked in closer I looked at

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.880 
and when I looked in closer I looked at
Holly<00:00:53.910> Springs<00:00:54.180> which<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.870> where<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.379> complex

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
Holly Springs which is where the complex

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.529 
Holly Springs which is where the complex
is<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.340> that's<00:00:56.579> number<00:00:56.879> one<00:00:57.149> place<00:00:57.420> in

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
is and that's number one place in

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.069

America<00:00:57.710> for<00:00:58.710> families<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.930> made

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
America for families so it just made

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.750 
America for families so it just made
sense<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.559> know<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.129> when<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.309> moved<00:01:02.579> in

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
sense you know that when I moved in

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.509 
sense you know that when I moved in

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
intimidating for some just because I

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.820 
intimidating for some just because I
think<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:13.110> well-known<00:01:13.590> like

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
know I made sure that when I built the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.840 
know I made sure that when I built the
complex<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.560> was<00:01:19.740> something<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.520> can

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
complex it was something that I can

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.550

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
it's been great just because we've been

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.500 
it's been great just because we've been

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
able to to make that Daniel what is the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.180 
able to to make that Daniel what is the
the<00:02:39.780> most<00:02:39.990> amazing

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
the most amazing

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.580 
the most amazing
I<00:02:41.790> don't<00:02:42.060> know<00:02:42.150> trick<00:02:42.510> or<00:02:42.750> move<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.410> you've

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
I don't know trick or move that you've

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.170 
I don't know trick or move that you've
done<00:02:43.860> with<00:02:44.610> BMX<00:02:45.300> bicycles<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:47.250> maybe<00:02:47.910> three

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
done with BMX bicycles in maybe three

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.330 
done with BMX bicycles in maybe three
four<00:02:48.720> years<00:02:48.930> ago<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.290> invented<00:02:49.770> this<00:02:50.040> trick

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
four years ago I invented this trick

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.850 
four years ago I invented this trick
called<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.730> cash<00:02:50.970> roll<00:02:51.240> so<00:02:51.959> it's<00:02:52.500> kind<00:02:52.830> of

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
called the cash roll so it's kind of

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.530 
called the cash roll so it's kind of
hard<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.100> explain<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.580> probably<00:02:54.150> need<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.390> see

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
hard to explain you probably need to see

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.690 
hard to explain you probably need to see
a<00:02:54.570> video<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:55.080> it's<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.440> I'll<00:02:55.620> do<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.800> 180<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.490> do<00:02:56.670> a

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
a video but it's a I'll do a 180 I do a

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.880 
a video but it's a I'll do a 180 I do a
back<00:02:56.970> flip<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.390> then<00:02:57.450> another<00:02:57.750> 180<00:02:57.990> an<00:02:58.350> eight

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
back flip and then another 180 an eight

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.790 
back flip and then another 180 an eight
a<00:02:59.220> 180<00:02:59.760> a<00:03:00.060> back<00:03:00.390> flip<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.840> then<00:03:00.990> another<00:03:01.260> 180

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
a 180 a back flip and then another 180

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.520 
a 180 a back flip and then another 180
yes<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.180> little<00:03:03.360> intricate<00:03:03.870> move<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.290> don't

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
yes it's a little intricate move I don't

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.610 
yes it's a little intricate move I don't
really<00:03:04.730> bring<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.880> out<00:03:06.030> often<00:03:06.270> it's<00:03:06.690> it's<00:03:07.260> hard

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
really bring it out often it's it's hard

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.490 
really bring it out often it's it's hard
and<00:03:07.860> confusing<00:03:08.070> once<00:03:08.640> you're<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.000> air<00:03:09.030> but

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
and confusing once you're in the air but

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.980 
and confusing once you're in the air but
it's<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.590> great<00:03:10.770> trick
