00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
school I don't know how it happened it

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.449 
school I don't know how it happened it
just<00:02:15.489> sort<00:02:15.849> of<00:02:15.940> did<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:17.170> but<00:02:17.769> I<00:02:17.980> ended<00:02:18.280> up

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
just sort of did so but I ended up

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.559 
just sort of did so but I ended up
buying<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:19.120> size<00:02:19.510> 13<00:02:20.170> boots<00:02:20.200> because<00:02:21.569> they

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
buying the size 13 boots because they

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.720 
buying the size 13 boots because they
actually<00:02:23.019> go<00:02:23.170> all<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.650> way<00:02:23.680> up<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.160> 21<00:02:24.700> inch

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
actually go all the way up to a 21 inch

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.360 
actually go all the way up to a 21 inch
shaft<00:02:25.209> so<00:02:25.989> it's<00:02:26.530> enough<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:26.860> thing<00:02:27.220> will

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
shaft so it's enough that thing will

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.509 
shaft so it's enough that thing will
stay<00:02:27.610> on<00:02:27.849> and<00:02:28.180> they<00:02:28.690> will<00:02:28.840> actually<00:02:29.349> go<00:02:29.530> on<00:02:29.560> so

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
stay on and they will actually go on so

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.550 
stay on and they will actually go on so
I<00:02:30.549> am<00:02:31.030> full<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.299> squeak<00:02:31.870> about<00:02:32.170> having

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
I am full of squeak about having

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.240 
I am full of squeak about having
anything<00:02:33.220> like<00:02:33.670> this<00:02:34.019> so<00:02:35.019> it's<00:02:35.590> not<00:02:35.799> a<00:02:36.010> perfect

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
anything like this so it's not a perfect

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.130 
anything like this so it's not a perfect
fit<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.910> think<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.360> only<00:02:37.540> way<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:37.810> can<00:02:37.959> really

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
fit I think the only way you can really

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.900 
fit I think the only way you can really
get<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.190> have<00:02:39.340> them<00:02:39.519> custom-made

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
get that is to have them custom-made

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.500 
get that is to have them custom-made
these<00:02:40.299> days<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:41.220> custom<00:02:42.220> makers<00:02:42.640> start<00:02:43.269> going

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
these days and custom makers start going
