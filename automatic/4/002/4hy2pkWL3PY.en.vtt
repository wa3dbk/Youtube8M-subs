question<00:01:58.780> for<00:01:59.200> you<00:01:59.350> go<00:01:59.590> ahead<00:01:59.799> if<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.159> happen

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
question for you go ahead if you happen

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.480 
question for you go ahead if you happen
to<00:02:01.030> encounter<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.869> zombie<00:02:02.380> what<00:02:02.830> weapon<00:02:03.250> or

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
to encounter a zombie what weapon or

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.550 
to encounter a zombie what weapon or
object<00:02:03.850> which<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.060> use<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.240> slay<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:04.810> I<00:02:05.259> think

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
object which you use to slay it I think

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.170 
object which you use to slay it I think
the<00:02:05.619> sonic<00:02:05.950> erupter<00:02:06.369> would<00:02:06.520> be<00:02:06.640> good<00:02:06.820> because

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
the sonic erupter would be good because

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.630 
the sonic erupter would be good because
