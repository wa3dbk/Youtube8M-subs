which one of those get drag spots check

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.109 
which one of those get drag spots check
it<00:01:49.140> apart<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:50.340> know<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.880> don't<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.060> how

to do it

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.200 
to do it

look it up on YouTube and then basically
what<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:54.869> you're<00:01:55.049> gonna<00:01:55.140> get<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.950> ID

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
what you do is you're gonna get the ID

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.999 
what you do is you're gonna get the ID
to<00:01:56.729> USB<00:01:57.000> cable<00:01:57.180> whatever<00:01:57.750> you're<00:01:58.649> gonna<00:01:58.740> play

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
to USB cable whatever you're gonna play

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.410 
to USB cable whatever you're gonna play
it<00:01:59.070> into<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.340> USB<00:01:59.610> ports<00:02:00.149> back<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:01.080> so<00:02:02.420> and

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
it into a USB ports back like so and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.030 
it into a USB ports back like so and
you're<00:02:03.600> gonna<00:02:03.690> play<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.140> stereo<00:02:04.440> cable<00:02:04.619> here

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
you're gonna play the stereo cable here

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.510 
you're gonna play the stereo cable here
take<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:09.590> then<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.770> here<00:02:11.069> you're

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
take that and then this here you're

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.130 
take that and then this here you're
gonna<00:02:11.640> plug<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.030> into<00:02:12.150> your<00:02:12.390> action<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.989> your

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
gonna plug it into your action to your

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.130 
gonna plug it into your action to your
drive<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.090> they<00:02:15.090> don't<00:02:15.239> have<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.510> unplug<00:02:15.840> your

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
drive so they don't have to unplug your

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:29.110 
drive so they don't have to unplug your
drive<00:02:16.950> for<00:02:17.220> them<00:02:17.340> for

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.170 

so<00:02:30.819> looks<00:02:31.819> something<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:33.910> now<00:02:34.910> make

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
so looks something like that now make

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.610 
so looks something like that now make
sure<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:35.480> have<00:02:35.629> this<00:02:35.900> white<00:02:36.230> kid<00:02:36.440> over<00:02:36.590> here

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
sure you have this white kid over here

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.900 
sure you have this white kid over here
this<00:02:36.830> is<00:02:37.010> your<00:02:37.129> power<00:02:37.280> make<00:02:37.640> sure<00:02:37.760> that's

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
this is your power make sure that's

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.970 
this is your power make sure that's
plugged<00:02:38.239> in<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:39.500> basically<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:41.000> should<00:02:41.980> look

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
plugged in so basically you should look

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.490 
plugged in so basically you should look
like<00:02:43.010> this

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
like this

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.960 
like this
basically<00:02:47.230> leave<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.910> leave<00:02:49.910> that

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
basically leave that leave that

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.970 
basically leave that leave that
connected<00:02:50.660> like<00:02:50.780> that<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.620> what<00:02:51.830> you're

going to do is you're going to have a
PCI<00:02:54.140> card<00:02:54.230> install<00:02:55.220> on<00:02:55.370> your<00:02:55.400> computer<00:02:55.580> turn

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
PCI card install on your computer turn

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.830 
PCI card install on your computer turn
on<00:02:56.599> your<00:02:56.840> computer<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.470> then<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.879> know<00:02:58.970> then

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
on your computer and then you know then

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.470 
on your computer and then you know then

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
it moved up or whatever and then once

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.479 
it moved up or whatever and then once
the<00:03:02.690> machines<00:03:03.079> boot<00:03:03.319> up<00:03:03.470> what<00:03:04.160> you're<00:03:04.340> going

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
then you plug it into the PCI card on

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.270 
then you plug it into the PCI card on
that<00:03:22.579> slot<00:03:22.819> I<00:03:22.879> showed<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:23.360> earlier<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:24.280> that

this cable here then you plug it into a

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.520 
this cable here then you plug it into a
card<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.450> I'm<00:04:00.690> gonna<00:04:00.930> go<00:04:01.110> ahead<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:01.320> do<00:04:01.500> that

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
card so I'm gonna go ahead and do that

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
right so now you have a jungle flasher

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.490 
right so now you have a jungle flasher
turn<00:04:42.900> on<00:04:43.250> that<00:04:44.250> expose<00:04:44.640> just<00:04:45.030> turned<00:04:45.720> on<00:04:45.840> just

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
turn on that expose just turned on just

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.040 
turn on that expose just turned on just
what<00:04:46.650> you<00:04:46.800> do<00:04:46.950> is<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.880> plug<00:04:48.210> this<00:04:48.390> cable<00:04:48.450> here

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
what you do is you plug this cable here

what you do is you plug this cable here
and<00:04:51.620> some<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.580> plug<00:04:53.790> it<00:04:53.850> into<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.240> car

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
and some and you plug it into the car

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.660 
and some and you plug it into the car
and<00:04:55.200> right<00:04:55.440> so<00:04:55.620> he<00:04:55.710> wants<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.250> be<00:04:56.340> able<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.520> try

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
and right so he wants to be able to try

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:11.700 
and right so he wants to be able to try
to<00:04:56.700> do<00:04:56.910> this<00:04:57.060> here<00:04:57.330> with<00:04:58.140> one<00:04:58.380> hand

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
that's what clear but we get the idea so

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:35.620 
that's what clear but we get the idea so
now<00:05:27.010> you<00:05:27.070> come<00:05:27.430> over<00:05:27.580> here<00:05:27.850> to<00:05:28.030> jungle<00:05:28.360> flasher
