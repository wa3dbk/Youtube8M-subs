Sun today the road of april 2011 well
we've<00:00:07.080> had<00:00:07.109> some<00:00:07.350> excitement<00:00:07.620> after<00:00:08.040> 48<00:00:08.639> hours

we've had some excitement after 48 hours

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.790 
we've had some excitement after 48 hours
of<00:00:09.030> very<00:00:09.300> quiet<00:00:09.599> sort<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.960> conditions<00:00:10.410> we've

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
had a very sudden increase in the x-ray

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.919 
had a very sudden increase in the x-ray

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
Sun now this is either an increase in

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.160 
Sun now this is either an increase in
the<00:00:20.490> background<00:00:20.939> due<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.480> growth<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.050> new

the background due to growth of a new

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.349 
the background due to growth of a new

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
region or a very long duration flare and

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.759 
region or a very long duration flare and
I<00:00:24.660> think<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:24.990> actually<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.289> combination<00:00:25.470> of

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
I think it's actually a combination of

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.950 
I think it's actually a combination of
two<00:00:25.890> which<00:00:26.160> will<00:00:26.310> see<00:00:26.519> as<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:26.640> go<00:00:26.849> along<00:00:26.970> let's

news is that the region 1184 that all
but<00:00:44.610> disappeared<00:00:45.120> yesterday<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:46.230> made<00:00:46.440> a

but disappeared yesterday have made a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.080 
but disappeared yesterday have made a
roaring<00:00:46.920> return<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.820> quite<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
roaring return and we have quite a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.270 
roaring return and we have quite a
decent<00:00:48.329> sized<00:00:48.690> reach<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:49.469> there<00:00:50.100> is

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
decent sized reach in there now there is

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.549 
decent sized reach in there now there is
just<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.670> hint<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.210> couple<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.570> spots<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
just a hint of a couple of spots in the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.380 
just a hint of a couple of spots in the
region<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.039> rotating<00:00:53.489> over<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.850> slim<00:00:54.239> at

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
region that is rotating over the slim at

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.700 
region that is rotating over the slim at
the<00:00:54.480> moment<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.020> we'd<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.320> wait<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the moment but we'd have to wait for a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.170 
the moment but we'd have to wait for a
day<00:00:55.860> or<00:00:56.010> two<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.520> region<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.850> rotate

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
day or two for the region to rotate

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.880 
day or two for the region to rotate
further<00:00:57.420> onto<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.899> disk<00:00:58.050> before<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:58.739> can

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
further onto the disk before we can

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.319 
further onto the disk before we can
confirm<00:00:59.190> whether<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.609> spots<00:00:59.910> are<00:01:00.059> really

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
confirm whether the spots are really

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.240 
confirm whether the spots are really
there<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.570> not<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> development

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
there or not you can see the development

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.390 
there or not you can see the development
of<00:01:02.520> region<00:01:02.850> 1184<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:04.229> both<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> sunspot<00:01:05.040> movie

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
of region 1184 in both the sunspot movie

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.460 
of region 1184 in both the sunspot movie
and<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.820> Magnetic<00:01:06.270> movie<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:07.080> keep<00:01:07.229> an<00:01:07.350> eye

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and the Magnetic movie just keep an eye

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.440 
and the Magnetic movie just keep an eye
on<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> area<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.100> eastern<00:01:08.490> region<00:01:08.700> 1183

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
on the area to the eastern region 1183

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.270 
on the area to the eastern region 1183
and<00:01:09.840> you'll<00:01:09.960> see<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.260> new<00:01:10.500> sunspot<00:01:10.950> region

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and you'll see this new sunspot region

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
and you'll see this new sunspot region
grow<00:01:11.460> very<00:01:11.729> rapidly<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.900> reason<00:01:16.140> why<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.290> think

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
grow very rapidly the reason why I think

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.230 
grow very rapidly the reason why I think
the<00:01:16.619> x-ray<00:01:16.920> background<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.490> increasing<00:01:17.970> due

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the x-ray background is increasing due

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.060 
the x-ray background is increasing due
to<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.479> long-duration<00:01:18.780> flare<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.710> seen<00:01:19.920> in

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
to a long-duration flare can be seen in

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.679 
to a long-duration flare can be seen in
the<00:01:20.100> helium<00:01:20.460> 2<00:01:20.670> movie<00:01:21.030> there's<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.479> large

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the helium 2 movie there's a large

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.179 
the helium 2 movie there's a large
eruption<00:01:22.110> from<00:01:22.140> revenants<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.860> beach<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
eruption from revenants of beach and

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.609 
eruption from revenants of beach and
1176<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> think<00:01:24.780> there's<00:01:25.110> renewed<00:01:25.290> growth

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
1176 so I think there's renewed growth

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.620 
1176 so I think there's renewed growth
there<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.549> becomes<00:01:26.850> more<00:01:27.000> plain<00:01:27.330> when<00:01:27.540> you

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
there this becomes more plain when you

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
there this becomes more plain when you
look<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.049> coronal<00:01:28.680> images<00:01:29.070> there<00:01:29.310> is

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
look at the coronal images there is

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.280 
look at the coronal images there is
obviously<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.790> large<00:01:30.150> flare<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:30.990> there

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
obviously a large flare going on there

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:46.680 
obviously a large flare going on there
just<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> movie<00:01:32.520> ends

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.580 

unfortunately<00:01:47.690> do<00:01:47.780> not<00:01:47.810> have<00:01:48.050> any<00:01:48.200> data<00:01:48.350> from

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
unfortunately do not have any data from

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.350 
unfortunately do not have any data from
the<00:01:48.680> seller<00:01:48.920> chronograph<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:49.880> fortunately

supplemental video to show what's going

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.620 
supplemental video to show what's going
on<00:02:15.830> there<00:02:16.070> it<00:02:16.250> should<00:02:16.430> be<00:02:16.580> spectacular<00:02:17.270> so

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
on there it should be spectacular so

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.330 
on there it should be spectacular so
keep<00:02:17.780> an<00:02:17.900> eye<00:02:17.990> out<00:02:18.020> for<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.440> if<00:02:18.980> we<00:02:19.160> look<00:02:19.250> at

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
keep an eye out for that if we look at

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.920 
keep an eye out for that if we look at
the<00:02:19.459> whole<00:02:19.610> Sun<00:02:19.970> from<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.450> point<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.750> view<00:02:20.810> of

both stereo spacecraft and the Solar
Dynamics<00:02:23.120> Observatory<00:02:23.570> we<00:02:24.350> see<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.680> we<00:02:24.770> have

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
Dynamics Observatory we see that we have

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.500 
Dynamics Observatory we see that we have
quite<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.370> few<00:02:25.430> meetings<00:02:25.760> on<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.120> district

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
quite a few meetings on the district

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.330 
quite a few meetings on the district
moment<00:02:26.900> but<00:02:27.230> there<00:02:27.380> are<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.590> couple<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.280> are

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
moment but there are a couple that are

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.210 
moment but there are a couple that are
due<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.730> come<00:02:28.880> on<00:02:29.150> in<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.600> next<00:02:29.900> few<00:02:30.080> days<00:02:30.320> most

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
due to come on in the next few days most

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.580 
due to come on in the next few days most
important<00:02:31.670> thing<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:31.970> region<00:02:32.630> 1184<00:02:33.380> is

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
important thing is that region 1184 is

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.740 
important thing is that region 1184 is
growing<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:34.430> we<00:02:34.550> can<00:02:34.670> expect<00:02:35.030> some<00:02:35.330> excitement

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
growing so we can expect some excitement

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.660 
growing so we can expect some excitement
from<00:02:36.020> that<00:02:36.260> if<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.709> growth<00:02:36.950> continues<00:02:37.550> at

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
from that if that growth continues at

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.340 
from that if that growth continues at
the<00:02:37.760> rate<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.209> has<00:02:38.420> been<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:39.050> Aurora

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
the rate that it has been the Aurora

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.380 
the rate that it has been the Aurora
lark<00:02:39.739> remains<00:02:40.160> unsettled<00:02:40.880> as<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.239> was

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
lark remains unsettled as it was

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.830 
lark remains unsettled as it was
yesterday<00:02:41.830> with<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.860> KP<00:02:43.610> index<00:02:44.180> of<00:02:44.480> between

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
yesterday with a KP index of between

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.600 
yesterday with a KP index of between
three<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.260> four<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:46.100> result<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.489> we

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
three and four the result is that we

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.190 
three and four the result is that we
have<00:02:46.790> some<00:02:46.940> more<00:02:47.120> spectacular<00:02:47.690> images<00:02:47.989> of

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
have some more spectacular images of

science from the artistic as well here's
the<00:03:01.220> KP<00:03:01.700> index<00:03:02.030> which<00:03:02.210> is<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.420> measure<00:03:02.630> of<00:03:02.750> the

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
activity of the Aurora art and you can

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.490 
activity of the Aurora art and you can
see<00:03:05.090> it's<00:03:05.210> been<00:03:05.360> basically<00:03:05.540> varying<00:03:06.410> between

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
see it's been basically varying between

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.280 
see it's been basically varying between
three<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:06.950> four<00:03:07.310> so<00:03:08.240> in<00:03:08.360> summary<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.900> sunspot

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
three and four so in summary the sunspot

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.370 
three and four so in summary the sunspot
number<00:03:09.590> remains<00:03:10.040> low<00:03:10.340> 66<00:03:11.180> but<00:03:11.840> I<00:03:11.900> suspect<00:03:12.080> that

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
number remains low 66 but I suspect that

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.050 
number remains low 66 but I suspect that
that<00:03:12.470> will<00:03:12.740> increase<00:03:13.190> over<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.580> next<00:03:13.670> day<00:03:14.030> or

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
that will increase over the next day or

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.180 
that will increase over the next day or

what's the forecast well I expect that
solar<00:03:33.650> activity<00:03:33.800> will<00:03:34.370> be<00:03:34.400> moderate<00:03:34.940> as<00:03:35.120> an
