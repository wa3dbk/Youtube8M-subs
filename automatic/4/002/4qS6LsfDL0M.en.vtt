00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
same thing on the other side now you end

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.599 
same thing on the other side now you end
up<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:01.020> something<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.800> almost<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
up with something that's almost a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.329

corner cut off keep that in mind

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.780 
corner cut off keep that in mind
would<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.830> be<00:01:07.979> doing<00:01:08.100> something<00:01:08.220> about<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.760> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
would you be doing something about in a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.149 
would you be doing something about in a
moment<00:01:08.909> then<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> diamond<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.799> folded

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
moment then that the diamond have folded

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.460 
moment then that the diamond have folded
across<00:01:11.280> towards<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> middle<00:01:12.360> two<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.290> this
