00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:09.269
 good day let's play on level 1 578 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:11.940
 but let's play again because 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.440
 we played a couple of days ago and already 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.560
 changed 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.060
 they added more mascotitas they asked for 10 now 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.060
 they ask 15 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.830
 the methodology is exactly the same 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.820
 have to play in this part I'm 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.010
 playing there abajito 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.310
 to go down the pets that are 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.750
 the right side 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:39.720
 but go playing on the left side 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.330
 to lower the other pets that are going to 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.010
 going out on that side what has the 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.590
 left side is that they have to go 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.830
 calculating with the with the pump to go 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.930
 weakening the cages if not at each 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.530
 while they will be locked the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.850
 mascots 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.850
 so it has a little bit more 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.180
 of complication to those on the right side 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.940
 but they are closer 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.610
 with fewer movements we will take the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.070
 pets and see sometimes seem like 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.170
 they come from hamas to the left but 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.260
 has a complication of cells if 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.690
 can deal with that 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.690
 take from the left but be 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.200
 playing only right there and 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.510
 try your luck 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.580
 I would tell him that 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.580
 try to deal with the factories 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.260
 they weaken with the pump 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.500
 and when it falls it touches the floor it goes away 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.360
 it breaks is always the same with the pump 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.340
 from above or with the official fort in 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.230
 this case I'm going to use the fort 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.260
 official but if I did not have to lower the 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.480
 pump I will do exactly the same 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.420
 with the other cages that come the same 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:05.740
 and so on half monotonous 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.340
 the level but you have to measure the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.340
 movements 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.200
 with the calm and they will be able to pass 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.320
 maybe not the first one but they're going to 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.320
 happen 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.690
 I repeat the same thing 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.610
 in other levels and it is not my fault 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.100
 the levels change I do not have it 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.410
 that when I was in 10 movements 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.530
 of some seem angry because to 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.450
 they asked them 15 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.530
 there are times that they go up to hinder the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.810
 levels there are times that lower them 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.910
 the 217 I play it when it was 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:48.290
 extremely difficult totally totally 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.290
 unlikely that they would not pass without a booster 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.840
 there I have it in my saved collection 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.040
 it was the only level of so far in 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.069
 the whole history of the pp that I had to 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.769
 spend some type of booster 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.090
 that's why I let him never authorize him 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.120
 new that is easier 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.300
 but there are times that they modify it to 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.270
 make them more difficult like in this case 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.050
 You can also lower the level 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.050
 I hope you can spend it 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.060
 we can not in the next have a great 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.810
 day 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.810
 regards
