00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
some change in every album you release

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
some change in every album you release
for<00:01:18.210> example<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> previous<00:01:18.869> one<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.350> you

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
for example the previous one and you

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.370 
for example the previous one and you
play<00:01:19.770> with<00:01:19.979> kam<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.390> are<00:01:21.810> four

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380

people<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> van<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.869> always<00:01:25.229> tend<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
people in the van so you always tend to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.819 
people in the van so you always tend to
change<00:01:26.990> keeping<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.200> essence<00:01:30.530> did<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.650> say

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
change keeping your essence did you say

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.460 
change keeping your essence did you say
to<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.460> intend<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.450> change<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.110> want

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
to you is intend to change like we want

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.090 
to you is intend to change like we want
to<00:01:34.530> keep<00:01:34.680> changing<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:36.829> think<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.009> just

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
to keep changing it I think it's just

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.039 
to keep changing it I think it's just
something<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.700> happens<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.450> know<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> think

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
something that happens you know I think

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.319 
something that happens you know I think
each<00:01:40.409> album<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.369> react<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.880> what<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.180> did

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
each album you react to what you did

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.770 
each album you react to what you did
with<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> album<00:01:42.899> before<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.829> we<00:01:44.009> don't

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
with the album before and we don't

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.240 
with the album before and we don't
sometimes<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.930> go<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.290> with<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> plan<00:01:46.770> but

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
sometimes we go in with a plan but

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.770 
sometimes we go in with a plan but
whatever<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.030> think<00:01:48.270> you're<00:01:48.420> going<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> do

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
whatever you think you're going to do

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.690 
whatever you think you're going to do
you<00:01:49.020> don't<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:49.890> end<00:01:50.070> up<00:01:50.189> making<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
you don't do you just end up making a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.080 
you don't do you just end up making a
record<00:01:51.030> that's<00:01:51.710> what<00:01:52.710> evers<00:01:52.950> inside<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.850> I

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
record that's what evers inside you so I

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.179 
record that's what evers inside you so I
think<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.170> would<00:01:55.290> always<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.619> different

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
think it would always be different

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:56.610 
think it would always be different
because

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
because

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.440 
because
you<00:01:57.070> know<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.670> songs<00:01:57.910> will<00:01:58.150> be<00:01:58.270> about

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
you know the songs will be about

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.180 
you know the songs will be about
different<00:01:58.870> things<00:01:58.900> and<00:01:59.350> we<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.890> know<00:02:00.010> our

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
different things and we you know our

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.770 
different things and we you know our
lives<00:02:00.400> will<00:02:00.610> change<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:01.060> way<00:02:01.180> we<00:02:01.330> play<00:02:01.570> will

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
lives will change the way we play will

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.920 
lives will change the way we play will
change<00:02:02.050> and<00:02:02.730> you<00:02:03.730> know<00:02:03.880> Tim<00:02:04.450> will<00:02:04.600> have<00:02:04.630> born

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930
