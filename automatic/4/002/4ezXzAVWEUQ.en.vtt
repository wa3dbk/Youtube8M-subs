I think as long as we maintain that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.990 
I think as long as we maintain that
sense<00:02:06.660> of<00:02:06.900> personal<00:02:07.200> intimacy<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.160> no

sense of personal intimacy that no

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.790 
sense of personal intimacy that no

matter how large as he gets you'll still

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.530 
matter how large as he gets you'll still
have<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.459> sense<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.820> intimacy<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
platform but how big do you want to grow

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.100 
platform but how big do you want to grow
do<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.700> want<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.090> pee<00:02:15.150> Oh<00:02:15.330> on<00:02:15.570> your<00:02:15.600> own<00:02:15.870> I

do you want to I pee Oh on your own I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.570 
do you want to I pee Oh on your own I
think<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.530> outcome<00:02:16.709> threats<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.250> could<00:02:17.430> be

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
think one outcome threats it could be

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.030 
think one outcome threats it could be
being<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.970> public<00:02:18.270> company<00:02:18.300> but<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.840> think<00:02:19.050> in

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
being a public company but I think in

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.860 
being a public company but I think in
many<00:02:20.610> ways<00:02:20.760> that's<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.300> legal<00:02:21.600> structure

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
many ways that's just a legal structure

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.900 
many ways that's just a legal structure
I<00:02:22.260> think<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.950> way<00:02:23.070> we<00:02:23.250> think<00:02:23.400> about<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.790> is

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
I think the the way we think about it is

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.180 
I think the the way we think about it is
just<00:02:24.150> being<00:02:24.300> independent<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.100> serving<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
just being independent and serving the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.930 
just being independent and serving the
community

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.000
