00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
I'll have it jump to slide 4 instead now

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.840 
I'll have it jump to slide 4 instead now
on<00:01:52.720> slide<00:01:53.720> 3<00:01:54.320> it's<00:01:54.530> incorrect<00:01:54.830> I<00:01:55.280> want<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.700> have

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
on slide 3 it's incorrect I want to have

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.690 
on slide 3 it's incorrect I want to have
a<00:01:56.060> hyperlink<00:01:56.570> here<00:01:56.840> on<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.259> words<00:01:57.710> try<00:01:58.190> again

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
a hyperlink here on the words try again

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.730 
a hyperlink here on the words try again
and<00:01:59.410> that<00:02:00.410> will<00:02:00.940> jump<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:03.759> slide<00:02:04.759> number<00:02:05.290> 2<00:02:06.290> to

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
and that will jump to slide number 2 to

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.370 
and that will jump to slide number 2 to
give<00:02:06.890> them<00:02:07.040> another<00:02:07.190> chance<00:02:08.020> here<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.050> can

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
give them another chance here I can

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.110 
give them another chance here I can
actually<00:02:09.530> assign<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:11.330> ability<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.780> jump<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.650> a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
actually assign the ability to jump to a

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.990 
actually assign the ability to jump to a
slide<00:02:14.120> 5<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.989> next<00:02:15.290> slide<00:02:15.550> when<00:02:16.550> that's<00:02:16.700> there

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
slide 5 the next slide when that's there

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.080 
slide 5 the next slide when that's there
or<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:17.330> could<00:02:18.050> have<00:02:18.260> just<00:02:18.769> had<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.100> go<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.280> the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
or I could have just had it go to the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.509 
or I could have just had it go to the
next<00:02:20.930> slide<00:02:21.230> here<00:02:21.799> which<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.070> what<00:02:22.310> I'm<00:02:22.400> going

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
next slide here which is what I'm going

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.770 
next slide here which is what I'm going
to<00:02:22.549> do<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:22.850> we'll<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.150> jump<00:02:23.299> onto<00:02:23.480> matically

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
to do so we'll just jump onto matically

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.150 
to do so we'll just jump onto matically
to<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.019> next<00:02:24.230> slide<00:02:24.320> which<00:02:24.470> would<00:02:24.650> be<00:02:24.769> the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
to the next slide which would be the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.840 
to the next slide which would be the
next<00:02:25.310> question<00:02:26.739> now<00:02:27.739> when<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.370> play<00:02:30.549> it'll<00:02:31.549> ask

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
next question now when I play it'll ask

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.530 
next question now when I play it'll ask
