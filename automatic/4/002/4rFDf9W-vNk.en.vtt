00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
enthusiastic and run away for them it

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.840 
enthusiastic and run away for them it
might<00:01:34.170> actually<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.770> some<00:01:34.950> good<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.130> turn<00:01:35.579> on

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
might actually do some good and turn on

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.489 
might actually do some good and turn on
the<00:01:35.880> center<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.659> example<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.170> they<00:01:37.289> left

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:37.499 
the center for example if they left

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:39.560 
the center for example if they left
flank<00:01:37.770> wins<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.789> don't<00:01:38.969> know<00:01:39.030> how<00:01:39.149> your<00:01:39.329> left

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
leaders is of course very important it's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.459 
leaders is of course very important it's
a<00:01:47.609> character-driven<00:01:47.999> game<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
a character-driven game so the

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:50.749 
a character-driven game so the
characters<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.950> different<00:01:50.249> skills<00:01:50.490> and

characters have different skills and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.279 
characters have different skills and
attributes<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.299> martial<00:01:51.719> skill<00:01:51.929> is<00:01:52.049> one<00:01:52.200> of

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
will of course be more effective than

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.419 
will of course be more effective than
one<00:01:56.189> with<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> poor<00:01:56.579> martial<00:01:56.999> skill<00:01:58.399> also<00:01:59.399> a

one with a poor martial skill also a
good<00:01:59.819> general<00:02:00.179> will<00:02:00.450> pick<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> better<00:02:00.869> tactic

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
good general will pick a better tactic

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.529 
good general will pick a better tactic
because<00:02:01.799> there<00:02:02.549> are<00:02:02.670> different<00:02:02.969> tactics<00:02:03.420> to

because there are different tactics to

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.770
