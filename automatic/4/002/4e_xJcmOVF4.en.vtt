00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.219
 Today we are dedicated to a topic in what 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.580
 Recently asked more often by you 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.440
 has been 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.809
 and look first the back wheel 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.609
 more particularly important 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.619
 during assembly disassembly 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.260
 But above all, whether it is cold and 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.880
 set track so go then 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.390
 Let's start with disassembly first 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.250
 on 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.859
 in the first step we make sure that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.000
 the stop light couples on the way comes 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.130
 next we'll take care of that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.649
 Axel's work is divided into two parts 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.969
 and this is best suited a 900th 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.250
 nut we at on the left side 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.050
 the stock sat now on the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.520
 right side with turns when the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.440
 screw connection of the two axle parts in 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.030
 inner probably already some chimneys 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.989
 if that is the case we pull on the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.910
 right side in the mother too 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.160
 First aid and then try on the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.660
 left side again after a dream 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.879
 turns can then be the axis 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.930
 remove easily 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.489
 next comes the spacer 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.980
 down which is sloping behind 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.300
 should be deducted 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.800
 now the wheel should be free and 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.780
 can be removed under the armor 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.100
 if he is alone, hang up 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.900
 in any case something under the main stand 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.260
 then you have much more room for that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.880
 remove rear wheel if you have it now 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.740
 the tire changes gold looks best 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.600
 Up here I have you in the video of me 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.070
 link if not then we need 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.450
 the wheel now again and take care of us 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.740
 then in chain tension and track 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.270
 attitude if you yours 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.680
 Rear brake in advance what to do good 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.720
 I want to get in there then 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.729
 brake drum threatens air or with a 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.439
 rag and brake cleaner but respect 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.119
 if still the original brake pads 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.220
 are then best worn one 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.170
 respiratory protection because the old as best evidence 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.790
 are toxic 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.710
 now my favorite task comes because 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.210
 These three weeks have to come back 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.259
 take in her and that can be under 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.070
 circumstances sometimes a few minutes 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.840
 take longer 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.250
 Some names also put back first 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.649
 the axle through and frieze then 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.329
 Carefully the wheel in me personally 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.270
 but come with the order shown 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.439
 Much better works 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.270
 so that the axle still a few years 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.090
 keeps we had this best spot 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.320
 with regard to 1 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.270
 After that, the axle and spacer can be used 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.350
 remounted now is 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.450
 exciting because now we come to 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.710
 Fine adjustment of the rear wheel and for it 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.140
 are the span on the left and 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.670
 right side responsible the axis ever 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.590
 pull backwards after a span 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.390
 the tensioner is on the right side 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.280
 also responsible for the chain tension 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.080
 and with that we also start directly 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.819
 look for a helper from yours 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.459
 Weight class for you 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.230
 meanwhile you release the axle 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.630
 on the right side and pulls the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.250
 nut on the right tensioner as far as to 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.530
 the chain in the chain hose about one 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.060
 until two centimeters has game where I 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.190
 personally because the motto would go 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.440
 rather too loose than too tight so falls 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.329
 it's better to put two inches around it 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.920
 check chain tension pushes the 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.690
 chain hose together and tries 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.640
 to move the chain up and down 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.430
 Crucial is the game of the chain and 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.870
 not the floppy loop if the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.269
 Tensioned chain pulls the axle 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.769
 Right again, now a helper must 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.239
 on the moped the handlebar in straight 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.250
 exhibition brings you and yourself 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.500
 let as much time as possible for the wheel 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.200
 should end straight ahead as far as possible 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.630
 Now we need a long show 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.519
 the best possible straight object 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.959
 suitable for this is a wooden slat and 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.880
 so that now the tire trail 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.130
 be adjusted so that both mature in 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.739
 Driving a line lays the wooden slats 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.359
 and flush passed to the front engage 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.459
 the wooden lath would have to be so flush now 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.810
 also on the rear wheel offer so no 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.060
 splits more between latte and 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.349
 if that should be behind mature because 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.209
 the case is still on the 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.950
 left side the axis can be solved and 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.389
 the mother is tense accordingly 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.310
 or relaxed 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.010
 depending on how the wheel is corrected 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.160
 must be the mother, for example 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.690
 dressed 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.819
 you pull the axis at the same time left 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.430
 back and the wheel is right 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.200
 therefore , if both mature in exactly 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.790
 stand a line then let yours 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.230
 helper refurbishes neatly in 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.810
 Release the brake and pull 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.250
 meanwhile, left axis fixed this 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.079
 ensures in the last step that the 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.299
 rear wheel brake is optimally centered 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.630
 once the tire track has stopped 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.470
 is 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.360
 then you do not need that so fast 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.520
 let's do it again so time 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.050
 works carefully and controlled 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.270
 Your result until you are satisfied 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.310
 If you then in the course of time the 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.630
 chain tension is then you need the 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.910
 track not extra again from scratch 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.650
 but can equal many 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.420
 turns on both sides one 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.730
 to make each other exciting and stay that way 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.020
 tension the track straight at the chain and 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.790
 Of course there are traces again 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.690
 some approaches how to do that 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.100
 can tackle whole 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.110
 I have the method today 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.739
 I used and used what 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.540
 should I say 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.610
 about the mobility has complained 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.860
 I never complained anything 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.210
 overall pretty round so i can 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.860
 you only recommend the method 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.060
 Just try it out and in that 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.060
 until next time
