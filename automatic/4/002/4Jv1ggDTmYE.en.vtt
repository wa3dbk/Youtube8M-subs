this<00:00:22.090> is<00:00:22.270> what<00:00:22.960> I<00:00:22.990> use<00:00:23.230> most<00:00:23.500> of<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:23.710> time<00:00:23.770> as

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
this is what I use most of the time as

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.670 
this is what I use most of the time as
to<00:00:24.310> Juno<00:00:24.580> 106<00:00:24.760> it's<00:00:25.300> like<00:00:25.450> very<00:00:26.170> versatile

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
to Juno 106 it's like very versatile

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.120 
to Juno 106 it's like very versatile
synthesizer<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.680> then<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:31.090> ms-20<00:00:31.990> mini<00:00:32.140> and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
synthesizer and then to ms-20 mini and

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.460 
synthesizer and then to ms-20 mini and
it's<00:00:33.640> exactly<00:00:33.850> like<00:00:34.060> the<00:00:34.240> old<00:00:34.360> ms-20<00:00:35.170> but<00:00:35.320> it's

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
it's exactly like the old ms-20 but it's

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.220 
it's exactly like the old ms-20 but it's
um<00:00:35.770> but<00:00:36.670> it<00:00:36.790> takes<00:00:36.970> MIDI<00:00:37.360> which<00:00:37.540> is<00:00:37.720> good<00:00:37.900> and

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
um but it takes MIDI which is good and

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.700 
um but it takes MIDI which is good and
then<00:00:38.890> this<00:00:38.950> is<00:00:39.130> based<00:00:39.370> on<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:39.730> line<00:00:39.880> online

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
then this is based on the line online

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.070 
then this is based on the line online
drum<00:00:41.710> machine<00:00:42.010> I<00:00:42.850> mainly<00:00:43.420> collect<00:00:43.870> like

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.160 
drum machine I mainly collect like
techno<00:00:44.770> and<00:00:45.750> throwing<00:00:46.750> music<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.410> guess<00:00:49.170> it's

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
techno and throwing music I guess it's

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.140 
techno and throwing music I guess it's
important<00:00:50.680> for<00:00:50.800> me<00:00:50.950> to<00:00:51.130> be<00:00:51.520> authentic<00:00:52.030> and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
important for me to be authentic and

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.150 
important for me to be authentic and
genuine<00:00:52.750> especially<00:00:53.589> when<00:00:53.710> it<00:00:53.800> comes<00:00:53.920> to

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
genuine especially when it comes to

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
genuine especially when it comes to
lyrics<00:00:55.260> otherwise<00:00:56.260> when<00:00:56.800> I<00:00:56.830> perform<00:00:57.339> the<00:00:57.940> song

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
lyrics otherwise when I perform the song

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.020 
lyrics otherwise when I perform the song
or<00:00:58.629> that's<00:00:58.870> in<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.110> studio<00:00:59.470> or<00:00:59.850> playing<00:01:00.850> it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
or that's in the studio or playing it

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.530 
or that's in the studio or playing it
live<00:01:01.530> very<00:01:02.530> easy<00:01:02.739> to<00:01:03.010> see<00:01:03.190> if<00:01:03.489> you<00:01:04.089> know<00:01:04.210> for

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
live very easy to see if you know for

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.380 
live very easy to see if you know for
other<00:01:04.629> people<00:01:04.989> maybe<00:01:05.320> they<00:01:05.410> won't<00:01:05.830> believe<00:01:06.040> it

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
other people maybe they won't believe it
