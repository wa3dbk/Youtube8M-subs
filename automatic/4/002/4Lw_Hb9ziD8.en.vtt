 If you can not log in to any site, mail, 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.420
 YouTube, it does not matter .... 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:29.900
 And from other browsers it turns out, but not from the opera. 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:41.890
 I enter login, password, click, enter, but no sense 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.879
 no - nothing happens ... 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:01:02.860
 And nothing helps, and the cookie is deleted, and the cache is cleaned, 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:14.850
 and the settings were all shaken up, and the opera was deleted, reinstalled 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.350
 - nothing helped. 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:35.830
 If you have such nonsense, If you can not enter either 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:50.810
 on the site, or exit, you can do as I did. 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.050
 To start, I saved the bookmarks. 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.750
 But this folder, which opens with this, it 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.920
 not deleted if delete opera. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.890
 I saved the bookmark file in a different location, and this folder 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.690
 Opera in aplikashen date also deleted. 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.590
 Here I delete the opera. 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.660
 And now I delete the opera folder in the aplication date. 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.000
 If the date folder is not visible, then it is necessary in the properties 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.430
 folders put a dot in front of the line - show hidden 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.330
 files and folders. 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.330
 Apply. 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.670
 And now I delete the opera folder in the application date folder. 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.209
 Now I install the opera again. 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.110
 And it works. 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.280
 I go to the mail in YouTube ...
