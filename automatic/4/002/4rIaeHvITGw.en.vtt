00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
way which is good and it closes pretty

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:56.990

and so this is a storage solution for
your<00:03:08.250> Skylanders<00:03:08.940> if<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:10.140> have<00:03:10.320> any<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.460> if

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
your Skylanders if you have any and if

your Skylanders if you have any and if
not<00:03:11.760> it's<00:03:12.030> good<00:03:12.240> for<00:03:12.540> any<00:03:12.810> sort<00:03:13.050> of<00:03:13.290> figuring

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
not it's good for any sort of figuring

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.280 
not it's good for any sort of figuring
with<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.190> circle<00:03:14.940> base<00:03:15.120> but<00:03:15.540> make<00:03:15.750> sure<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:16.170> it

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
with a circle base but make sure that it

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.280 
with a circle base but make sure that it
fits<00:03:16.320> before<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.420> get<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.570> but<00:03:18.900> there<00:03:19.110> was

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
fits before you get it but there was

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.930 
fits before you get it but there was
tape<00:03:19.530> on<00:03:19.740> it<00:03:19.770> so<00:03:20.130> I'm<00:03:20.430> not<00:03:20.610> sure<00:03:20.760> how<00:03:20.880> you

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
tape on it so I'm not sure how you

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.890 
tape on it so I'm not sure how you
figure<00:03:21.450> out<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:22.560> this<00:03:23.100> is<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.250> cheap<00:03:23.660> quick<00:03:24.660> and

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900
