00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.410
 European territory of Russia has brought 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.780
 snow over two days off in the center on 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.270
 more than a third of the country's northwest 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.470
 monthly norm of precipitation snowfall 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.179
 hit the capital 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.439
 well sunday went with her anyway 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.039
 kilometer traffic jams would avoid not 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.949
 succeeded 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.019
 what cities have felt the power of families 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.380
 northern cyclone and where 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.610
 broken snow records

 Actual analyst on the channel

 Russia 24 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.350
 I vadim for kegs leading specialist 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.320
 phobos center 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.660
 Hello, then, from the invasions of cyclones 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.539
 Moscow has suffered less 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.969
 the most significant anomaly is observed 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.230
 in the east of the Russian plain in the capital 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.570
 height of snowdrifts 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.960
 exceeded the average perennial by one third 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.629
 values before it reached 46 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.059
 centimeters but in Kazan and lower 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.690
 Novgorod already piled up snow and a half 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.090
 times the usual 60 66 centimeters 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.910
 such deviations do not occur more often 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.010
 than once every five to six years but the most powerful 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.100
 snow cover in central Russia 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.290
 formed further south on the streets 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.470
 Bashkir Kumertau is a layer of snow 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.710
 almost 90 centimeters is double 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.720
 more than going here all winter 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.390
 By the way, this city is located in the latitudinal 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.550
 Voronezh or 450 kilometers 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.520
 South of Moscow is interesting something 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.240
 absolute record of snowdrifts 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.980
 fixed last february 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.160
 day 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.590
 2001 this month separates only 17 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.180
 centimeters and in nature in the reserve still 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.000
 twenty days to catch up 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.760
 lag is unusually much rain and in 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.010
 southern Russia and in the Crimea for example in 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.860
 Simferopol this winter was 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.050
 the wettest in 35 years 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.990
 Last Sunday the amount of precipitation 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.150
 the season reached 160 millimeters and already on 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.290
 2 millimeters exceeded previous 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.720
 extreme value of 1986 so 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.890
 finally managed to do away with the Crimean 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.269
 drought that lasted 11 months 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.219
 We will understand the reason for this 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.850
 abnormal flow of atmospheric 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.010
 processes the point is 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.680
 then over 60 percent cyclones 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.050
 doctors break through from the west before 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.840
 get to the Russian plain from the atlantic 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.060
 they have to overcome about 3000 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.160
 kilometers along the way cyclones loses 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.120
 a significant part of its moisture reserves 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.700
 vicril north and south need to go in two 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.020
 times less distance therefore precipitation 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.480
 they bring more 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.850
 but usually repeatable invasions 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.610
 not big this year only 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.690
 on the contrary, western cyclones come to us 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.880
 rather rarely south and north 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.040
 cleaned up the way is the northern cycle 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.950
 was the cause of bad weather in the past 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.150
 weekend and now over the Barents Sea 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.800
 already spins a new look by tuesday 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.410
 under his influence will be all 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.060
 northwest of the country and on Wednesday fields 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.970
 dense frontal clouds 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.770
 reach out to the banks of the moscow river so 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.290
 what after some respite weather 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.540
 continues to implement inclement 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.480
 scenario today snow depth 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.270
 will change a little and on Tuesday drifts 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.400
 generally settle down one centimeter but 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.770
 mid week sky over the capital 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.170
 again will begin to drag snow clouds and 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.680
 by Thursday snow layer on Moscow 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.830
 the streets 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.510
 can reach half a meter about what 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.750
 the temperature will be in cities today 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.500
 Russia immediately gave interested weather 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.500
 goodbye
