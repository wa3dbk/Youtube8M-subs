00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:17.040
 anguish of not having to torment you 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.040
 of not having your love 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:25.779
 anguish finger kiss you more 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.419
 nostalgia for not listening to your voice 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.950
 I'll never be able 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.950
 to forget 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.860
 our nights by the sea 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.750
 with you went all illusion 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:09.580
 the anguish filled my heart 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.350
 good anguish is the ideal song for 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.270
 those who want to start playing boleros 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.159
 well, it's really very simple and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.409
 enter few chords is the minor 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.100
 remember that the lower the bass 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.560
 principal is the fifth string and the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.369
 under secondary is the fifth block 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.369
 third fret 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.650
 then it is less' 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.930
 the main bass is the fourth string and 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.590
 the secondary bass the same string in the 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.590
 third fret 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.729
 and my seventh 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.770
 bass on the sixth string and bass 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.190
 secondary in the sixth fourth string 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.190
 fret 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.400
 the residue that we use the strumming number 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.439
 4 thumb down 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.439
 three fingers up twice 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:26.210
 thumb low secondary again three two 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.590
 from above and again down secondary and 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.590
 again the three fingers up 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.890
 Y 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.140
 now there is a step from the minor to re a 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.710
 small phrase a bead that links these 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.710
 two chords 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.140
 to me 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.600
 the fifth rope is interspersed 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.980
 with the second string with the third 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.980
 rope on the second fret 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.230
 ah 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.070
 well and otherwise this song is 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.750
 quite simple and short is in the 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.750
 page number 3 of the 100 best 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.750
