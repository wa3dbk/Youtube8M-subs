team lousy servo home horn for crawlers
super<00:01:07.710> thick<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.250> lot<00:01:08.820> thicker<00:01:09.030> than<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:10.189> the

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
super thick a lot thicker than the the

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.700 
super thick a lot thicker than the the
high-tech<00:01:12.299> one<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.750> blue<00:01:12.960> anodized<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.590> that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
comes with their digital servos so went

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.870 
comes with their digital servos so went
ahead<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.979> mounted<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.340> one<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.610> hopefully

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
ahead and mounted that one up hopefully

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.969 
ahead and mounted that one up hopefully
this<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.390> will<00:01:18.570> last<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.470> little<00:01:19.590> bit<00:01:19.830> better

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
this one will last a little bit better

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.300 
this one will last a little bit better
than<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.610> previous<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:22.439> ended<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:22.830> ending

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
than the previous so it ended up ending

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.160 
than the previous so it ended up ending
in<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.580> guess<00:01:23.970> probably<00:01:24.330> from<00:01:24.540> taking<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
in I guess probably from taking a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.010 
in I guess probably from taking a
nosedive<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.890> something<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:27.020> that's

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
nosedive or something so that's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.270 
nosedive or something so that's
basically<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:28.619> gonna<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:28.890> shoot<00:01:29.100> some
