a<00:01:12.330> much<00:01:12.570> more<00:01:12.840> similar<00:01:13.290> experience<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
a much more similar experience to the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.340 
a much more similar experience to the
previous<00:01:14.610> dead<00:01:14.820> spaces<00:01:15.360> very<00:01:15.869> small

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
previous dead spaces very small

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.380 
previous dead spaces very small
adjustment<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.189> some<00:01:17.430> people<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.820> matters<00:01:17.939> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
adjustment but some people it matters to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.730 
adjustment but some people it matters to
I've<00:01:19.350> gone<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:19.979> far<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.280> putting<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.119> ten

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
I've gone as far as putting it to ten

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.679 
I've gone as far as putting it to ten
there<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.189> couldn't<00:01:23.700> find<00:01:23.909> any<00:01:24.210> difference

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
there I couldn't find any difference

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.440 
there I couldn't find any difference
after<00:01:24.869> 2.0<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> think<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.549> 2.0<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.210> really

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
after 2.0 so I think that 2.0 is really

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.840 
after 2.0 so I think that 2.0 is really
the<00:01:27.570> maximum<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.430> anything<00:01:29.430> after<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
the maximum and anything after that I

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.609 
the maximum and anything after that I
don't<00:01:30.150> think<00:01:30.329> makes<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.630> difference<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.259> you

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
don't think makes a difference but you

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.020 
don't think makes a difference but you
can<00:01:31.770> play<00:01:31.920> with<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
can play with it if you like then you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.140 
can play with it if you like then you
