00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:10.990
 Good morning, everyone. 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.679

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.340
 Here now, let Recording Can I have about the end of August 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:20.019
 It's been so hot for a while now . 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.710

 I'm going down this track, and you guys are a little uncomfortable living in a photo. 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:39.490
 Now haejusimyeon and I get a little uncomfortable out easily when it 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.520
 This word is also some air in this room intently at me even once bought some books 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.400
 Look at the photo book and buy it again. 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.910
 I wonder if these parts are a little better. 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.730
 I'll take a break and see how you can not keep moving. 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.390
 Let's start the ingredient picture today. 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.440
 Today, whatever the theory is, start with a slightly lighter theme than this. 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.020
 I'll try. 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:06.850
 Well, what if I just had some kind of dog out today? 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.109
 What came lens is written so any equipment hammer the table a little part of what these 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.890
 Except 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:15.880
 You and I will be my second time as before 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.920
 This attraction is called the old oven once the shelter to go get some rest flavored page 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.149
 This time it will take 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:28.479
 I would like to make a page to take a shelter in a countryside. 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:31.960
 There are a few things ready. 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:36.969
 That could be selected once 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.130
 Weigh adjuster, I now try to think what that again only once more 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:42.749
 I wanted to be there. 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.869
 No matter where you are and where you are now, 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:50.110
 I think I see you now and I want to talk to you guys 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.800
 I do not know why. 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:58.630
 What were you doing with your photos and what tools? 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:03.670
 Yes , we know that the cameras you are using are called Genji . 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.780
 I use it as a shooting tool. Of course , as an ancillary book, a tripod, 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.440
 Or 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:12.570
 There is also a camera or a variety of such 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.280
 Find it also as the camera and lens you are taking iteoyaji 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:21.040
 You can complete the picture . 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:26.860
 Here then you have the equipment for the fact that a large lens out 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:30.480
 Uh, no matter how cheap something to get started with some words expensive side 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.320
 So it's going to be a lot of money going into here, 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.790
 Budget 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.250
 If you do not have any money, what is it again? 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.690
 I have two fives because raneunge equipment 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.500
 Newer than the maker, the new nails are developed and new products are poured out 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.330
 Will 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.660
 The days of the camera era, the furniture has changed a little . 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.890
 Because what feels rolled bars 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:03.760
 These days digital cameras are like this. 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:10.180
 It seems like we use common electronic products at home and just throw something mother Haeju 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:15.610
 Or going to the extent that doing something electric rice cooker theory that some rice that his wife 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:18.190
 I have a fast digital camera coming out. 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.590
 Well, I can do what I like. 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:26.769
 I do not know why . 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.090
 Place the new equipment comes I want to try all of the photographers 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.870
 Now that all professionals who need hanteneun referred to as hobbies such people imagine there 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.260
 and 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.459
 I got another suspicion about it, and it's another case of money 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.970
 Investing 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:46.750
 Another negative is yet to collect any money with it because to do so, and some 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.200
 That also receives the trail, even those who are now maneusi to mental stress 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.799
 I'm talking. 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.720
 So one time, Japan will want to try these parts photographic equipment 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.950
 Clear once 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:02.450
 Let's choose wisely once 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.450
 Well, that's why I wrote down the subject once. 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:32.669
 Select the handlebar to the current look down on cell phone also yet another 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:35.950
 I'll start with my cell phone turned off. 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:41.320
 What is your camera? 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:46.540
 Is it a tool for taking photos or is it good for the photos or the camera 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:50.860
 It's also another audio that now also takes a taste of that lng 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:53.150
 Whether it's a tester that tests flavors, 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.570
 Are you a collector? 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.460
 From which side do you go? This is neither that nor just tastes 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.820
 Are you such people? 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:07.010
 I think this is what I call 2 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:10.610
 I have a lot of cameras and I go to buy 4 7 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:14.690
 Well, then you do not have to work with him, you do a lot of work. 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.100
 There are a lot of pictures, too. 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.780
 It's part of their 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:25.790
 If you buy a camera to take pictures 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:30.380
 I am very good when I use it as a tool. 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:33.050
 This is the side that will position you want to try why today we have a hobby pictures 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:37.700
 Let's say you start with the paste. 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.510
 If so , you should buy a camera and mine as a tool for finding photos . 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.780
 I do. 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:45.170
 At first, it's true that everyone starts with that. 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:49.030
 Porter during the day fishing pictures sent to the party room 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:53.960
 There is equipment out of the wall that's good relationship going and yet so little 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:59.450
 These same story that could work the way I look at it is either about picture 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:03.830
 You have a lot of greed for your photographic equipment. 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.610
 Then who is this then I also wrote Angie beside it.I am sure if the good 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.150
 That's it. 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:13.100
 I mean, I can take pictures like this before . 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:15.680
 Also rattling the pictures are surfing the Internet any lice gansahan Landscape 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.060
 I have equipment 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.300
 Moody's 4 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:25.830
 I just looked bisuri x 2870 Lens ah 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:28.410
 2470 Range In front of what Canon 5d Mark Taiya area cc 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:32.639
 Will it be so good 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:37.710
 I've watched it, and I can see that if you buy such a thing , 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:42.300
 You should think about those parts, too . 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:46.380
 I think I'll be able to take three of the stores I like that all the people are generally 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:50.610
 Yuri said that 9 people would like to buy such equipment 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.600
 When you collect the money invested rattling again and again so that not stamped eotteol 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.889
 Look 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:59.220
 So what do you do? Oh, I 'm a little short on skills. 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:04.380
 Rather than studying and studying photography 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:09.030
 Then another piece of equipment. Another piece of equipment. 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.780
 For going I gotta talk so that you can continue to lead the pocket 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.770
 I'm talking. 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:15.030
 If money is gone, I do not say what I do not. 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.700
 In your field 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:22.570
 I mean, you have to make money. 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:25.810
 It is the life itself that takes the deletion 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:30.880
 It gets annoying, annoying and stressful. 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:34.570
 This is a problem I think you have to think at least once ag 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:38.050
 You have to fight again in front of him. 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:40.630
 What equipment do I need when I actually take pictures? 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.930
 Of course, this is not the right answer. 

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.930
 I'll do it
