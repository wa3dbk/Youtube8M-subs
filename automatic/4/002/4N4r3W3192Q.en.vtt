 Wild boar bear 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:23.789
 Alive is high for electric fence to protect nutri from fresh water of harmful animals such as hawubicin 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:31.919
 You can expect photo performance and excellent control effect 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:32.820
 As soon as the farm's electric fence, the Wild Shop series is adopted in the local government's animal pest control situation 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:41.600
 Is 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.600
 Co-Sena is easy to install in anyone one person professional materials 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:56.640
 This is the only set material needed to encircle the 100m around Tabata with electric fences 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.870
 The electric fence that generates an electric shock 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.110
 7500 Bol likely 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:08.650
 Caution Power box f 400 more than 400m 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:15.230
 Not to mention the usual 12 v battery 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:19.010
 It will move to Pafuru even alkali-to-one hepatitis pond four 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:27.380
 Electric fences have low resistance 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:32.479
 Achieve ultra-high conductivity by inserting 3 lines of tin plating and 3 lines of stainless steel 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:36.070
 Carry the electric shop stronger and farther 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.070
 子 子 生生 ワ イ ヤ ー Wire 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:50.710
 Glass fiber pole is highly insulating 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:50.710
 Also , because it is flexible and resilient, it will be restored even if animals etc. get on 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.600
 Electric fence Ayer's with a special clip easily 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.530
 It can be adjusted up and down winding distance 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:11.230
 We can put on wire easily easily alone 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:11.740
 Easy to install and withdraw, and all materials are very compact, so management in a bone rebase tie 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.660
 Also 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:20.290
 There is no bother 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.290
 Now let's develop an electric fence 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:32.170
 First of all together at the height of attaching the clip of the ball the clip marked 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:34.380
 I will keep on putting on 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.380
 Hmm 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.510
 Then we will refer to the ball to the coder part of the field 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:51.020
 true 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:55.630
 Connect the wire to the first pole clip of the first pole and then put it on the ball clip 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.630
 I will be around the field while 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.630
 Next while pointing to the pole between 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:08.770
 I will put on the clip 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.770
 I will put the wire in the same way in the second stage 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.770
 Hmm 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.770
 Attach the gate to the part that will be the entrance of the flag management 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:30.570
 Today 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:30.570
 Embed earth on the ground, connect the electric fence to the wire and switch on the switch . 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.970
 of 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:46.730
 The solar panel and the dedicated battery are integrated 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:52.740
 To the electric fence real power box If f 500 sp and f 1600 sp 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:55.070
 Even if you are away, you can operate the electric fence without worrying about charging 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.070
 not 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.319
 ane 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.319
 wh 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.319
 Hmm
