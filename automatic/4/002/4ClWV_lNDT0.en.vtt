00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.680
 Hi girls, I did not come back in the video. 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.269
 February every day so travel in this 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.280
 Special because I'll show you 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.590
 in the decorating tips here in my 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.080
 room is also my house well 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.350
 her little house looks like a question 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.960
 apartment then put everything right 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.029
 in a heap of marks did not look ugly 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.130
 runs out of space 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.529
 So I decided to show you mine. 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.040
 new decoration is the containment of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.860
 dengue made a living right now and debate day in 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.630
 Then I changed those days and recorded 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.420
 everything to you so if you want 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.180
 check in Stábile quote is 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.840
 to be see is only to continue without a doubt then 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.840
 comes from corn 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.530
 so the first step you'll make 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.129
 the entire forest exploitation is to put a 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.120
 carpet in the sand that actually is kind a 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:04.140
 frame that is not mdl frame just missing 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.659
 put thing then it was put 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.020
 four headers 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.830
 already in the moment as she was very dark like this 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.170
 like the rest of it is the furniture in the room 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.759
 in fact I wanted to put a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.580
 use of strong property 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.420
 I would not be so alive if you have a 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.970
 purple as they tried to save or one inside 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.630
 a red cosmo was not going to have a 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.939
 legal contract then wanted to put white 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.570
 because she driving is classic then 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.720
 I chose very different pieces and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.180
 They give a beautiful act but it was then 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.950
 they stayed a little things but things 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.950

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.090
 four pieces of chess I bought in the 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.280
 store time was not good picture I 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.640

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.130
 I have none I put this is the queen 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.880
 purple flowers to count on the 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:50.709
 inconveniences not only get us in blanc 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:52.810
 my turn down here is not it - 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.940
 It shot very very very, you have 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.549
 I like my new decoration, I do not 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.700

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.640
 active suffocating then knows what to choose 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.549
 classic pieces with a topic that 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.549
 It was the other like you saw then. 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.820
 I'm beautiful, you have to choose the 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.310
 What bothers you most is that you will not be lacking. 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:19.170
 rug to a legal framework instrument on 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.690
 walls that have to pass without anything 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.730
 with a comic on the light sofa that 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.980
 can stay behind and then you put 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.140
 and you try to match objects from 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.510
 substance decoration gets super cute 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.810
 You're like this, I 'm not neutral. 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.110
 of objects in other teams as well as 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.120
 other part of the decoration as in the frame 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.450
 Sandra groans and pillows in 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.030
 flower arrangements and decorative objects 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.900
 practicing the rav you set the tone and 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.330
 scratch a more vivid air the décor 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.459
 so we are here at home I put 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.830
 just a carpet a legal framework in the 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.440
 not to be white wall and where 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.950
 It is more beautiful charge and not only 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.560
 I put some co with ned cache 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.110
 in a neutral piece that has passed through 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.390
 not with purple software and other side 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.930

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.600
 contact him and if he is putting me this 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.669
 White tone capture more handsome rich and 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.130
 highlights more because it treats me very dark 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.350
 I put another maybe I would not 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.180

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.810

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.300
