00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 good morning evenings nights or what 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.480
 be today I bring you a guide to camp 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.900
 ua hahahaha good the first episode 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.900
 will be the classes 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:21.810
 It will be a fairly long series since 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:24.360
 I will show all the maps and all the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.110
 sites where you can pose in those 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.730
 maps 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:34.370
 and good we started with the classes 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.670
 the last vice this will be for 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.100
 and good as we are going to according to the campers 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.289
 shit we're going to move 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.519
 we have to put on a machine gun 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.400
 light there are four machine guns 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.030
 different 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.940
 I recommend the m 48 and the exact 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.500
 since its more extended loaders than 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.100
 the one from the web the sw and the one from the hummer 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.910
 well then we can class and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.910
 good 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.680
 and the most important thing to do a good 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.159
 cantero is to have a search engine for targets in 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.090
 this weapon 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:20.179
 we also need armored bullets 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.659
 perfect rector let's go with the advantages 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:27.530
 we can put 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.700
 bulletproof vest that this is the best 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.429
 advantage to camp after the second 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.070
 scavenger as to pick them clemons and 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.620
 Ammunition of the same 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.430
 and third tactical mask so you do not 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.550
 they can hit us or stun 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.220
 of such as not boxing bet and if you have 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.190
 we thought you can also use it is more 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.410
 recommended one of a boxing already 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.870
 that boxing betis can be avoided 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.510
 but good as I do not have unblocks 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.090
 even then I will put the weak position and 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.990
 of tactics I recommend shock load 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.140
 or system atrophies some stems 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.479
 I will shock shock if you go to 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.530
 I only recommend them more cargo 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.480
 shock and if you're going to camp with someone 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.450
 more then trophy system is one of the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.680
 two that is put into the trophy system and the 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.680
 other shock load 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.849
 we put two puts a burden on us 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:32.750
 shock and for secondary have the cap 40 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:35.030
 in with the accessory to the bad guys 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.880
 and so we have a good class to 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.040
 campear this is the first class I am going 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.980
 to teach more combinations of classes 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.200
 and well come on we have others we have another 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.910
 class 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.260
 so as not to have to repeat 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.260
 some things that we copy 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.600
 and well the weapon you can change 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.680
 I will put the elstat now 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.910
 the same 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:08.190
 and of secondary we removed the cab 40 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:12.050
 and we put the excess means 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.050
 and we put on the shield 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.319
 this is another good option because if 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.500
 you change with friends you can cover yourself 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.530
 not give you the bullets and you're pointing 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.989
 for the America that has the shield and 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.960
 when you see an enemy you get up and go 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.670
 you kill 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:37.480
 well this is another possible combination 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.480
 then there are even weirder combinations 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.239
 let's go with another one we'll start it again 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.930
 we can use their rifles too but not 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:52.750
 they are highly recommended, but it's good 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.230
 camping with the shotgun we can 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.420
 put one more 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.130
 these shotguns the streets is that it is not 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.130
 highly recommended as they tend to fail 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.640
 and we can kill quickly so 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:10.240
 I would recommend the remington of that 12 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.210
 from Jan 12 16 this is unlocked more 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.250
 late nothing happens when you get them 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.989
 teach another class 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.870
 let's get the s12 since reding 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:29.370
 with the remington we can still fail now 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:32.280
 which is a manual action lock 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.900
 that shotgun with the running mechanism 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.970
 slide 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.600
 then we can look like the s12 that 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:44.240
 It is semi-automatic 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.240
 I recommend spanair of millimeters 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.600
 when the cup 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.490
 high 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:56.190
 after advantages the same as before 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.790
 bulletproof vest 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:05.470
 scavenger tactical mask 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.900
 the boxing x as no shock loads and 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:12.150
 after high school I do not think I do 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:15.050
 nothing is missing but just in case 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.050
 the execution 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.000
 40 yes no 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.700
 the internal b-20 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.280
 but well I put the 40 tracks 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.030
 well this is another cruise class to 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.240
 do three 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.840
 three possible classes and well this has 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.990
 been the first episode that have been the 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.890
 classes in the next I will teach you three 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.500
 more classes and then we'll go in the 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.410
 public games to show us the 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.500
 site for the sites to camp 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:06:00.010
 the first episode of sites for 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.770
 change in will be on the after map 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:06.460
 matters since it is first on the list 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:11.080
 bone begins in alphabetical order if 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:13.729
 the first then the last one will be the 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.260
 last will be those of 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:19.860
 downloadable content 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:23.250
 and the last normal will be someone 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.090
 so a greeting to all and see you in 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.090
 the next episode 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.790
 and all
