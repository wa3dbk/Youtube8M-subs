00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.110
 we continue with the recipes of Chinese food 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.839
 and the English that we are going to need 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.050
 for our recipe are 120 grams of 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.600
 toasted almonds without salt a little 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.000
 Salt 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.210
 two tablespoons of vinegar 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.210
 Apple 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.210
 two whole chicken breasts 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.339
 two onions 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.339
 2 carrots 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.640
 a little bit of ground black pepper or 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.620
 to grind a large green pepper 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.120
 sunflower oil and how I do not fit 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.120
 let's continue with the ingredients 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.839
 here the second batch four spoonfuls 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.570
 of fine corn flour or cornstarch four 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.519
 spoons of four soy sugar one 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.140
 concentrated chicken broth pill 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.769
 chicken avecrem and half a liter of water 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.899
 the tablespoons are always soup 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.210
 first thing we're going to do is cut in 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.560
 you strip the chicken and once cut in 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.030
 strips we will make 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.030
 squares so you can understand me 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.140
 as you see here 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.540
 and once we have all the chicken 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.540
 trimmed we reserve 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.100
 now we go with the carrots the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.700
 we will cut in half and cut them 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.700
 finite 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.140
 we will also clean and cut the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.140
 onions 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 and finally the pepper that he 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.000
 we will leave a little thicker 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.700
 something like that 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.729
 with already all the vegetables and the chicken 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.009
 we are going to put a wok or a 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.450
 large pan with sunflower oil and 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.350
 let's start frying our chicken 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.350
 Until it fries 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.930
 while we have it to the fire the chicken 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.140
 let's also add a little bit of 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.140
 Salt 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.680
 this to taste 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.650
 and we're also going to put a little bit of 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.420
 pepper I 'm going to put it freshly ground 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.740
 because I like the taste it gives more but 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.120
 you can put the pepper 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.120
 that this already ground 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.599
 and we remove 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.090
 once the chicken is done in its 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.900
 whole that is well golden by 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.830
 all sides we are going to remove it to a 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.640
 kitchen plate 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.160
 and we continue with the other ingredients 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.930
 we drain well and put on the plate now 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.810
 we will put a little oil of 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.580
 new sunflower in the pan a wok and what 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.830
 first that we are going to fry is the 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.450
 carrot because it is the hardest vegetable 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.450
 what we have for this recipe 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.980
 once we have it ready we will add 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.980
 the pepper 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.950
 once the pepper is ready 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.210
 A) Yes 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.210
 we will put the onion 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.060
 We will leave voting and we have to stay 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:08.700
 the vegetables made but crunchy 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.700
 and finally we add the almonds 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.840
 we reserve and now we go with the sauce 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:21.090
 we put the soy in the water 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.389
 remember that the half liter two glasses of 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.389
 Water 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.409
 we will put apple cider vinegar 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.949
 the sugar 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.949
 and we're going to stir until it dissolves almost 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.020
 all the sugar and then we will go 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.289
 adding little by little the fine flour 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.289
 corn 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.879
 when a part is integrated 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.589
 we add the other 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:59.589
 in this way we avoid making lumps 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.180
 and finally once everything is already 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.040
 integrated we will put the pill of 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.580
 chicken broth or meat concentrate 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.580
 cream bird 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.480
 and so we have little left for the recipe 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.669
 we move well 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:30.110
 and we return to the pan we will put the 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.279
 vegetables together with chicken and 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.749
 almonds and we will add the caldito 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:39.960
 you're testing if you need salt but 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:42.030
 I left it that way and it tastes really good 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.770
 let's wait now to thicken and 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.539
 our recipe will be ready the truth is 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.280
 which is delicious and you can see that 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.740
 it's very easy to do we no longer have 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.300
 excuse to eat Chinese food I hope 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.800
