and they weigh almost nothing there are

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.300 
and they weigh almost nothing there are
a<00:02:48.670> lot<00:02:48.940> easier<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.450> use<00:02:49.780> than<00:02:50.470> these<00:02:50.740> larger

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
a lot easier to use than these larger

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.580 
a lot easier to use than these larger
heavier<00:02:51.610> ice<00:02:52.120> packs<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:53.050> cooler<00:02:53.320> works

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
heavier ice packs and this cooler works
