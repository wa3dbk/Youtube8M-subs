daily meal plan now I say sufficient not
an<00:00:12.540> overabundance<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.590> protein<00:00:14.250> every<00:00:15.030> single

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
an overabundance of protein every single

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.060 
an overabundance of protein every single
day<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:16.170> lot<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.379> people<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.890> this

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
day and a lot of people have this

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.519 
day and a lot of people have this
misconception<00:00:17.270> that<00:00:18.270> they<00:00:18.930> need<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.320> have

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
misconception that they need to have

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.310 
misconception that they need to have
tons<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.430> tons<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.910> protein<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.600> order<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
tons and tons of protein in order to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.920 
tons and tons of protein in order to
build<00:00:22.500> these<00:00:22.830> lean<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.550> toned<00:00:23.730> muscles<00:00:24.269> so

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
build these lean and toned muscles so

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.439 
build these lean and toned muscles so
first<00:00:25.260> what<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.830> protein<00:00:26.460> well<00:00:27.029> your<00:00:27.240> body

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
first what is protein well your body

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.349 
first what is protein well your body
breaks<00:00:27.930> down<00:00:28.080> protein<00:00:28.859> into<00:00:29.279> amino<00:00:29.550> acids<00:00:30.119> and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
breaks down protein into amino acids and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.290 
breaks down protein into amino acids and
use<00:00:30.929> those<00:00:31.320> uses<00:00:31.980> those<00:00:32.160> amino<00:00:32.489> acids<00:00:33.059> to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
use those uses those amino acids to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450 
use those uses those amino acids to
build<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:33.780> muscles<00:00:34.110> when<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.100> exercise

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
build up your muscles when you exercise

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.340 
build up your muscles when you exercise
you're<00:00:35.940> actually<00:00:36.120> breaking<00:00:36.630> down<00:00:37.079> muscle

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
you're actually breaking down muscle

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.340 
you're actually breaking down muscle
this<00:00:37.950> doesn't<00:00:38.399> mean<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:39.090> need<00:00:39.300> tons<00:00:39.930> and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
this doesn't mean that you need tons and

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.729 
this doesn't mean that you need tons and
tons<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:41.010> protein<00:00:41.520> every<00:00:41.879> single<00:00:42.840> day<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.379> in

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
tons of protein every single day and in

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.830 
tons of protein every single day and in
every<00:00:44.070> single<00:00:44.460> meal<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:45.149> should<00:00:45.390> keep<00:00:45.600> them

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
every single meal you should keep them

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.619 
every single meal you should keep them
at<00:00:45.989> reasonable<00:00:46.710> portions<00:00:47.219> now<00:00:48.000> what's<00:00:48.539> very

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
at reasonable portions now what's very

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.389 
at reasonable portions now what's very
important<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.890> need<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.219> have

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
important is that you need to have

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.340 
important is that you need to have
protein<00:00:50.910> with<00:00:51.149> every<00:00:51.539> single<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.140> your

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
protein with every single one of your

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.610 
protein with every single one of your
meals<00:00:52.559> because<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.070> will<00:00:53.219> help<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.610> burn<00:00:53.789> fat

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
meals because it will help you burn fat

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.959 
meals because it will help you burn fat
protein<00:00:55.620> releases<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> hormone<00:00:56.309> called

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
protein releases a hormone called

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.990 
protein releases a hormone called
glucagon<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:58.469> does<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.890> exact<00:00:59.280> opposite<00:00:59.940> of

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
glucagon that does the exact opposite of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.389 
glucagon that does the exact opposite of
insulin<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.230> where<00:01:01.440> insulin<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> fat

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
insulin so where insulin is a fat

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.270 
insulin so where insulin is a fat
storage<00:01:02.969> hormone<00:01:03.000> glucagon<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.680> actually<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
storage hormone glucagon is actually a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.210 
storage hormone glucagon is actually a
fat-burning<00:01:05.810> hormone<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.799> eat<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
fat-burning hormone so if you eat a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.370 
fat-burning hormone so if you eat a
serving<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:09.090> two<00:01:09.299> servings<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:09.900> even<00:01:10.140> three

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
serving or two servings or even three

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.590 
serving or two servings or even three
servings<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.890> protein<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.790> every<00:01:12.210> single

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
servings of protein with every single

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.630 
servings of protein with every single
one<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> your<00:01:13.049> meals<00:01:13.290> you're<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.400> get

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
one of your meals you're going to get

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.510 
one of your meals you're going to get
this<00:01:15.000> fat<00:01:15.420> burning<00:01:15.930> effect<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:17.009> your<00:01:17.250> meals

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
this fat burning effect with your meals

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.990 
this fat burning effect with your meals
it's<00:01:18.299> also<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.750> blood<00:01:19.229> sugar<00:01:19.530> stabilizer<00:01:20.340> so

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it's also a blood sugar stabilizer so

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.240 
it's also a blood sugar stabilizer so
when<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.299> eat<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> protein<00:01:21.960> along<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:22.830> your

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
when you eat a protein along with your

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.370 
when you eat a protein along with your
carbohydrates<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.570> help<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.049> keep<00:01:25.200> your

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
carbohydrates you help to keep your

carbohydrates you help to keep your
blood<00:01:25.650> sugar<00:01:25.680> stable<00:01:26.640> when<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.659> eat

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
blood sugar stable when you just eat
