 called freddie roach the one that was 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.360
 charge of my past three fights has 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.470
 made him look great and I trust him and 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.570
 It will be my best weapon 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.570
 I'm not very happy very satisfied very 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.190
 grateful for how the public the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.090
 press and all Mexicans have 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.229
 worked every time we have the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.229
 skill opportunity of this country 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.900
 Miguel Angel Cotto who has won everything 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.940
 he is a fighter that in her is a 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.100
 Legend in boxing 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.810
 to enter history you have to win 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.270
 these fighters I do not feel happy 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.310
 motivated with great enthusiasm to 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.310
 prepare to win this fight 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.860
 no good I think that in favor you can not 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.390
 to say that I have more than the least I think 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.790
 that he is a very complete fighter 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.230
 I fight this is a 50/50 the one that 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.739
 prepare better and whichever is better goes to 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.739
 win that day 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.610
 Of course, yes, it is certainly what I have 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.440
 come saying that the fight is given me 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.370
 I believe in the best moment I am a fighter 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.790
 more more more more more mature more this 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.799
 with more experience so I feel myself 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.099
 I feel good I think it has better 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.480
 opportunity 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.280
 I think so I think so is a 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.700
 big fight is not a big fight 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.390
 a fight cataloged as like that without 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.760
 doubt but but where where there will be action 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.829
 that's going to be very different and it's going to be 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.829
 very different fighting style 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.560
 do not look I think it 's fight after fight 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.410
 of arrived to where I have arrived 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.250
 thank god and this is a fight that 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.250
 I burned myself 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.120
 that will take me to history without 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.849
 No doubt it will take me to the story because 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.980
 for the rivalries that exist between mexico 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.109
 against puerto rico I will enter 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.299
 to one more story so I feel very 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.299
 happy and very honored that it be so 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.730
 in the history of fights between 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.170
 boxers of these two nationalities 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.110
 fifty - five have been earned by 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.360
 Puerto Rican boxers and 47 per 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.760
