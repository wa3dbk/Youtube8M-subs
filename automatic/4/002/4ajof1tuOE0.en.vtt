00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello everyone and what does the video increase 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.440
 degree same 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.880
 the first option is most likely to want 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.920
 achieve more power 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.400
 same engine second option 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.130
 it is simply not enough 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.160
 gasoline you need for yourself and squeeze 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.250
 its up to about button 1 building itâ€™s 7 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.970
 and 5 that ledinets I decided to change the degree 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.000
 compression 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.010
 Now I measure the volume of the combustion chamber 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.010
 very top dead center is fed and 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:38.550
 just need to pour oil into the syringe 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.290
 cylinder head and see how much 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:47.850
 we will enter lamaze by this method we 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:55.710
 find out the volume of the combustion chamber instead 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:58.350
 there is another fill in the moment 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.719
 the combustion chambers on our moped are about 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.329
 seven cubic centimeters or even more 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.549
 more with this amount it turns out 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.700
 compression ratio don't exactly remember just by 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.820
 my 7 and 5 or something around eight and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.830
 it is only suitable for 80 gasoline 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.290
 some of course solve the problem with 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.119
 gasoline is very simple nervous they just 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.530
 turn the ignition to put another 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.729
 him a little earlier but I see no point 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.729
 turn the ignition 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:42.090
 remove the head inspection of the engine itself 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.000
 you can see that the piston is small on Harry 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.670
 such thanks to it is just butter 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.560
 probably now or cloth 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:56.400
 I'll try to remove it. Well, here I am with a rag. 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.680
 rubbed and then there is a small soot 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.440
 Of course the piston is now lowering it in 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:07.110
 bottom dead center is not interesting 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.670
 state cylinder eat look like 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.830
 can see the cylinder in quite good 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.450
 able to scuff, I don't see it now 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.940
 on the very head and increase the degree 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.100
 compression on the head there is a ledge here it is 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.640
 here is still laying this one 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.500
 protrusion 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.530
 he grinds off about one 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.110
 I just need to calculate the millimeter 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.870
 I will show all calculations here approximately 1 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.120
 millimeter grind down this ledge 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.650
 hence the surface itself 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.320
 heads are polished too on one millimeter 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.239
 to keep the ratios just if 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.360
 you are only one landing point 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.120
 place and this part will remain with you 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.489
 there is a chance that this part 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.230
 rests on the cooling shirt itself 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.300
 the cylinder practically will not be dense 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.880
 fit so here it grins this one 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.160
 chamfer milled by one millimeter or 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.690
 grind the surface itself after 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.380
 of this we get the necessary degree 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:06.570
 compression I will remind that for 92 dash 95 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:09.140
 gasoline need a compression ratio of 10-10 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.709
 and 5 is now the volume of the combustion chamber 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.860
 it is easier to calculate 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.530
 seven cubic centimeters is a big one 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.989
 combustion chamber here is the name for this motor 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.260
 a small addition to the increase 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:28.350
 compression ratio on moped carpathians 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:31.230
 as you can see here they are all my calculations I you 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.120
 I will throw the link in the description to have a look 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.150
 mean now 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.129
 but the most basic value is what 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.950
 It should be the volume of combustion chamber 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:47.250
 there are 5 5-5 and 8 cubic centimeters 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.819
 let 's take our head first 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.239
 engine at 50 or there at 501 in my 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.549
 no difference only upgraded walked 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.610
 already tucked in my head 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:03.680
 as far as I remember, let's take our 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:09.599
 volume that is 5 8 cubic centimeters 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:13.220
 So I poured a lotion spotlight and now we 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:16.400
 fill in 5 8 cubic centimeters to ours 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.400
 combustion chamber 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.770
 the liquid became a straight light which 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.720
 made for the piston well, that's about. 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.590
 especially so that the pistons do not lie 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.960
 where did you get it now ? 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.080
 millimeters that same treasured millimeter 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.000
 which need to grind about that so 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.030
 everyone says that you need a millimeter 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.570
 let me plant it now 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.360
 There are, according to my calculations, the distance first 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.210
 from the top of this head to 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:04.789
 scar in which our cylinder is removed 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:09.620
 we are exactly 2 millimeters now we measure from 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:11.840
 the edges of the head and here before the groove well 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.780
 which is made so that the piston rests on 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.389
 the head is exactly how it turned out 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.360
 look it turned out just three 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.400
 millimeter that is to enlarge 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.560
 degree squeeze it such that us 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.860
 need a surface you need to form here 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:33.650
 by this ledge which is made for piston 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.979
 there is exactly one millimeter but you need 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:41.210
 teacher what is the thickness of this copper 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:43.190
 laying about four tenths that is 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.430
 This surface will have to be milled 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.760
 2 millimeters but this plane 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.280
 the plane of contact of the cylinder head on 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.910
 one and a half millimeter deep in this way 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.000
 I did 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:59.479
 making no difficult calculations soon 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.729
 Time to get a moped with a good degree 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:06.729
 compression under 92 dash 95 gasoline
