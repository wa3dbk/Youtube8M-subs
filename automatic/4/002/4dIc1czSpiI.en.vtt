these<00:00:01.829> are<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.070> mature<00:00:02.399> larvae<00:00:02.879> black

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
these are the mature larvae black

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.160 
these are the mature larvae black
soldier<00:00:03.720> fly<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:04.250> collected<00:00:05.250> these<00:00:05.370> over<00:00:06.170> that

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
soldier fly I collected these over that

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.440 
soldier fly I collected these over that
was<00:00:07.290> over<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> five<00:00:07.890> day<00:00:08.189> or<00:00:08.400> six<00:00:08.550> days<00:00:08.760> ban<00:00:09.090> but

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
was over a five day or six days ban but

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450 
was over a five day or six days ban but
they<00:00:10.320> were<00:00:10.380> collected<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:11.040> two<00:00:11.250> nights

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
they were collected in two nights

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.099 
they were collected in two nights
primarily<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:14.240> what<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.299> normally<00:00:15.630> would<00:00:15.990> do

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
primarily and what I normally would do

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.400 
primarily and what I normally would do
is<00:00:16.260> protect<00:00:16.590> these<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.949> bucket<00:00:17.340> with

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
is protect these in a bucket with

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.450 
is protect these in a bucket with
ventilation<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.590> little<00:00:19.830> sawdust<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.310> that

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
ventilation and little sawdust so that

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.910 
ventilation and little sawdust so that
they<00:00:20.520> could<00:00:20.699> pupate<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.210> there<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.570> not<00:00:21.920> be

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
they could pupate in there and not be

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.939 
they could pupate in there and not be
preyed<00:00:23.160> upon<00:00:23.189> by<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:24.650> several<00:00:25.650> types<00:00:25.830> of

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
preyed upon by the several types of

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.370 
preyed upon by the several types of
animals<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.580> would<00:00:26.849> eat<00:00:27.000> them<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:28.199> way<00:00:28.320> I

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
animals that would eat them that way I

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.970 
animals that would eat them that way I
get<00:00:28.650> more<00:00:28.970> adults<00:00:29.970> emerging<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.570> mate<00:00:30.980> but

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
get more adults emerging to mate but

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.799 
get more adults emerging to mate but
it's<00:00:32.430> getting<00:00:32.640> late<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.000> year<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:35.809> I'm

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it's getting late in the year and I'm

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.869 
it's getting late in the year and I'm
not<00:00:37.050> sure<00:00:37.290> how<00:00:37.980> effective<00:00:38.160> they'll<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:38.730> to

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
not sure how effective they'll be to

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.610 
not sure how effective they'll be to
hold<00:00:39.059> them<00:00:39.300> during<00:00:39.570> cold<00:00:39.840> weather<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
hold them during cold weather in a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.160 
hold them during cold weather in a
bucket<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:42.510> more<00:00:42.690> confidence<00:00:42.870> that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
bucket I have more confidence that

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.770 
bucket I have more confidence that
they'll<00:00:43.379> survive<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.890> their<00:00:44.070> own<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.489> just

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
they'll survive on their own if I just

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.709 
they'll survive on their own if I just
release<00:00:45.780> them<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.079> my<00:00:46.200> property<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.940> I<00:00:47.940> doubt

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
release them on my property and I doubt

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.740 
release them on my property and I doubt
they'll<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.230> time<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.680> emerge<00:00:50.570> while<00:00:51.570> it's

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
they'll have time to emerge while it's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.939 
they'll have time to emerge while it's
still<00:00:51.870> warm<00:00:52.020> enough<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.410> mate<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.770> they'll

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
still warm enough to mate so they'll

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.770 
still warm enough to mate so they'll
probably<00:00:53.129> just<00:00:53.340> overwinter<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.329> emerge<00:00:54.660> in

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
probably just overwinter and emerge in

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.770 
probably just overwinter and emerge in
the<00:00:54.870> spring<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:56.210> continue<00:00:57.210> mating<00:00:57.510> at<00:00:57.629> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the spring and continue mating at that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.470 
the spring and continue mating at that
point<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:59.070> these<00:00:59.250> are<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.489> these<00:01:00.210> were<00:01:00.359> not

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
point so these are not these were not

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.819 
point so these are not these were not
raised<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.870> bio<00:01:01.050> pod<00:01:01.289> these<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.530> raised<00:01:01.680> in

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
raised in a bio pod these are raised in

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.759 
raised in a bio pod these are raised in
to<00:01:02.100> other<00:01:02.280> units<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.600> going<00:01:03.840> that

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
to other units that I have going that

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.520 
to other units that I have going that
that<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.700> use<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.270> use<00:01:08.330> those<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.570> get<00:01:10.080> larvae

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that I use to use those to get larvae

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.600 
that I use to use those to get larvae
and<00:01:10.710> eggs<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.670> starter<00:01:12.240> kits<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:14.460> is

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
and eggs for starter kits so this is

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.420 
and eggs for starter kits so this is
equivalent<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.210> about<00:01:15.420> two<00:01:15.600> bio<00:01:15.810> pots<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:17.340> you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
equivalent of about two bio pots so you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.890 
equivalent of about two bio pots so you
can<00:01:17.549> see<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.790> generates<00:01:17.909> quite<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> lot<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
can see it generates quite a lot and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.670 
can see it generates quite a lot and
I've<00:01:18.990> said<00:01:19.470> these<00:01:19.619> two<00:01:19.650> units<00:01:20.040> pretty<00:01:20.220> heavily

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
I've said these two units pretty heavily

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.020 
I've said these two units pretty heavily
so<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:22.830> I'm<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.100> do<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.460> I'm<00:01:23.759> not<00:01:23.880> gonna

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
so what I'm going to do is I'm not gonna

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.020 
so what I'm going to do is I'm not gonna
let<00:01:24.150> them<00:01:24.270> all<00:01:24.390> go<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:24.990> one<00:01:25.140> place<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:26.030> if

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
let them all go in one place because if

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.420 
let them all go in one place because if
a<00:01:27.150> predator<00:01:27.450> does<00:01:27.659> find<00:01:27.930> them<00:01:28.110> they<00:01:28.200> could

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
a predator does find them they could

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.039 
a predator does find them they could
decimate<00:01:29.430> them<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:29.970> I'm<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.570> scatter

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
decimate them so I'm going to scatter

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.420 
decimate them so I'm going to scatter
them<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.770> few<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.130> there<00:01:32.250> all

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
them just a few here and there all

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.020 
them just a few here and there all
around<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.450> area<00:01:33.689> where<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.900> keep<00:01:34.140> my<00:01:34.200> bio<00:01:34.439> pods

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
around the area where I keep my bio pods

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.929 
around the area where I keep my bio pods
and<00:01:36.979> hope<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.100> they<00:01:38.250> survive<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> winter

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
and hope that they survive the winter

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.270 
and hope that they survive the winter
I'm<00:01:39.030> sure<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.619> percentage<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.799> them<00:01:40.950> will<00:01:41.070> and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
I'm sure a percentage of them will and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.819 
I'm sure a percentage of them will and
since<00:01:41.520> there<00:01:41.729> are<00:01:42.020> several<00:01:43.020> thousand<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.649> them

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
since there are several thousand of them

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.460 
since there are several thousand of them
here<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.610> about<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.850> four<00:01:45.689> gallon<00:01:45.869> bucket

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
here this is about a four gallon bucket

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.039 
here this is about a four gallon bucket
so<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> little<00:01:48.600> less<00:01:48.689> than<00:01:48.750> two

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
so this is a little less than two

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.170 
so this is a little less than two
gallons<00:01:49.229> probably<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> gallon<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> half<00:01:50.670> I

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
gallons probably a gallon and a half I

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.609 
gallons probably a gallon and a half I
don't<00:01:51.450> know<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:52.159> equaling<00:01:53.159> pounds<00:01:53.939> but

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
don't know what that equaling pounds but

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.580 
don't know what that equaling pounds but
needless<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.829> say<00:01:56.719> quite<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> few<00:01:57.960> thousand<00:01:58.409> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
needless to say quite a few thousand I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.120 
needless to say quite a few thousand I
would<00:01:58.740> say<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.250> one<00:02:00.240> cup<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.810> about<00:02:01.619> six

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
would say one one cup is about six

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.740 
would say one one cup is about six
hundred<00:02:02.219> five<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.090> six<00:02:03.299> hundred<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.600> these

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
hundred five to six hundred of these

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.850 
hundred five to six hundred of these
because<00:02:03.960> they're<00:02:04.079> large<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> that's<00:02:06.060> probably

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
because they're large so that's probably

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.410 
because they're large so that's probably
500

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
500

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.580 
500
conservatively<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.079> can<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.349> there<00:02:10.500> are

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
conservatively so you can see there are

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.559 
conservatively so you can see there are
probably<00:02:11.400> tens<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.790> thousands<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.329> them<00:02:12.480> in

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
probably tens of thousands of them in

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.660 
probably tens of thousands of them in
this<00:02:12.720> bucket<00:02:14.390> okay<00:02:15.390> well<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:16.049> just<00:02:16.670> I'm

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
this bucket okay well that's just I'm

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.940 
this bucket okay well that's just I'm
going<00:02:17.849> to<00:02:17.909> look<00:02:18.030> at<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.299> large<00:02:18.890> quantity<00:02:19.890> of

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
going to look at a large quantity of

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.390 
going to look at a large quantity of
black<00:02:22.950> soldier<00:02:23.340> fly<00:02:23.519> larvae<00:02:23.849> mature<00:02:25.400> black

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
black soldier fly larvae mature black

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.520 
black soldier fly larvae mature black
soldier<00:02:26.760> fly<00:02:26.909> grubs<00:02:27.239> this<00:02:28.170> would<00:02:28.409> probably

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
soldier fly grubs this would probably

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.039 
soldier fly grubs this would probably
make<00:02:28.799> a<00:02:28.829> lot<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.099> chickens<00:02:29.609> for<00:02:30.239> other<00:02:30.420> birds

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
make a lot of chickens for other birds

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:38.869 
make a lot of chickens for other birds
or<00:02:31.260> pets<00:02:31.470> very<00:02:31.739> happy<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:38.280> they're<00:02:38.459> very<00:02:38.640> dry

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
or pets very happy and they're very dry

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.119 
or pets very happy and they're very dry
and<00:02:39.150> they<00:02:39.299> just<00:02:39.450> tickle<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.799> course<00:02:40.950> I'll

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
and they just tickle and of course I'll

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.479 
and they just tickle and of course I'll
wash<00:02:41.310> my<00:02:41.340> hands<00:02:41.670> afterwards<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.359> I<00:02:43.250> can<00:02:44.250> I

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
wash my hands afterwards but I can I

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.129 
wash my hands afterwards but I can I
think<00:02:44.609> these<00:02:44.849> are<00:02:44.909> probably<00:02:45.269> as<00:02:45.569> clean<00:02:45.870> as<00:02:45.989> my

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
think these are probably as clean as my

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.280 
think these are probably as clean as my
dog<00:02:46.349> is<00:02:46.560> when<00:02:46.739> he<00:02:46.829> comes<00:02:47.040> out<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.370> woods<00:02:47.549> so

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
dog is when he comes out of the woods so

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.770 
dog is when he comes out of the woods so
just<00:02:49.290> use<00:02:49.530> normal<00:02:50.220> sanitation<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.329> you'll<00:02:51.690> be

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
just use normal sanitation and you'll be

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.479 
just use normal sanitation and you'll be
fine<00:02:51.959> otherwise<00:02:52.230> if<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.950> doubts<00:02:53.189> just

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
fine otherwise if you have doubts just

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.819 
fine otherwise if you have doubts just
wear<00:02:53.639> gloves
