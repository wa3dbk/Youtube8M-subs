silicon<00:03:13.989> is<00:03:14.110> just<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.410> thick<00:03:14.709> which<00:03:15.130> offers

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
silicon is just so thick which offers

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.280 
silicon is just so thick which offers
which<00:03:15.790> is<00:03:15.910> great<00:03:16.120> because<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.540> gives<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.780> more

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
which is great because it gives you more

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.660 
which is great because it gives you more
protection<00:03:17.769> which<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.070> can<00:03:18.190> always<00:03:18.489> use

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
protection which you can always use

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.580 
protection which you can always use
which<00:03:19.090> is<00:03:19.239> awesome<00:03:19.450> awesome<00:03:20.200> awesome<00:03:20.290> awesome

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
which is awesome awesome awesome awesome

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.280 
which is awesome awesome awesome awesome
more<00:03:21.100> protection<00:03:21.489> so<00:03:22.000> once<00:03:22.330> it's<00:03:22.480> on<00:03:22.630> you

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
more protection so once it's on you

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.840 
more protection so once it's on you
notice<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.590> actually<00:03:24.220> comes<00:03:24.400> up<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.760> the

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
notice that actually comes up to the

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.280 
notice that actually comes up to the
very<00:03:25.000> edge<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.390> screen<00:03:25.660> which<00:03:25.930> is<00:03:26.080> great

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
very edge of the screen which is great

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.780 
very edge of the screen which is great
because<00:03:26.440> then<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:26.830> know<00:03:26.860> your<00:03:27.190> chrome<00:03:27.549> and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
because then you know your chrome and

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.670 
because then you know your chrome and
the<00:03:27.850> very<00:03:28.360> edges<00:03:28.540> of<00:03:28.660> your<00:03:28.780> ipod<00:03:29.170> are<00:03:29.350> actually

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
the very edges of your ipod are actually

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.610 
the very edges of your ipod are actually
perfectly<00:03:30.310> awesomely<00:03:30.880> protected<00:03:31.500> around<00:03:32.500> the

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
perfectly awesomely protected around the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.140 
perfectly awesomely protected around the
edge<00:03:32.769> we<00:03:33.040> have<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.220> whole<00:03:33.580> I'll<00:03:33.790> get<00:03:33.910> to<00:03:34.060> those

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
edge we have a whole I'll get to those

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.280 
edge we have a whole I'll get to those
later<00:03:34.209> actually<00:03:34.510> cuz<00:03:34.750> that's<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:34.959> only<00:03:35.170> thing

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
later actually cuz that's the only thing

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.140 
later actually cuz that's the only thing
i<00:03:35.380> don't<00:03:35.440> like<00:03:35.650> about<00:03:35.739> this<00:03:36.070> case<00:03:36.310> i'm<00:03:36.820> on<00:03:37.060> the

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
i don't like about this case i'm on the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.520 
i don't like about this case i'm on the
bottom<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.450> actually<00:03:37.720> have<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:37.870> big<00:03:38.140> gaping

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
bottom you actually have this big gaping

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.140 
bottom you actually have this big gaping
hole<00:03:38.739> for<00:03:39.040> your<00:03:39.190> 32<00:03:39.489> pin<00:03:39.640> jack<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.060> your

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
hole for your 32 pin jack and your

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.430 
hole for your 32 pin jack and your
headphone<00:03:40.420> jack<00:03:40.630> i<00:03:40.810> wish<00:03:41.110> they<00:03:41.230> could<00:03:41.350> have

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
headphone jack i wish they could have

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.539 
headphone jack i wish they could have
like<00:03:41.560> covered<00:03:41.920> it<00:03:42.010> or<00:03:42.130> because<00:03:42.250> they<00:03:42.370> could

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
like covered it or because they could

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.039 
like covered it or because they could
have<00:03:42.670> stopped<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.180> silicon<00:03:43.510> here<00:03:43.750> instead<00:03:43.989> of

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
have stopped the silicon here instead of

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.240 
have stopped the silicon here instead of
around<00:03:44.380> here<00:03:44.590> if<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:44.739> know<00:03:44.860> what<00:03:44.950> I'm<00:03:45.010> saying

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
around here if you know what I'm saying

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.740 
around here if you know what I'm saying
because<00:03:45.670> this<00:03:45.790> section<00:03:46.120> is<00:03:46.239> kind<00:03:46.450> of<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.690> know

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
because this section is kind of you know

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.479 
because this section is kind of you know
just<00:03:46.959> open<00:03:47.320> you<00:03:47.830> could<00:03:47.950> have<00:03:48.040> put<00:03:48.160> silicone

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
just open you could have put silicone

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.910 
just open you could have put silicone
there<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:48.700> know<00:03:48.790> why<00:03:49.000> be<00:03:49.810> lazy<00:03:50.049> come<00:03:50.709> on<00:03:50.769> just

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
there you know why be lazy come on just

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.620 
there you know why be lazy come on just
put<00:03:50.950> some<00:03:51.160> silicon<00:03:51.489> there<00:03:51.610> add<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.330> little<00:03:52.510> bit

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
put some silicon there add a little bit

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.660 
put some silicon there add a little bit
more<00:03:52.750> protection<00:03:53.070> besides<00:03:54.070> that<00:03:54.160> love<00:03:54.549> it

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
more protection besides that love it

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.240 
more protection besides that love it
really<00:03:54.820> do<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.420> definitely<00:03:56.019> but<00:03:56.799> hands<00:03:57.130> it's

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
really do I definitely but hands it's

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.699 
really do I definitely but hands it's
like<00:03:57.430> okay<00:03:58.360> okay<00:03:58.780> fine<00:03:58.959> I'll<00:03:59.260> start<00:03:59.530> with<00:03:59.590> this

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
like okay okay fine I'll start with this

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.520 
like okay okay fine I'll start with this
the<00:04:00.580> silicon<00:04:01.180> is<00:04:01.450> really<00:04:01.780> great<00:04:01.989> but<00:04:02.230> it's<00:04:02.410> a

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
the silicon is really great but it's a

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.650 
the silicon is really great but it's a
little<00:04:02.830> too<00:04:03.190> soft<00:04:03.610> for<00:04:03.760> my<00:04:03.880> liking<00:04:04.120> I<00:04:04.420> know

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
little too soft for my liking I know

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.910 
little too soft for my liking I know
they<00:04:04.840> call<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.080> a<00:04:05.110> silicone<00:04:05.500> case<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.860> I

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
they call it a silicone case and I

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.500 
they call it a silicone case and I
there's<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.190> ton<00:04:06.489> of<00:04:06.519> different<00:04:06.880> silicon<00:04:07.329> cases

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
there's a ton of different silicon cases

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.050 
there's a ton of different silicon cases
that<00:04:07.750> are<00:04:07.840> soft<00:04:08.380> hard<00:04:09.160> like<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.489> belkin<00:04:09.850> wave

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
that are soft hard like the belkin wave

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.490 
that are soft hard like the belkin wave
I<00:04:10.269> just<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.510> gay<00:04:10.630> boy<00:04:10.810> when<00:04:11.019> I<00:04:11.079> only<00:04:11.230> had<00:04:11.380> like

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
I just a gay boy when I only had like

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.740 
I just a gay boy when I only had like
200<00:04:11.709> subs<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.549> one<00:04:12.730> was<00:04:12.880> really<00:04:13.150> really<00:04:13.450> hard

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
200 subs that one was really really hard

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.170 
200 subs that one was really really hard
silicone<00:04:14.170> and<00:04:14.590> I<00:04:15.100> loved<00:04:15.579> it<00:04:15.760> because<00:04:15.910> it

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
silicone and I loved it because it

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.819 
silicone and I loved it because it
offers<00:04:16.630> shock<00:04:16.840> protection<00:04:17.019> plus<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.680> looked

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
offers shock protection plus it looked

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.849 
offers shock protection plus it looked
really<00:04:18.070> great<00:04:18.310> plus<00:04:19.410> it's<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.470> really<00:04:20.680> really

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
really great plus it's a really really

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.230 
really great plus it's a really really
solid<00:04:21.130> construction<00:04:21.489> so<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:21.970> don't<00:04:22.120> have

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
solid construction so you don't have

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.160 
solid construction so you don't have
these<00:04:22.390> flap

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
these flap

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.260 
these flap
little<00:04:23.380> edges<00:04:23.620> you<00:04:23.710> got<00:04:23.830> going<00:04:24.190> on<00:04:24.280> this<00:04:24.970> lappy

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
little edges you got going on this lappy

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.240 
little edges you got going on this lappy
little<00:04:25.480> edges<00:04:25.780> here<00:04:26.380> aren't<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:27.010> bad

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
little edges here aren't that bad

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.620 
little edges here aren't that bad
obviously<00:04:27.880> I've<00:04:28.000> actually<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:28.510> have<00:04:28.600> another

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
obviously I've actually I have another

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.150 
obviously I've actually I have another
case<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:29.050> have<00:04:29.170> to<00:04:29.260> do<00:04:29.350> a<00:04:29.380> review<00:04:29.590> on<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:29.980> have

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
case I have to do a review on that have

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.910 
case I have to do a review on that have
really<00:04:30.400> bad<00:04:30.670> flat<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.240> edges<00:04:31.540> but<00:04:31.710> this<00:04:32.710> one

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
really bad flat the edges but this one

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.740 
really bad flat the edges but this one
since<00:04:33.190> it's<00:04:33.370> so<00:04:33.490> thick<00:04:33.730> and<00:04:33.880> it's<00:04:34.480> a<00:04:34.540> little

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
since it's so thick and it's a little

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.390 
since it's so thick and it's a little
it's<00:04:35.020> a<00:04:35.080> little<00:04:35.110> harder<00:04:35.530> silicon<00:04:35.950> then<00:04:36.160> the

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
it's a little harder silicon then the

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.400 
it's a little harder silicon then the
other<00:04:36.580> one<00:04:36.610> after<00:04:36.910> review<00:04:37.180> actually<00:04:37.990> stays<00:04:38.230> on

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
other one after review actually stays on

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.140 
other one after review actually stays on
here<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.710> doesn't<00:04:38.830> flap<00:04:39.100> around<00:04:39.130> as<00:04:39.640> much<00:04:39.910> but

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
here and doesn't flap around as much but

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.640 
here and doesn't flap around as much but
still<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.450> know<00:04:40.540> does<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.870> get<00:04:40.990> in<00:04:41.080> there<00:04:41.230> but

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
still you know does to get in there but

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.170 
still you know does to get in there but
I<00:04:41.680> know<00:04:41.770> it's<00:04:41.920> a<00:04:41.980> silicon<00:04:42.340> case<00:04:42.370> so<00:04:42.790> you<00:04:43.000> know

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
I know it's a silicon case so you know

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.270 
I know it's a silicon case so you know
what<00:04:43.600> you<00:04:43.690> gonna<00:04:43.780> do<00:04:43.990> right<00:04:44.200> we<00:04:44.890> have<00:04:45.010> a<00:04:45.040> nice

besides that I really really enjoyed
this<00:04:54.370> case<00:04:54.610> definitely<00:04:55.240> recommend<00:04:55.780> it

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
this case definitely recommend it

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.530 
this case definitely recommend it
because<00:04:56.740> of<00:04:56.980> the<00:04:57.040> price<00:04:57.220> 19<00:04:57.670> but<00:04:57.820> 14<00:04:58.360> bucks

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
because of the price 19 but 14 bucks

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
these volume rocker holes like what was

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.370 
these volume rocker holes like what was
going<00:05:04.060> through<00:05:04.210> your<00:05:04.270> head<00:05:04.510> ifrogz<00:05:05.080> when<00:05:05.290> you

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
confused like you saw my boxing of this

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.280 
confused like you saw my boxing of this
I<00:05:09.580> was<00:05:09.910> like<00:05:09.940> what<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.300> hell<00:05:10.510> I<00:05:10.540> freaked<00:05:11.080> out

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
because I was like what are these holes

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.110 
because I was like what are these holes
for<00:05:12.970> I'm<00:05:13.180> so<00:05:13.450> confused<00:05:13.920> you<00:05:14.920> it's<00:05:15.160> since<00:05:16.030> the

for I'm so confused you it's since the
silicone<00:05:16.510> is<00:05:16.660> just<00:05:16.840> really<00:05:17.140> thick<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:18.010> they

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
silicone is just really thick and they

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.740 
silicone is just really thick and they
just<00:05:18.400> leave<00:05:18.640> a<00:05:18.670> hole<00:05:19.000> there<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:19.480> know<00:05:19.600> they

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
just leave a hole there you know they

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.660 
just leave a hole there you know they
expect<00:05:20.050> you<00:05:20.140> to<00:05:20.170> kind<00:05:20.410> of<00:05:20.440> dig<00:05:20.680> in<00:05:20.830> the

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
expect you to kind of dig in the

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.950 
expect you to kind of dig in the
silicones<00:05:22.000> really<00:05:22.210> thick<00:05:22.420> so<00:05:22.630> you<00:05:22.690> really

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
silicones really thick so you really

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.150 
silicones really thick so you really
have<00:05:22.990> to<00:05:23.110> kind<00:05:23.350> of<00:05:23.380> mush<00:05:23.620> your<00:05:23.770> finger<00:05:24.070> in

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
have to kind of mush your finger in

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.460 
have to kind of mush your finger in
there<00:05:24.280> to<00:05:24.490> dry<00:05:24.670> to<00:05:24.700> add<00:05:24.970> to<00:05:25.150> get<00:05:25.420> to<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.140> button

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
there to dry to add to get to the button

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.320 
there to dry to add to get to the button
to<00:05:26.770> get<00:05:27.010> to<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.220> actual<00:05:27.340> button<00:05:27.700> that<00:05:28.090> kind<00:05:28.270> of

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
to get to the actual button that kind of

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.910 
to get to the actual button that kind of
bothered<00:05:28.660> me<00:05:28.690> because<00:05:28.780> I<00:05:28.990> was<00:05:29.050> like<00:05:29.170> oh<00:05:29.410> come

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
bothered me because I was like oh come

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.290 
bothered me because I was like oh come
on<00:05:30.010> I<00:05:30.040> frogs<00:05:30.400> you<00:05:30.550> can't<00:05:30.730> do<00:05:30.820> that<00:05:30.940> i<00:05:31.000> love<00:05:31.210> your

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
on I frogs you can't do that i love your

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.660 
on I frogs you can't do that i love your
Luck's<00:05:31.540> what<00:05:31.990> happened<00:05:32.320> here<00:05:32.500> so<00:05:33.160> the<00:05:33.340> besides

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
Luck's what happened here so the besides

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.070 
Luck's what happened here so the besides
that<00:05:33.850> the<00:05:34.000> holes<00:05:34.270> they're<00:05:34.750> just<00:05:34.900> you<00:05:34.990> know

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
that the holes they're just you know

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.320 
that the holes they're just you know
just<00:05:35.320> kind<00:05:35.770> of<00:05:35.800> mush<00:05:36.040> through<00:05:36.340> them<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:37.060> get<00:05:37.180> to

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
just kind of mush through them to get to

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.490 
just kind of mush through them to get to
the<00:05:37.420> actual<00:05:37.600> buttons<00:05:37.990> because<00:05:38.140> they're<00:05:38.320> so

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
the actual buttons because they're so

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.770 
the actual buttons because they're so
you<00:05:38.890> know<00:05:38.980> embedded<00:05:39.820> in<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.180> silicone<00:05:40.600> I

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
you know embedded in the silicone I

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.180 
you know embedded in the silicone I
guess<00:05:41.200> that's<00:05:41.320> a<00:05:41.440> good<00:05:41.620> thing<00:05:41.680> because<00:05:41.980> that

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
guess that's a good thing because that

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.880 
guess that's a good thing because that
you<00:05:42.520> know<00:05:42.640> protects<00:05:43.450> your<00:05:43.780> buttons<00:05:44.140> and<00:05:44.380> so

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
you know protects your buttons and so

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.890 
you know protects your buttons and so
dust<00:05:45.250> won't<00:05:45.790> be<00:05:45.940> as<00:05:46.060> prone<00:05:46.420> to<00:05:46.600> getting<00:05:46.690> in

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
dust won't be as prone to getting in

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.390 
dust won't be as prone to getting in
there<00:05:47.020> as<00:05:47.170> with<00:05:47.500> you<00:05:47.530> know<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.740> wide<00:05:48.070> open<00:05:48.100> hole

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
there as with you know a wide open hole

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.040 
there as with you know a wide open hole
but<00:05:48.640> they<00:05:48.700> could<00:05:48.850> just<00:05:49.090> cover<00:05:49.240> that<00:05:49.360> and<00:05:49.630> put

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
but they could just cover that and put

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.110 
but they could just cover that and put
some<00:05:50.200> like<00:05:50.380> bulges<00:05:50.830> here<00:05:51.010> and<00:05:51.370> boulders<00:05:51.790> the

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
some like bulges here and boulders the

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.760 
some like bulges here and boulders the
hell<00:05:52.450> that<00:05:52.900> are<00:05:53.020> you<00:05:53.080> know<00:05:53.170> let<00:05:53.350> you<00:05:53.440> press<00:05:53.620> and

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
hell that are you know let you press and

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.200 
hell that are you know let you press and
know<00:05:53.890> where<00:05:54.070> they<00:05:54.160> are<00:05:54.190> need<00:05:54.610> a<00:05:54.640> little<00:05:55.030> bulge

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
know where they are need a little bulge

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.060 
know where they are need a little bulge
here<00:05:55.440> instead<00:05:56.440> of<00:05:56.500> just<00:05:56.650> leaving<00:05:56.830> a<00:05:56.920> gaping

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
here instead of just leaving a gaping

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.460 
here instead of just leaving a gaping
hole<00:05:57.420> if<00:05:58.420> that<00:05:58.600> makes<00:05:58.810> sense<00:05:58.960> but<00:05:59.170> beside<00:05:59.440> that

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
hole if that makes sense but beside that

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.410 
hole if that makes sense but beside that
I<00:05:59.650> definitely<00:06:00.100> recommend<00:06:00.490> it<00:06:00.880> go<00:06:01.060> check<00:06:01.300> the

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420
