00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.510 
just to build his confidence up and then
we'll<00:03:49.420> try<00:03:49.630> a<00:03:49.660> higher<00:03:49.930> one<00:03:50.110> right<00:03:51.100> if<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.370> go

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
we'll try a higher one right if you go

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
we'll try a higher one right if you go
over<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:52.060> grid<00:03:53.700> as<00:03:54.700> you<00:03:54.880> can<00:03:55.000> see<00:03:55.209> there's

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
over to the grid as you can see there's

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.380 
over to the grid as you can see there's
three<00:03:56.069> elements<00:03:57.160> I'll<00:03:57.250> let<00:03:57.610> take<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.209> top

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
three elements I'll let take the top

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.150 
three elements I'll let take the top
pole<00:03:58.600> off<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:58.989> spread<00:03:59.319> there<00:03:59.620> so<00:03:59.860> that<00:04:00.010> it's

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
pole off that spread there so that it's

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.670 
pole off that spread there so that it's
just<00:04:00.400> three<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.360> same<00:04:01.510> height<00:04:01.780> for<00:04:02.560> now

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
just three of the same height for now

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.210 
just three of the same height for now
and<00:04:02.980> there<00:04:03.880> should<00:04:04.060> be<00:04:06.870> I'd<00:04:07.870> say<00:04:08.260> two<00:04:08.860> strides

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
and there should be I'd say two strides

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.820 
and there should be I'd say two strides
in<00:04:09.459> between<00:04:09.790> but<00:04:10.390> he<00:04:10.660> might<00:04:10.810> do<00:04:10.989> it<00:04:11.110> in<00:04:11.200> one<00:04:11.380> so

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
in between but he might do it in one so

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.770 
in between but he might do it in one so
be<00:04:12.250> ready<00:04:12.400> for<00:04:12.519> that<00:04:12.700> you<00:04:13.150> might<00:04:13.330> have<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:13.600> push
