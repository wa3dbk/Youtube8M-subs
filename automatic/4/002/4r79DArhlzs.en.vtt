00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.660
 hey little ones welcome be a new 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.640
 episode of the pearl adventures my 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.009
 name is juan and fair of the black moon 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.079
 and I'm in 85 because I'm in the 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.550
 realm of evidence and for some reason no 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:27.050
 let me update the characters to 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.800
 level 90 but more realm of evidence than 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.710
 you can wait 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.420
 we are in the fair of the black moon 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.989
 and only now I realized that it 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.989
 waved moves 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.630
 and there are a couple of surprises in the kingdom of 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.010
 5.1 patch testing that was just 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.010
 throw music 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.350
 and the music of the other fair 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.289
 I will find out what they get 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.450
 there are news 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.670
 and there there are a couple of novelties in the 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.470
 fair of the black moon in the park 5.1 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.780
 and is currently in the kingdom of 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.780
 warcraft tests mists of pandaria 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.850
 and some of the new additions have 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.800
 what to do with the fair of the black moon 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.960
 let's see the other additions through 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.950
 tables that had been activated during the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.110
 weather 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.840
 and as long as I also achieved 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.950
 pass my level 90 character to the kingdom 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.620
 of tests because for now it is 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.260
 getting very idiotic 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.760
 if I show you on this side you do not 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.760
 they will find many new things 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.190
 of course they are in the myths and everything 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.470
 There are people who sell their 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.940
 with the coins but if we 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.580
 we started to zoom in from behind to 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.220
 forward especially the girl who sells 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.900
 pets we will find here a 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.370
 new pet who the offspring of the moon 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.740
 black that we actually have here 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.850
 in the lincoln and also when we go to 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.850
 look for it because of problems 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.189
 corner 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.189
 this time easily the bug 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.050
 and also in this patch they are giving us 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.379
 at least in the lion kingdom we 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.209
 are giving to try the kitten ash 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.930
 in fact I have it invoked here I'll 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.930
 I will show immediately 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.420
 this is the kitten 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.420
 that has some sounds also out there 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.380
 it sounds as if someone has issued a 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.660
 scrubbed but it will be as if someone 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.660
 I would have put a cat inside a well 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.510
 and appears in this kitten you can 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:54.510
 get it in the store of my being 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.580
 soon so I hope in that 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.189
 but let's review I'm still reviewing some of 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.900
 the between the new editions to the 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.390
 series of the black moon and basically 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.150
 you know there are these these tents 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.590
 immense that have a message forward 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.159
 that says there will soon be a game here 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.920
 good in patch 5.1 they pulled two of 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.959
 the tents and now yes games so 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.519
 we can find one of them in one of them 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.459
 new pet tamer that is called 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.290
 jervis physio that is exclusive to the 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.359
 fair the luminary then we 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.519
 we have to fight against him and all his 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.319
 pets are level 25 and are tomás 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.720
 things that can be found inside 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.519
 the black fair including this one that 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.160
 call sentence and I will apologize 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.080
 background sound 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.850
 sentence is a pet that comes out in the 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.040
 fair of the black moon as a reward to 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.420
 this daily mission that only supplies 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.610
 of the mascot of the black moon then 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.080
 we have to basically 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.270
 defeat yesterday difficult in a fight of 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.700
 pets however as I do not have 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.319
 more cases at level 25 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.720
 because those are the pets that he has 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.010
 I'm not going to fight this guy, but if 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.569
 you have pets at level 25 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.760
 you can fight against this guy 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.350
 on a daily basis not having a little bit of 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.420
 gold 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.260
 and they also get a little bag from the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:11.360
 which you can get the ojito 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.360
 we are united by an enemy in common 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.049
 and we also have another new edition 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.879
 inside him 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.009
 inside the fair of the black moon that 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:22.610
 it's really how beautiful we have 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:25.290
 a nice screen in here 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.139
 under the name of you 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.199
 and it will give us 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.969
 permission to enter a carousel 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.150
 but apparently I need to buy tickets 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:34.150
 for 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.210
 how they came out 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.650
 appear is not the seller 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.340
 but the house is that there is good you can 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.340
 see at least from outside 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.280
 to several things that can be assembled 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.680
 there's a tap out there and a rocket there's a 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.600
 block 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.370
 app 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.380
 but as the seller of the chips does not 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.440
 is maybe this is not to say 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.770
 completely complete worth the 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.449
 redundancy 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.379
 but that the new thing that you are going to 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:13.840
 to find and not point olivia 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.460
 you have to be radical, those are the things 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.949
 new ones that you can find or 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.020
 who will they be able to find in the patch 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.270
 5.1 inside the fair of the black moon 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.889
 soon I will be recording does it 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.810
 additions such as missions 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.009
 that are going to start happening inside the 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.680
 screen continent very 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.810
 specifically the area of ​​the thickets 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.310
 of fat they will do and we will also throw 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.650
 a look as long as I 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.009
 let's say in the copy of 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.599
 characters let's take a look at the 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:43.700
 we saw the fight club that is like 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:45.890
 many people know him 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.660
