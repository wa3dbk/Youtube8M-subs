many<00:00:02.790> people<00:00:03.120> think<00:00:03.330> self-driving<00:00:04.259> cars<00:00:04.589> are

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
many people think self-driving cars are

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.190 
many people think self-driving cars are
science<00:00:05.190> fiction<00:00:05.549> but<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.450> reality<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:06.930> that

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
science fiction but the reality is that

in this case I still have to supervise
the<00:00:36.719> system<00:00:37.050> because<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.590> an<00:00:37.649> early
