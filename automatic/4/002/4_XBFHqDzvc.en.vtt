00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.010
 Because 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.429
 There are a lot of things on this 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.670

 And cheap card has emerged 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:58.980

 And still do normal card 10,000 per what grams of the 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.820

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.450

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.870
 Something of this gram 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.250
