00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
are the cause of Sweden because others

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.210

Chauvin and SJ at the moment so I'm
alone<00:07:18.140> again<00:07:18.400> then<00:07:19.400> again<00:07:19.430> I<00:07:19.790> bet<00:07:20.030> they

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 
alone again then again I bet they

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.420 
alone again then again I bet they
probably<00:07:20.540> just<00:07:20.720> left<00:07:21.530> to<00:07:21.710> call<00:07:21.890> because<00:07:22.160> they

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.430 
probably just left to call because they

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.780 
probably just left to call because they
don't<00:07:22.610> like<00:07:22.790> hockey

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:27.790 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.130 

well<00:07:28.790> that's<00:07:29.120> the<00:07:29.330> end<00:07:29.360> of<00:07:29.600> the<00:07:29.720> first<00:07:29.900> period

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.140 
well that's the end of the first period

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.850 
well that's the end of the first period
and<00:07:31.870> things<00:07:32.870> are<00:07:32.990> not<00:07:33.110> going<00:07:33.290> terribly<00:07:33.620> well

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.620 

so<00:07:36.860> let's<00:07:37.460> just<00:07:37.730> leave<00:07:38.180> that<00:07:38.240> as<00:07:38.600> a

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:38.630 
so let's just leave that as a

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.240 
so let's just leave that as a
cliffhanger<00:07:39.140> move<00:07:40.100> on<00:07:40.340> shall<00:07:40.730> we

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.250 
cliffhanger move on shall we

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.220 
cliffhanger move on shall we
slapshot<00:07:43.250> ladies<00:07:43.580> animal<00:07:44.950> slap<00:07:45.950> shot
