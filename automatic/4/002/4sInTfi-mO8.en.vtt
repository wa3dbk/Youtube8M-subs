00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:05.440
 that's a subject that you have to understand that your career is also being and we're going 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.250
 also step by step 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.480
 these are friendly matches and montilla matches will come 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.720
 official commitments or commitments of eliminatory 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.619
 owned the technical director will know and this missionary 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.699
 Well let's wait for your boy york with just 20 years and with a lot of future and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.010
 right now it will not make a difference in the team 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.810
 and we are going to give us the modern tribune times we put ourselves in advance to 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.530
 someone and try to cut heads ahead of time and gold that the doors 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.610
 from my point of view but there is also technical body and direction 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.930
 general national team the secretary general in the federation 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.270
 from my point of view the for this Christmas if we are going to wait for you not you 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.250
 He announced what the path to retraining is not the first thing that 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.180
 you need not 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.510
 an idea is to have the pride of carrying the green if you do not have that interest 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.790
 masters your side if you have interest seek and point important characters 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.879
 let's hope I cut it and the coaching staff does not 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.720
 when the difference I think that right here we take a player who does 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.000
 difference I think the point about going played better than him but 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.940
 really barely 20 years old 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.070
 I was four years old with six and seven to be in Brazil. San Jose does 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.090
 difference and of course it's knocking the doors 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.440
 that is indisputably that it is not having the best ones I think so that it declared 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.540
 the best ones also have to have the best disposition to wear the green 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.020
 I think it would be 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.810
 p be even because there are other Mexican players who are in Europe 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.760
 just as young or maybe a little bit - young 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.990
 yonatan 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.380
 that does not put any condition to come I think of the brother himself 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.180
 or think about me chicharito hernández who is only two years older than 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.980
 yonathan and still very young 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.920
 and it does not put any condition 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.340
 to come with the Mexican national team when chicharito is also 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.759
 trying to win a starting position with his team so in this case I do not 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.310
 I find a greater justification in Jonathan would also have to think that 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.829
 if it's dad 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.629
 the pope that crosses and that put it 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.749
 kuchar another osi is really yonathan who is deciding not to come to these 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.719
 this appointment calls and merged with plan if you are not interested in the 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.149
 selection then by your side if you are interested 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.989
 by her toyota has already been sided on two occasions the interested molá 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.259
 Per hundred of the last two calls it is clear to me that we 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.939
 missing big maturity percent of the pope to him if it's from the people who run it 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.019
 also because I think that there should be the 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:38.829
 percent 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.689
 distension the sensitivity the intelligence to know that if it were not 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.650
 world cup looked for because it did not want javier aguirre in the previous annotation 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.790
 that's a new place but also good if it's always a little 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.889
 maturity and it does not surprise me to hear this is to say the doors are open 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.950
 when he endured what I can stand a guy like nery castle that 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:56.740
 did other 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.719
 worse 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.039
 to the Galapagos 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.049
 now all of you more 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.629
 I insist I estimate a lot if people did not comply when presenting the 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.880
 appeal that is called justino compean 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.189
 I do not understand, I'm justified 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.049
 especially xavi does not know football because when I pray for the world cup 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.239
 He said he did not think because he did not know about football and today he is giving his opinion 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.260
 situations 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.710
 eminently and exclusively sporting says there are better players than yonathan 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.300
 If you do not know what football is based on just to make this judgment, it seems to me 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.089
 that you have to be congruent by never talking about soccer 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:35.489
 or always talk about football in good times and bad in the other 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.510
 this ds that the player who does not have the pride to wear the green because not 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.189
 come on 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.749
 I also say the federation justino the first ones that have to 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:45.459
 respect the green 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.909
 you are the first to be proud of the green as you say 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.309
 sun you 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:57.229
 and you do not cover well the green do not respect the green you use it for 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:02.299
 for profit only if they will respect it if they would like it 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:08.040
 they would have so many molero matches they would explode vilely they would not give him away 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.049
 the shirt the green to anyone in order to meet 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.210
 with an economic commitment 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.879
 so 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.650
 that yonathan and that all 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.150
 green beacon you managers who are the owners of the green 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.490
 he really yearns 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.909
 give the example 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.460
 not always cheney 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.680
 the hell towards the player and criticize him and receive not you not 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.400
 they want the green you are worth the green hat 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.210
 for pride of having debate of the players if you sell to the green and 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.069
 window 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.490
 as if it were a shirt the place is hurrying national team 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.680
 it bothers me a lot that they criticize yonathan and the players who do not come 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.320
 to creep out of respect for the truth by flying with the moral to see men who 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.919
 he wants those who know what we will see dollars in cuts like 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.139
 boxing sports carlos inn 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.430
 pamplona what I'm going to say this 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.729
 electrical of a principle of order 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.129
 a principle of order and rules of equity for all s 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.370
 exact if you are going to follow a rule with yonathan good for legalization 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:11.379
 create a precedent 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.389
 then everyone to create a precedent 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.370
 When Rafael Marquez tells you today I have a fan level match on Saturday 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.690
 although that fifa date
