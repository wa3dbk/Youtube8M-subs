00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.779
 Well guys, here we have a new 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.970
 video in this case we also have a 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.340
 new server now if the server is 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.080
 done by me but good really has 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.910
 taken a lot to do it a lot very much 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.250
 good time not very much three days but 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.109
 blue or whatever the destination setting 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.970
 plugins and all really the server has 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.320
 stayed super good and that's why they 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.850
 I recommend that they go to try it the 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.890
 description of the link win session on 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.449
 link or the ip I leave here in the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.140
 description of the video so go and 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.140
 join 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.929
 good guys to whom super things 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.219
 fast the server comes first 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.800
 is that they ask how I register 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.350
 well, put the register bar and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.089
 can your password the password 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.469
 obviously he will be here and then 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.050
 is going to tell you that you are going to repeat it for 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.510
 confirm you become totally what 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.030
 same or you re-register with 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.559
 your password obviously and then 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.330
 repeat the password again 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.940
 you put in your moment but obviously 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.649
 I'm wrong here but you put your 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.720
 password as good is a space 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.210
 and you repeat it and you'll be good 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.009
 already registered simply theologies by 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.950
 another side you have to know where then 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.600
 Yes decide whether to use or not use pp 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.630
 that is, if we stick with each other or 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.909
 not so what better than if we and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.490
 we ourselves can choose the pvp or 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.440
 be you choose if you want to fight or not 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.000
 obviously that has some bad things 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.340
 because if you kill someone they will charge you a 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.720
 a certain amount of money but good 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.490
 each one's flame as we do 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.649
 we really put a command that is 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.020
 bp and let's say and disable them with the 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.020
 same command psuv see your per super fast 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.700
 now richard I am in my house as the 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.990
 I can save or how I do not 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.090
 lose me the truth that is very easy 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.009
 obviously first you have to choose which one 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.159
 it's your house and then we're going to put 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.320
 commandos &amp; home &amp; home why they plowed 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.700
 because there you are going to configure it there 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.090
 that we take advantage of to put the store for 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.159
 that we put word store which is going to be 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.840
 obviously having transportation to the 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.610
 store here in the store we can 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.739
 observe how there are so many things there 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.140
 eyes there is everything that you 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.360
 imagine so to protect future 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.280
 the house we also have food and good 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.780
 here I'm going to change game world because 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.580
 I was in survival and I do not want to die and 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.500
 lose my life and all this but good 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.209
 also of the prices the protection and 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.350
 everything something that they have to go into 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.180
 account is that the server is still in 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.190
 beta phase so many may be missing 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.290
 things already just to go home 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.200
 we put the home key and then where the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.200
 we keep then they will return us to 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.200
 teleport 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.500
 Well now they will ask and how 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.209
 earn money to buy a house 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.060
 normal here at the moment is like this 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.500
 assassinate then mou and sell things in the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.090
 same youtube store that good to the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.890
 store but then we will implement 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.450
 jobs but that already goes in a small 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.300
 future but you have to take advantage of this 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.800
 now something very very important richard 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.840
 as I do for those inside my house 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.310
 good for that you are you have to 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.470
 share little things that are a bit expensive 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.209
 like anything but there are several 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.730
 types in this case there are three we have the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.860
 of carbon the blue pencil and the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.420
 diamond each has its price and its 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.040
 respective as power is not giving us 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.720
 five times five times five times five 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.640
 be five on the five side on the other side 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.530
 not controlled and on the other five 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.750
 up and five down there 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.780
 we have the blue pencil and which gives us 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.989
 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 that is totally what 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.930
 same but nothing more and then follows the 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.090
 of diamond and stopped highland we would do 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.810
 of which equally we charge that this we 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.090
 complement by 20 by 20 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.849
 good guys now something very important 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.470
 as vice will start the server obviously 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.330
 give us a protection so to speak 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.069
 so it is highly recommended that if not 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.690
 you have where to make your house or something 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.730
 just have a sign and put it 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.230
 in your chest the man automatically goes 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.450
 to be protected by you is not going to be 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.459
 only yours too that he speaks no 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.870
 will not be able to do it even if you do not have houses 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.360
 simply with the fact of putting a 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.099
 chest there will be ready if you want to put 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.989
 or take things out you can do it without 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.880
 no problem only the one that has 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.800
 since you can simply put your 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.950
 oven obviously you can steal things 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.209
 so what better than to put it on 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.489
 also a furnace to get us to 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.530
 steal anything like that but not good guys 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.600
 I hope and join the server will be 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.150
 future things that is there are many things 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.979
 I'm going to be going to drop accounts this 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.510
 who wins the best house that week 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.610
 let's help the server and I'll look 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.260
 administrators so that's why they 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.240
 I highly recommend that you get into 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.919
 serve now so that the accounts win 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.960
 that are going to serve the server is super 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.820
 alright so once it 's guys we'll see each other 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.820
 in the next video we'll see you
