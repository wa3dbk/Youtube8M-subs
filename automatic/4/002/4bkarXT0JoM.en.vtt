00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
am a dragon made of ice guys are you are

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.220 
am a dragon made of ice guys are you are
you<00:00:21.480> seeing<00:00:21.779> this

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230

they're like good what that Kaplan I

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.830 
they're like good what that Kaplan I
think<00:00:47.500> I<00:00:47.620> see<00:00:47.860> I<00:00:48.129> think<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.760> see<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.570> remnants

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
think I see I think I see the remnants

you see this purple stuff here
whoo<00:00:57.460> purple<00:00:58.390> stuff<00:00:58.570> way<00:00:59.350> over<00:00:59.589> here<00:00:59.800> by<00:00:59.949> where

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
whoo purple stuff way over here by where

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:09.469 
whoo purple stuff way over here by where
the<00:01:00.760> fountain<00:01:01.180> was<00:01:04.830> taint<00:01:05.830> this<00:01:06.400> is<00:01:06.580> taint<00:01:07.170> hmm

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the fountain was taint this is taint hmm

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.830 
the fountain was taint this is taint hmm
explosive<00:01:10.479> like<00:01:10.600> that<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:12.000> don't<00:01:13.000> think<00:01:13.360> it<00:01:13.630> is

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
explosive like that I don't think it is

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.109 
explosive like that I don't think it is
well<00:01:14.680> when<00:01:14.979> they<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.220> Masters<00:01:15.670> in<00:01:15.789> a<00:01:15.880> large

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
well when they the Masters in a large

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.660 
well when they the Masters in a large
enough<00:01:16.390> quantity<00:01:16.890> through<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.039> principles

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
enough quantity through the principles

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.440 
enough quantity through the principles
of<00:01:18.880> theoretical<00:01:19.600> physics<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:21.520> possible<00:01:22.210> for

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
of theoretical physics it's possible for

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.990 
of theoretical physics it's possible for
taint<00:01:22.899> to<00:01:23.200> turn<00:01:23.470> itself<00:01:23.770> into<00:01:24.000> plastic

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
taint to turn itself into plastic

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.639 
taint to turn itself into plastic
explosives<00:01:27.420> what<00:01:28.420> was<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.750> what's<00:01:29.259> going<00:01:29.500> on

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
explosives what was that what's going on

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.190 
explosives what was that what's going on
oh<00:01:29.860> my<00:01:30.399> god

see<00:01:32.250> Wow<00:01:33.310> are<00:01:33.910> you<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.240> more<00:01:34.869> exploding<00:01:36.539> this

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
see Wow are you that more exploding this

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.480 
see Wow are you that more exploding this
poor<00:01:37.990> poor<00:01:38.410> village<00:01:39.750> our<00:01:40.750> home<00:01:41.110> we<00:01:41.350> have<00:01:41.500> we

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
poor poor village our home we have we

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.649 
poor poor village our home we have we
have<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.790> start<00:01:43.030> anew

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
have to start anew

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.990 
have to start anew
I<00:01:43.689> have<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.590> guess<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.810> well<00:01:46.810> looks<00:01:47.380> like<00:01:48.000> only

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
I have a guess so well looks like only

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.609 
I have a guess so well looks like only
one<00:01:49.270> building<00:01:49.750> left<00:01:50.909> what<00:01:51.909> is<00:01:52.150> there<00:01:52.600> how<00:01:53.470> are

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
one building left what is there how are

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.719 
one building left what is there how are
you<00:01:53.710> gonna<00:01:53.950> shoot<00:01:55.950> Harry<00:01:56.950> did

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
you gonna shoot Harry did

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:08.910 
you gonna shoot Harry did
me<00:01:57.939> too<00:01:58.150> I<00:02:00.030> think<00:02:01.030> it's<00:02:01.180> it<00:02:04.649> oh<00:02:05.649> there<00:02:06.399> goes<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
me too I think it's it oh there goes and

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.560 
me too I think it's it oh there goes and
that<00:02:09.100> would<00:02:09.280> be<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.579> end<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.940> village<00:02:10.090> oh

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
that would be the end of the village oh

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.490 
that would be the end of the village oh
boy

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
boy

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.680

hey ice come on ice versus fire that's
the<00:03:33.640> way<00:03:33.760> things<00:03:34.060> are

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.820 

I'm<00:03:37.570> just<00:03:37.690> gonna<00:03:37.780> kill<00:03:38.020> jamun<00:03:38.380> I<00:03:38.530> think<00:03:38.710> that's

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
I'm just gonna kill jamun I think that's

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.090 
I'm just gonna kill jamun I think that's
the<00:03:38.980> solution<00:03:39.540> no<00:03:40.540> no<00:03:41.230> no<00:03:41.290> which<00:03:41.740> one<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:41.950> you

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
the solution no no no which one of you

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.410 
the solution no no no which one of you
used<00:03:42.250> gammon<00:03:42.670> not<00:03:43.270> the<00:03:43.510> one<00:03:43.720> flying<00:03:44.050> away<00:03:44.260> I

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
used gammon not the one flying away I

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.990 
used gammon not the one flying away I
guess<00:03:46.420> it<00:03:46.570> won't<00:03:46.690> fly<00:03:46.960> away<00:03:47.700> wait<00:03:48.700> you're<00:03:48.850> both
