00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
alright so the kickflip is the first

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.060 
alright so the kickflip is the first
flip<00:00:41.629> trick<00:00:41.870> you'll<00:00:42.019> probably<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:42.679> want<00:00:42.859> to

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
flip trick you'll probably you want to

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.180 
flip trick you'll probably you want to
learn<00:00:43.250> how<00:00:43.429> to<00:00:43.460> do<00:00:43.699> it's<00:00:44.420> probably<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.500> most<00:00:45.649> I

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
the other trick other flip tricks you

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.410 
the other trick other flip tricks you
wanna<00:00:56.179> do

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
wanna do

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.000 
wanna do
so<00:00:59.420> yeah<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.749> kickflip<00:01:00.109> is<00:01:00.260> pretty<00:01:00.530> much<00:01:00.710> the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
so yeah the kickflip is pretty much the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.450 
so yeah the kickflip is pretty much the
motion<00:01:01.370> where<00:01:01.489> your<00:01:01.640> board<00:01:01.850> flips<00:01:02.210> once

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
motion where your board flips once

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.930 
motion where your board flips once
towards<00:01:04.460> your<00:01:05.150> palm<00:01:05.570> of<00:01:05.870> your<00:01:05.900> hand<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.940> it

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
towards your palm of your hand and it

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.490 
towards your palm of your hand and it
does<00:01:08.180> one<00:01:08.390> full<00:01:08.660> flip<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.170> then<00:01:09.230> you<00:01:09.320> just

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
does one full flip and then you just

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.710 
does one full flip and then you just
like<00:01:09.680> before<00:01:10.520> you<00:01:10.820> learn<00:01:11.000> how<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.240> kickflip

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
like before you learn how to kickflip

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.840 
like before you learn how to kickflip
you<00:01:11.930> probably<00:01:12.410> want<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:12.830> already<00:01:13.340> know<00:01:13.640> how<00:01:13.820> to

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
you probably want to already know how to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.240 
you probably want to already know how to
do<00:01:14.030> a<00:01:14.060> nice<00:01:14.870> and<00:01:15.170> solid<00:01:15.410> ollie

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.560 

once<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.340> get<00:01:19.490> your<00:01:19.610> Ollie's<00:01:19.970> nice<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.360> solid

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
once you get your Ollie's nice and solid

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.960 
once you get your Ollie's nice and solid
and<00:01:20.900> consistent<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.980> pretty<00:01:22.340> good<00:01:22.550> height

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
and consistent and a pretty good height

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.480 
and consistent and a pretty good height
you<00:01:23.330> should<00:01:23.570> be<00:01:23.690> pretty<00:01:23.990> set<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:24.500> do<00:01:24.680> how<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.190> do

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
you should be pretty set to do how to do

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.860 
you should be pretty set to do how to do
a<00:01:25.520> kickflip

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.230 

into<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.290> finger<00:01:30.740> positioning<00:01:31.340> I<00:01:31.610> like<00:01:32.090> to

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
into the finger positioning I like to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.750 
into the finger positioning I like to
have<00:01:32.450> my<00:01:32.690> in<00:01:33.200> my<00:01:33.560> middle<00:01:33.950> finger<00:01:34.220> on<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.550> tail

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
have my in my middle finger on the tail

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.820 
have my in my middle finger on the tail
nice<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:35.540> solid<00:01:35.750> in<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.140> middle<00:01:36.440> just<00:01:36.710> like

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
nice and solid in the middle just like

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.880 
nice and solid in the middle just like
how<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.280> would<00:01:37.430> do<00:01:37.670> for<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.910> nollie<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.890> for

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
how you would do for a nollie and for

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.790 
how you would do for a nollie and for
your<00:01:40.160> index<00:01:40.970> finger<00:01:41.300> I<00:01:41.660> usually<00:01:42.440> like<00:01:42.650> to<00:01:42.680> have

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
your index finger I usually like to have

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.310 
your index finger I usually like to have
it<00:01:43.250> pretty<00:01:43.640> much<00:01:43.820> just<00:01:44.480> like<00:01:44.660> an<00:01:44.840> ollie<00:01:45.020> to

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
it pretty much just like an ollie to

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.920 
it pretty much just like an ollie to
just<00:01:45.650> right<00:01:45.860> in<00:01:46.070> between<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.820> middle<00:01:47.720> of<00:01:47.840> the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
just right in between the middle of the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.930 
just right in between the middle of the
board<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.470> behind<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.950> front<00:01:49.190> truck<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:49.790> it's

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
board and behind the front truck so it's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.140 
board and behind the front truck so it's
just<00:01:50.030> like<00:01:50.440> about<00:01:51.440> here

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
just like about here

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.840 
just like about here
so<00:01:53.150> overall<00:01:53.510> your<00:01:53.930> finger<00:01:54.890> booth<00:01:55.070> positioning

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
so overall your finger booth positioning

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.600 
so overall your finger booth positioning
should<00:01:56.060> be<00:01:56.210> around<00:01:56.480> this<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:58.250> don't<00:01:58.400> have<00:01:58.490> to

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
should be around this you don't have to

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.340 
should be around this you don't have to
do<00:01:58.730> it<00:01:58.760> like<00:01:58.970> it's<00:01:59.150> kickflip<00:01:59.720> I<00:01:59.870> escaped<00:02:00.170> or

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
do it like it's kickflip I escaped or

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.880 
do it like it's kickflip I escaped or
were<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.970> front<00:02:01.970> finger<00:02:02.540> is<00:02:03.140> hanging<00:02:03.710> off<00:02:03.860> a

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
were you front finger is hanging off a

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.260 
were you front finger is hanging off a
bit<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.310> could<00:02:04.460> just<00:02:04.640> do<00:02:04.730> it<00:02:04.760> just<00:02:05.000> like<00:02:05.210> a

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
bit you could just do it just like a

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.620 
bit you could just do it just like a
normal<00:02:05.450> ollie<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.400> because<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.580> how<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.420> do<00:02:08.600> a

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
normal ollie and because the how to do a

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.120 
normal ollie and because the how to do a
kickflip<00:02:09.050> is<00:02:09.200> pretty<00:02:09.410> much<00:02:09.500> all<00:02:09.710> in<00:02:09.980> your

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
kickflip is pretty much all in your

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
kickflip is pretty much all in your
wrist<00:02:10.280> flick<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.060> yeah<00:02:11.840> let's<00:02:12.080> get<00:02:12.170> into<00:02:12.260> that

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.390 

it's<00:02:16.329> so<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.750> motion<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.709> kickflip<00:02:18.099> is

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
it's so the motion of the kickflip is

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.259 
it's so the motion of the kickflip is
pretty<00:02:20.040> explanatory<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.519> would<00:02:21.730> think<00:02:21.909> just

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
pretty explanatory I would think just

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.089 
pretty explanatory I would think just
like<00:02:22.420> me<00:02:22.569> ollie<00:02:22.780> what<00:02:23.379> you<00:02:23.470> want<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.739> do<00:02:23.860> is

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
like me ollie what you want to do is

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.880 
like me ollie what you want to do is
roll<00:02:24.459> up<00:02:24.489> just<00:02:24.849> roll<00:02:25.810> up<00:02:25.900> regular<00:02:26.530> cuz<00:02:26.769> they're

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
roll up just roll up regular cuz they're

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.179 
roll up just roll up regular cuz they're
doing<00:02:27.129> a<00:02:27.189> regular<00:02:27.370> kickflip<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:29.290> set

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
doing a regular kickflip just set

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.920 
doing a regular kickflip just set
yourself<00:02:30.310> up<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> normal<00:02:31.420> ollie

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
yourself up like a normal ollie

pop the tail slide your fingers up and
once<00:03:23.169> you're<00:03:23.290> sliding<00:03:23.500> up<00:03:23.859> and<00:03:24.099> you're<00:03:24.280> in<00:03:24.370> the

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
once you're sliding up and you're in the

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.710 
once you're sliding up and you're in the
air<00:03:24.639> that's<00:03:24.879> when<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.060> want<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.269> flick<00:03:25.540> out

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
you don't have to like do it it's not

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.689 
you don't have to like do it it's not
like<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.900> finger<00:03:29.379> motion<00:03:29.769> it's<00:03:30.220> kind<00:03:30.459> of<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.609> is

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
like a finger motion it's kind of it is

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.610 
like a finger motion it's kind of it is
all<00:03:31.239> in<00:03:31.419> your<00:03:31.569> wrist<00:03:31.750> in<00:03:31.959> town<00:03:32.199> where<00:03:32.379> you<00:03:32.470> do

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
the flick and I'll get the board a flip

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.619 
the flick and I'll get the board a flip
and<00:03:34.959> then<00:03:35.139> you<00:03:35.319> just<00:03:35.560> like<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:37.060> you<00:03:37.120> can't

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
and then you just like so you can't

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.990 
and then you just like so you can't
really<00:03:37.840> I<00:03:38.319> can't<00:03:38.530> really<00:03:38.829> get<00:03:39.190> much<00:03:39.430> more<00:03:39.730> into

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
really I can't really get much more into

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.349 
really I can't really get much more into
detail<00:03:40.419> on<00:03:40.599> how<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.810> do<00:03:41.379> this<00:03:41.530> trick<00:03:42.150> some<00:03:43.150> good

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
detail on how to do this trick some good

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.050 
detail on how to do this trick some good
way<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.810> practice<00:03:43.989> it<00:03:44.409> is<00:03:44.560> just<00:03:45.340> making<00:03:45.819> sure

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
way to practice it is just making sure

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.750 
way to practice it is just making sure
just<00:03:46.930> practicing<00:03:47.349> maybe<00:03:47.620> like<00:03:47.889> the<00:03:48.099> flicking

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
just practicing maybe like the flicking

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.119 
just practicing maybe like the flicking
motion<00:03:49.060> in<00:03:49.269> your<00:03:49.419> hand<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:50.440> then<00:03:50.650> pretty<00:03:51.040> much

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
motion in your hand and then pretty much

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.599 
motion in your hand and then pretty much
it's<00:03:51.790> all<00:03:51.970> practice<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:53.229> just<00:03:53.500> want<00:03:53.829> once<00:03:54.459> you

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
it's all practice you just want once you

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.550 
it's all practice you just want once you
define<00:03:54.940> once<00:03:55.359> you're<00:03:55.599> able<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:55.930> do<00:03:56.079> it<00:03:56.199> one<00:03:56.379> so

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
define once you're able to do it one so

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.280 
define once you're able to do it one so
I'm<00:03:56.620> pretty<00:03:56.769> sure<00:03:56.979> you'll<00:03:57.159> be<00:03:57.370> able<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.819> do<00:03:57.970> it

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
I'm pretty sure you'll be able to do it

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.599 
I'm pretty sure you'll be able to do it
every<00:03:59.290> time<00:03:59.530> because<00:03:59.769> it's<00:04:00.040> all<00:04:00.280> in<00:04:00.459> your

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
every time because it's all in your

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.119 
every time because it's all in your
muscle<00:04:00.909> memory<00:04:01.030> once<00:04:01.930> you<00:04:02.049> once<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:02.889> practice

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
muscle memory once you once you practice

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.719 
muscle memory once you once you practice
it<00:04:03.519> enough<00:04:03.849> and<00:04:04.389> you<00:04:05.139> get<00:04:05.560> a<00:04:05.620> flick<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.310> your

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
it enough and you get a flick of your

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.449 
it enough and you get a flick of your
wrist<00:04:06.879> all<00:04:07.540> coordinated<00:04:08.199> and<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:08.739> could

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
wrist all coordinated and you could

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.229 
wrist all coordinated and you could
catch<00:04:09.849> your<00:04:10.090> board<00:04:10.349> then<00:04:11.349> you<00:04:12.220> print<00:04:13.060> your

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
catch your board then you print your

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.969 
catch your board then you print your
hands<00:04:13.599> will<00:04:13.810> pretty<00:04:13.989> much<00:04:14.169> know<00:04:14.409> how<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.650> do<00:04:14.829> it

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:14.979 
hands will pretty much know how to do it

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.779 
hands will pretty much know how to do it
and<00:04:15.299> yeah<00:04:16.299> I<00:04:16.659> just<00:04:17.139> can't<00:04:17.409> stress<00:04:18.130> out<00:04:18.340> enough

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
and yeah I just can't stress out enough

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.390 
and yeah I just can't stress out enough
on<00:04:19.169> making<00:04:20.169> sure<00:04:20.229> you<00:04:20.470> have<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.680> really<00:04:21.190> solid

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
on making sure you have a really solid
