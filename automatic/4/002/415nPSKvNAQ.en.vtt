00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.389
 the youtube staff suplicy squid and the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.380
 Today's media is another video about gta 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.230
 and Syria 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.960
 and as you can see by the title is a 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.630
 lightweight graphics template for pc and weak 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.680
 is this model that works on 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.750
 any pc 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.090
 but personal attention I assure you 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.330
 that the mode works perfectly in 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.519
 computers that have processor 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.870
 they said they could have said brain and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.149
 more modern than he is from the cole in 3 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.820
 Ikea will work anyway, so I 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.770
 I tested in the test and also tested 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.239
 celeron and the two most 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.809
 I have weaknesses here 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.789
 neither of them has a video card 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.410
 so no problems if you do not have and 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.590
 this employee is perfectly 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.719
 running up to the maximum chart up to 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.680
 because we already have Cecilia is a game 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.590
 very light 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.750
 but of course there is very heavy moles 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.170
 of graphics for gta vassiliki one of the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.580
 lap and no wheel is without video card 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.100
 there is so much that I will even bring 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.080
 video for you on this tactical chart 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.549
 only really works to understand where it is 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.990
 and have video card 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.720
 so the people with you can see 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.720
 For the images, the graphic is good, I guess. 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.500
 I will be him and have used him for some 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.930
 days 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.030
 their spending improves a lot 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.360
 objective goes yes if it blasts a 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.810
 frost the car beats including 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.119
 it also adds new movements to the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.310
 Character tanks are cool too 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.869
 but ultimately it is today is the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.090
 own images are showing there 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.460
 You guys, how's the mob an explanation? 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.259

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.210

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.259
 I will stop making videos. 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.270
 I'm just very close to my 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.520

 stop making videos and stay 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.420
 that as well as stimulating 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.479
 passing the channel will have practically 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.740
 videos every day is on record this 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.079
 What am I talking about charging too? 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.550
 because it's going to happen but it's difficult 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.349
 subject for another video 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.849

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.800
 and I'll show you the 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.700

 come on 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.569
 the guys now let's go for installation 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.340
 it 's very simple 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.250
 Of course I'll leave it at the institution of the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.440
 video the way you always do 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.360
 You're going to lower it, it's not much. 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.150
 large is the file is not large and 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.239

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.390

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.920
 and I will also leave the institution of 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.380
 video credits of the author of the mode tÃ¡ 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.549

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.980

 piece will vary and if you ask you already know 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.780

 the campaign aims to stop Sicily and 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.140
 With you, you see, it's working. 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.570
 normal 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.390
 the graphics is already working you 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.050
 can see the car is already with the reflex 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.580
 huh 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.730
 but before that let me show you something 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.510
 You're here on the menu and 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.590
 came in options display if I am 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.220
 here in English 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:24.550
 and here I have the brightness of that brightness 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.260
 You can reduce the sun a little. 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.540
 you want to decrease 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.120
 It's up to you, but one 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.590
 detail does not diminish much if you 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.360
 it decreases a lot 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.690
 He's going to be fighting the world. He's going to give 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.570
 The difference is, so do not mess with it. 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.690
 here if you want to move lower but well 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.760
 There are not much of these 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.880
 here I dominate very little I do not change much 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.880
 because otherwise you can 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.740
 A bug happened in the way I do not know 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.850
 explain to you why it happens 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.340
 but happens 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.650
 the game stayed a little slow he gets 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.330
 It took a while so I do not touch it. 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.669
 If you want to fiddle like I said a little bit 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.350
 I'm going back here for the game. 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.840

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.820
