00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.010 
think I think it's time for people to
like<00:00:44.219> move<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.879> know<00:00:45.000> now<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.390> realize<00:00:45.989> that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
playing the other call of duties because

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.570 
playing the other call of duties because
it<00:01:04.530> was<00:01:04.650> repetitive<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.189> know<00:01:05.280> advanced

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
warfare all the shots were the same call

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.770 
warfare all the shots were the same call
of<00:01:08.250> duty<00:01:08.460> ghosts<00:01:08.760> all<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> shots<00:01:09.270> were<00:01:09.510> the
