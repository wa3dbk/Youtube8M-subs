that it does to all my photos and so it

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.580 
that it does to all my photos and so it
wasn't<00:00:17.910> really<00:00:18.090> fair<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.570> some<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> nail

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
wasn't really fair that some of the nail

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.080 
wasn't really fair that some of the nail
art<00:00:19.830> designs<00:00:20.100> were<00:00:20.220> getting<00:00:20.430> cut<00:00:20.609> off<00:00:20.640> and
