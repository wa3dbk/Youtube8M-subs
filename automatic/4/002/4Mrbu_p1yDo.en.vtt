00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
course or taught me actually it was a

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.149 
course or taught me actually it was a
figure<00:03:09.609> eight<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.480> they<00:03:10.599> thought<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:12.010> was

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
figure eight that they thought it was

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.349 
figure eight that they thought it was
like<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.280> 20<00:03:12.760> x<00:03:14.190> 25<00:03:15.190> 40<00:03:15.549> box<00:03:15.730> or<00:03:16.000> something<00:03:16.120> I

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
like a 20 x 25 40 box or something I

nighthawk 252 mil twin and there's

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.240 
nighthawk 252 mil twin and there's
absolutely<00:03:39.260> little<00:03:39.470> high-strung<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.069> had

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
absolutely little high-strung so I had

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.230 
absolutely little high-strung so I had
to<00:03:40.280> be<00:03:40.970> careful<00:03:41.000> with<00:03:41.450> it

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
without a little high which I didn't

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.950 
without a little high which I didn't
like<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.640> glow<00:03:46.820> too<00:03:47.060> high<00:03:47.210> for<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.720> speed

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
like and glow too high for the speed

that<00:03:48.080> we<00:03:48.230> were<00:03:48.320> doing<00:03:49.280> in<00:03:49.460> the<00:03:49.790> course<00:03:50.560> but

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
that we were doing in the course but

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.210 
that we were doing in the course but
there's<00:03:53.840> no<00:03:54.080> flight<00:03:54.350> bike<00:03:54.560> actually<00:03:54.980> I<00:03:55.190> think

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
there's no flight bike actually I think

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.650 
there's no flight bike actually I think
it's<00:03:55.400> later<00:03:55.670> than<00:03:55.760> what<00:03:55.970> this<00:03:56.120> bike<00:03:56.330> is<00:03:56.360> this

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
it's later than what this bike is this

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.080 
it's later than what this bike is this
Vegas<00:03:57.020> is<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:57.950> turd<00:03:58.430> compared<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.180> Hannah

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
Vegas is a turd compared to Hannah

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:12.070 
Vegas is a turd compared to Hannah
turn<00:04:00.330> it's<00:04:00.629> a<00:04:00.720> brick

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.570 

thought<00:04:12.680> was<00:04:12.800> one<00:04:12.980> of<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.160> things<00:04:13.280> we<00:04:13.430> learned

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
thought was one of the things we learned

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.780

how<00:04:13.730> to<00:04:13.790> do<00:04:13.940> a<00:04:13.970> turn<00:04:14.720> I<00:04:14.750> take<00:04:15.080> turn<00:04:15.290> like<00:04:15.500> that

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
how to do a turn I take turn like that

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.039 
how to do a turn I take turn like that
but<00:04:16.790> it<00:04:16.850> was<00:04:16.880> in<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.120> form<00:04:17.390> of<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.600> figure<00:04:17.870> eight

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
but it was in the form of a figure eight

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.110 
but it was in the form of a figure eight
nada<00:04:18.320> we<00:04:18.680> go<00:04:18.860> into<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.160> box<00:04:19.340> on<00:04:19.519> one<00:04:19.700> side<00:04:19.910> on

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
nada we go into the box on one side on

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.720 
nada we go into the box on one side on
say<00:04:20.360> it<00:04:20.390> boxes<00:04:20.959> here<00:04:21.410> we<00:04:22.010> would<00:04:22.130> go<00:04:22.250> in<00:04:22.490> on<00:04:22.700> this

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
say it boxes here we would go in on this

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:31.210 
say it boxes here we would go in on this
corner<00:04:23.390> figure<00:04:24.670> 8c<00:04:25.670> we<00:04:25.880> would<00:04:26.360> go<00:04:28.630> we<00:04:29.630> go<00:04:30.220> oh

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
corner figure 8c we would go we go oh

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.060 
corner figure 8c we would go we go oh
yeah<00:04:31.640> we<00:04:31.940> go<00:04:32.060> we<00:04:32.900> go<00:04:32.930> up<00:04:33.290> this<00:04:33.440> way<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.920> top

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
yeah we go we go up this way to the top

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.770 
yeah we go we go up this way to the top
and<00:04:34.520> back<00:04:34.700> around<00:04:34.940> then<00:04:35.060> up<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.360> then<00:04:35.420> out<00:04:35.630> the

and back around then up and then out the

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.110 
and back around then up and then out the
opposite<00:04:36.050> corner<00:04:39.370> let<00:04:40.370> slip<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.640> crap<00:04:40.940> out<00:04:41.090> of

opposite corner let slip the crap out of

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:54.780 
opposite corner let slip the crap out of
my<00:04:41.300> engine<00:04:42.130> that's<00:04:43.130> not<00:04:43.310> good<00:04:43.430> for
