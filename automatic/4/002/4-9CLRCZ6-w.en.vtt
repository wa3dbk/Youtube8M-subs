much<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.750> but<00:00:13.170> gommage<00:00:13.320> you've<00:00:13.559> got<00:00:13.650> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
much of that but gommage you've got the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.890

opportunity<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.309> go<00:00:14.549> back<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.790> it's<00:00:15.509> really

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
opportunity to go back and it's really

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.210 
opportunity to go back and it's really
difficult<00:00:16.080> isn't<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.470> when<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:16.710> go<00:00:16.830> back<00:00:17.010> from

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
difficult isn't it when you go back from

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
the calls are different and it makes it

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.310 
the calls are different and it makes it
more<00:00:21.180> difficult<00:00:21.390> for<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> scrum<00:00:22.050> off<00:00:22.140> what

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.380 
person tell us how the depth of the rook
is<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.100> different<00:00:35.550> makes<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.910> different<00:00:36.270> yeah

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
is now different makes it different yeah

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.569 
is now different makes it different yeah
speed<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.840> ball<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.140> still<00:00:37.320> crucial<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.070> you

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
speed of ball is still crucial but you

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.549 
speed of ball is still crucial but you
know<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.760> scrum<00:00:39.690> arts<00:00:39.899> are<00:00:40.020> now<00:00:40.140> having<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
know you scrum arts are now having to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.380 
know you scrum arts are now having to
step<00:00:40.829> back<00:00:41.070> they're<00:00:41.760> having<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.059> step<00:00:42.239> back

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
step back they're having to step back

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.450 
step back they're having to step back
because<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:42.989> competitive<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
because it's so competitive in in in the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.580 
because it's so competitive in in in the
ruck<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.390> you're<00:00:45.510> having<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.809> step<00:00:46.110> which

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
ruck now so you're having to step which

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.830 
ruck now so you're having to step which
means<00:00:46.860> now<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.489> bury<00:00:47.969> my<00:00:48.210> attack

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
means now I can bury my attack

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.660 
means now I can bury my attack
I<00:00:48.870> could<00:00:49.230> still<00:00:49.500> deliver<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> ball

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
I could still deliver and get the ball

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.520 
I could still deliver and get the ball
out<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.910> Philips<00:00:51.360> who's<00:00:51.600> very<00:00:51.780> very<00:00:52.079> strong<00:00:52.379> up

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
out of Philips who's very very strong up

out of Philips who's very very strong up
here<00:00:52.710> he's<00:00:52.829> always<00:00:53.010> looking<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> snide

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
but he's got a very very accurate and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770 
but he's got a very very accurate and
strong<00:00:55.980> pass<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.090> all<00:00:57.300> around<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
strong pass but it's all around the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.830 
strong pass but it's all around the
communication<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.770> that's<00:00:58.949> what<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.719> show<00:01:00.719> is

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
communication and that's what a show is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.180 
communication and that's what a show is
that<00:01:00.870> old<00:01:01.170> pass<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.710> used<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.070> with

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.280 
that old pass that you used to do with
Nigel<00:01:02.550> Melva<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> one<00:01:03.180> arm<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:04.199> just

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
Nigel Melva is the one arm so it's just

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.940 
Nigel Melva is the one arm so it's just
one<00:01:04.530> arm<00:01:04.710> push<00:01:04.979> yeah<00:01:05.700> okay<00:01:06.180> well<00:01:06.360> good<00:01:06.950> still

one arm push yeah okay well good still
got<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:08.939> need<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.240> ball<00:01:09.450> back

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.520 
got it I think we need that ball back
but<00:01:09.780> what<00:01:09.869> we're<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.110> go<00:01:10.229> through<00:01:10.409> now

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
but what we're going to go through now

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.960 
but what we're going to go through now
is<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> difference<00:01:10.979> from<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> England<00:01:11.790> cause

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
is the difference from the England cause

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.429 
is the difference from the England cause
and<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.150> if<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.390> remember<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.170> mean<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and that if you remember you mean you

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.480 
and that if you remember you mean you
would<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:13.590> been<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.890> bench<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.220> lot<00:01:14.340> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
would have been on the bench a lot you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.149 
would have been on the bench a lot you
didn't<00:01:14.729> know<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.119> calls<00:01:15.360> Burton<00:01:15.780> leave

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
didn't know all the calls Burton leave

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.560 
didn't know all the calls Burton leave
let's<00:01:17.159> talk<00:01:17.400> about<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.790> difference<00:01:18.240> for

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
let's talk about the difference for

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.149 
let's talk about the difference for
example<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> flash<00:01:19.380> call<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:19.890> England

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
example like the flash call for England

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.560 
example like the flash call for England
which<00:01:20.250> was<00:01:20.280> somebody<00:01:20.790> switching<00:01:21.240> from<00:01:21.360> one

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
which was somebody switching from one

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.149 
which was somebody switching from one
side<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:21.990> other<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.409> got<00:01:22.740> back<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
side to the other you got back to the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.039 
side to the other you got back to the
club<00:01:23.400> how<00:01:23.820> did<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.090> put<00:01:24.270> more<00:01:24.540> pressure<00:01:24.869> on

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
club how did that put more pressure on

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.800 
club how did that put more pressure on
you<00:01:25.350> at<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> base<00:01:25.770> massive<00:01:26.520> pressure<00:01:27.299> because

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
you at the base massive pressure because

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.690 
you at the base massive pressure because
this<00:01:28.020> all<00:01:28.170> around<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> communication<00:01:29.220> it's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
this all around the communication it's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
this all around the communication it's
all<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.180> did<00:01:30.450> there<00:01:30.630> at<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> base<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
all if you did there at the base the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.620 
all if you did there at the base the
defense<00:01:32.369> they<00:01:32.579> want<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> sack<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> nine

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
defense they want to sack you as a nine

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.810 
defense they want to sack you as a nine
and<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.079> ANA<00:01:34.259> 10<00:01:34.590> if<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.460> get<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
and the ANA 10 if you can get as a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.969 
and the ANA 10 if you can get as a
defense<00:01:36.270> into<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.810> 9<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.110> 10<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.470> messes<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
defense into the 9 and 10 it messes the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.800 
defense into the 9 and 10 it messes the
attack<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> moment<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> don't<00:01:39.570> know

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
attack up so the moment you don't know

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.560 
attack up so the moment you don't know
you<00:01:39.869> calls<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.430> confusion<00:01:42.090> sets<00:01:42.360> in

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
you calls and you and confusion sets in

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.810 
you calls and you and confusion sets in
a<00:01:42.750> everyone<00:01:43.590> gets<00:01:43.770> flat<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> attacks<00:01:44.520> gone

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
a everyone gets flat the attacks gone

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.100 
a everyone gets flat the attacks gone
and<00:01:45.149> then<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.930> makes

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
and then you can get so and that makes

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.810 
and then you can get so and that makes
it<00:01:46.259> more<00:01:46.350> difficult<00:01:46.409> for<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.979> forwards<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
it more difficult for the forwards the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.149 
it more difficult for the forwards the
timing<00:01:48.180> their<00:01:48.360> run<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.350> say<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:49.979> were<00:01:50.070> going

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
timing their run so so say we were going

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.740 
timing their run so so say we were going
to<00:01:50.250> do<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.579> we<00:01:50.670> used<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.909> call<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.119> smash<00:01:51.479> core

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
to do what we used to call a smash core

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.030 
to do what we used to call a smash core
with<00:01:51.930> England<00:01:52.259> which<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> old<00:01:52.740> George

this<00:02:03.149> hole<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:03.829> problem<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.340> he's<00:02:05.549> having

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
to think about the call or I can't quite

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.609 
to think about the call or I can't quite
get<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.979> call<00:02:08.190> what<00:02:09.000> happens<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.569> he<00:02:10.229> starts

to go we're calling smash uncertainly

to go we're calling smash uncertainly
smash<00:02:13.349> smash

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
smash smash

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.740 
smash smash
I've<00:02:13.920> already<00:02:14.220> gone<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.640> I've<00:02:14.730> missed<00:02:15.510> it

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
I've already gone and I've missed it

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.930 
I've already gone and I've missed it
this<00:02:15.930> guy<00:02:16.110> can<00:02:16.350> go<00:02:16.500> forward<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.130> smash<00:02:17.730> our

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
this guy can go forward and smash our

this guy can go forward and smash our
scrum-half

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
scrum-half

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.510 
scrum-half
so<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.020> got<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.320> be<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> second<00:02:20.070> nature<00:02:20.250> thing

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
so it's got to be a second nature thing

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.670 
so it's got to be a second nature thing
because<00:02:20.670> any<00:02:20.820> hesitation<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:22.230> gap<00:02:22.500> will

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
because any hesitation and that gap will

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.410 
because any hesitation and that gap will
close<00:02:22.710> same<00:02:23.220> thing<00:02:23.490> going<00:02:23.730> around<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.060> corner

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
close same thing going around the corner

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.180 
close same thing going around the corner
because<00:02:24.840> if<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.260> come<00:02:25.560> around<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.890> corner<00:02:25.920> and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
because if I come around the corner and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.280 
because if I come around the corner and
I<00:02:26.310> don't<00:02:26.550> know<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.850> call<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.750> 9<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.110> 10

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
I don't know the call that the 9 and 10

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.020 
I don't know the call that the 9 and 10
have<00:02:28.470> got<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.830> look<00:02:28.950> after<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.460> /<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.760> can't

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
have got to look after that / I can't

have got to look after that / I can't

call a hot call give me the ball give it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.030 
call a hot call give me the ball give it

to 10 if if the 10 story hot hot hot and
I<00:02:35.130> don't<00:02:35.160> hear<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.790> or<00:02:35.910> don't<00:02:36.150> recognize<00:02:36.540> it

I don't hear it or don't recognize it

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.440 
I don't hear it or don't recognize it
I'm<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.530> way<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.580> best<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.150> get<00:02:39.300> is

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
I'm in the way so the best I can get is

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.680 
I'm in the way so the best I can get is
the<00:02:39.570> pass<00:02:39.780> from<00:02:40.530> gamez<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.250> I'm<00:02:41.430> flat<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.210> and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
the pass from gamez but I'm flat and and

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.180 
the pass from gamez but I'm flat and and
it's<00:02:43.050> probably<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.380> pretty<00:02:43.590> low<00:02:43.800> gotta<00:02:43.950> catch

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
it's probably a pretty low gotta catch

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.920 
it's probably a pretty low gotta catch
because<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.610> pass<00:02:44.850> it's<00:02:45.180> gonna<00:02:45.300> take<00:02:45.570> not<00:02:45.750> very

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
because I pass it's gonna take not very
