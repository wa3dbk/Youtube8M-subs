00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
for a long time we get to do stuff like

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.890 
for a long time we get to do stuff like
grosgrain<00:02:55.879> it's<00:02:56.180> not<00:02:56.330> something<00:02:56.870> that

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
grosgrain it's not something that

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
but we got to try it up here and see the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.300 
but we got to try it up here and see the
whole<00:03:02.420> process<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.650> was<00:03:03.830> that<00:03:03.980> kind<00:03:04.190> of

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
whole process so it was that kind of

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.490 
whole process so it was that kind of
freedom<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:04.970> space<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:06.080> experiment<00:03:06.710> that<00:03:07.150> AMS

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
freedom and space to experiment that AMS

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.380 
freedom and space to experiment that AMS
just<00:03:09.500> has<00:03:09.680> in<00:03:09.950> abundance<00:03:10.040> well<00:03:10.820> I<00:03:10.850> really

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390
