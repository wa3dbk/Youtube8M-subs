00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.000 
upon what I'm seeing our former high
recently<00:00:50.250> was<00:00:50.660> 1923<00:00:51.660> dollars<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.530> did<00:00:52.739> sell

was<00:00:58.199> overdone<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> way<00:00:59.879> it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
was overdone but that's just the way it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.670 
was overdone but that's just the way it
is<00:01:00.059> when<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.750> goes<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.469> it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
is when you when it goes up so much it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.910 
is when you when it goes up so much it
comes<00:01:01.859> down<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.370> 19<00:01:02.969> 23<00:01:03.539> was<00:01:03.809> our<00:01:03.989> old<00:01:04.199> former

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
comes down to 19 23 was our old former

comes down to 19 23 was our old former
high<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.460> expect<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.420> will<00:01:06.570> match<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.869> number

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
high I expect we will match that number

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.980 
high I expect we will match that number
in<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:08.100> quarter<00:01:08.610> before<00:01:08.909> Christmas<00:01:09.689> time

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
in this quarter before Christmas time

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.230 
in this quarter before Christmas time
and<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.680> fact<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.250> things<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:12.030> going

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and in fact if things really get going

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.140 
and in fact if things really get going
too<00:01:12.570> well<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:13.439> could<00:01:13.740> touch<00:01:14.130> two<00:01:14.430> thousand<00:01:15.030> or

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
too well we could touch two thousand or

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.630 
too well we could touch two thousand or
slightly<00:01:15.450> higher<00:01:15.840> i<00:01:16.170> would<00:01:16.799> say<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.100> when

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
slightly higher i would say that when

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.120 
slightly higher i would say that when
gold<00:01:17.909> touches<00:01:18.360> two<00:01:18.540> thousand<00:01:19.140> that's<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.920> kind

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
gold touches two thousand that's a kind

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.730 
gold touches two thousand that's a kind
of<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.340> magic<00:01:20.759> number<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.470> probably<00:01:22.470> there

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
of a magic number and probably there

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.230 
of a magic number and probably there
would<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.310> selling<00:01:23.729> at<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.030> particular

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
would be some selling at that particular

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.660 
would be some selling at that particular
