when<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.179> grow<00:00:15.450> up<00:00:15.480> well<00:00:15.929> then<00:00:16.170> there<00:00:16.529> are<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> few

when I grow up well then there are a few

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.070 
when I grow up well then there are a few
things<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.640> every<00:00:18.060> spaceman<00:00:18.630> should<00:00:18.900> know

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
things that every spaceman should know

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.790 
things that every spaceman should know

okay<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:21.380> off<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.740> space<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.430> go<00:00:23.640> past<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
okay we off to space we go past the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.679 
okay we off to space we go past the
upper<00:00:24.720> stratosphere<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:26.460> now<00:00:27.060> we're<00:00:27.420> passing

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
upper stratosphere and now we're passing

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.479 
upper stratosphere and now we're passing
the<00:00:28.109> exosphere<00:00:30.019> up<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.349> away<00:00:31.619> we<00:00:31.830> go<00:00:31.859> as<00:00:32.340> your

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the exosphere up and away we go as your

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.600 
the exosphere up and away we go as your
body<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.850> deprived<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.600> oxygen<00:00:34.340> what

you<00:00:35.850> won't<00:00:36.030> need<00:00:36.180> oxygen<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.870> where<00:00:36.989> you're

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
you won't need oxygen for where you're

yes kiddo everywhere in space is deadly
and<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.760> worth<00:01:02.969> pursuing<00:01:03.229> what<00:01:04.229> about<00:01:04.439> Mars

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and not worth pursuing what about Mars
