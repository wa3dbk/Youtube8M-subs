00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
distinction between alpha and beta

my<00:01:25.100> Piper's<00:01:26.450> emailing<00:01:27.450> stuff<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:28.439> that

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
my Piper's emailing stuff like that

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.200 
my Piper's emailing stuff like that
and<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.820> these<00:01:30.150> types<00:01:30.450> keys<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.610> I<00:01:32.610> prefer<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
and on these types keys and I prefer to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.950 
and on these types keys and I prefer to
put<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:34.290> control<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:36.030> pretty<00:01:36.630> close

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
put on control because it's pretty close

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.940 
put on control because it's pretty close
to<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:38.130> arrows<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.619> why<00:01:40.890> you

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
to the arrows and then that's why you

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.480 
to the arrows and then that's why you
can<00:01:41.220> put<00:01:41.899> very<00:01:42.899> fast<00:01:43.140> well<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.040> course<00:01:44.100> I've

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
can put very fast well of course I've

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.260 
can put very fast well of course I've
out<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.390> path<00:01:45.600> right<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.229> still<00:01:47.270> Botsman

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
out of path right now but still Botsman

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.859 
out of path right now but still Botsman
control

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
control

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.510 
control
and<00:01:50.289> footrest<00:01:50.950> yeah<00:01:51.240> jump<00:01:52.240> on<00:01:52.420> alt<00:01:52.659> that's

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and footrest yeah jump on alt that's

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.660 
and footrest yeah jump on alt that's
logic<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:54.759> guess<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:56.189> yet<00:01:57.189> that's<00:01:57.399> where

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
logic I guess and yet that's where

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.700 
logic I guess and yet that's where
basically<00:01:59.579> Mikey<00:02:01.229> that's<00:02:02.229> basically<00:02:02.590> my

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
basically Mikey that's basically my

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.179 
basically Mikey that's basically my
keyboard<00:02:03.219> layout<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:04.979> something<00:02:05.979> else<00:02:06.100> that

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
keyboard layout and something else that

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.779 
keyboard layout and something else that
I<00:02:06.310> want<00:02:06.459> to<00:02:06.520> show<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.789> guys<00:02:06.880> I<00:02:08.429> make<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.459> clear

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
I want to show you guys I make a clear

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.570 
I want to show you guys I make a clear
distinction<00:02:10.119> between<00:02:10.299> alpha<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:10.989> beta<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.580> I

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
distinction between alpha and beta and I

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.589 
distinction between alpha and beta and I
do<00:02:13.360> this<00:02:13.540> by<00:02:13.840> using<00:02:13.900> cache<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.530> items<00:02:14.890> as<00:02:15.129> well

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
do this by using cache of items as well

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.229 
do this by using cache of items as well
because<00:02:16.599> my<00:02:16.989> alpha<00:02:17.620> character<00:02:18.060> whereas<00:02:19.060> a

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
because my alpha character whereas a

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:19.830 
because my alpha character whereas a
yellow<00:02:19.510> Hat's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
yellow Hat's

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.069 
yellow Hat's
but<00:02:20.470> my<00:02:21.459> beta<00:02:21.670> character<00:02:22.180> wears<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.599> pink<00:02:22.870> one

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
but my beta character wears a pink one

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.970 
but my beta character wears a pink one
and<00:02:23.680> that's<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.849> then<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.420> know<00:02:25.540> all<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.470> time

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
and that's and then I know all the time

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.160 
and that's and then I know all the time
when<00:02:27.220> I'm<00:02:27.310> using<00:02:27.430> alpha<00:02:27.970> or<00:02:28.180> beta<00:02:28.299> I<00:02:28.660> know

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
when I'm using alpha or beta I know

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.110 
when I'm using alpha or beta I know
exactly<00:02:29.500> which<00:02:29.950> one<00:02:30.010> I'm<00:02:30.280> using<00:02:30.459> because<00:02:30.819> of

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
exactly which one I'm using because of

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.830 
exactly which one I'm using because of
the<00:02:31.209> hat<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.790> also<00:02:34.180> maybe<00:02:34.360> an<00:02:34.540> extra

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
the hat so this is also maybe an extra

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.190 
the hat so this is also maybe an extra
tip<00:02:35.049> that<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:35.590> should<00:02:36.329> use<00:02:37.329> some<00:02:37.360> jeschica

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
tip that you should use some jeschica
