00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.279
 I'll show you tricks today for all rehearsals 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:12.339
 As you can see, this is the rhythm of the Olympics 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.719
 pretty easy to clarify 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.060
 which can be based on a telegram TI 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:19.749
 and 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:23.470
 Percent before that and after that are the first steps made it very easy too 

00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:24.759
 learn 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.759
 because what you do you have these weaknesses 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.339
 and then you ride the second time is falling from the sky 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.850
 the taz partners 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.010
 he rids Madrid apn possible consequences made clear and it makes you now 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.250
 just undo 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 he punches 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.870
 and that's it 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.870
 So wanted to grab words came from Tim Burgess 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.640
 and so easy front 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.830
 return 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.820
 Solms may have noticed you I do not know that 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.860
 makes two moves too much 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.590
 The momentum seemed keeper the market value of 2 initiated 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.300
 Embers Rottenburg stage destination of fnatic wanted to undo more than one 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.830
 percent 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.730
 but it makes you happy 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.460
 and the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.770
 Percent comes after the find in Germany 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.780
 and legally 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.240
 if you get away from lit up with it last so completely gone 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 So it makes and redirects wealth as well as in the commercial 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 and now you have to do this and there normally you pass 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.300
 as soon as graded 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.440
 and then you stop right now 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.200
 and freedom 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.200
 So start soon 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.520
 next does not follow 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.960
 and for others by the way natural I did not know how much there is 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.960
 it takes a little longer 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.230
 and that the FC does not make sense 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.539
 to Local Official 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.539
 I hope that did not help me 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:20.399
 oppressive 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:21.279
