00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
the orchestral score in your own part

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.130 
the orchestral score in your own part
and<00:00:42.520> knowing<00:00:43.420> a<00:00:43.510> little<00:00:43.600> bit<00:00:43.780> about<00:00:43.960> the

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
and knowing a little bit about the

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.459 
and knowing a little bit about the
background<00:00:44.350> of<00:00:44.800> course<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.780> composer<00:00:47.199> and

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.000 
background of course of the composer and
of<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:48.190> time<00:00:48.399> it<00:00:48.550> was<00:00:48.670> written<00:00:48.879> in<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.230> then<00:00:50.559> I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
of the time it was written in and then I

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.459 
of the time it was written in and then I
think<00:00:51.760> especially<00:00:52.210> with<00:00:52.600> this<00:00:52.809> concerto<00:00:53.019> I've

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
think especially with this concerto I've

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.400 
think especially with this concerto I've
played<00:00:53.980> for<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.280> long<00:00:54.370> time<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:55.690> I<00:00:55.899> think<00:00:56.109> it's

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
played for a long time and I think it's

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.009 
played for a long time and I think it's
it's<00:00:56.710> really<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.090> case<00:00:58.239> of<00:00:58.420> Beethoven

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
it's really in the case of Beethoven

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.709 
it's really in the case of Beethoven
it's<00:00:59.500> something<00:01:00.070> that<00:01:00.219> needs<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:01.059> work<00:01:01.600> that

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
it's something that needs a work that

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.350 
it's something that needs a work that
needs<00:01:01.929> to<00:01:02.079> grow<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:03.340> you<00:01:03.519> so<00:01:03.789> you<00:01:03.850> know<00:01:04.089> every

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
needs to grow with you so you know every

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.580 
needs to grow with you so you know every
time<00:01:04.540> you're<00:01:04.689> playing<00:01:04.930> it<00:01:05.080> you're<00:01:05.229> learning

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
time you're playing it you're learning

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
new things and it's I think it's

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.899

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
it's it is better to have either and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.490 
it's it is better to have either and
then<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.030> no<00:01:45.539> it's<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.869> mean<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.289> it's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
then you have no it's I mean it's a it's

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.210 
then you have no it's I mean it's a it's
a<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.890> monumental<00:01:47.610> piece<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:49.710> just

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
a really a monumental piece and it just

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.700 
a really a monumental piece and it just
expresses<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.659> know<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.229> deepest

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
expresses the you know the the deepest

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.800 
expresses the you know the the deepest
feelings<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.420> course<00:01:54.539> you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
feelings I think that of course you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.789 
feelings I think that of course you
can't<00:01:55.049> put<00:01:55.829> into<00:01:55.979> words<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.720> that's<00:01:57.799> that's

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
can't put into words and that's that's

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.469 
can't put into words and that's that's
what<00:01:58.920> musics<00:01:59.250> about<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.789> know<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.030> can't<00:02:00.270> put

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
what musics about you know you can't put

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.130 
what musics about you know you can't put
it<00:02:00.630> into<00:02:00.750> words<00:02:01.039> but<00:02:02.039> I<00:02:02.100> think<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.539> Beethoven

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
it into words but I think the Beethoven

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.039 
it into words but I think the Beethoven
concerto<00:02:04.259> has<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:05.360> maybe<00:02:06.360> more<00:02:06.659> than<00:02:06.840> any

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
concerto has that maybe more than any

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.039 
concerto has that maybe more than any
other<00:02:07.289> concerto<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:09.149> then<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.569> got<00:02:09.750> with<00:02:09.899> us
