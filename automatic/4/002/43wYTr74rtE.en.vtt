I got it for about $50 out Walmart right

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.599 
I got it for about $50 out Walmart right
now<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.100> want<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> let<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.580> know

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
now and I just want to let you know

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.960 
now and I just want to let you know
since<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.270> bought<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.770> yesterday<00:00:19.789> today<00:00:20.789> was

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
since I bought it yesterday today was

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.240 
since I bought it yesterday today was
the<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.240> day<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.630> rolled<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.140> out<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.529> on

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
the first day that I rolled it out on on

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.000 
the first day that I rolled it out on on
this<00:00:23.609> area<00:00:23.910> here<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.990> find<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.439> even

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
this area here and I find that even

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.560 
this area here and I find that even
though<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.310> been<00:00:26.490> raining<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:27.240> haven't<00:00:27.480> had

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
though it's been raining we haven't had

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.200 
though it's been raining we haven't had
any<00:00:27.720> leakage<00:00:28.220> it's<00:00:29.220> been<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:29.939> set<00:00:30.090> up

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
any leakage it's been so it was set up

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.049 
any leakage it's been so it was set up
really<00:00:30.420> quickly<00:00:30.750> very<00:00:31.140> easily<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.940> there<00:00:32.940> was

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
really quickly very easily and there was

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.360 
really quickly very easily and there was
just<00:00:33.180> one<00:00:33.390> little<00:00:33.570> catch<00:00:33.899> here<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.950> zipper

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
just one little catch here on the zipper

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.170 
just one little catch here on the zipper
but<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.059> kind<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.960> was<00:00:37.110> unnecessary

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
but we just kind of it was unnecessary

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.310 
but we just kind of it was unnecessary
fabric<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.540> kind<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.719> cut<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.079> out

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
fabric so we just kind of cut that out

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.350 
fabric so we just kind of cut that out
other<00:00:40.620> than<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.890> I'm<00:00:41.370> haven't<00:00:42.090> had<00:00:42.210> any

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
other than that I'm haven't had any

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.389 
other than that I'm haven't had any
problems<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.290> no<00:00:43.530> leakage<00:00:43.980> there's<00:00:44.340> a

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
problems with it no leakage there's a

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.619 
problems with it no leakage there's a
little<00:00:44.879> cover<00:00:45.180> tent<00:00:45.750> right<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:47.390> this<00:00:48.390> cover

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
little cover tent right here this cover

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.260 
little cover tent right here this cover
tent<00:00:48.960> right<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.489> what<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.910> kind<00:00:51.210> of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
tent right here is is what is kind of

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.180 
tent right here is is what is kind of
like<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.719> window<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.920> allows<00:00:53.160> for

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
like the window and it allows for

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.160 
like the window and it allows for
ventilation<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.360> protects<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.020> there's

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
ventilation but it protects so there's

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.029 
ventilation but it protects so there's
no<00:00:55.350> leakage<00:00:55.770> inside<00:00:56.360> I've<00:00:57.360> had<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.800> at

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039
