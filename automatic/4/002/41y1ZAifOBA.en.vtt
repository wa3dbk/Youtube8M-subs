00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.570
 golden with pink I love these 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.040
 tones especially for the time where 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.600
 advised in quotes because many of 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.170
 these days has been a little bit played 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.870
 between Uruguayans and today's surprise is 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.330
 doing just good here is going to put 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.630

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.710
 this video and there's also in the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.650
 course of the video will go 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.170
 saying that specific brands use 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.210
 or what name of the products of 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.720
 use I hope you like this video 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.840
 and I know there's a kiss for everyone 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.840
 bye 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.820
 ready let's start with this little boy 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.040
 you already know that the first thing that 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.570
 let's apply is the prime is we apply 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.520
 1st 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.110
 so that he is the first for the 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.479
 shadow give us all day and do not miss us 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.770
 they run independent in the quality of the 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.770
 shadow the important thing is to use 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.510
 I always apply it with a brush and 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.480
 after 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.930
 I do not finish applying with my finger because 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.110
 is the brochita makes it look like very 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.530
 thick the capital of bt prime and with the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.860
 finger 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.230
 What we do is match and give 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.180
 surface texture palm 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.760
 So what are we going to use? 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.490
 start using 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.240
 I really do not know how to pronounce naked 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.240
 or naked 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.920
 well let's use the gold I'll be 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.920
 here is called charles bach 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.659
 let's use this on the eyelid 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.080
 mobile 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:13.960
 what is this little piece of here 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.850
 if I have the magnifying mirror and 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.280
 I know that by far it looks very bad 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.280
 well let's start applying 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.240
 we apply it first taps well 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.030
 equal 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.040
 with taps well matched before 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:40.090
 start to blend well 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.090
 is entering the in the basin 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.320
 until you almost enter the account 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.720
 the conchitas of this ink where it is made 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.800
 the crease 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.800
 come up there 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.840
 Yes now 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.180
 and we blur well what we are going to do 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.840
 now about this tone we are going to apply 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.129
 this team 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.129
 what is the tone 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.960
 good man I do not know the 0-3 but then there 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.910
 is the name but I would not know 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.850
 pronounce it 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.600
 they do not see 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.760
 03 so much color 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.190
 let's apply with another brush this 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.410
 tone on which market to apply 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.040
 so that I give a little more 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.570
 of brightness in what sense then brightness does not 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.000
 because the shine already has the shadow 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.870
 what happens is that it is a bit coppery 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.620
 and this in the boy's is rather a 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.140
 gold color 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.090
 and what I want is for it to go down a bit 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.030
 the copper tone 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.989
 and give it a little bit more of an insurance tone 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.550
 now what are we going to do I have a shadow 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:57.220
 politics has long since bought 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.220
 but they already say it's not in the name 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.020
 with a wayward 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.890
 these toasts are ocher tones or shades 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.360
 brilliant 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:13.610
 zimmer I'm going to use a tone like this 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.640
 and more exactly such a color 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.609
 ding ding ding ding ding ding but 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.240
 I'm going to kill her too , I tell them with 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.200
 time let's apply this tone first 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.930
 and I'm going to tell you where we have 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.780
 applied 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.289
 we are going to apply in the basin in this 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:36.340
 part to simile we place the brush like this 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:38.850
 so direct we open a little bit the eye and 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.850
 we passed it 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.590
 from back to front 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.720
 We opened the eye and it was then in 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.550
 that marquita we started to blur and 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.020
 apply the shadow 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.479
 this is for people who suddenly do not 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.400
 They know how to put on makeup or do not know how to do it 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.639
 well this hairline that is a little bit 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.020
 complicated sometimes 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.020
 we blur like this 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.699
 see the color that remains is a tris 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.590
 different from this one is a little bit more 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:15.419
 strong then what are we going to do now 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:17.710
 let's paint the bone here we go to 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.969
 paint it and I tell them 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.979
 with a shadow 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.869
 this chorus I tell you a beige and a 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.819
 shadow good looking a little bit more 

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:30.679
 clear a tone lighter than the tone 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.679
 of your skin I have this 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.230
 It is as you see from already it has been demonstrated 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:41.560
 from red globe 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:44.350
 is mate is the number 2002 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.930
 I like it very much there are many people 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.910
 they say it's a very light tone other 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.770
 they say it's okay there are others that do not 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.820
 they apply a bone color tone but a 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.820
 white color tone 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.599
 as you better sit with the 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.270
 color after applying this tone 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:03.689
 then we blend well we paint well 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.689
 the little bone 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:18.620
 and on the rice line the color 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:21.620
 pink we passed a little and the white 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.820
 or the bone color you see we are 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.610
 applying on the top 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.900
 we had a little bit now you go 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.430
 to see that the tones are starting to 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.010
 blur what we are going to do now 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.860
 then we will apply another tone about 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.020
 the pink tone I have a blog that I 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.300
 I really like to mix you already know 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.000
 this is the soma 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.370
 floor 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.320
 27 this is a blog but we're going to 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.790
 use me usually the colors 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.190
 of blogs and I love to use it 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.990
 from shadows I love this let's 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.270
 take a little bit of this blog just a 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:59.520
 little and we will go again 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.520
 on that rosadito that we had applied 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.650
 we blur up and blur 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.240
 a bit inward for social 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:13.050
 gold and use forming 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.410
 and smartly I advise it so ends 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.410
 this tutorial 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:24.139
 here I have or do an approach to 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:27.389
 that you can appreciate there is a point 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:31.110
 that moves a lot there you can 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:33.539
 appreciate the shades is a golden and a 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.800
 pink you can if you want to do it 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:38.430
 mate to take during the day 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:41.400
 we could use a yellow color 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:45.509
 very pale pale and the pink that has 

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:49.210
 dying or the only thing I did now for 

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:52.080
 the last one was lashed and outlined 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.080
 Rest 

00:07:56.039 --> 00:08:01.150
