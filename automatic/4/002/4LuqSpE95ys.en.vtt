very<00:04:10.879> expensive<00:04:11.239> headphones<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:12.229> think<00:04:13.129> there

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:13.219 
very expensive headphones I think there

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.369 
very expensive headphones I think there
is<00:04:13.250> only<00:04:13.430> one<00:04:13.699> negative<00:04:13.969> for<00:04:14.389> me<00:04:14.509> and<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:15.259> is

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
is only one negative for me and that is

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.439 
is only one negative for me and that is
with<00:04:15.560> regard<00:04:15.979> to<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.729> actual<00:04:16.909> weight<00:04:17.239> of<00:04:17.389> the

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
with regard to the actual weight of the

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.149 
with regard to the actual weight of the
headphones<00:04:17.930> because<00:04:18.650> they're<00:04:18.799> made<00:04:18.979> of

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:19.159 
headphones because they're made of

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.370 
headphones because they're made of
forged<00:04:19.489> aluminium<00:04:19.669> which<00:04:20.659> really<00:04:20.959> does<00:04:21.169> give

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
forged aluminium which really does give

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.019 
forged aluminium which really does give
them<00:04:21.500> a<00:04:21.590> quality<00:04:21.739> feel<00:04:22.250> they<00:04:22.460> are<00:04:22.610> quite

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:23.029 
them a quality feel they are quite

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:25.490 
them a quality feel they are quite
weighty<00:04:23.360> they<00:04:24.260> weigh<00:04:24.620> in<00:04:24.860> at

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
weighty they weigh in at

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.090 
weighty they weigh in at
things<00:04:25.830> about<00:04:26.040> 300<00:04:26.910> grams<00:04:26.960> or<00:04:27.960> ten<00:04:28.410> point<00:04:28.770> six

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.500 
things about 300 grams or ten point six
ounces<00:04:29.580> so<00:04:29.820> they're<00:04:29.970> quite<00:04:30.120> a<00:04:30.210> weighty

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
ounces so they're quite a weighty

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.200 
ounces so they're quite a weighty
headphone<00:04:31.110> but<00:04:31.590> thankfully<00:04:32.280> because<00:04:32.790> of<00:04:33.000> the

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210
