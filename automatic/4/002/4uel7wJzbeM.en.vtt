satisfied<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.189> microphone<00:01:38.610> thus<00:01:38.909> far

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
satisfied with this microphone thus far

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.230 
satisfied with this microphone thus far
it<00:01:40.140> ranges<00:01:40.710> around<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.369> hundred<00:01:41.670> dollar<00:01:41.850> mark

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
it ranges around the hundred dollar mark

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.060 
it ranges around the hundred dollar mark
although<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.810> sure<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.560> get<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.770> cheaper

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
although I'm sure you can get it cheaper

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.139 
although I'm sure you can get it cheaper
elsewhere<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.610> you'll<00:01:44.759> probably<00:01:44.820> pay<00:01:45.119> a

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
elsewhere and you'll probably pay a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.810 
elsewhere and you'll probably pay a
little<00:01:45.299> bit<00:01:45.420> more<00:01:45.509> somewhere<00:01:45.960> else<00:01:46.610> I'm<00:01:47.610> also

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
little bit more somewhere else I'm also

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.130 
little bit more somewhere else I'm also
going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> look<00:01:48.270> at<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.810> AKG<00:01:50.149> p220<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.960> has<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
going to look at the AKG p220 that has a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.929 
going to look at the AKG p220 that has a
couple<00:01:52.829> features<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.460> audio<00:01:53.670> technica

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
couple features that the audio technica

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.940 
couple features that the audio technica
does<00:01:54.360> not<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> couple<00:01:55.049> switches<00:01:55.530> some<00:01:55.740> low<00:01:55.920> end

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
does not a couple switches some low end

does not a couple switches some low end
roll-off<00:01:57.229> fancy<00:01:58.229> things<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.070> it's

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
roll-off fancy things like that and it's

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.389 
roll-off fancy things like that and it's
also<00:01:59.759> designed<00:02:00.119> here<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.110> Vienna<00:02:01.530> Austria<00:02:01.680> so

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
also designed here in Vienna Austria so

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.450 
also designed here in Vienna Austria so
there's<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.090> little<00:02:03.450> bit<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:04.159> got<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> little<00:02:05.310> bit
