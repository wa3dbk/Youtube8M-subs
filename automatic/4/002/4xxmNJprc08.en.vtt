 after which we start so actively 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.050
 whip them with a whisk but the whipping will go away 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.919
 seven to ten minutes until foam appears 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.080
 with bubbles 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.529

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.539
 water and that 600 milliliters is the same 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.510
 actively so whip minutes three 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.370
 Now add half a liter of kefir I 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.850
 add one percent but for 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.809
 and you can add and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.149
 three percent carefully all 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.309
 we mix with a whisk now we add 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.789

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:54.879

 whip whisk add 5-6 tablespoons 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.820
 spoons of vegetable oil mix 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.520
 the dough is ready to take the pan I 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.890
 recommend a special pancake with low 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.530
 bumpers and always with ceramic 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.170
 coating about the dangers of teflon I already 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.930
 I will not repeat the gas 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.780
 turn on medium strong on my plate 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.930
 the flames look something like this with 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.850
 I think you will understand the electric ones 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.170
 pour the oil to the first pancake is not 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.790
 turned out to be a lump we make it a trial 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.159
 take half a ladle of dough and 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.680
 pour into the pan wait for now 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.829
 the middle spot is baked see the white spot 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.540
 in the center gradually turns yellow 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.630
 depending on the pan and the heat on one 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.450
 side will take approximately 15 minutes and minutes 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.490
 30 seconds time the baked side is not 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.670
 should stick to the pan but also 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.740
 burn too should not overturn 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.860
 and fry the second side about another 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.700
 minute shift test pancake on 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.560
 the plate and thoughtfully burst it seemed to me 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.840
 which is not enough salt and I added more 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.570
 a little salt in the dough and stirred 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.030
 Now we start to bake the main pancake 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.670
 I have a large pan so you can 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.150
 boldly take a full ladle of dough and 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.440
 pour my grandmother still smeared 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.820
 each shot a pancake piece of cream 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.130
 oils on the knife 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.100
 but since we used kefir 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.010
 reduced fat and generally announced 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.100
 on my channel the war of the zeal do 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.790
 this will not be a stack height in the elbow 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.860
 like the old days, too, the oven will not be baked and 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.860
 stop asking for the table
