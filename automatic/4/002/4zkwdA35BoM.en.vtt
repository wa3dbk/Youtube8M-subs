00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and the exterior yeah well is when we

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.760 
and the exterior yeah well is when we
first<00:01:09.119> sent<00:01:09.330> over<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.540> design<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:10.680> were

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
first sent over the design we were

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.020 
first sent over the design we were
worried<00:01:11.010> we're<00:01:11.130> gonna<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> back<00:01:11.610> going

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
worried we're gonna get it back going

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.789 
worried we're gonna get it back going
you<00:01:12.330> can't<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:13.140> two<00:01:13.320> different<00:01:13.439> color

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
you can't have two different color

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.190 
you can't have two different color
wheels<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> car<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.790> doesn't<00:01:15.090> work<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.509> so

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
wheels on a car that doesn't work and so

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.320 
wheels on a car that doesn't work and so
we<00:01:16.290> actually<00:01:16.380> threw<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.860> some<00:01:17.130> alters<00:01:17.850> with

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
we actually threw in some alters with

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.700 
we actually threw in some alters with
the<00:01:18.420> different<00:01:18.689> colors<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.290> actually<00:01:19.619> got

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the different colors and we actually got

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.350 
the different colors and we actually got
it<00:01:19.860> back<00:01:19.979> from<00:01:20.100> Jim<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:20.460> said<00:01:20.640> keep<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it back from Jim they said keep the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.420 
it back from Jim they said keep the
wheels<00:01:21.509> different<00:01:21.869> colors<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.220> it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
wheels different colors we like it so it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.160 
wheels different colors we like it so it
that's<00:01:23.729> what<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.939> did<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.990> think

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that's what we did and it's just I think

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.499 
that's what we did and it's just I think
those<00:01:25.439> wheels<00:01:25.680> make<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.100> car<00:01:26.340> pop<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
those wheels make that car pop with the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.749 
those wheels make that car pop with the
yellow<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> black<00:01:28.140> well<00:01:28.860> obviously<00:01:29.579> Bob

this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> first<00:01:41.340> time<00:01:41.549> we've<00:01:41.729> seen<00:01:41.759> an

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
this is the first time we've seen an

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.819 
this is the first time we've seen an
opportunity<00:01:42.270> where<00:01:42.750> builders<00:01:43.200> come<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.649> and

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
opportunity where builders come in and

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.100 
opportunity where builders come in and
change<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.460> color<00:01:44.759> distinctively<00:01:45.450> from<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
change the color distinctively from the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.109 
change the color distinctively from the
front<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.590> rear<00:01:46.829> make<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.430> blend<00:01:47.670> into<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
front to the rear make it blend into the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.700 
front to the rear make it blend into the
car<00:01:48.329> well<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> think<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.290> could<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.560> taken

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
car well I think you could have taken

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.889 
car well I think you could have taken
the<00:01:49.920> easy<00:01:49.950> route<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.460> done<00:01:50.790> gray<00:01:51.119> or<00:01:51.360> white<00:01:51.600> or

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
the easy route and done gray or white or

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.929 
the easy route and done gray or white or
something<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.920> has<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.430> tie<00:01:53.670> in

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
something like that but it has to tie in

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:54.889 
something like that but it has to tie in
that's<00:01:54.210> one<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.509> things<00:01:54.689> that's<00:01:54.780> very

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that's one of the things that's very

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.749 
that's one of the things that's very
important<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.380> design<00:01:55.649> when<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.189> put<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> car

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
important to design when you put a car

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.219 
important to design when you put a car
together<00:01:56.909> when<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> see<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
together when you see it out in the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.170 
together when you see it out in the
future<00:01:58.409> how<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.700> come<00:01:59.969> about

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
future how do you have you come about

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.789 
future how do you have you come about
that<00:02:00.420> design<00:02:00.689> when<00:02:00.930> do<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.710> your

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
that design when do you see it in your

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.740 
that design when do you see it in your
eyes<00:02:02.009> do<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> computer<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.509> see

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
eyes do you see it on a computer you see

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.889 
eyes do you see it on a computer you see
it<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.960> napkin<00:02:04.340> well<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.450> jumped<00:02:06.780> into

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
it on a napkin well we just jumped into

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.300 
it on a napkin well we just jumped into
the<00:02:07.170> rock<00:02:07.320> star<00:02:07.530> performance<00:02:07.860> garage<00:02:08.129> with

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the rock star performance garage with

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.800 
the rock star performance garage with
rock<00:02:08.489> star<00:02:08.700> energy<00:02:08.849> drinks<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.420> build<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
rock star energy drinks to build the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.949 
rock star energy drinks to build the
first<00:02:09.989> lifestyle<00:02:10.679> own<00:02:11.069> garage<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.840> we

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
first lifestyle own garage and so we

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.010 
first lifestyle own garage and so we
knew<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.349> colors<00:02:13.620> we<00:02:13.709> really

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
knew the colors we really

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.330 
knew the colors we really
to<00:02:14.170> use<00:02:14.260> primary<00:02:14.470> land<00:02:14.770> this<00:02:14.920> was<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.190> yellow

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
to use primary land this was the yellow

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.650 
to use primary land this was the yellow
and<00:02:15.550> black<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.000> we<00:02:16.030> kind<00:02:16.270> of<00:02:16.330> started<00:02:16.420> with

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
and black so we kind of started with

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.630 
and black so we kind of started with
that<00:02:16.840> as<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.050> palette<00:02:17.470> but<00:02:18.040> we<00:02:18.130> wanted<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.400> do<00:02:18.520> it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
that as a palette but we wanted to do it

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.070 
that as a palette but we wanted to do it
in<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.760> way<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:18.880> wasn't<00:02:19.570> just<00:02:19.780> going<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.020> be

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
in a way that wasn't just going to be

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.360 
in a way that wasn't just going to be
something<00:02:20.260> plastered<00:02:20.740> on<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.860> side<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.070> a<00:02:21.190> car

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
something plastered on the side of a car

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.760 
something plastered on the side of a car
so<00:02:22.000> what<00:02:22.540> we<00:02:22.630> did<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.900> we<00:02:22.930> basically<00:02:23.080> figured

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
so what we did is we basically figured

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.620 
so what we did is we basically figured
out<00:02:23.890> where<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.610> lines<00:02:24.850> were<00:02:25.090> on<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.330> Camaro

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
out where the lines were on the Camaro

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.510 
out where the lines were on the Camaro
we<00:02:25.780> all<00:02:25.900> know<00:02:26.050> it<00:02:26.140> has<00:02:26.200> wide<00:02:26.530> hips<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.400> the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
we all know it has wide hips so the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.040 
we all know it has wide hips so the
front<00:02:27.700> end<00:02:27.850> kind<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.120> loses<00:02:28.570> some<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:28.930> when

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
front end kind of loses some of it when

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.020 
front end kind of loses some of it when
you<00:02:29.140> seize<00:02:29.350> normally<00:02:29.860> painted<00:02:30.130> Camaro<00:02:30.430> the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
you seize normally painted Camaro the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.090 
you seize normally painted Camaro the
the<00:02:31.540> back<00:02:31.690> ends<00:02:31.900> are<00:02:32.020> more<00:02:32.140> accident<00:02:32.710> so<00:02:33.070> we

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
the back ends are more accident so we

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.830 
the back ends are more accident so we
wanted<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.520> take<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.910> black<00:02:34.300> because<00:02:34.630> so<00:02:34.720> it

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
wanted to take that black because so it

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.030 
wanted to take that black because so it
can<00:02:34.960> just<00:02:34.990> kind<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.560> tone<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.800> down<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.950> little

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
can just kind of tone it down a little

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.710 
can just kind of tone it down a little
bit<00:02:36.250> but<00:02:36.430> bring<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.700> front<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.300> little<00:02:37.600> bit

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
bit but bring the front a little bit

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.030 
bit but bring the front a little bit
brighter<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.230> widens<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.650> front<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:38.950> little

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
brighter so it widens the front a little

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.890 
brighter so it widens the front a little
bit<00:02:39.190> throw<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.850> couple<00:02:40.000> little<00:02:40.150> pinstripes<00:02:40.690> in

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
bit throw a couple little pinstripes in

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.260 
bit throw a couple little pinstripes in
there<00:02:41.080> but<00:02:41.530> our<00:02:42.010> biggest<00:02:42.400> problem<00:02:42.790> was<00:02:42.910> once

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
there but our biggest problem was once

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.760 
there but our biggest problem was once
we<00:02:43.420> got<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.690> pearl<00:02:43.990> paint<00:02:44.230> job<00:02:44.470> on<00:02:44.650> this

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
we got this pearl paint job on this

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.410 
we got this pearl paint job on this
thing<00:02:44.830> we<00:02:45.520> had<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.730> step<00:02:45.910> up<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.180> interior

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
thing we had to step up the interior

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.710 
thing we had to step up the interior
being<00:02:46.810> convertible<00:02:47.380> everything<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.490> seen<00:02:49.360> so

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
being convertible everything is seen so

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.240 
being convertible everything is seen so
that's<00:02:50.350> kind<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.530> where<00:02:50.650> we<00:02:50.710> jumped<00:02:50.980> in<00:02:51.100> and

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
that's kind of where we jumped in and

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.940 
that's kind of where we jumped in and
used<00:02:51.430> an<00:02:51.580> Alpine<00:02:52.030> star<00:02:52.360> race<00:02:52.600> suit<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.260> kind<00:02:53.860> of

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
used an Alpine star race suit to kind of

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.100 
used an Alpine star race suit to kind of
inspire<00:02:54.460> our<00:02:54.820> interior<00:02:55.300> on<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.960> can

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
inspire our interior on it and you can

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.660 
inspire our interior on it and you can
see<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.470> in<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.620> pinstripe<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.280> love<00:02:57.520> it

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
see that in the pinstripe and I love it

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.280 
see that in the pinstripe and I love it
the<00:02:57.790> other<00:02:57.970> thing<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.390> really<00:02:58.510> stuck<00:02:59.140> out

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
the other thing that really stuck out

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.620 
the other thing that really stuck out
about<00:02:59.770> your<00:02:59.950> Camaro<00:03:00.340> in<00:03:00.520> my<00:03:00.700> mind<00:03:00.970> was<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.510> use

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
about your Camaro in my mind was the use

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.090 
about your Camaro in my mind was the use
of<00:03:01.810> carbon<00:03:02.230> fiber<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.710> we<00:03:02.770> had<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.920> great

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
of carbon fiber and we had a great

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.830 
of carbon fiber and we had a great
little<00:03:03.280> discussion<00:03:03.640> about<00:03:03.820> how<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:04.420> don't

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
little discussion about how you don't

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.780 
little discussion about how you don't
just<00:03:05.050> take<00:03:05.230> apart<00:03:05.710> this<00:03:05.980> carbon<00:03:06.400> fiber<00:03:06.430> and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
just take apart this carbon fiber and

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.310 
just take apart this carbon fiber and
put<00:03:06.910> on<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.090> car<00:03:07.240> but<00:03:07.420> you're<00:03:07.810> really<00:03:07.990> using

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
put on the car but you're really using

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.160 
put on the car but you're really using
that<00:03:08.650> skill<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.450> metamorphosize<00:03:10.450> these<00:03:10.810> parts

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
that skill to metamorphosize these parts

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.290 
that skill to metamorphosize these parts
to<00:03:11.320> make<00:03:11.440> them<00:03:11.590> fit<00:03:11.860> as<00:03:12.040> if<00:03:12.190> they<00:03:12.340> were<00:03:12.400> factory

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
to make them fit as if they were factory

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.020 
to make them fit as if they were factory
issue<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.840> as<00:03:13.990> we<00:03:14.170> all<00:03:14.320> know<00:03:14.700> carbon<00:03:15.700> fiber

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
issue and as we all know carbon fiber

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.690 
issue and as we all know carbon fiber
can<00:03:16.270> be<00:03:16.300> kind<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:16.660> stubborn<00:03:16.900> well<00:03:17.710> whenever

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
can be kind of stubborn well whenever

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.860 
can be kind of stubborn well whenever
you're<00:03:18.880> dealing<00:03:18.970> with<00:03:19.090> like<00:03:19.240> a<00:03:19.270> fiber<00:03:19.570> type

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
you're dealing with like a fiber type

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.930 
you're dealing with like a fiber type
material<00:03:20.320> compared<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.740> a<00:03:20.770> metal<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.670> don't

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
material compared to a metal you don't

and you're doing a carb you have to

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.870 
and you're doing a carb you have to
maintain<00:03:29.530> om<00:03:30.250> lines<00:03:30.490> and<00:03:30.610> there's<00:03:30.730> been<00:03:30.850> a

maintain om lines and there's been a

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.180 
maintain om lines and there's been a
couple<00:03:31.030> times<00:03:31.180> where<00:03:31.600> he's<00:03:32.410> broke<00:03:32.709> out<00:03:32.920> a

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
couple times where he's broke out a

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.949 
couple times where he's broke out a
ruler<00:03:33.610> on<00:03:33.730> me<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.209> checked<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.570> down<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.870> the

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
ruler on me and checked it down to the

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.350 
ruler on me and checked it down to the
sixteenth<00:03:35.380> going<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:36.160> need<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.340> fix<00:03:36.490> that<00:03:36.700> so

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
sixteenth going you need to fix that so

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.970 
sixteenth going you need to fix that so
what<00:03:37.750> one<00:03:37.959> thing<00:03:38.110> that<00:03:38.230> we<00:03:38.320> always<00:03:38.500> learn<00:03:38.770> in

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
what one thing that we always learn in

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.280 
what one thing that we always learn in
this<00:03:39.070> nice<00:03:39.310> trick<00:03:39.580> to<00:03:39.700> have<00:03:39.880> in<00:03:40.060> your<00:03:40.209> bag<00:03:41.020> is

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
this nice trick to have in your bag is

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.680 
this nice trick to have in your bag is
we<00:03:41.740> always<00:03:41.890> heat<00:03:42.160> our<00:03:42.250> carbon<00:03:42.550> up<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:43.450> we<00:03:43.540> get

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
we always heat our carbon up and we get

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.060 
we always heat our carbon up and we get
it<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.930> point<00:03:44.050> where<00:03:44.230> it's<00:03:44.470> pretty<00:03:44.740> hot<00:03:44.920> to

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
it to the point where it's pretty hot to

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.430 
it to the point where it's pretty hot to
handle<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.550> then<00:03:46.120> we<00:03:46.270> remould<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.110> refit

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
handle and then we remould it and refit

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.230 
handle and then we remould it and refit
it<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.620> little<00:03:47.800> bit<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.370> get<00:03:48.490> to<00:03:48.730> get<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:49.030> much

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
it a little bit to get to get that much

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.810 
it a little bit to get to get that much
better<00:03:49.450> so<00:03:49.990> we'll<00:03:50.200> spend<00:03:50.470> maybe<00:03:50.709> two<00:03:51.550> or<00:03:51.670> three

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
better so we'll spend maybe two or three

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.490 
better so we'll spend maybe two or three
days<00:03:52.000> do<00:03:52.420> nothing<00:03:52.780> but<00:03:52.900> fitting<00:03:53.170> carbon

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
days do nothing but fitting carbon

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.960 
days do nothing but fitting carbon
before<00:03:53.740> we<00:03:53.830> even<00:03:53.950> touch<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.280> for<00:03:54.550> pain<00:03:54.730> or<00:03:54.760> do

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
before we even touch it for pain or do

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.490 
before we even touch it for pain or do
anything<00:03:55.120> like<00:03:55.300> that<00:03:55.330> well<00:03:56.020> Bob<00:03:56.170> I'm<00:03:56.350> gonna

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
anything like that well Bob I'm gonna

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.020 
anything like that well Bob I'm gonna
ask<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.860> now<00:03:57.070> we've<00:03:57.280> talked<00:03:57.520> about<00:03:57.640> why<00:03:57.970> the

ask you now we've talked about why the
car<00:03:58.330> stood<00:03:58.600> out<00:03:58.750> but<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.110> it<00:03:59.500> important<00:03:59.950> to

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
car stood out but is it important to

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.440 
car stood out but is it important to
