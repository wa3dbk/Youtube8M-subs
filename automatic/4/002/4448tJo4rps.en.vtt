00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:55.570 

all<00:00:35.520> right<00:00:35.640> let's<00:00:35.879> engage<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> tremolo

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.010 

basic<00:00:56.580> controls<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.300> tremolo<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.870> got

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
basic controls on this tremolo we got

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.020 
basic controls on this tremolo we got
the<00:00:58.200> depth<00:00:59.390> controls<00:01:00.390> intensity<00:01:01.940> then<00:01:02.940> we

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the depth controls intensity then we

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:12.280 
the depth controls intensity then we
have<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> shape

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.230 

yes<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.700> harder

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
yes like to the right is harder

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
yes like to the right is harder
Tremeloes<00:01:16.280> to<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.399> left<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.909> softer

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.789 

now<00:01:29.800> I<00:01:29.830> have<00:01:30.010> speed<00:01:31.050> is<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.260> maximum

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
we at school we have a little LED

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:52.170

and another function that this pedal has

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.969 
and another function that this pedal has
and<00:01:57.850> we<00:01:57.909> hit<00:01:58.060> this<00:01:58.210> Pam<00:01:58.540> button<00:02:00.840> basically

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and we hit this Pam button basically

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.870

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.440 

can<00:02:43.540> engage<00:02:43.840> some<00:02:44.370> overdrive<00:02:45.370> prince<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.210> tone

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.480 

you<00:03:01.310> bring<00:03:01.550> down<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.000> depth<00:03:02.270> that<00:03:02.540> basically

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
you bring down the depth that basically

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.320 
you bring down the depth that basically
centers<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:04.700> image<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.780> guitar

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.410 

it's<00:03:08.810> whitens<00:03:09.320> it<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:09.770> centers<00:03:10.160> it<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:11.000> this

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
it's whitens it this centers it and this

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.100 
it's whitens it this centers it and this
makes<00:03:11.690> it<00:03:11.900> softer

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
creates almost like a little Leslie kind

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:44.470 
creates almost like a little Leslie kind
of

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480
