00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
make the vision you want or a good movie

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.830 
make the vision you want or a good movie
you<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:53.880> time<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:54.360> you're<00:01:54.630> very

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
you don't have time if you're very

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.980 
you don't have time if you're very
limited<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.560> making<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.399> good<00:01:56.790> vision<00:01:57.000> then<00:01:57.840> why

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
limited to making a good vision then why

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.560 
limited to making a good vision then why
do<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.140> at<00:01:58.290> all<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.619> think<00:01:58.920> he<00:01:59.100> fled<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.850> very

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
do it at all I think he fled for a very

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.510 
do it at all I think he fled for a very
good<00:02:00.659> reason<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.259> his<00:02:01.439> logic<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.920> very<00:02:02.130> good<00:02:02.369> as

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
good reason in his logic is very good as

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.999 
good reason in his logic is very good as
well<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:03.030> everybody<00:02:03.360> else<00:02:03.540> leaving<00:02:03.950> if<00:02:04.950> you

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
well as everybody else leaving if you

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.869 
well as everybody else leaving if you
don't<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:06.000> initial<00:02:07.340> vision<00:02:08.340> ER<00:02:08.550> then

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
don't have the initial vision ER then

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.020 
don't have the initial vision ER then
why<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.569> carry<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.140> with<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.470> now<00:02:11.069> then<00:02:11.879> i'm

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
why just carry out with it now then i'm

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.190 
why just carry out with it now then i'm
doing<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.300> reboot

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
doing a reboot

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.750 
doing a reboot
obviously<00:02:14.200> they<00:02:14.319> had<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.500> script<00:02:14.890> ready<00:02:15.340> for

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
obviously they had a script ready for

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.610 
obviously they had a script ready for
years<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.120> come<00:02:16.390> they<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:17.290> they've<00:02:17.470> had<00:02:17.590> a

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
years to come they have they've had a

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.320 
years to come they have they've had a
script<00:02:17.890> now<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.099> Sony's<00:02:18.610> had<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.760> script<00:02:19.090> ready

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
script now the Sony's had a script ready

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.300 
script now the Sony's had a script ready
for<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.569> reboot<00:02:19.989> for<00:02:20.500> many<00:02:20.980> many<00:02:21.159> years

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
for a reboot for many many years

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.070 
for a reboot for many many years
obviously<00:02:21.970> they<00:02:22.090> weren't<00:02:22.209> unprepared<00:02:22.810> for<00:02:22.900> it

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
obviously they weren't unprepared for it

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.500 
obviously they weren't unprepared for it
and<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:23.890> makes<00:02:24.250> me<00:02:24.489> scratch<00:02:24.849> my<00:02:25.239> head<00:02:25.269> a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
and so that makes me scratch my head a

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.070 
and so that makes me scratch my head a
little<00:02:25.750> more<00:02:26.319> even<00:02:26.530> more<00:02:26.860> because<00:02:27.959> well<00:02:28.959> it

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
little more even more because well it

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.800 
little more even more because well it
makes<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.349> think<00:02:29.590> were<00:02:30.069> they<00:02:30.220> hecka<00:02:30.430> lean

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
makes you think were they hecka lean

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.149 
makes you think were they hecka lean
sanrio<00:02:31.810> me<00:02:31.900> on<00:02:31.959> purpose<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:32.470> they<00:02:32.500> can<00:02:32.620> do<00:02:33.129> a

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
sanrio me on purpose so they can do a

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.960 
sanrio me on purpose so they can do a
reboot<00:02:33.970> or<00:02:34.209> what<00:02:34.870> what's<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.440> deal<00:02:35.590> with<00:02:35.709> that

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
reboot or what what's the deal with that

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.119 
reboot or what what's the deal with that
anyway<00:02:36.970> point<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.989> that<00:02:38.049> it<00:02:38.829> could<00:02:39.040> go

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
anyway point is is that it could go

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.640 
anyway point is is that it could go
