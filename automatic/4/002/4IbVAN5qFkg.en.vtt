00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
just like you saw on the show and now we

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.600 
just like you saw on the show and now we
just<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.559> headers<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.159> really<00:01:05.400> can't

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
just have the headers you really can't

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.250 
just have the headers you really can't
tell<00:01:05.760> them<00:01:05.939> apart<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.960> exact<00:01:07.229> same

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
tell them apart it's the exact same

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.160 
tell them apart it's the exact same
thing<00:01:08.060> looks<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> instructions<00:01:09.869> are<00:01:10.049> in

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
thing looks like the instructions are in

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.780 
thing looks like the instructions are in
English<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.860> how<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.280> different<00:01:11.520> from

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
English and how is this different from

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.300 
English and how is this different from
the<00:01:11.939> American<00:01:12.780> version<00:01:13.110> well<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.920> American

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the American version well the American

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.300 
the American version well the American
version<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:15.990> Zord<00:01:16.320> builder<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.009> that's<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
version it is Zord builder so that's a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.640 
version it is Zord builder so that's a
plus<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.390> Zord<00:01:18.659> builder<00:01:18.960> line<00:01:19.140> otherwise

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
plus for the Zord builder line otherwise

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.469 
plus for the Zord builder line otherwise
this<00:01:19.950> isn't<00:01:20.280> my<00:01:20.400> favorite<00:01:20.759> Megazord<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> just

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
this isn't my favorite Megazord it just

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.310 
this isn't my favorite Megazord it just
seems<00:01:21.689> kind<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.130> well<00:01:23.570> actually<00:01:24.570> he'd<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.229> able

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
seems kind of well actually he'd be able

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.200 
seems kind of well actually he'd be able
to<00:01:25.409> shake<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.830> I'm<00:01:26.100> not<00:01:26.220> sure<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.820> kind

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
to shake like that I'm not sure so kind

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.950 
to shake like that I'm not sure so kind
of<00:01:27.470> wobbly<00:01:28.850> that's<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.329> case<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.720> this

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
of wobbly that's not the case with this

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.620 
of wobbly that's not the case with this
the<00:01:31.560> headers<00:01:31.890> come<00:01:32.369> off<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> lot

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the headers come off and go on a lot

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.560 
the headers come off and go on a lot
easier<00:01:34.320> every<00:01:35.310> single<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.820> them<00:01:36.030> has<00:01:36.270> an

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
easier every single one of them has an

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:46.389 
easier every single one of them has an
opening<00:01:36.930> mouth

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.899 

not<00:01:46.939> one<00:01:47.210> of<00:01:47.240> these<00:01:47.479> has<00:01:47.780> an<00:01:47.960> opening<00:01:48.259> mouth

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
not one of these has an opening mouth

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.730 
not one of these has an opening mouth
for<00:01:49.909> this<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:50.539> can't<00:01:50.810> put<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.259> sword<00:01:51.649> back

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
for this you can't put the sword back

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.880 
for this you can't put the sword back
here<00:01:52.189> you<00:01:52.399> can<00:01:52.549> put<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.759> tail<00:01:53.030> in<00:01:53.619> like<00:01:54.619> that

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
here you can put the tail in like that

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.309 
here you can put the tail in like that
the<00:01:55.340> neck<00:01:55.549> does<00:01:55.789> extend<00:01:56.270> at<00:01:56.420> least<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:57.049> that's

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
the neck does extend at least so that's

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.440 
the neck does extend at least so that's
I'm<00:01:57.710> glad<00:01:58.130> they<00:01:58.250> did<00:01:58.399> that<00:01:58.429> in<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.149> Bandai

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
I'm glad they did that in the Bandai

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.050 
I'm glad they did that in the Bandai
America<00:01:59.829> but<00:02:00.829> it's<00:02:01.039> of<00:02:01.250> course<00:02:01.429> not<00:02:01.520> painted

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
America but it's of course not painted

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.889 
America but it's of course not painted
headers<00:02:02.869> are<00:02:03.079> very<00:02:03.289> satisfying<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:04.569> snap<00:02:05.569> like

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
headers are very satisfying to snap like

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:14.460 
headers are very satisfying to snap like
that<00:02:09.099> he<00:02:10.099> actually<00:02:10.369> extends<00:02:12.879> push<00:02:13.879> this<00:02:14.090> in

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
that he actually extends push this in

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.300 
that he actually extends push this in
flowers<00:02:15.910> mouth<00:02:16.910> opens<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:18.040> little<00:02:19.040> snake

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
flowers mouth opens a little snake

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.130 
flowers mouth opens a little snake
tongue<00:02:19.489> in<00:02:19.670> there<00:02:20.799> and<00:02:22.150> then<00:02:23.150> he<00:02:23.599> has<00:02:23.780> this

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
tongue in there and then he has this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.080 
tongue in there and then he has this
little<00:02:24.380> thingy<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.130> flips<00:02:25.459> like<00:02:25.670> that

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
little thingy that flips like that

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.259 
little thingy that flips like that
or<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.299> American<00:02:26.480> version<00:02:26.840> just<00:02:27.380> not<00:02:28.269> nice

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
or the American version just not nice

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.850 
or the American version just not nice
looking<00:02:31.660> it's<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.780> much<00:02:32.959> nicer<00:02:32.989> display<00:02:33.709> piece

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
looking it's a much nicer display piece

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.440 
looking it's a much nicer display piece
there<00:02:36.860> also<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.129> couple<00:02:37.370> absorbs<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.090> goseiger

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
there also a couple absorbs and goseiger

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.240 
there also a couple absorbs and goseiger
that<00:02:38.750> were<00:02:38.870> not<00:02:39.019> released<00:02:39.349> in<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.560> u.s.<00:02:39.860> that

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
that were not released in the u.s. that

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.949 
that were not released in the u.s. that
were<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.760> course<00:02:40.970> not<00:02:41.180> compatible<00:02:41.540> with<00:02:41.780> the

were of course not compatible with the
US<00:02:42.200> version<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:43.450> but<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.569> might<00:02:44.840> go<00:02:44.959> into<00:02:45.170> that

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
US version so but I might go into that

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:57.340 
US version so but I might go into that
different<00:02:46.220> video<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:55.569> don't<00:02:56.569> recommend<00:02:56.930> this

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
different video I don't recommend this

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.330

but<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.959> know<00:03:00.079> I'm<00:03:00.380> just<00:03:00.560> saying<00:03:00.799> I<00:03:01.069> don't

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
but you know I'm just saying I don't

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.120 
but you know I'm just saying I don't
recommend<00:03:01.670> shaking<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.269> violently<00:03:03.130> tie

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
recommend shaking it violently tie

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.979 
recommend shaking it violently tie

this power morphicon to @c s toys and

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.870 
this power morphicon to @c s toys and
they<00:03:09.410> had<00:03:09.590> one<00:03:09.859> of<00:03:09.950> these<00:03:10.040> on<00:03:10.220> display<00:03:10.400> and

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
they had one of these on display and

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.509 
they had one of these on display and
once<00:03:11.269> I<00:03:11.420> have<00:03:11.540> just<00:03:11.660> started<00:03:12.190> snatching<00:03:13.190> these

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
once I have just started snatching these

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.610 
once I have just started snatching these
on<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:13.910> off<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.959> was<00:03:15.079> kind<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.319> it

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
on and off that was kind of it

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.280 
on and off that was kind of it
I<00:03:15.650> knew<00:03:16.099> I<00:03:16.130> needed<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.609> I<00:03:16.849> really<00:03:17.810> can't<00:03:18.049> find

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
I knew I needed that I really can't find

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.020 
I knew I needed that I really can't find
any<00:03:18.620> difference<00:03:19.069> it's<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.400> exact<00:03:19.730> same<00:03:19.760> thing

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
any difference it's the exact same thing

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.990 
any difference it's the exact same thing
as<00:03:20.389> an<00:03:20.510> import<00:03:21.220> do<00:03:22.220> they<00:03:22.340> even<00:03:22.549> change<00:03:22.760> them<00:03:22.910> to

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
as an import do they even change them to

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.490 
as an import do they even change them to
see<00:03:23.150> if<00:03:23.209> they<00:03:23.329> change<00:03:23.359> the<00:03:23.750> date<00:03:23.959> or<00:03:24.169> something

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
see if they change the date or something

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.039 
see if they change the date or something
I<00:03:24.769> did<00:03:25.130> find<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.609> difference<00:03:26.060> this<00:03:26.510> is<00:03:26.690> Bandai

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
I did find the difference this is Bandai

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.750 
I did find the difference this is Bandai
2009<00:03:27.829> made<00:03:28.130> in<00:03:28.250> Thailand<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:29.269> is<00:03:29.329> Bandai

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
2009 made in Thailand this is Bandai

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.970 
2009 made in Thailand this is Bandai
2011<00:03:31.760> made<00:03:31.970> in<00:03:32.150> China<00:03:32.440> Japanese<00:03:33.440> version<00:03:33.829> has

2011 made in China Japanese version has

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.089 
2011 made in China Japanese version has
all<00:03:34.130> these<00:03:34.280> screws<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.090> wings<00:03:35.299> here<00:03:36.260> you

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
all these screws in the wings here you

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.190 
all these screws in the wings here you
can<00:03:37.250> see<00:03:37.430> where<00:03:37.579> they<00:03:37.700> would<00:03:37.940> be<00:03:38.209> but<00:03:38.480> there

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
can see where they would be but there

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.040 
can see where they would be but there
aren't<00:03:39.349> any<00:03:39.579> that's<00:03:40.579> weird

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.759 

why<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:46.480> only<00:03:46.720> difference<00:03:47.080> I<00:03:47.170> can<00:03:47.319> really<00:03:47.500> see

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
why the only difference I can really see

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:48.990 
why the only difference I can really see
there<00:03:48.010> are<00:03:48.069> a<00:03:48.099> couple<00:03:48.220> screws<00:03:48.700> that<00:03:48.940> are

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
there are a couple screws that are

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.589 
there are a couple screws that are
silver<00:03:49.360> on<00:03:49.599> this<00:03:49.720> one<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.319> like<00:03:51.190> dark<00:03:51.640> on<00:03:52.390> this

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
silver on this one and like dark on this

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.509 
silver on this one and like dark on this
one<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:53.170> guess<00:03:53.709> there<00:03:53.890> are<00:03:53.950> some<00:03:54.040> tiny<00:03:54.370> little

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
one I guess there are some tiny little

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.119 
one I guess there are some tiny little
weird<00:03:55.000> differences<00:03:55.660> but<00:03:56.080> other<00:03:56.800> than<00:03:57.040> that

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
weird differences but other than that

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.360 
weird differences but other than that
it's<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.269> exact<00:03:58.569> same<00:03:58.599> thing<00:03:59.220> there's<00:04:00.220> like

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
it's the exact same thing there's like

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.890 
it's the exact same thing there's like
there's<00:04:00.670> no<00:04:00.849> weight<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.239> this<00:04:01.360> thing<00:04:01.660> at<00:04:01.780> all

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
there's no weight to this thing at all

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:09.900 
there's no weight to this thing at all
it's<00:04:02.260> really<00:04:05.819> yeah<00:04:07.440> it's<00:04:08.440> like<00:04:08.739> this<00:04:09.610> weight

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
it's really yeah it's like this weight

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.839 
it's really yeah it's like this weight
any<00:04:10.120> less<00:04:10.390> I<00:04:10.599> think<00:04:10.630> it<00:04:10.870> would<00:04:11.019> float<00:04:11.260> away

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
any less I think it would float away

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.600 
any less I think it would float away
these<00:04:12.849> are<00:04:12.910> there's<00:04:13.780> some<00:04:13.959> weight<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:14.319> these

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
these are there's some weight to these

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.129 
these are there's some weight to these
but<00:04:15.610> anyway<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.180> main<00:04:16.540> purpose<00:04:16.900> of<00:04:17.049> this

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
but anyway the main purpose of this

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.140 
but anyway the main purpose of this
video<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.560> just<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.889> let<00:04:18.040> you<00:04:18.190> know<00:04:18.220> that<00:04:18.609> this

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
video is just to let you know that this

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.610 
video is just to let you know that this
is<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:20.169> bandai<00:04:20.530> japan<00:04:20.590> version<00:04:21.519> it's<00:04:22.620> nearly

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
is the bandai japan version it's nearly

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.250 
is the bandai japan version it's nearly
identical<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:24.310> what<00:04:24.580> you<00:04:24.669> got<00:04:24.820> in<00:04:25.000> japan<00:04:25.330> when

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
identical to what you got in japan when
