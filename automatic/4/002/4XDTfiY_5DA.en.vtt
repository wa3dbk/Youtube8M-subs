daylight but the church could do they do

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.460 
daylight but the church could do they do
that<00:03:46.730> still<00:03:47.120> he<00:03:47.239> could<00:03:47.450> from<00:03:47.630> fidelity<00:03:48.019> yeah

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
that still he could from fidelity yeah

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.050 
that still he could from fidelity yeah
and<00:03:48.709> it's<00:03:48.830> I<00:03:49.010> think<00:03:49.220> it's<00:03:49.370> unlikely<00:03:49.760> they

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
and it's I think it's unlikely they

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.490 
and it's I think it's unlikely they
could<00:03:50.239> friend<00:03:50.480> fidelity<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:50.989> they<00:03:51.080> could<00:03:51.260> for

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
could friend fidelity and they could for

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.320 
could friend fidelity and they could for
