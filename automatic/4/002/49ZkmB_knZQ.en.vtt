00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.210
 here is how you can see used here 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.679
 a common usb to ps2 adapter because 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.650
 use for the test is a door a 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.590
 laptop that does not own 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.410
 no ps2 attack so as many 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.170
 computers now tend to adopt 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.420
 only the usb also cooperates the keyboard 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.130
 and mouse 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.260
 here used only the connector 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.070
 green because the green is dedicated 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.780
 in the ps2 mouse and just let's go to 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.040
 see how it works once that 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.410
 we had pulled out the device 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.770
 because at the end of device 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.010
 independent of the computer it is not 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.440
 we will have to do nothing but locate the pins 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.780
 connection ps2 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.079
 in this case it even helps 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:00.449
 same signup tix producer of the piece 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:03.600
 as you can see because in practice searching 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.080
 the internet model is provided on 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.680
 pin out of the flat connection here not 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.200
 I used the flash connector for 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.909
 solder the wires because I came more 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.549
 convenient to use and pitches i 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.840
 test points already present on the board in 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.850
 how much bigger for welds 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:34.950
 let's see in detail here 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:39.000
 we have the 5 volt t 10 corresponds to the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.920
 clock the t 11 is the passage of the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.380
 information given in the car of the of 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.850
 ps2 connector is this here 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.100
 simply a mass that has scratched 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.060
 away some space to be able to weld 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.680
 above some even suggest 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.560
 weld here on the person already present 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.360
 but it is not that it changes absolutely 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.670
 nothing like I managed to pull out 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:10.259
 the information we used 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.209
 to weld this is the model then 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:18.330
 you can see 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:24.159
 delta scott doing a brief search on 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.400
 google I managed to find the pdf yes 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.440
 explains in detail how it works 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.400
 now there is this thing in focus 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.220
 here we are here and here 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.700
 as you can see he explained to me for 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.700
 full 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.290
 d 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.300
 oh well what made the word ha 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.780
 finally put the man we do not have 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:00.180
 did nothing but reproduce what was there 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:04.390
 present on be nice 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.510
 welding the wires on the tracks following the 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.510
 tracks 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:17.650
 let's test to see if 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:20.250
 it works and as you can see it's perfectly 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.250
 working 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.930
 I can also click because I now 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.940
 I'm using a tool that already has 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.100
 recognized the device as a mouse and 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:42.010
 it also allows me to click 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:44.380
 simply with a tap for others 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.060
 systems may need the 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.540
 drive but being ps2 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.540
 I do not think so
