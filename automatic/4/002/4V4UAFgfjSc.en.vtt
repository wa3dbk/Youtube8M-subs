this is quite a sort of a new idea from

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.779

grey<00:00:48.059> necks<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.980> quite<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.610> think

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
grey necks and I quite like it I think

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.369 
grey necks and I quite like it I think
it<00:00:50.879> does<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.059> job<00:00:51.329> going<00:00:51.660> across<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> chest

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
it does a job going across the chest

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.260 
it does a job going across the chest
it's<00:00:52.590> quite<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.070> comfortable<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> strap<00:00:54.059> is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
it's quite it's comfortable the strap is

you<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.629> zoom<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.760> nice<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
you can zoom in on that is nice and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.090 
you can zoom in on that is nice and
padded<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.899> are<00:00:58.170> gonna<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.949> not

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
padded so you are gonna be it's not

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.410 
padded so you are gonna be it's not
going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.370> too<00:00:59.579> uncomfortable<00:00:59.760> they're

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
going to be too uncomfortable they're

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.510 
going to be too uncomfortable they're
sitting<00:01:01.109> across<00:01:01.170> your<00:01:01.559> chest<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.430> think

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
sitting across your chest and so I think

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.250 
sitting across your chest and so I think
that's<00:01:02.699> good<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> major

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that's good but there is a major

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.950 
that's good but there is a major
criticism<00:01:04.920> I'd<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.210> if<00:01:06.210> you'd<00:01:06.420> assume<00:01:06.600> RG

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
criticism I'd have if you'd assume RG

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.810 
criticism I'd have if you'd assume RG
for<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.200> willow<00:01:07.439> six<00:01:07.770> duffel<00:01:08.189> bag<00:01:08.340> you'll

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
for the willow six duffel bag you'll

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.920 
for the willow six duffel bag you'll
have<00:01:08.909> noticed<00:01:09.210> something<00:01:09.450> quite<00:01:09.630> unusually

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
have noticed something quite unusually

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.990 
have noticed something quite unusually
it<00:01:09.990> has<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> clip<00:01:10.590> across<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.729> so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it has a clip across and that is so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.730 
it has a clip across and that is so
incredibly<00:01:12.659> useful<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:13.200> you've<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.560> got<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
incredibly useful when you've just got a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.800 
incredibly useful when you've just got a
single<00:01:13.979> strap<00:01:14.340> because<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.970> means<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.240> unclip

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
single strap because it means you unclip

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.140 
single strap because it means you unclip
it<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.920> take<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.280> off<00:01:17.400> rather<00:01:17.909> than

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
it and you can take it off rather than

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.859 
it and you can take it off rather than
having<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> want<00:01:19.200> every<00:01:19.680> single<00:01:20.070> time

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
having to if you want every single time

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.060 
having to if you want every single time
lift<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.320> take<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.530> over<00:01:22.770> your<00:01:22.979> head

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
lift it up and take it over your head

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.070 
lift it up and take it over your head
and<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.430> put<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.640> back<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.869> lift

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and to put it back on you have to lift

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.840 
and to put it back on you have to lift
it<00:01:25.259> up<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.830> put<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.189> back<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.700> which

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
it up and put it back on like that which

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.340 
it up and put it back on like that which
is<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.360> bit<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> hassle<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.259> and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
is a bit of a bit of a hassle really and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.740 
is a bit of a bit of a hassle really and
that<00:01:28.380> would<00:01:28.530> be<00:01:28.619> my<00:01:28.770> criticism<00:01:29.729> about<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.270> one

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
that would be my criticism about the one

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.620 
that would be my criticism about the one
strap<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.290> did<00:01:31.650> now<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> back<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.329> think

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
strap I did now on to the back I think

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.770 
strap I did now on to the back I think
it's<00:01:34.619> certainly<00:01:34.890> pretty<00:01:35.220> bright<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.390> impact

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
it's certainly pretty bright the impact

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.080 
it's certainly pretty bright the impact
it's<00:01:37.409> as<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> color<00:01:37.979> scheme<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it's as the color scheme of the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.420 
it's as the color scheme of the
powerboat<00:01:39.780> Generation<00:01:40.590> X<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.220> see

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
powerboat Generation X as you can see

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.789 
powerboat Generation X as you can see
that<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.390> bat<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.750> myself<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.470> using

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
that the bat that I myself for using

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.340 
that the bat that I myself for using
this<00:01:43.950> year<00:01:44.479> obviously<00:01:45.479> Greg<00:01:45.869> Nickels<00:01:46.049> being

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
this year obviously Greg Nickels being

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.520 
this year obviously Greg Nickels being
live<00:01:46.470> sponsors<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.009> year<00:01:47.869> but<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.049> think<00:01:49.110> if

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
live sponsors this year but I think if

than I thought

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.890 
than I thought
I<00:04:52.970> when<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.000> first<00:04:54.060> took<00:04:54.360> this<00:04:54.419> out<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.630> packet

you think you know it's not massive it's
a<00:04:56.190> good<00:04:56.310> size<00:04:56.580> then<00:04:57.150> you<00:04:57.240> start<00:04:57.479> loading<00:04:57.720> it

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
a good size then you start loading it

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.510 
a good size then you start loading it
and<00:04:58.020> it's<00:04:58.350> like<00:04:58.410> a<00:04:58.500> TARDIS<00:04:59.010> it<00:04:59.100> can<00:04:59.190> just<00:04:59.310> keep

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
and it's like a TARDIS it can just keep

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.520 
and it's like a TARDIS it can just keep
taking<00:04:59.789> more<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.479> more<00:05:00.630> stuff<00:05:00.930> which<00:05:01.410> is

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
taking more and more stuff which is

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.900
