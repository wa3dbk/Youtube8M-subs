on<00:00:16.920> your<00:00:17.490> your<00:00:18.060> water<00:00:18.449> pipes<00:00:18.980> which<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.130> pretty

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
on your your water pipes which is pretty

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.519 
on your your water pipes which is pretty
simple<00:00:20.609> but<00:00:20.880> before<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.210> make<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> demonstration

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
different types you know mainly I use

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.519 
different types you know mainly I use
the<00:00:28.109> white<00:00:28.470> tape<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.660> they<00:00:30.660> come<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.019> varying

less turns you have to go around the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.939 
less turns you have to go around the
pipe<00:00:48.800> but<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> most<00:00:50.430> part<00:00:51.829> what<00:00:52.829> you're

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
pipe but for the most part what you're

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.459 
pipe but for the most part what you're
looking<00:00:53.219> at<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.520> what<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.699> use<00:00:54.000> mainly<00:00:54.719> now

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
looking at here is what I use mainly now

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.740 
looking at here is what I use mainly now
they<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.949> comes<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.340> half<00:00:56.579> inch<00:00:56.760> widths<00:00:57.149> all

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
they this comes in half inch widths all

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.540 
they this comes in half inch widths all
the<00:00:57.930> way<00:00:58.020> up<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.469> inch<00:00:58.649> width<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.100> generally

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the way up to one inch width I generally

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.090 
the way up to one inch width I generally
carry<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.910> half<00:01:00.090> inch<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.420> 3/4<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.859> find

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
carry a half inch and 3/4 but I find

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.920 
carry a half inch and 3/4 but I find
myself<00:01:02.250> mainly<00:01:02.879> using<00:01:03.210> half<00:01:03.359> inch<00:01:03.600> tape

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
myself mainly using half inch tape

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.020 
myself mainly using half inch tape
because<00:01:04.290> I'm<00:01:04.439> working<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.280> half<00:01:05.519> inch<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
because I'm working with half inch and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.550 
because I'm working with half inch and
3/4<00:01:06.510> inch<00:01:06.659> pipe<00:01:07.729> they<00:01:08.729> also<00:01:08.909> make<00:01:09.240> up<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.630> pink

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
3/4 inch pipe they also make up a pink

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.289 
3/4 inch pipe they also make up a pink
version<00:01:11.840> which<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.520> triple<00:01:14.520> density<00:01:15.060> tape

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
version which is a triple density tape

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.249 
version which is a triple density tape
and<00:01:15.509> that's<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.840> larger<00:01:16.530> pipes<00:01:16.799> larger<00:01:17.490> pipes

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
and that's for larger pipes larger pipes

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.999 
and that's for larger pipes larger pipes
in<00:01:19.259> big<00:01:20.220> distribution<00:01:21.150> systems<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.920> know

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
in big distribution systems you know

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.850 
in big distribution systems you know
anything<00:01:23.340> from<00:01:23.460> two-inch<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.030> above<00:01:24.860> and

anything from two-inch and above and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.830 
anything from two-inch and above and
that's<00:01:26.100> pretty<00:01:26.369> pretty<00:01:26.759> heavy<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> 10<00:01:27.600> mil

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that's pretty pretty heavy like a 10 mil

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.560 
that's pretty pretty heavy like a 10 mil
weight<00:01:28.409> they<00:01:29.369> also<00:01:29.520> make<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> yellow<00:01:30.150> tape

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
weight they also make a yellow tape

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
I've gone up to six or seven turns

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.740 
I've gone up to six or seven turns
around<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:40.120> couple<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.180> things<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.480> bear<00:02:41.660> in

mind you want to wrap your tape

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.460 
mind you want to wrap your tape
clockwise<00:02:44.980> that's<00:02:45.980> away<00:02:46.459> from<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:47.410> away<00:02:48.410> from

clockwise that's away from you away from

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.840 
clockwise that's away from you away from
you<00:02:48.769> so<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.100> when<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.340> screw<00:02:49.670> this

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
you so that when you screw this

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.990 
you so that when you screw this
clockwise<00:02:50.209> into<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.900> fitting<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:52.610> tape<00:02:52.850> is

clockwise into the fitting the tape is

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.729 
clockwise into the fitting the tape is
going<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.209> stay<00:02:53.450> there<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.870> see<00:02:54.290> quite<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.620> few

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
going to stay there I see quite a few

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.670 
going to stay there I see quite a few
guys<00:02:55.510> taking<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.600> Teflon<00:02:57.019> and<00:02:57.230> they<00:02:57.319> wrap<00:02:57.650> it

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
guys taking the Teflon and they wrap it

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.400 
guys taking the Teflon and they wrap it
towards<00:02:58.580> them<00:02:58.850> which<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.840> counterclockwise

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
towards them which is counterclockwise

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.740 
towards them which is counterclockwise
and<00:03:01.370> what<00:03:01.760> that's<00:03:01.940> going<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.120> do<00:03:02.330> is<00:03:02.480> when<00:03:02.630> they

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
and what that's going to do is when they

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.300 
and what that's going to do is when they
screw<00:03:03.049> it<00:03:03.170> into<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.410> fitting<00:03:03.709> they're<00:03:04.160> going

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
screw it into the fitting they're going

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.979 
screw it into the fitting they're going
to<00:03:04.370> unravel<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.000> Teflon<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.600> Teflon<00:03:05.959> is

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
to unravel the Teflon the Teflon is

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.900 
to unravel the Teflon the Teflon is
actually<00:03:06.380> going<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.620> come<00:03:06.799> out<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.700> not

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
actually going to come out it's not

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.280 
actually going to come out it's not
going<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.180> stay<00:03:08.330> inside<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.840> joint<00:03:09.110> so<00:03:09.260> you

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
going to stay inside the joint so you

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.280 
going to stay inside the joint so you
need<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.769> keep<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.610> in<00:03:10.670> mind<00:03:11.030> always<00:03:11.290> wrap

point out is this I prefer keeping the
Teflon<00:03:44.690> toward<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.200> end<00:03:45.440> of<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.680> pipe<00:03:45.890> I

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
Teflon toward the end of the pipe I

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.380 
Teflon toward the end of the pipe I
don't<00:03:48.410> like<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.709> go<00:03:48.859> all<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.220> way<00:03:49.250> back<00:03:49.579> only

don't like to go all the way back only

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.229 
don't like to go all the way back only
because<00:03:50.630> once<00:03:51.170> this<00:03:51.380> piece<00:03:51.650> is<00:03:51.890> made<00:03:52.100> up<00:03:52.310> then

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
because once this piece is made up then

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.120 
because once this piece is made up then
I<00:03:53.269> lose<00:03:53.600> most<00:03:53.959> of<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.260> Teflon<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:54.769> you<00:03:54.980> don't

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
I lose most of the Teflon and you don't

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.819 
I lose most of the Teflon and you don't
see<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.519> and<00:03:55.640> you<00:03:55.730> have<00:03:55.850> a<00:03:55.880> nice<00:03:56.090> clean<00:03:56.450> joint

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
see it and you have a nice clean joint

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.940 
see it and you have a nice clean joint
what<00:03:57.829> I<00:03:57.859> see<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.160> lot<00:03:58.370> of<00:03:58.400> guys<00:03:58.579> doing<00:03:59.170> and<00:04:00.170> I'm

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
what I see a lot of guys doing and I'm

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.500 
what I see a lot of guys doing and I'm
not<00:04:01.160> saying<00:04:01.459> whether<00:04:01.670> this<00:04:01.880> is<00:04:02.090> right<00:04:02.329> or

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
not saying whether this is right or

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.470 
not saying whether this is right or
wrong<00:04:02.540> but<00:04:03.489> I<00:04:04.489> just<00:04:04.700> don't<00:04:04.910> think<00:04:05.120> it<00:04:05.239> looks

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
wrong but I just don't think it looks

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.599 
wrong but I just don't think it looks
nice<00:04:06.470> they'll<00:04:07.220> start<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:08.950> they'll<00:04:09.950> wrap<00:04:10.250> and

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
nice they'll start and they'll wrap and

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.520 
nice they'll start and they'll wrap and
they'll<00:04:11.090> go<00:04:11.269> all<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.720> way<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.049> back<00:04:12.230> end

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
they'll go all the way to the back end

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.240 
they'll go all the way to the back end
of<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.739> threads<00:04:13.069> there<00:04:14.530> but<00:04:15.530> they<00:04:15.680> know<00:04:15.920> that

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
of the threads there but they know that

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.580 
of the threads there but they know that
when<00:04:17.000> you<00:04:17.120> screw<00:04:17.389> pipe<00:04:17.630> in<00:04:17.900> there's<00:04:18.229> no<00:04:18.410> way

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
when you screw pipe in there's no way

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.810 
when you screw pipe in there's no way
you're<00:04:18.769> going<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:18.950> screw<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.340> pipe<00:04:19.549> all<00:04:19.789> the

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
you're going to screw the pipe all the

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.520 
you're going to screw the pipe all the
way<00:04:19.940> in<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:20.570> you're<00:04:20.840> going<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.049> end<00:04:21.169> up<00:04:21.350> with

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
way in so you're going to end up with

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.190 
way in so you're going to end up with
this<00:04:21.880> kind<00:04:22.880> of<00:04:22.970> white<00:04:23.180> racing<00:04:23.659> stripe<00:04:23.930> if<00:04:24.080> you

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
this kind of white racing stripe if you

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.440 
this kind of white racing stripe if you
will<00:04:24.409> on<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:25.430> pipe<00:04:25.640> and

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
will on the pipe and

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.920 
will on the pipe and
just<00:04:26.690> looks<00:04:26.900> terrible<00:04:27.490> so<00:04:28.490> my<00:04:29.180> recommendation

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
just looks terrible so my recommendation

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.530 
just looks terrible so my recommendation
is<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.110> keep<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.590> toward<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.920> front<00:04:31.540> obviously

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
is to keep it toward the front obviously

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.480 
is to keep it toward the front obviously
this<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.230> half<00:04:33.410> inch<00:04:33.590> pipe<00:04:33.800> I'm<00:04:34.010> using<00:04:34.190> half

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
this is half inch pipe I'm using half

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.070 
this is half inch pipe I'm using half
inch<00:04:34.730> Teflon<00:04:36.880> we<00:04:37.880> have<00:04:37.970> a<00:04:38.000> piece<00:04:38.210> of<00:04:38.240> 3/4<00:04:38.780> here

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
piece of 3/4 inch pipe now a lot of guys

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.750 
piece of 3/4 inch pipe now a lot of guys
would<00:04:42.200> use<00:04:42.350> 3/4<00:04:42.860> Teflon<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.250> cover<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.730> whole

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
would use 3/4 Teflon and cover the whole

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.410 
would use 3/4 Teflon and cover the whole

mystery<00:05:07.790> to<00:05:07.970> this<00:05:08.770> pretty<00:05:09.770> easy<00:05:10.040> to<00:05:10.220> work<00:05:10.400> with

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
mystery to this pretty easy to work with

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.480 
mystery to this pretty easy to work with
you<00:05:11.210> can<00:05:11.270> even<00:05:11.570> use<00:05:11.870> it<00:05:11.900> on<00:05:12.110> smaller<00:05:13.040> pieces<00:05:13.340> of

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
you can even use it on smaller pieces of

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.660 
you can even use it on smaller pieces of
pipe<00:05:13.760> this<00:05:14.000> is<00:05:14.120> a<00:05:14.150> half<00:05:14.420> inch<00:05:14.660> closed<00:05:15.110> nipple

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.660 
pipe this is a half inch closed nipple
and<00:05:16.670> obviously<00:05:17.380> you<00:05:18.380> know<00:05:18.500> I<00:05:18.530> can't<00:05:19.040> keep<00:05:19.430> this

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
and obviously you know I can't keep this

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.400 
and obviously you know I can't keep this
to<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:19.970> front<00:05:20.240> because<00:05:20.420> there<00:05:20.720> isn't<00:05:20.870> much<00:05:21.020> to

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
to the front because there isn't much to

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.100 
to the front because there isn't much to
it<00:05:21.610> but<00:05:22.610> when<00:05:23.000> these<00:05:23.150> little<00:05:23.510> nipples<00:05:23.960> get

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
it but when these little nipples get

it but when these little nipples get
made<00:05:24.320> up

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
made up

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.820 
made up
you<00:05:25.370> generally<00:05:25.880> end<00:05:26.120> up<00:05:26.720> losing<00:05:26.990> most<00:05:27.470> of<00:05:27.740> the

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
you generally end up losing most of the

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.420 
you generally end up losing most of the
most<00:05:28.340> of<00:05:28.610> the<00:05:28.790> nipple<00:05:29.570> into<00:05:29.720> the<00:05:29.930> fitting
