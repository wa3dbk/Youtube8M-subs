00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.140
 presents a novelty on facetime that 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.519
 we only have since ios is everything 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.710
 first to be able to use facetime 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.080
 you have to activate it so you did 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.789
 style 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.680
 so you have to configure your address 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.330
 so it must be good of one on 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.849
 apple that facetime is enabled if thing 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.189
 to know your facetime identifier 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.619
 different from that of lay gold wedding 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.320
 or app store then once the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.750

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.129

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:58.890
 camera and the phone is so in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:59.969
 clicking on the phone so in 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.390
 clicking on the phone as you 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.300
 can see it 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:09.210
 you have two possibilities like 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.900

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.240

 to another contact does when you click 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.070
 on facetime so there you have a 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.740
 news 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.270
 how 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.040
 the traditional fnath that is displayed and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.020

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.680
 the traditional display so does this 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:18.540
 time but if I answer that will put the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.770
 video mode and so that's it 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.520

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.620

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.110
 and so here is this possible to 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.470
 this new option is not available 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.260
 that on the ios is on him is if it's
