I can tell you that my thoughts on it
for<00:00:17.279> now<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:18.109> basically<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.289> its<00:00:19.439> gonna<00:00:19.500> be

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
for now and basically what its gonna be

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.500 
for now and basically what its gonna be
like<00:00:19.740> when<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.070> goes<00:00:20.160> mainstream<00:00:20.420> now<00:00:21.420> of

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
like when it goes mainstream now of

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.179 
like when it goes mainstream now of
course<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.900> biggest<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.500> probably<00:00:22.710> most

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
course the biggest and probably most

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.759 
course the biggest and probably most
noticeable<00:00:23.820> update<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.689> counter<00:00:25.590> strike

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
noticeable update to the counter strike

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.140 
noticeable update to the counter strike
source<00:00:25.800> beta<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:26.670> updated<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
source beta was that they updated the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.839 
source beta was that they updated the
engine<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> Orange<00:00:28.050> Box<00:00:28.609> basically<00:00:29.609> what<00:00:29.699> that

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
engine to Orange Box basically what that

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.720 
engine to Orange Box basically what that
means<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.420> Team<00:00:30.599> Fortress<00:00:30.900> 2<00:00:31.520> half-life<00:00:32.520> 2

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
means is the Team Fortress 2 half-life 2

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.030 
means is the Team Fortress 2 half-life 2
episode<00:00:32.759> 2<00:00:33.329> engine<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.050> kind<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.290> thing<00:00:34.469> so

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
episode 2 engine that kind of thing so

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740 
episode 2 engine that kind of thing so
you<00:00:35.100> know<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.579> effects<00:00:35.880> are<00:00:36.030> improved<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you know the effects are improved the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.410 
you know the effects are improved the
textures<00:00:37.110> are<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> little<00:00:37.469> bit<00:00:37.590> sharper

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
textures are a little bit sharper

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.150 
textures are a little bit sharper
shadows<00:00:39.420> are<00:00:39.570> better<00:00:39.780> Lighting's<00:00:40.469> better<00:00:40.739> so

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
shadows are better Lighting's better so

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.069 
shadows are better Lighting's better so
just<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> graphics<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.210> overall<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.899> been

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
just the graphics so overall have been

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.330 
just the graphics so overall have been
improved

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
improved

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.060 
improved
it's<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:45.059> won't<00:00:45.329> notice<00:00:45.600> too<00:00:46.200> much<00:00:46.500> except

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
it's you won't notice too much except

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.060 
it's you won't notice too much except
for<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:47.969> said<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> lighting<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
for like I said the lighting and the you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.950 
for like I said the lighting and the you
know<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.309> kind<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.550> thing<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.030> overall<00:00:51.629> it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
know that kind of thing but overall it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.380 
know that kind of thing but overall it
does<00:00:52.110> look<00:00:52.350> better<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.860> that's<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.160> good<00:00:53.280> thing

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
does look better so that's a good thing

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.540 
does look better so that's a good thing
I<00:00:54.390> foresee<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.649> will<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:55.980> little<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
I foresee that this will have little to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.160 
I foresee that this will have little to
no<00:00:56.730> effect<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.360> people's<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.140> know

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
no effect on people's you know

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.930 
no effect on people's you know
performance<00:00:58.800> because<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.129> Orange<00:00:59.550> Box<00:00:59.670> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
performance because the Orange Box is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.500 
performance because the Orange Box is
such<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.359> know<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:01.309> very<00:01:02.449> versatile<00:01:03.449> very

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
such a you know a very versatile very

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.170 
such a you know a very versatile very
efficient<00:01:04.470> engine<00:01:04.860> when<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.519> comes<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.880> you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
efficient engine when it comes to you

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.770 
efficient engine when it comes to you
know

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
know

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.290 
know
delivering<00:01:07.560> great<00:01:07.920> graphics<00:01:08.400> without<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
delivering great graphics without you

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.080 
delivering great graphics without you
know<00:01:09.420> too<00:01:09.960> much<00:01:10.080> performance<00:01:10.650> problems

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
know too much performance problems

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.090 
know too much performance problems
beyond<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.390> supposedly<00:01:13.230> they<00:01:13.530> updated<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
beyond that supposedly they updated the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.950 
beyond that supposedly they updated the
hitboxes<00:01:14.730> I<00:01:14.790> haven't<00:01:15.270> really<00:01:15.450> noticed<00:01:15.630> too

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
hitboxes I haven't really noticed too

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.320 
hitboxes I haven't really noticed too
much<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.260> a<00:01:16.350> change<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:17.220> think<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.180> are

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
much of a change I think they are

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.760 
much of a change I think they are
supposed<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> little<00:01:19.170> bit<00:01:19.290> closer<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
supposed to be a little bit closer to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.550 
supposed to be a little bit closer to
1.6<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.670> hitboxes<00:01:21.300> to<00:01:21.930> where<00:01:22.050> they<00:01:22.200> follow<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
1.6 as hitboxes to where they follow a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.680 
1.6 as hitboxes to where they follow a
little<00:01:22.860> better<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.300> that's<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
little better but you know so that's a

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.690 
little better but you know so that's a
little<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.320> noticed<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:26.250> hit<00:01:26.490> more

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
little I have noticed that I do hit more

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.250 
little I have noticed that I do hit more
in<00:01:27.360> general<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.380> that's<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.619> nice<00:01:28.770> thing<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
in general so that's a nice thing and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.960 
in general so that's a nice thing and
another<00:01:31.260> thing<00:01:31.560> they<00:01:31.830> added<00:01:32.190> achievements

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
another thing they added achievements

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.020 
another thing they added achievements
and<00:01:33.150> steam<00:01:33.540> cloud<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.970> counter-strike<00:01:35.970> source

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
and steam cloud to counter-strike source

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.240 
and steam cloud to counter-strike source
and<00:01:36.570> they<00:01:36.990> did<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:37.470> Team<00:01:37.650> Fortress<00:01:37.860> 2<00:01:38.220> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
and they did that with Team Fortress 2 a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.850 
and they did that with Team Fortress 2 a
while<00:01:38.640> back<00:01:38.910> but<00:01:39.690> you<00:01:40.080> know<00:01:40.200> put<00:01:40.530> again<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.800> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
while back but you know put again in the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.550 
while back but you know put again in the
counter-strike<00:01:41.310> source<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.990> have<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.170> say<00:01:43.350> it's

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
counter-strike source I have to say it's

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.580 
counter-strike source I have to say it's
kind<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.800> pointless<00:01:44.899> there's<00:01:45.899> no<00:01:46.140> reason<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
kind of pointless there's no reason to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.139 
kind of pointless there's no reason to
put<00:01:46.800> in<00:01:46.950> stats<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.640> counter-strike<00:01:48.090> source

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
put in stats in counter-strike source

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
counter-strike source it that the only

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.779 
counter-strike source it that the only
achievements<00:02:01.500> are<00:02:01.619> stuff<00:02:01.800> like<00:02:02.039> you<00:02:02.430> know<00:02:02.460> get

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
X number of headshots get X number of

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.479 
X number of headshots get X number of
kills<00:02:05.160> win<00:02:05.580> X<00:02:05.910> number<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.240> times<00:02:06.890> yeah<00:02:07.890> they're

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
kills win X number of times yeah they're

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.160 
kills win X number of times yeah they're
very<00:02:08.729> very<00:02:08.940> simple<00:02:09.539> things<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.989> you'd

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
very very simple things that you'd

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.920 
very very simple things that you'd
expect<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.530> find<00:02:10.619> something<00:02:11.010> like<00:02:11.160> whole<00:02:11.400> duty

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
expect to find something like whole duty

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.210 
expect to find something like whole duty
so<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.590> they're<00:02:13.799> kind<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.040> out<00:02:14.190> of

so it's that they're kind of out of

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.670 
so it's that they're kind of out of
place<00:02:14.340> should<00:02:15.150> be<00:02:15.269> honest<00:02:15.480> with<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.750> um<00:02:16.230> the
