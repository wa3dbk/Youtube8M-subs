Welcome to my video

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.760
Today I'm going to show you how to cut a watermelon easily

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.660
Crop the top and the bottom of the melon

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.850
Cut it to halts

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:53.617
Clean the seeds in it

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.660
Smells lovely

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:20.537
Put it like this

00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:24.555
I'll show it from a closer shot

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.140
Slice the melon in this direction first

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.815
Cut it the other way now

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.060
Now I'm going to show you how to eat it easily

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.060
This is actually a bit failish..

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.980
Because the middle of the melon disappears unlike watermelon...

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.129
But still it's eatable and easy

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.040
This trick obviously works better with a watermelon 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.280
