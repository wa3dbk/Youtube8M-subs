00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.010
 peter from the angel about you not against it 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.840
 nac breda b happy that you seen 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.280
 tonight 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.599
 you called I was satisfied with that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.889
 it was probably that our football ours 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.820
 best match but we knew it 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.890
 beforehand 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.350
 because they pull your wall where it 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.550
 just very difficult line ball is in and out 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.949
 they then pray dangerously on the counter 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.029
 in addition, is usually our 6th 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.920
 competition in two weeks 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.570
 so guys and that made me totally fresh 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.699
 like that maybe a couple of weeks 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.900
 ago or so were actually was 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.790
 quite logical as the competition itself 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.890
 beam in a row 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.500
 yes that tastes like more six days three 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.840
 victories we also knew the dutch 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.879
 website so knox that is not there 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.129
 good for them and assume full house 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.350
 There were always cravings 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.059
 tad extra good and they have everything 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.020
 and fortunately we have three points 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.129
 had 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.360
 watch as you all go inside 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.469
 start walking make room for you 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.239
 cut yourself too small 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.680
 draw all the walls then you have to 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.390
 make your scrap space possible 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.250
 so i especially like labyad and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.379
 and oil did not say that it was whole 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.519
 wide to keep the midfielders 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.250
 that already have little space just something 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.750
 try to give more space 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.670
 yes they play 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.700
 the side can move it quickly 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.900
 keep the game a bit more broad and like us 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.250
 would play by would mark 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.650
 eventually we are a bit of a break 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.080
 goal and that is ultimately also 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.550
 happens and of course very happy with that 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.080
 in 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.020
 have kept the zero so one 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.910
 victory it's not a whole 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.710
 clear win but if you have it 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.460
 many blue game want to see than it is 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.600
 justly 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.920
 and then that hit and actually falls 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.690
 gather to make the second then 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.940
 it will still be very exciting 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.259
 yes, that is the moment when they do something 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.789
 more spaces to give away and the 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.110
 they did and yes you have to 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.310
 completion 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.170
 something quieter for that second to 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.330
 then make the best played shocked 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.860
 is he play tall people for in and 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.740
 even defenders and the keeper went 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.899
 bring forward the end to file 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.670
 kept well done not many chances 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.580
 given away 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.960
 I always think and had the ball and 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.270
 combinations may way he sometimes 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.679
 sloppy ball loss but its point true 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.530
 we can work on it but if you do 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.700
 then wins over first joy now 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.140
 won three games in a row that is 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.660
 also long ago that somewhere 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.010
 good feeling every victory is one 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.680
 good feeling 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.910
 and yes that victory was anyway 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.989
 a while ago and now three times behind 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.989
 each other so that's fine
