00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.830
 eae personal beauty that I am today with 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.400
 my first video about dragon city 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.920
 remembering already has a channel and I ask that 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.289
 you enter into it and sign up for 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.080
 help a video channel that teaches me 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.600
 players and this one is going to be a dragon 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.680
 city ​​maybe i'll put some center 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.349
 out good pro CISF another today is 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.460
 talking about a rule of three of 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:37.200
 dragon city ​​that she is very simple in her 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.710
 daily bonus you have to shuffle the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.520
 letters there and will put in 14 hours or deck 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.410
 q3 or here that is the superior that takes 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.020
 these two letters to him as you can 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.140
 check whether these two provinces 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.649
 shuffling then the rule of 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.160
 three here so not here not when here 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:04.430
 tell me this one 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:08.280
 Whenever you're as I can say 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.280
 was to press some of these buttons 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.689
 I do not trust you to tighten these 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.799
 buttons around here so here 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:22.049
 because this letter and this house always 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.070
 have another face that has the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.970
 gems 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.710
 She's going to come out here or 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.710
 so here's how it is over 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.020
 fortunate to leave is that the cnec in these three is 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.540
 that around going out sometimes does not go out 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.990
 All time here does not go out all the time. 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.170
 né type sometimes none of these come out 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.950
 two letters here today leave both 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.680
 But try again near the hill. 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:58.590
 then I'll show you is there to 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:03.810
 I'm going to win yours I'm not going to win there 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.409
 appeared to try again here 35 outside and 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.349
 is out here but try again is that 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.420
 which I would scramble again and 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.560
 give a click and bitch who gave birth and 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.880
 try again 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:23.040
 I did not go out and go there and luckily 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.989
 When I clicked on the top, I left the poop 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.310
 on the bottom it is when he goes to bed 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.950
 understood 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.519
 Good people but he saw me as I am very 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.470
 ass just because the request of lps envy 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.090
 or try again at the time then change 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.630
 of letter but did not give and dragon put in 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.970
 up the you the 35 gems 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.319
 But that 's it folks I hope you 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.319
 have enjoyed and even more
