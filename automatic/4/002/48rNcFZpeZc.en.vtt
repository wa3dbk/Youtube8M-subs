the zone seamlessly as well but that's

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.309 
the zone seamlessly as well but that's
going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.649> be<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:17.009> lot<00:01:17.550> more<00:01:17.580> difficult<00:01:18.330> also

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:19.319

called all of the PvP players to your
location<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:45.610> getting<00:02:45.820> out<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.090> these<00:02:46.180> zones

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
location so getting out of these zones

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.280 
location so getting out of these zones
is<00:02:46.840> going<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.560> be<00:02:47.650> pretty<00:02:48.010> tough<00:02:48.850> and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
is going to be pretty tough and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.180 
is going to be pretty tough and
interesting<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.440> say<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.650> least<00:02:50.800> and

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
interesting to say the least and

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.610 
interesting to say the least and
apparently<00:02:51.910> dark<00:02:52.360> zones<00:02:52.690> will<00:02:52.870> have<00:02:53.020> a<00:02:53.050> very

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
apparently dark zones will have a very

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.720 
apparently dark zones will have a very
different<00:02:54.280> look<00:02:54.820> to<00:02:54.880> them<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.480> NPCs<00:02:56.440> will<00:02:57.370> act

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
different look to them and NPCs will act

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.020 
different look to them and NPCs will act
differently<00:02:58.480> at<00:02:59.040> nighttime<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.370> roaming<00:03:00.790> into

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
differently at nighttime so roaming into

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.150 
differently at nighttime so roaming into
these<00:03:01.180> dark<00:03:01.930> zones<00:03:02.260> will<00:03:02.530> be<00:03:02.650> more<00:03:02.950> difficult

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
these dark zones will be more difficult

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.330 
these dark zones will be more difficult
at<00:03:03.640> nighttime<00:03:04.300> than<00:03:04.600> during<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.230> day<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:06.220> can

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
at nighttime than during the day you can

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.270 
at nighttime than during the day you can
expect<00:03:06.730> more<00:03:07.210> pvp<00:03:07.740> engagement<00:03:08.740> during<00:03:08.980> that

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
expect more pvp engagement during that

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.600 
expect more pvp engagement during that
time<00:03:09.550> as<00:03:09.730> well<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.860> roaming<00:03:11.860> around<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.370> night
