00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
of our power break all that kind of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.440 
of our power break all that kind of
stuff<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.369> actually<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.790> pretty<00:01:39.390> big

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
stuff this is actually a pretty big

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.050 
stuff this is actually a pretty big
power<00:01:39.840> brick<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.860> power<00:01:41.460> brick<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.939> we

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
power brick so power brick for that we

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.200 
power brick so power brick for that we
use<00:01:42.470> of<00:01:43.470> course<00:01:43.560> we've<00:01:43.860> got<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.220> AC<00:01:44.490> wall<00:01:44.880> plug

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
use of course we've got the AC wall plug

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.469 
use of course we've got the AC wall plug
in<00:01:45.390> there<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.460> looks<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.270> had<00:01:48.450> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
in there and it looks like if I had to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.600 
in there and it looks like if I had to
guess<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.530> power<00:01:50.070> brick<00:01:50.399> yeah

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
guess this can be the power brick yeah

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.330 
guess this can be the power brick yeah
the<00:01:50.880> charger<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.930> Wii<00:01:52.110> U<00:01:52.140> controller<00:01:52.470> so

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
it up looks like we've got our HDMI

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.550 
it up looks like we've got our HDMI
cable<00:02:35.880> which<00:02:36.300> I'm<00:02:36.450> actually<00:02:36.600> pretty<00:02:37.080> excited

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
cable which I'm actually pretty excited

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.380 
cable which I'm actually pretty excited
that<00:02:37.680> they<00:02:37.770> include<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.460> system<00:02:38.910> if

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
that they include this in the system if

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.030 
that they include this in the system if
I'm<00:02:39.510> not<00:02:39.660> mistaken<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.170> lot<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.410> gaming<00:02:40.710> systems

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
I'm not mistaken a lot of gaming systems

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.310 
I'm not mistaken a lot of gaming systems
don't<00:02:41.250> really<00:02:41.400> include<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.450> HDMI<00:02:42.990> cable

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
don't really include the that HDMI cable

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.870 
don't really include the that HDMI cable
so<00:02:43.410> it's<00:02:43.560> pretty<00:02:43.680> handy<00:02:43.830> too<00:02:44.460> in<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.700> box

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
so it's pretty handy too in the box

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.630 
so it's pretty handy too in the box
you've<00:02:45.060> got<00:02:45.210> it<00:02:45.300> right<00:02:45.420> there<00:02:46.460> there<00:02:47.460> we<00:02:47.550> go

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
you've got it right there there we go

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.670 
you've got it right there there we go
there's<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.000> sensor<00:02:48.510> bar<00:02:48.690> looks<00:02:49.350> very

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
there's the sensor bar looks very

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.560 
there's the sensor bar looks very
reminiscent<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.880> one<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.209> we've<00:02:51.330> seen

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
reminiscent to the one that we've seen

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.870 
reminiscent to the one that we've seen
on<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.990> original<00:02:52.440> week<00:02:52.620> let's<00:02:53.430> go<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.670> slide

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
on the original week let's go and slide

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.240 
on the original week let's go and slide
this<00:02:54.090> aside<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.410> looks<00:02:55.709> like<00:02:55.800> this<00:02:56.100> is

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
this aside and it looks like this is

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.420 
this aside and it looks like this is
gonna<00:02:56.370> be<00:02:56.550> where<00:02:56.730> all<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.720> good<00:02:57.900> stuff<00:02:58.140> is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
gonna be where all of the good stuff is

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.000 
gonna be where all of the good stuff is
so<00:02:59.430> it's<00:02:59.550> gonna<00:02:59.730> pop<00:03:00.630> this<00:03:00.870> open<00:03:01.050> here<00:03:01.440> and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
so it's gonna pop this open here and

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.270 
so it's gonna pop this open here and
this<00:03:03.000> if<00:03:03.330> I'm<00:03:03.780> not<00:03:04.020> mistaken<00:03:04.440> will<00:03:04.740> be<00:03:04.920> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
this if I'm not mistaken will be the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.930 
this if I'm not mistaken will be the
black<00:03:05.640> Wii<00:03:06.420> controller<00:03:07.020> or<00:03:07.980> gamepad<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.670> guess

sticks<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.470> everything<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:23.220> it's<00:03:23.600> pretty

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
sticks and everything so it's pretty

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.900 
sticks and everything so it's pretty
lightweight<00:03:24.959> honestly<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.250> kind<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.550> feels

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
lightweight honestly it kind of feels

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.850 
lightweight honestly it kind of feels
about<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.570> same<00:03:27.840> weight<00:03:28.140> as<00:03:28.320> maybe<00:03:28.530> like<00:03:28.739> an

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
about the same weight as maybe like an

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.009 
about the same weight as maybe like an
iPad<00:03:29.250> Mini<00:03:29.489> I've<00:03:29.880> actually<00:03:30.030> got<00:03:30.300> my<00:03:30.330> iPad<00:03:30.780> Mini

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
so let's go ahead and compare those in

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.470 
so let's go ahead and compare those in
size<00:03:34.130> let<00:03:35.130> me<00:03:35.220> grab<00:03:35.430> this<00:03:35.820> really<00:03:36.090> quick<00:03:36.300> out

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
size let me grab this really quick out

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.009 
size let me grab this really quick out
of<00:03:36.510> my<00:03:36.720> bag<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.769> here<00:03:38.160> we<00:03:38.250> go<00:03:38.480> so<00:03:39.480> here<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.900> an

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
of my bag and here we go so here is an

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.949 
of my bag and here we go so here is an
iPad<00:03:40.380> Mini<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:41.370> just<00:03:41.640> kind<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.820> comparative<00:03:42.480> to

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
iPad Mini so just kind of comparative to

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.710 
iPad Mini so just kind of comparative to
the<00:03:42.989> Wii<00:03:43.200> U<00:03:43.380> gamepad<00:03:43.830> so<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:45.360> know<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.540> course

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
the Wii U gamepad so you know of course

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.960 
the Wii U gamepad so you know of course
it's<00:03:45.959> obviously<00:03:46.320> thicker<00:03:46.650> but<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.700> know<00:03:47.790> not

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
it's obviously thicker but you know not

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.290 
it's obviously thicker but you know not
much<00:03:48.209> longer<00:03:48.720> than<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.019> iPad<00:03:49.380> Mini<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:50.580> if

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
much longer than the iPad Mini so if

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.850 
much longer than the iPad Mini so if
you've<00:03:51.450> held<00:03:51.750> one<00:03:51.989> of<00:03:52.080> those<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.620> know<00:03:52.709> this

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
you've held one of those you know this

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.350 
you've held one of those you know this
is<00:03:52.920> gonna<00:03:53.010> be<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.190> couple<00:03:53.310> inches<00:03:53.519> longer<00:03:53.850> but

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
is gonna be a couple inches longer but

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.170 
is gonna be a couple inches longer but
it<00:03:54.450> feels<00:03:54.570> good<00:03:54.810> in<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.050> hand<00:03:55.880> just<00:03:56.880> another

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
it feels good in the hand just another

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.390 
it feels good in the hand just another
look<00:03:57.890> you<00:03:58.890> guys<00:03:59.040> can<00:03:59.250> see<00:04:00.380> pretty<00:04:01.380> nice<00:04:02.010> and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
look you guys can see pretty nice and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.520 
look you guys can see pretty nice and
black<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.850> definitely<00:04:03.300> like<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.540> black<00:04:03.750> so

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
black I definitely like the black so

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.140 
black I definitely like the black so
it's<00:04:04.650> going<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.860> put<00:04:05.100> this<00:04:05.250> aside<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.910> get<00:04:06.120> a

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
it's going to put this aside and get a

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.590 
it's going to put this aside and get a
look<00:04:06.420> at<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.780> console<00:04:10.970> and<00:04:11.970> all<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.299> tape

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
look at the console and all this tape

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.690 
look at the console and all this tape
let's<00:04:12.900> figure<00:04:13.140> out<00:04:13.320> how<00:04:13.440> we<00:04:13.739> can<00:04:13.920> pop<00:04:14.130> all<00:04:14.430> this

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
let's figure out how we can pop all this

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.580 
let's figure out how we can pop all this
open

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.779 

what's<00:04:19.590> funny<00:04:19.829> is<00:04:19.979> when<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.190> saw<00:04:20.459> this<00:04:20.609> in

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
what's funny is when I saw this in

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.370 
what's funny is when I saw this in
stores<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.239> was<00:04:21.389> like<00:04:21.570> immediately<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.259> was

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
stores I was like immediately I was

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.210 
stores I was like immediately I was
thinking<00:04:22.680> oh<00:04:22.800> man

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
thinking oh man

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.560 
thinking oh man
I<00:04:23.250> could<00:04:23.460> get<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:23.789> much<00:04:23.940> money<00:04:24.090> for<00:04:24.300> this<00:04:24.419> on

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
I could get so much money for this on

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.260 
I could get so much money for this on
eBay<00:04:24.930> but<00:04:25.800> being<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.100> gamer<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.580> kind<00:04:26.940> of<00:04:26.970> a<00:04:27.060> big

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
eBay but being a gamer and kind of a big

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.180 
eBay but being a gamer and kind of a big
nerd<00:04:27.509> I<00:04:27.720> couldn't<00:04:28.020> resist<00:04:28.139> and<00:04:28.650> so<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:28.830> decided

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
nerd I couldn't resist and so I decided

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.219 
nerd I couldn't resist and so I decided
I<00:04:29.639> go<00:04:30.030> ahead<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.180> keep<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:30.479> for<00:04:30.630> myself

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
I go ahead and keep it for myself

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.469 
I go ahead and keep it for myself
so<00:04:31.979> maybe<00:04:32.160> if<00:04:32.310> I<00:04:32.370> see<00:04:32.520> another<00:04:32.729> one<00:04:32.940> maybe<00:04:33.180> I'll

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
so maybe if I see another one maybe I'll

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.659 
so maybe if I see another one maybe I'll
try<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:33.780> make<00:04:33.870> a<00:04:33.930> profit<00:04:34.350> on<00:04:34.440> eBay<00:04:34.830> but<00:04:35.130> we'll

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
try and make a profit on eBay but we'll

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.879 
try and make a profit on eBay but we'll
