today<00:00:03.840> we're<00:00:03.990> gonna<00:00:04.080> be<00:00:04.290> taking<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.650> look<00:00:04.859> at

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
today we're gonna be taking a look at

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.030 
today we're gonna be taking a look at
the<00:00:05.250> octobot<00:00:05.850> by<00:00:06.060> Steve<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.600> Kowski<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.319> we're

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
the octobot by Steve to Kowski and we're

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.700 
the octobot by Steve to Kowski and we're
gonna<00:00:08.370> prepare<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.970> for<00:00:09.240> 3d<00:00:09.690> printing<00:00:10.080> on<00:00:10.349> AF

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
gonna prepare this for 3d printing on AF

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.280 
gonna prepare this for 3d printing on AF
DM<00:00:11.040> or<00:00:11.250> FFF<00:00:11.880> machine<00:00:12.269> if<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.929> were<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.110> try<00:00:13.259> to

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
DM or FFF machine if you were to try to

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.870 
DM or FFF machine if you were to try to
print<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.650> all<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:13.920> one<00:00:14.070> go<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.340> would<00:00:14.730> have

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
print this all in one go you would have

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.700 
print this all in one go you would have
a<00:00:14.910> ton<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.210> support<00:00:15.450> material<00:00:16.139> all<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
a ton of support material all in the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.189 
a ton of support material all in the
inside<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.340> legs<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.690> body<00:00:18.869> and

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
inside of the legs and the body and

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.429 
inside of the legs and the body and
there's<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.980> little<00:00:20.340> camera<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.210> light

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
there's this little camera and a light

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.960 
there's this little camera and a light
thing<00:00:22.439> which<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.920> uh<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.670> lot<00:00:23.880> of

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
thing which is uh just a lot of

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.179 
thing which is uh just a lot of
overhangs<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:25.380> kind<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.680> stressful<00:00:25.920> for

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
overhangs and it's kind of stressful for

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.250 
overhangs and it's kind of stressful for
any<00:00:26.340> printer<00:00:26.760> really<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.840> won't<00:00:28.050> really

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
any printer really and you won't really

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.220 
any printer really and you won't really
get<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> best<00:00:28.769> results<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.660> let's<00:00:30.660> take<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
get the best results so let's take a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.020 
get the best results so let's take a
look<00:00:31.470> at<00:00:31.590> how<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.800> broke<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.279> down<00:00:32.399> already<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
look at how we broke it down already and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.209 
look at how we broke it down already and
we're<00:00:33.660> gonna<00:00:33.780> take<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> look<00:00:34.290> at<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.620> aspect<00:00:34.800> of

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
we're gonna take a look at one aspect of

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.400 
we're gonna take a look at one aspect of
how<00:00:35.340> we<00:00:35.399> achieve<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.050> see<00:00:37.079> that

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
how we achieve this so you can see that

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.680 
how we achieve this so you can see that
we<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:38.070> two<00:00:38.280> three<00:00:38.309> four<00:00:38.670> pieces<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
we have one two three four pieces of the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.229 
we have one two three four pieces of the
character<00:00:40.219> this<00:00:41.219> Lake<00:00:41.489> obviously<00:00:42.030> gets

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
character this Lake obviously gets

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.560 
character this Lake obviously gets
duplicated<00:00:42.660> around<00:00:43.230> eight<00:00:43.440> times<00:00:43.910> and<00:00:44.910> then

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
duplicated around eight times and then

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.930 
duplicated around eight times and then
we<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.780> these<00:00:45.960> little<00:00:46.140> pins<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.860> these<00:00:47.670> pins

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
we have these little pins and these pins

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.860 
we have these little pins and these pins
snap<00:00:48.300> together<00:00:48.600> kind<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.320> toy<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.870> we

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
snap together kind of like a toy and we

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.689 
snap together kind of like a toy and we
have<00:00:51.989> three<00:00:52.199> size<00:00:52.440> pins<00:00:52.800> one<00:00:53.100> small<00:00:53.430> one<00:00:53.579> up

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
have three size pins one small one up

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.689 
have three size pins one small one up
here<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> light<00:00:54.620> one<00:00:55.620> medium<00:00:56.129> sized<00:00:56.370> one

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
here for the light one medium sized one

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
here for the light one medium sized one
one<00:00:57.030> large<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.390> actually<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.170> head<00:00:58.350> so

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
one large one actually for the head so

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.610 
one large one actually for the head so
the<00:00:58.770> head<00:00:58.920> rotates<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the head rotates and and one for the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.930 
the head rotates and and one for the
lake<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.219> we're<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.430> gonna<00:01:02.640> look<00:01:02.820> at

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
lake here so we're just gonna look at

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.990 
lake here so we're just gonna look at
how<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.120> did<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> lake<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> octobot

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
how we did the lake so this is a octobot

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.350 
how we did the lake so this is a octobot
that<00:01:06.270> has<00:01:06.390> not<00:01:06.659> been<00:01:07.549> affected<00:01:08.549> yet<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.240> we're

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that has not been affected yet and we're

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.740 
that has not been affected yet and we're
gonna<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.869> quickly<00:01:10.409> go<00:01:11.189> through<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
gonna just quickly go through the the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.020 
gonna just quickly go through the the
technique<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.490> very<00:01:14.549> similar

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
technique to do this it's very similar

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.320 
technique to do this it's very similar
to<00:01:15.210> making<00:01:15.330> keys<00:01:16.369> I'll<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.150> bit

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
to making keys I'll be it's a bit

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.210 
to making keys I'll be it's a bit
improved<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.680> really<00:01:19.950> cool<00:01:20.159> because

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
improved and it's really cool because

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.020 
improved and it's really cool because
everything<00:01:20.939> snaps<00:01:21.240> together<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.430> what<00:01:23.880> we're

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
everything snaps together so what we're

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.120 
everything snaps together so what we're
gonna<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.689> we're<00:01:24.900> gonna<00:01:24.960> grab<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.950> body

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
gonna do is we're gonna grab the body

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.679 
gonna do is we're gonna grab the body
here<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.640> we're<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:26.790> gonna<00:01:26.970> do<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.509> for

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
here and we're just gonna do the one for

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.090 
here and we're just gonna do the one for
this<00:01:27.780> Lake<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.409> we're<00:01:28.500> gonna<00:01:28.590> hide<00:01:28.860> these

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
this Lake and we're gonna hide these

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.319 
this Lake and we're gonna hide these
guys<00:01:29.369> here<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.909> we're<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.090> gonna

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
guys here so we're just gonna

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.210 
guys here so we're just gonna
concentrate<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.290> section<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:34.220> we're

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
concentrate on this one section so we're

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.999 
concentrate on this one section so we're
gonna<00:01:35.310> use<00:01:35.400> what's<00:01:35.850> called<00:01:35.939> an<00:01:36.180> insert<00:01:36.570> mesh

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
gonna use what's called an insert mesh

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.969 
gonna use what's called an insert mesh
so<00:01:38.150> what<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.329> do<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.600> hit<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> B<00:01:40.140> key<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
so what we do is hit the B key in the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.550 
so what we do is hit the B key in the
eye<00:01:41.009> key<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.899> had<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.229> IMM<00:01:44.159> FDM<00:01:44.670> pin<00:01:44.970> one

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
eye key and we had this IMM FDM pin one

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.319 
eye key and we had this IMM FDM pin one
that<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.649> already<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:47.070> pre-made<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
that we already have pre-made and in a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.819 
that we already have pre-made and in a
later<00:01:48.479> tutorial<00:01:48.750> we'll<00:01:49.200> go<00:01:49.320> through<00:01:49.590> how<00:01:49.799> to

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
later tutorial we'll go through how to

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.160 
later tutorial we'll go through how to
make<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.579> own<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:51.990> see<00:01:52.140> I

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
make one of your own so you can see I

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.330 
make one of your own so you can see I
could<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:52.560> drag<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:53.009> anywhere<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:55.340> what

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
could just drag this anywhere and what

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.440 
could just drag this anywhere and what
we're<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.640> do<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.939> we're<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.210> drag

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
we're going to do is we're going to drag

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.929 
we're going to do is we're going to drag
this<00:01:57.719> right<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.259> center<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:59.420> this<00:02:01.939> you

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
this right in the center of this you

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.660 
this right in the center of this you
know<00:02:03.090> Lake<00:02:03.540> joint<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.500> don't<00:02:05.490> worry<00:02:05.610> about

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
know Lake joint and don't worry about

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.550 
know Lake joint and don't worry about
being<00:02:05.790> exact<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.719> always<00:02:06.899> we<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.259> always

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
being exact we can always we can always

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.800 
being exact we can always we can always
modify<00:02:07.710> word<00:02:08.280> or<00:02:08.580> where<00:02:09.000> exactly<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.599> we're

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
modify word or where exactly it is we're

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.240 
modify word or where exactly it is we're
gonna<00:02:09.899> inset<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.679> all<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.400> way<00:02:11.489> in

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
gonna inset it all the way in

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.840 
gonna inset it all the way in
we're<00:02:12.640> gonna<00:02:12.730> go<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.090> side<00:02:13.300> view<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:14.850> and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
we're gonna go to the side view and and

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.880 
we're gonna go to the side view and and
move<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:16.540> up<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:16.780> we're<00:02:17.170> just<00:02:17.320> gonna<00:02:17.440> push

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
move this up so we're just gonna push

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.640 
move this up so we're just gonna push
that<00:02:18.190> right<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.550> there<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.300> what<00:02:19.480> now<00:02:19.660> we<00:02:20.500> know

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
that right in there so what now we know

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.590 
that right in there so what now we know
this<00:02:20.800> is<00:02:20.920> connecting<00:02:21.430> into<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.730> leg<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:22.330> we<00:02:22.450> got

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
this is connecting into a leg so we got

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.030 
this is connecting into a leg so we got
to<00:02:22.690> make<00:02:22.810> sure<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.380> doesn't<00:02:23.560> stick<00:02:23.890> out

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
to make sure that it doesn't stick out

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.130 
to make sure that it doesn't stick out
and<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.460> actually<00:02:24.640> looks<00:02:24.970> okay<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.930> if<00:02:26.020> you

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
and it actually looks okay and if you

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.990 
and it actually looks okay and if you
hit<00:02:26.200> transparency<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:27.190> can<00:02:27.340> see<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.790> we're

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
hit transparency you can see that we're

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.240 
hit transparency you can see that we're
getting<00:02:28.780> kind<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.290> close<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:29.770> we<00:02:29.890> might<00:02:30.070> want

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
getting kind of close so we might want

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.470 
getting kind of close so we might want
to<00:02:30.310> inset<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.940> just<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.540> little<00:02:31.810> bit<00:02:31.960> more

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
to inset this just a little bit more

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.170 
to inset this just a little bit more
alrighty<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:34.960> looks<00:02:35.110> pretty<00:02:35.200> good<00:02:36.180> and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
alrighty so that looks pretty good and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.000 
alrighty so that looks pretty good and
it<00:02:37.570> doesn't<00:02:37.960> actually<00:02:38.050> matter<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.800> these

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
it doesn't actually matter that these

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.010 
it doesn't actually matter that these
are<00:02:39.190> perfectly<00:02:39.640> Center<00:02:40.090> now<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.480> more<00:02:40.720> center

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
are perfectly Center now the more center

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.860 
are perfectly Center now the more center
the<00:02:41.140> better<00:02:41.350> but<00:02:42.270> that's<00:02:43.270> gonna<00:02:43.510> work<00:02:43.690> out

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
the better but that's gonna work out

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.570 
the better but that's gonna work out
pretty<00:02:44.080> good<00:02:44.260> for<00:02:44.530> us<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.630> if<00:02:46.630> we<00:02:46.810> take<00:02:47.050> this

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
pretty good for us so if we take this

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.610 
pretty good for us so if we take this
this<00:02:48.580> model<00:02:49.000> now<00:02:49.180> we<00:02:49.240> use<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.990> insert<00:02:50.260> mesh<00:02:50.440> so

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
this model now we use the insert mesh so

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.050 
this model now we use the insert mesh so
it's<00:02:50.770> all<00:02:50.890> kind<00:02:51.070> of<00:02:51.100> one<00:02:51.280> polygon<00:02:51.730> we're<00:02:51.940> gonna

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
it's all kind of one polygon we're gonna

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.270 
it's all kind of one polygon we're gonna
clear<00:02:52.390> our<00:02:52.570> mask<00:02:52.930> we're<00:02:53.770> gonna<00:02:53.860> go<00:02:54.040> down<00:02:54.250> here

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
clear our mask we're gonna go down here

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.450 
clear our mask we're gonna go down here
and<00:02:54.520> hit<00:02:54.670> split<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.330> say<00:02:55.570> split<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.020> parts

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
and hit split and say split the parts

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.710 
and hit split and say split the parts
and<00:02:57.460> now<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.730> could<00:02:57.910> see<00:02:57.970> we<00:02:58.210> generated

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
and now you could see we generated

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.660 
and now you could see we generated
actually<00:02:58.930> three<00:02:59.470> new<00:02:59.650> parts<00:02:59.980> we<00:03:00.250> turned<00:03:00.520> it

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
actually three new parts we turned it

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.300 
actually three new parts we turned it
generated<00:03:01.240> to<00:03:01.870> cutter<00:03:02.170> shapes<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.860> then<00:03:03.190> we

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
generated to cutter shapes and then we

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.490 
generated to cutter shapes and then we
have<00:03:03.460> our<00:03:03.640> pin<00:03:03.850> this<00:03:04.690> is<00:03:04.810> our<00:03:04.930> pin<00:03:05.110> that's<00:03:05.320> in

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
have our pin this is our pin that's in

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.740 
have our pin this is our pin that's in
place<00:03:05.740> and<00:03:06.040> in<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.490> correct<00:03:06.760> scale<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.390> it

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
place and in the correct scale and it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.450 
place and in the correct scale and it
already<00:03:07.960> has<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.530> tolerance<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:11.860> so<00:03:12.280> it's

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
already has a tolerance to it so it's

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.190 
already has a tolerance to it so it's
actually<00:03:12.760> slightly<00:03:13.000> smaller<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:13.960> can<00:03:14.050> see

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
actually slightly smaller you can see

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.540 
actually slightly smaller you can see
it's<00:03:14.350> already<00:03:14.440> slightly<00:03:14.890> smaller<00:03:15.220> than<00:03:15.370> the

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
it's already slightly smaller than the

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.430 
it's already slightly smaller than the
cutting<00:03:16.030> shape<00:03:16.239> so<00:03:16.540> it's<00:03:16.660> gonna<00:03:16.780> fit<00:03:17.110> right<00:03:17.320> in

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
cutting shape so it's gonna fit right in

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.400 
cutting shape so it's gonna fit right in
it<00:03:17.530> right<00:03:17.830> in<00:03:17.980> there<00:03:18.100> nicely<00:03:19.020> so<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.200> next

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
it right in there nicely so the next

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.930 
it right in there nicely so the next
step<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:20.860> pretty<00:03:21.160> common<00:03:21.430> one<00:03:21.700> we're<00:03:21.910> just

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
step is a pretty common one we're just

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.780 
step is a pretty common one we're just
gonna<00:03:22.209> boolean<00:03:22.720> out<00:03:23.020> these<00:03:23.350> cutter<00:03:23.950> shapes<00:03:24.040> so

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
gonna boolean out these cutter shapes so

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.660 
gonna boolean out these cutter shapes so
let's<00:03:25.390> go<00:03:25.570> ahead<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.810> select<00:03:26.739> our<00:03:26.890> body<00:03:27.220> here

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
let's go ahead and select our body here

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.940 
let's go ahead and select our body here
and<00:03:28.180> then<00:03:28.810> we're<00:03:28.959> gonna<00:03:29.050> just<00:03:29.440> double<00:03:29.770> check

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
and then we're gonna just double check

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.949 
and then we're gonna just double check
and<00:03:30.130> make<00:03:30.190> sure<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.459> this<00:03:30.850> is<00:03:31.120> ready<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.810> go

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
and make sure that this is ready to go

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.370 
and make sure that this is ready to go
and<00:03:32.290> we're<00:03:32.560> gonna<00:03:32.650> turn<00:03:33.070> on<00:03:33.220> visibility<00:03:34.380> and

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
and we're gonna turn on visibility and

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.910 
and we're gonna turn on visibility and
make<00:03:36.280> sure<00:03:36.400> those<00:03:36.550> are<00:03:36.580> off<00:03:36.820> selected<00:03:37.510> body

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
make sure those are off selected body

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.740 
make sure those are off selected body
and<00:03:38.920> we're<00:03:39.670> gonna<00:03:39.790> hit<00:03:39.940> this<00:03:40.090> little<00:03:40.360> Halfmoon

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
and we're gonna hit this little Halfmoon

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.530 
and we're gonna hit this little Halfmoon
circle<00:03:41.470> here<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:41.970> then<00:03:42.970> we're<00:03:43.090> gonna<00:03:43.180> merge

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
circle here and then we're gonna merge

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.340 
circle here and then we're gonna merge
this<00:03:43.870> down<00:03:44.220> March<00:03:45.220> down<00:03:46.050> and<00:03:47.050> we're<00:03:47.260> gonna

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
this down March down and we're gonna

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.130 
this down March down and we're gonna
redraw<00:03:47.769> our<00:03:48.280> dynamesh<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.390> we'll<00:03:49.840> let<00:03:49.959> that

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
redraw our dynamesh and we'll let that

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.070 
redraw our dynamesh and we'll let that
run<00:03:50.760> alright<00:03:51.760> so<00:03:51.940> that<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.360> all<00:03:52.660> done<00:03:52.870> running

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
run alright so that is all done running

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.530 
run alright so that is all done running
and<00:03:53.410> you<00:03:54.310> can<00:03:54.459> see<00:03:54.610> that<00:03:54.790> we<00:03:54.880> have<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.030> perfectly

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
and you can see that we have a perfectly

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.540 
and you can see that we have a perfectly
cut<00:03:55.720> hole<00:03:56.019> one<00:03:56.650> thing<00:03:56.830> to<00:03:56.920> keep<00:03:57.040> in<00:03:57.160> mind<00:03:57.370> is

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
cut hole one thing to keep in mind is

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.009 
cut hole one thing to keep in mind is
you<00:03:57.670> notice<00:03:57.820> how<00:03:58.030> we<00:03:58.090> put<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.390> flat<00:03:58.630> sides<00:03:58.870> on

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
you notice how we put the flat sides on

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.720 
you notice how we put the flat sides on
the<00:03:59.140> side<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.739> round<00:03:59.920> side<00:04:00.130> this<00:04:00.430> allows

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
the side and the round side this allows

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.759 
the side and the round side this allows
the<00:04:00.850> 3d<00:04:01.120> printer<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.630> gradually<00:04:02.170> build<00:04:02.350> up<00:04:02.590> the

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
the 3d printer to gradually build up the

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.880 
the 3d printer to gradually build up the
top<00:04:02.950> edge<00:04:03.190> here<00:04:04.050> limiting<00:04:05.050> its<00:04:05.230> need<00:04:05.440> for<00:04:05.470> use

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
top edge here limiting its need for use

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.150 
top edge here limiting its need for use
of<00:04:06.070> support<00:04:06.550> if<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.940> flat<00:04:07.180> edge<00:04:07.360> was<00:04:07.660> here<00:04:08.160> it

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
of support if the flat edge was here it

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.740 
of support if the flat edge was here it
would<00:04:09.250> have<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.489> generate<00:04:09.670> this<00:04:10.360> whole<00:04:10.570> edge

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
would have to generate this whole edge

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.620 
would have to generate this whole edge
all<00:04:10.930> at<00:04:11.080> one<00:04:11.230> time<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.800> might<00:04:12.040> have

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
all at one time and you might have

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.500 
all at one time and you might have
drooping<00:04:13.630> or<00:04:13.840> overhang<00:04:14.290> issues<00:04:14.739> so<00:04:15.510> we're

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
drooping or overhang issues so we're

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.699 
drooping or overhang issues so we're
gonna<00:04:16.600> actually<00:04:16.840> do<00:04:17.080> this<00:04:17.230> one<00:04:17.410> more<00:04:17.530> time

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
gonna actually do this one more time

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.080 
gonna actually do this one more time
with<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.070> leg<00:04:18.250> now<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:18.669> we're<00:04:18.760> gonna<00:04:18.850> go<00:04:19.030> ahead

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
with the leg now so we're gonna go ahead

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.789 
with the leg now so we're gonna go ahead
and<00:04:19.180> move<00:04:19.299> this<00:04:19.419> all<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.660> way<00:04:19.750> down<00:04:19.799> we're

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
and move this all the way down we're

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.770 
and move this all the way down we're
gonna<00:04:20.890> select<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.580> leg<00:04:21.789> let's<00:04:22.240> hide<00:04:22.539> that

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
gonna select the leg let's hide that

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.720 
gonna select the leg let's hide that
body<00:04:23.080> real<00:04:23.380> fast

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
body real fast

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.190 
body real fast
we're<00:04:25.000> gonna<00:04:25.090> show<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:25.990> pen<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:28.020> always<00:04:29.020> make

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
we're gonna show the pen and always make

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.500 
we're gonna show the pen and always make
sure<00:04:29.230> that<00:04:29.590> before<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:30.550> dynamesh<00:04:31.240> these

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
sure that before you dynamesh these

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.780 
sure that before you dynamesh these
bullying's<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:32.650> everything<00:04:33.010> is<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.160> solid

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
bullying's is that everything is a solid

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.610 
bullying's is that everything is a solid
polygroup<00:04:34.210> so<00:04:34.420> we're<00:04:34.570> just<00:04:34.600> hitting<00:04:34.750> ctrl<00:04:35.440> W

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
polygroup so we're just hitting ctrl W

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.070 
polygroup so we're just hitting ctrl W
on<00:04:36.100> each<00:04:36.340> one<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:37.510> we're<00:04:37.630> gonna<00:04:37.720> do<00:04:37.960> the

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
on each one and we're gonna do the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.740 
on each one and we're gonna do the
Halfmoon<00:04:38.260> again<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.160> select<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.700> leg<00:04:39.910> and

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
Halfmoon again and select the leg and

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.270 
Halfmoon again and select the leg and
we're<00:04:40.900> gonna<00:04:40.990> merge<00:04:41.320> down<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:42.070> then<00:04:42.160> we're

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
we're gonna merge down and then we're

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.840 
we're gonna merge down and then we're
gonna<00:04:42.370> retain<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:42.850> mesh<00:04:44.460> all<00:04:45.460> right<00:04:45.580> so

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
gonna retain the mesh all right so

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.460 
gonna retain the mesh all right so
that's<00:04:45.970> cut<00:04:46.240> out<00:04:46.270> not<00:04:46.570> too<00:04:46.780> so<00:04:47.080> let's<00:04:47.290> take<00:04:47.440> a

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
that's cut out not too so let's take a

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.500 
that's cut out not too so let's take a
look<00:04:47.620> at<00:04:47.770> what<00:04:47.920> we're<00:04:48.040> left<00:04:48.190> over<00:04:48.550> what<00:04:49.360> we

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
look at what we're left over what we

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.840 
look at what we're left over what we
have<00:04:49.660> left<00:04:49.870> over<00:04:49.990> so<00:04:50.320> we<00:04:50.410> have<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.650> pin<00:04:50.920> and<00:04:51.220> a

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
have left over so we have the pin and a

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.360 
have left over so we have the pin and a
body<00:04:52.060> all<00:04:52.840> done<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.500> it's<00:04:53.950> gonna<00:04:54.070> fit

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
body all done and it's gonna fit

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.510 
body all done and it's gonna fit
together<00:04:54.640> really<00:04:55.030> nicely<00:04:55.480> so<00:04:56.250> let's<00:04:57.250> go<00:04:57.370> and

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
together really nicely so let's go and

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.670 
together really nicely so let's go and
just<00:04:57.640> we'll<00:04:57.880> just<00:04:57.910> move<00:04:58.270> this<00:04:58.390> out<00:04:58.680> for

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
just we'll just move this out for

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.410 
just we'll just move this out for
presentation<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:02.610> you<00:05:03.610> could<00:05:03.760> see<00:05:03.970> how<00:05:04.270> this

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
presentation and you could see how this

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.000 
presentation and you could see how this
is<00:05:04.600> all<00:05:04.750> gonna<00:05:04.960> kind<00:05:05.230> of<00:05:05.290> fit<00:05:05.470> together<00:05:05.590> so

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
is all gonna kind of fit together so

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.490 
is all gonna kind of fit together so
let's<00:05:06.160> turn<00:05:06.340> off<00:05:06.460> transparency<00:05:07.240> and<00:05:07.570> that's

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
let's turn off transparency and that's

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.670 
let's turn off transparency and that's
one<00:05:08.710> leg<00:05:08.920> done<00:05:09.510> so<00:05:10.510> in<00:05:10.930> the<00:05:11.050> future<00:05:11.260> we<00:05:11.530> would

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
one leg done so in the future we would

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.500 
one leg done so in the future we would
have<00:05:11.800> done<00:05:11.920> all<00:05:12.130> of<00:05:12.160> these<00:05:12.610> at<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.000> same<00:05:13.210> time

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
have done all of these at the same time

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.590 
have done all of these at the same time
and<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:16.210> then<00:05:16.360> we<00:05:16.510> would<00:05:16.690> have<00:05:16.840> just<00:05:17.050> been

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
and and then we would have just been

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.000 
and and then we would have just been
saving<00:05:19.600> ourself<00:05:19.960> a<00:05:20.020> little<00:05:20.050> bit<00:05:20.350> of<00:05:20.410> time<00:05:20.590> we

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
saving ourself a little bit of time we

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.210 
saving ourself a little bit of time we
could<00:05:21.160> use<00:05:21.280> radial<00:05:21.700> symmetry<00:05:21.880> for<00:05:22.300> that<00:05:22.450> and

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
could use radial symmetry for that and

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.410 
could use radial symmetry for that and
that's<00:05:24.220> pretty<00:05:24.550> much<00:05:24.670> the<00:05:24.850> method<00:05:25.180> that<00:05:25.300> we

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
that's pretty much the method that we

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.900 
that's pretty much the method that we
use<00:05:25.450> to<00:05:25.840> break<00:05:26.050> down<00:05:26.350> this<00:05:26.680> octopi

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
use to break down this octopi
