00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
about the quality and stuff lately of my

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.450 
about the quality and stuff lately of my
camera<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.930> lot<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.170> confusion<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.160> stuff

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.389 
camera and a lot of confusion and stuff
yeah<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.570> now<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.750> kind<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.440> figured<00:00:43.920> out<00:00:44.070> all

yeah but now I kind of figured out all
the<00:00:44.550> things<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.210> my<00:00:45.329> camera<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> thought<00:00:46.289> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the things on my camera so I thought I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.860 
the things on my camera so I thought I
could<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.070> review<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.030> tell<00:00:48.780> you

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
could do a review on it and tell you

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.920 
could do a review on it and tell you
some<00:00:49.079> things<00:00:49.379> about<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.570> by<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.629> way<00:00:51.750> I'm

to<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.320> full<00:01:07.860> HD<00:01:09.229> 1080p<00:01:10.229> HD<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.070> believe<00:01:11.369> and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
to be in full HD 1080p HD I believe and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.020 
to be in full HD 1080p HD I believe and
I<00:01:11.729> cannot<00:01:12.689> do<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.900> when<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.320> edit<00:01:13.590> my<00:01:13.619> videos

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
I cannot do that when I edit my videos

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.719 
I cannot do that when I edit my videos
because<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.540> will<00:01:15.750> tell<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.140> now<00:01:16.350> why<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
because I will tell you now why the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.219 
because I will tell you now why the
first<00:01:17.970> videos<00:01:18.509> are<00:01:18.659> made<00:01:18.750> with<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.020> camera

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
first videos are made with this camera

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.700 
first videos are made with this camera
were<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:20.100> bad<00:01:20.549> quality<00:01:21.200> this<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> reason

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
were just bad quality this is the reason

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.770 
were just bad quality this is the reason
so<00:01:23.340> um<00:01:23.810> basically<00:01:24.810> my<00:01:25.500> computer<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.780> very

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
so um basically my computer is not very

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.920 
so um basically my computer is not very
good<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.310> doesn't<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.700> enough<00:01:29.970> room<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
good like it doesn't have enough room to

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.920 
good like it doesn't have enough room to
save<00:01:31.259> HD<00:01:31.740> videos<00:01:32.070> because<00:01:32.460> HD<00:01:33.090> videos<00:01:33.450> take<00:01:33.780> up

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
save HD videos because HD videos take up

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.230 
save HD videos because HD videos take up
a<00:01:34.049> lot<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.290> room<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.890> your<00:01:35.460> computer<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:35.939> they

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
a lot of room in your computer and they

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.109 
a lot of room in your computer and they
also<00:01:36.420> take<00:01:36.810> forever<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.619> upload<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.579> want<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
also take forever to upload so I want to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.210 
also take forever to upload so I want to
keep<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.420> video<00:01:39.720> kind<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.229> short<00:01:40.590> because<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
keep this video kind of short because it

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.940 
keep this video kind of short because it
just<00:01:41.400> takes<00:01:41.610> forever<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.090> upload<00:01:42.150> like<00:01:42.659> I

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
just takes forever to upload like I

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.990 
just takes forever to upload like I
uploaded<00:01:44.180> one<00:01:45.180> video<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.860> less<00:01:47.460> than<00:01:47.670> 4

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
uploaded one video of like less than 4

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.539 
uploaded one video of like less than 4
minutes<00:01:48.390> once<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.500> took<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.920> more<00:01:50.430> than

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
minutes once and it took like more than

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609 
minutes once and it took like more than
an<00:01:50.670> hour<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.060> upload<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.899> wasn't<00:01:52.049> for<00:01:52.290> HD

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
an hour to upload and it wasn't for HD

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.649 
an hour to upload and it wasn't for HD
and<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.829> did<00:01:53.009> not<00:01:53.189> edit<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.729> stuff<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.090> yeah

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
and I did not edit it and stuff so yeah

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.240 
and I did not edit it and stuff so yeah
but<00:01:54.930> my<00:01:55.079> computer<00:01:55.350> doesn't<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.740> enough<00:01:56.009> room

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250

be<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.430> lot<00:03:32.670> better<00:03:32.880> so<00:03:33.240> I<00:03:33.270> finally<00:03:33.600> did<00:03:34.140> that

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
be a lot better so I finally did that

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.230 
be a lot better so I finally did that
you<00:03:34.770> know<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:34.890> finally<00:03:35.280> figured<00:03:35.580> out<00:03:35.700> how<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:35.940> do

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
you know I finally figured out how to do

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.900 
you know I finally figured out how to do
that<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:37.350> I<00:03:37.380> could<00:03:37.710> do<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.430> then<00:03:38.820> I

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
that and that I could do that and then I

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.090 
that and that I could do that and then I
did<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:40.230> basically<00:03:40.560> made<00:03:40.950> my

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
did that and that basically made my

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.520 
did that and that basically made my
videos<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.400> lot<00:03:41.580> better<00:03:41.820> quality<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:42.840> yeah<00:03:43.320> but

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
videos a lot better quality so yeah but

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.220 
videos a lot better quality so yeah but
they<00:03:43.850> pretty<00:03:44.850> much<00:03:44.970> all<00:03:45.240> my<00:03:45.420> videos<00:03:45.690> too<00:03:46.020> are

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
they pretty much all my videos too are

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.570 
they pretty much all my videos too are
not<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.740> Full<00:03:47.040> HD

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
not in Full HD

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.520
