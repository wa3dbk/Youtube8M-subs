actually<00:06:27.260> it's<00:06:27.800> weird<00:06:28.340> to<00:06:28.490> see<00:06:28.669> what's<00:06:28.880> in

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
actually it's weird to see what's in

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.580 
actually it's weird to see what's in
people's<00:06:29.270> handbags<00:06:29.900> I<00:06:30.169> think<00:06:30.380> it's<00:06:30.500> only

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
people's handbags I think it's only

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.250 
people's handbags I think it's only
something<00:06:31.099> that<00:06:31.280> like<00:06:31.520> a<00:06:31.550> girl<00:06:31.910> could<00:06:32.270> look<00:06:33.050> at

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 
something that like a girl could look at

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.990 
something that like a girl could look at
and<00:06:33.440> understand<00:06:33.979> but<00:06:34.340> I<00:06:34.400> find<00:06:34.729> it<00:06:34.880> really

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
and understand but I find it really

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.770 
and understand but I find it really
interesting<00:06:35.120> so<00:06:35.810> thank<00:06:36.349> you<00:06:36.470> so<00:06:36.560> much
