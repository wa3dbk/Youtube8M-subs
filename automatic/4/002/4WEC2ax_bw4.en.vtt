00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
my words that there'll probably be a few

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.460 
my words that there'll probably be a few
curses<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.470> review<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.600> why<00:00:18.600> well

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
curses in this review and why well

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.529 
curses in this review and why well
because<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> review<00:00:20.369> about<00:00:20.539> pirates

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
because this is a review about pirates

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.170 
because this is a review about pirates
of<00:00:21.810> dark<00:00:22.199> water<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.789> you<00:00:23.789> know<00:00:23.910> there's<00:00:24.090> a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
of dark water and you know there's a

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.120 
of dark water and you know there's a
reason<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> expression<00:00:25.289> like<00:00:26.039> you

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
reason we have the expression like you

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.620 
reason we have the expression like you
know<00:00:26.250> more<00:00:26.460> custom<00:00:26.939> than<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> bucket<00:00:27.420> full<00:00:27.570> of

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
know more custom than a bucket full of

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.200 
know more custom than a bucket full of
pirates<00:00:28.160> because<00:00:29.160> pirates<00:00:29.640> like<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.000> curse

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
pirates because pirates like to curse

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.260 
pirates because pirates like to curse
and<00:00:30.570> you're<00:00:31.470> probably<00:00:31.710> thinking<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.759> Dave

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
and you're probably thinking but Dave

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.810 
and you're probably thinking but Dave
like<00:00:34.050> pirates<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.920> dark<00:00:35.100> water<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.670> was<00:00:35.760> a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
like pirates of dark water that was a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.270 
like pirates of dark water that was a
great<00:00:36.180> kids<00:00:36.750> show<00:00:37.079> they<00:00:37.350> don't<00:00:37.469> curse<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:37.890> that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
great kids show they don't curse in that

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.389 
great kids show they don't curse in that
and<00:00:39.140> you're<00:00:40.140> kind<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.680> right<00:00:40.890> they<00:00:41.219> don't

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
and you're kind of right they don't

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.150 
and you're kind of right they don't
curse<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.850> English<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:43.290> that's<00:00:43.800> sort<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
curse in English but that's sort of the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.000 
curse in English but that's sort of the
beauty<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.700> writing<00:00:45.539> scripts<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.410> kids<00:00:46.680> shows

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
beauty of writing scripts for kids shows

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.060 
beauty of writing scripts for kids shows
is<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:48.050> very<00:00:49.050> often<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:49.890> write

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
is that very often you can just write

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.529 
is that very often you can just write
whatever<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.700> want<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.270> made-up<00:00:51.510> language

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
whatever you want in a made-up language

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.720 
whatever you want in a made-up language
and<00:00:53.510> sometimes<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.140> curses<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:55.890> in

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and sometimes it can be curses like in

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.750 
and sometimes it can be curses like in
the<00:00:56.850> case<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.410> pirates<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.530> dark<00:00:58.770> water<00:00:58.829> they

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the case of pirates of dark water they

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.240 
the case of pirates of dark water they
this<00:01:00.239> takes<00:01:00.480> place<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> alien<00:01:01.649> world<00:01:01.949> of

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
this takes place on the alien world of

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.670 
this takes place on the alien world of
mer<00:01:02.930> where<00:01:03.930> everyone<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.460> world<00:01:05.670> arm<00:01:06.680> has

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
mer where everyone in the world arm has

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
some sailing knowledge and I guess the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.000 
some sailing knowledge and I guess the
entire<00:01:10.500> world<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.159> constructed<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.790> sort<00:01:12.180> of

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
cuz this the whole premise like i said

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.220 
cuz this the whole premise like i said
is<00:04:17.070> just<00:04:17.220> everyone's<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.850> pirate<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:18.900> know

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
is just everyone's a pirate you know

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
don't have to give it a time period

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.980 
don't have to give it a time period

just people evolved on mer looking like

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.790 
just people evolved on mer looking like
humans<00:04:58.080> but<00:04:58.949> um<00:04:59.510> you<00:05:00.510> know<00:05:00.630> they<00:05:00.840> can't<00:05:01.110> hold

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
humans but um you know they can't hold

humans but um you know they can't hold
their<00:05:01.979> breath<00:05:02.190> for<00:05:02.220> that<00:05:02.490> long<00:05:02.729> and<00:05:03.090> they

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
their breath for that long and they

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.540 
their breath for that long and they
can't<00:05:03.449> breathe<00:05:03.660> underwater<00:05:03.860> but<00:05:04.860> instead<00:05:05.190> of

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
can't breathe underwater but instead of

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.390 
can't breathe underwater but instead of
developing<00:05:06.240> these<00:05:06.840> uh<00:05:06.900> you<00:05:07.620> know<00:05:07.710> aqualungs

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
developing these uh you know aqualungs

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.420 
developing these uh you know aqualungs
or<00:05:08.850> little<00:05:09.750> scuba<00:05:10.080> diving<00:05:10.410> outfits<00:05:10.800> they

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
or little scuba diving outfits they

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.580 
or little scuba diving outfits they
actually<00:05:11.760> do<00:05:12.090> use<00:05:12.270> science<00:05:12.900> they've

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
actually do use science they've

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.409 
actually do use science they've
discovered<00:05:14.130> that<00:05:14.340> there<00:05:14.520> is<00:05:14.610> a<00:05:14.639> specific<00:05:14.880> fish

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
discovered that there is a specific fish

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.469 
discovered that there is a specific fish
that<00:05:15.750> kind<00:05:15.990> of<00:05:16.050> resembles<00:05:16.440> a<00:05:16.500> cephalopod<00:05:16.889> and

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
that kind of resembles a cephalopod and

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.080 
that kind of resembles a cephalopod and
hum<00:05:18.479> that<00:05:19.320> I<00:05:19.350> guess<00:05:19.710> pumps<00:05:20.010> oxygen<00:05:20.310> and<00:05:20.940> they

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
hum that I guess pumps oxygen and they

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.570 
hum that I guess pumps oxygen and they
stick<00:05:21.479> those<00:05:21.690> on<00:05:21.900> their<00:05:22.050> face<00:05:22.320> and<00:05:22.620> the

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
stick those on their face and the

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.100 
stick those on their face and the
creature<00:05:23.820> instinctually<00:05:24.449> wraps<00:05:24.870> its

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
creature instinctually wraps its

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.350 
creature instinctually wraps its
tentacles<00:05:25.590> around<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.250> then<00:05:26.850> suddenly<00:05:27.210> they

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
tentacles around and then suddenly they

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.560 
tentacles around and then suddenly they
just<00:05:27.539> have<00:05:27.750> this<00:05:28.130> brilliant<00:05:29.130> a<00:05:29.370> scuba<00:05:30.240> diving

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
just have this brilliant a scuba diving

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.120 
just have this brilliant a scuba diving
apparatus<00:05:30.690> that<00:05:31.200> just<00:05:31.380> lets<00:05:31.560> them<00:05:31.830> breathe

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
apparatus that just lets them breathe

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.820 
apparatus that just lets them breathe
while<00:05:32.520> they're<00:05:32.700> swimming<00:05:32.910> underwater

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
while they're swimming underwater

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.029 
while they're swimming underwater
science<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:35.400> biology<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.750> so<00:05:37.650> this<00:05:37.830> is<00:05:38.010> a

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
science and biology and so this is a

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.510 
science and biology and so this is a
science<00:05:38.460> fiction<00:05:38.639> show<00:05:39.120> that<00:05:40.220> doesn't<00:05:41.220> really

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
science fiction show that doesn't really

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.750 
science fiction show that doesn't really
have<00:05:41.849> any<00:05:42.210> elements<00:05:42.840> of<00:05:43.020> science<00:05:43.500> fiction<00:05:43.860> it

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
have any elements of science fiction it

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.469 
have any elements of science fiction it
seems<00:05:45.000> we<00:05:45.120> primarily<00:05:45.360> fantasy<00:05:46.289> but<00:05:47.300> there<00:05:48.300> is

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
seems we primarily fantasy but there is

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.000 
seems we primarily fantasy but there is
a<00:05:48.510> lot<00:05:48.750> going<00:05:48.810> on<00:05:49.139> in<00:05:49.200> this<00:05:49.380> show<00:05:49.620> and<00:05:49.860> it's

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
a lot going on in this show and it's

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.800 
a lot going on in this show and it's
brilliant<00:05:50.580> you've<00:05:50.700> got<00:05:50.880> the<00:05:51.030> evil<00:05:51.389> pirate
