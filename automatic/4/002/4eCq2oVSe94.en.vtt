00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.420
 polar welcome to this new virus detailed windows server 2003 my name 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.789
 He is setting up pérez and then we will learn to communicate the policies 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.740
 both the group and the coach of windows server 2003 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:15.570
 this practice 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.400
 it will be very fun 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.470
 The first thing we are going to do is take the lmc well 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.759
 lying mostly as soon 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.189
 mmc 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.479
 and we forget 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:31.489
 said in as much 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.250
 isma same here 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.570
 a tormo that is the pdi 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.880
 and we look for the corresponding option 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.030
 we think we have here 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.430
 group nisa and daddy dictates a lot that I did not want to touch meet 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.200
 Wolves 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.260
 and the quintet that has been revealed 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.410
 and we can double click on 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.300
 we expanded 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.710
 the different actions that appear in this sale 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.930
 ap michael vick in metz will specifically show us different locations 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.500
 within our operating system where we can establish and expose 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.870
 set in politics regarding the bread 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.430
 We criticize below control panel 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.430
 we can center for functionalities that d 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.720
 if we want even half the legal altuna access we can then and the factory 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.830
 accessible with sor juana 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.830
 let's see why and we are so good 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.160
 often be clarified 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.180
 busti 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.180
 and they are automatically imputed to the fields 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.410
 we see that we have access sanz have also been executed 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.300
 we wait for them to run 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.640
 and what we do has made a decision aa 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.450
 2 elements that are inside the complex as well as the policies is 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.930
 to extinguish parties those seats in the operating system directory 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.520
 as we just saw if we can and by the bloc there was also 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.690
 from this 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.690
 be able to share the terrestrial network tdt 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:09.579
 let's monitor 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.609
 we get to nobody 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.349
 the meeting 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.600
 and so on we can go configuring repressing 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.200
 i this will improve security in backed down 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.549
 We can do this through the windows of the group when my son is united. 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.629
 we are going to go to express proposal but first of all I recommend that you have the 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:32.319
 tournament 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.519
 a torrent and point 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.469
 donnet 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.299
 from x point efe he wants now but he comes and he 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.170
 dt at this point in this regard are just that happening because why 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.169
 successfully we can make the Italian team 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.170
 I strongly recommend that you see that you take the trouble to go back to 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.150
 charge that is not in the principle of agreement just as its 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.200
 served 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.940
 well it happened ok operating system amused charitable Spaniards in 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.669
 Spanish 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.669
 sister and later this year English 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.029
 to modify the group policy sos ap 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:10.539
 being able to be 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:11.679
 the right 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:13.189
 a little nervous 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.189
 the problem 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.059
 admit discussion 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.609
 and we look 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.369
 you put the country 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.369
 in the assembly the expert 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.179
 and I do not want to disappear you our domain 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:34.690
 point with all the publications written by john 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.649
 to create 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:39.819
 a new policy we simply select foal dominated a unit 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.789
 organizational we right click 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.359
 and we select below 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.729
 can here all right 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:51.069
 the president mentality we have a man we already know 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.169
 iberia has could we have 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.169
 several parties created 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.439
 modify certain policies within what is 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.509
 min 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:03.749
 all domain 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:07.979
 simply the iam you re-publish let's go for example 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:09.809
 soon 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:11.989
 i the sample that has already done 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.729
 measure 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:17.309
 i will automatically appear the same window 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:19.949
 the representative of mourinho 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.469
 we want to open the lead which added that the panel again 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.289
 milagros added 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.139
 already at the domain level 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.210
 no organizational renegade has such a policy 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.439
 by then 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.439
 none of its subway users of that organizational unit will be able to access 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.710
 those in the bread 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.749
 I will be here 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:52.749
 I will show how to clean one of these 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:54.680
 policies 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.870
 ap a corresponding unit 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.410
 is the one that is shown we just grab for example one of them that 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.979
 It will always be again 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.610
 i work to live 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.629
 let's see why 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:10.229
 and let's see how incredible because among the PRD senators we 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.560
 presents as a shock 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.479
 that is, a shortcut 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.589
 and is that here is mistreated there was previous of all this super here 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:19.389
 it is to fight 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.979
 will whistle major groups of undocumented in the folder 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.099
 will initially be added to overcome their respective corresponding 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.590
 if it is that not only as users as managers do we make a disaster, 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.569
 policies 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.499
 i do not know what to do I am recommending a father in the attacks 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.249
 to be a bank of the policies simply 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:43.110
 we select the 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.110
 the collective or labor and private policy 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:47.740
 we arrived 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.029
 apply done we arrive at paco cao 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:55.099
 We leave it a description and select that for example we 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.110
 we want to create work 4 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.139
 let's see something that is not little besides, listen to us 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.089
 finished the work the motion 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:07.249
 now if for example how you literally wanted a pan you want to establish 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:08.009
 again 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.569
 per cent the functionality that had prohibited area of ​​Beijing are implemented 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:12.229
 age 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:13.580
 and I have done 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.580
 the statue 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:19.809
 percent before 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:21.339
 and it is already 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.339
 for example the one that we create well is going to put worse 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.550
 let's see why in addition the dgt 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.880
 it will be giving the policies 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.090
 mens 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.150
 man 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.760
 this is extremely fun since 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.050
 you will have fun complicated because cheerful what teenagers access well 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.050
 the legislator of the pro of the organizational unit 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.840
 we also seek to add certain permissions 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.249
 this is how users are about such policies 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:53.759
 so for example of bouquets 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.409
 this policy 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:58.939
 We are here as the hearing loss we lost 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.590
 after two or three percent planned to modify the supervisor 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.249
 we have 

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:09.579
 twitter and 6 eriksen and that the team from Seville can do it because 

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:10.649
 simply law 

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:12.819
 but not so the users 

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:14.020
 will have 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.969
 these permits 

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:21.249
 starting in 2003 I hope you have learned quite loved 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:23.969
 bless you abundant mikati
