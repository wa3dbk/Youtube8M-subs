00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:02.170
 the agent 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.410
 our subject today respiratory physiology more precisely to 14 in 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.709
 that despite 14 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:09.050
 the gas exchange 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.400
 is the exchange of cassettes by the actor ie the capture of oxygen and the 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.390
 release of carbon dioxide ring for kleberson 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.109
 when we breathe in the oxygen pressure in the alveolar air is much greater 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.460
 What's the damn page of our times what happens 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.079
 the blood stream diffused and the hemoglobin of the 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.030
 called basket to capture it forming what we call hypothesis I go with 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.010
 obina 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.920
 will get out of the lung will reach our tissues fly 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.840
 the air pressure on our site is infinitely greater than in our 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.720
 cells that that is the correct pressure difference causes that by 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.510
 if it only loosens from hemoglobin if it diffuses plots happens that part of 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.950
 his thesis comes is not released because the affinity hemoglobin is very 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.420
 large in contrast we have a very high pressure of carbon dioxide 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.850
 intense within ours that is the spirit of cellular metabolism he 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.300
 then spreads to the classic 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.220
 part of it combines with hemoglobin that released the voice of jane forming finish 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.660
 the bologna 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.310
 occurs that the large volume of co2 will react chemically with water through 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.410
 of a reaction of an enzyme called carbonic charity producing acid 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.330
 carbonic 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.180
 as it is one day he released the hydrogen and ammunition 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.120
 forming double bicornornato 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.960
 this ionized hydrogen will be captured by hemoglobin and there it is 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.930
 an oil 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.840
 by doing this there in the blow on the loose that eliot suggests that she still did not have the 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.670
 which we call residual oxygen I am deciding then it will be diffused 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.560
 we seemed to be commenting on the concentration of oxygen in the tissues 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.080
 and consequently to work 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.740
 our body besides carrying your a 2 it gathers the useful to the pleasant 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.530
 ie it forming two compounds that there is in bovine tallow is reduced and the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.810
 bicarbonate as a system so paulo and with it he controls our foot hcb 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.570
