00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.940
 The continuation of dragon ball depends on

 truth was already confirmed. 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.130

 continuation of dragon ball z of tokyo

 which was a continuation will be a 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.470
 confirmation of the continuation of a 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.790
 The motivation that I understood was clear but 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.980
 what's it all that's going on 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.110
 There, the news is there. 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.280
 Saying that it's confirmed, there are already people. 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.319
 talking how is this new? 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.520
 There are people asking what they are going to be 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.800
 professionals, what's the story? 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.290
 what is going on the internet what is 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.680
 happened is that in the version of lax the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.209
 deluxe box dvd and blu-ray to give 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.910
 voice and b of the cup was released in Japan 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.610
 came the message written by the 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.220
 akira toriyama on his participation 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.349
 in the production of the film dragonball symbiosis 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.959
 among other things he talks about the 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.610
 coconut fact did not win the battle 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.710
 against 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.660
 he said that it was necessary because 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.840
 that it was necessary to keep the rumor of 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.640
 that business is the most powerful being in the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.560
 galaxy of the universe then I hope to be 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.110
 maintained for this or to win the battle 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.210
 then he says that by doing this he 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.550
 incorporated into the film a message that 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.730
 displays achieve future goals provoked 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.890
 and then he ends the message by saying 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.660
 dragon ball will not end 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.709
 summarizing if you noticed that dragon 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.950
 ball z bed of both leaves many holes 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.060
 for continuations is because this really 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.709
 was the goal 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.750
 makes these gaps clear to 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.560
 It follows that in any case 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:30.120
 moment he said come a continuation 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.370
 ball is retaining continuation 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.410
 robot in no time he said 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.380
 that some continuation is confirmed 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.950
 or who will have a new saga or who 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.300
 nothing ever confused, senate confirmed 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.790
 basically said that we already knew 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.640
 what dragon ball z best of god has 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.459
 gaps to continue the difference 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.090
 novelty is that he made a point of leaving 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:57.180
 clear good dragon will not end 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.459
 stutter stolen will not end 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.920
 that is, although the information is real 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.230
 is not official since it has not been 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.600
 an ad for nothing and 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.269
 simply said that there are 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.519
 loopholes and said it was good will not 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.160
 but it was not a confirmation 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.410
 official of something that will see 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.019
 last date has no format has nothing 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.090
 it was only to understand that they 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.490
 What does he mean? What does he think? 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.400
 made it clear here they dictate the loopholes 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.500
 for new stories and that gave a 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.850
 hit already and continue said it was good 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.470
 It will not end then I said dragon. 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.090
 ball will continue now how much and how 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.580
 people will only know the next episodes 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.400
 You will only really know when 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.140
 official information that is going to 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.300
 a new movie that will have a new series 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.650
 co deer that will be will be sent 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.220
 It can be a manga. 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.220
 I think that's it 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.730
 drugs if the crime is here until the 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:05.169
 next video on the way home one 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:05.169
 I is bye embrace was nÃ³is and f out such 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:16.520
 I'm not a little bit and it's starting. 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:19.400
 another blog is a case of the exchange today as 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.569
