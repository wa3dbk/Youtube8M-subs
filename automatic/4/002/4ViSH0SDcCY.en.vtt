00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
were doing is we were kind of making

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.340 
were doing is we were kind of making
this<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.340> more<00:00:35.579> real<00:00:35.940> animal<00:00:36.390> at<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.809> same<00:00:37.079> time

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
this a more real animal at the same time

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.860 
this a more real animal at the same time
making<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.160> slightly<00:00:38.399> human<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.450> was<00:00:39.570> kind

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
making it slightly human so it was kind

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.020 
making it slightly human so it was kind
of<00:00:39.960> something<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.320> could<00:00:40.530> relate<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.850> for

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
of something you could relate to so for

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.420 
of something you could relate to so for
instance<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.960> eyes<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.649> were<00:00:43.739> introducing<00:00:44.340> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
instance the eyes we were introducing a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.799 
instance the eyes we were introducing a
bit<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.640> white<00:00:44.879> around<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.390> edge<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.719> eyes

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
bit of white around the edge of the eyes

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.930 
bit of white around the edge of the eyes
like<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.320> that's<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.680> very<00:00:46.890> human<00:00:47.100> thing<00:00:47.280> in

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
like you do that's a very human thing in

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
like you do that's a very human thing in
that<00:00:48.090> way<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.480> kind<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.750> get<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
that way you can kind of get the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.360 
that way you can kind of get the
direction<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.500> he<00:00:49.590> was<00:00:49.739> looking<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
direction that he was looking in and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.130 
direction that he was looking in and
kind<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.610> emphasized<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.480> what<00:00:51.870> he<00:00:51.960> may<00:00:52.110> be

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
kind of emphasized with what he may be

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.779 
kind of emphasized with what he may be
thinking<00:00:52.649> at<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> time<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.309> kind<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.640> good

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
thinking at the time it's kind of a good

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.240 
thinking at the time it's kind of a good
way<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.000> portraying<00:00:54.420> emotions<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.829> had<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> lot

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
way of portraying emotions we had a lot

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.310 
way of portraying emotions we had a lot
of<00:00:56.280> references<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.850> George<00:00:57.030> Clooney<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:58.199> we

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
of references of George Clooney so we

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.410 
of references of George Clooney so we
actually<00:00:58.440> reference<00:00:58.980> his<00:00:59.789> eyes<00:01:00.030> when<00:01:00.300> we're

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
actually reference his eyes when we're

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.760 
actually reference his eyes when we're
doing<00:01:00.510> Paddington<00:01:01.079> because<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.320> felt<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
doing Paddington because we felt like it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.229 
doing Paddington because we felt like it
was<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.920> head<00:01:02.070> starting<00:01:02.460> giving<00:01:02.730> him<00:01:02.850> some<00:01:03.090> nice

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
was a head starting giving him some nice

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.929 
was a head starting giving him some nice
warm<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.780> character<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.610> they<00:01:05.610> were<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
warm and character to it they were a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.000 
warm and character to it they were a
painting<00:01:06.450> pattern<00:01:06.750> basically<00:01:07.020> Mario<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:07.799> our

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
painting pattern basically Mario was our

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.490 
painting pattern basically Mario was our
primary<00:01:08.310> paint<00:01:08.640> package<00:01:09.170> it's<00:01:10.170> kind<00:01:10.439> of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
primary paint package it's kind of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.590 
primary paint package it's kind of
changed<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> way<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.340> texture<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.210> well<00:01:12.240> too

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
changed the way we texture as well too

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.080 
changed the way we texture as well too
it's<00:01:12.750> change<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.740> workflow<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> pipeline

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it's change the workflow in the pipeline

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.140 
it's change the workflow in the pipeline
within<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.960> company<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.500> well<00:01:16.610> it<00:01:17.610> allows<00:01:17.820> for

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
within the company as well it allows for

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.469 
within the company as well it allows for
more<00:01:18.210> complex<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.170> more<00:01:19.979> detailed<00:01:20.970> textures

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
more complex and more detailed textures

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.660 
more complex and more detailed textures
you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:21.990> break<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.320> object<00:01:23.130> your<00:01:23.310> model

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you can break your object your model

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.270 
you can break your object your model
into<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.659> many<00:01:24.869> UV<00:01:25.259> tiles<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.710> they<00:01:25.830> need<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
into as many UV tiles as they need to to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.039 
into as many UV tiles as they need to to
get<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> resolution<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.090> need<00:01:27.390> there's<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
get the resolution you need there's a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.350 
get the resolution you need there's a
whole<00:01:28.290> slew<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.710> other<00:01:28.920> things<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:30.090> use

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
whole slew of other things that we use

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.179 
whole slew of other things that we use
in<00:01:30.600> my<00:01:30.780> eye<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.960> especially<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.680> Paddington

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
in my eye that especially on Paddington

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.890 
in my eye that especially on Paddington
that<00:01:32.460> helped<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.970> lot<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.299> procedurals

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that helped a lot of the procedurals

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.140 
that helped a lot of the procedurals
using<00:01:34.470> procedural<00:01:34.950> filters<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.759> generate

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
using procedural filters to generate

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
well has always been stuff that we

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.050 
well has always been stuff that we
