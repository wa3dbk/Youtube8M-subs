question<00:01:29.210> right<00:01:29.420> now<00:01:29.450> I'm<00:01:29.659> understudying<00:01:30.290> a

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
question right now I'm understudying a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.940 
question right now I'm understudying a
lot<00:01:30.770> of<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.040> aisle<00:01:31.760> 8<00:01:31.909> I'm<00:01:32.840> another<00:01:33.680> one<00:01:33.920> I

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
lot of the aisle 8 I'm another one I

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:42.290 
lot of the aisle 8 I'm another one I
have

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.490 

this<00:01:42.990> theory<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.740> practical<00:01:44.670> real<00:01:45.540> case

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
this theory is practical real case

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.890 
this theory is practical real case
examples<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.460> everything<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.300> I<00:01:48.330> think<00:01:48.690> it's

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
examples and everything so I think it's

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.770 
examples and everything so I think it's
just<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.800> different<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.520> guess<00:01:51.150> with<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
just so different I guess with the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.140 
just so different I guess with the
lecture<00:01:52.050> as<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:52.650> bring<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:53.010> closer<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.090> you

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
lecture as they bring you closer so you

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.300 
lecture as they bring you closer so you
have<00:01:54.480> ducked<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.230> you're<00:01:55.440> doing<00:01:55.800> it<00:01:56.010> like

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
have ducked so what you're doing it like

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.490 
have ducked so what you're doing it like
something<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.910> have<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> passion<00:01:57.330> for<00:01:57.600> when
