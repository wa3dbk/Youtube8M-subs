00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.700
 because it can be the goal to give it a 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.400
 Team triumph and happy because it 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.960
 played very well on a court that was like 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.519
 very impossible to play and we did it 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.500
 this goal but that can highlight the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.840
 match like it was some teammate who 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.580
 I also had a good performance 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.350
 and I think all had a good 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.789
 performance that's why you could win is 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.240
 means to you without a river fan 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.850
 by mouth in yellow house after 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.070
 also the first one also won if 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.949
 it means a lot because we know what it is 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.659
 the rival of us so he puts me 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.159
 very happy to be able to make a goal 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:39.510
 is what I needed that was 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.460
 waiting he has in mind that he ends 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.839
 this changing step playing headline 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.879
 then maybe you had to go down to 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.100
 save but cute what happens to you now 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.750
 if it says the cute one because when it goes down 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.850
 wants to play and I want to do it from the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.769
 better way and provide the best to 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.570
 team so happy about that 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.220
 you had some slump or something having in 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.040
 account that good that he had in mind 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.330
 maybe it came chain and came more people 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.400
 big and you had to see what happens or 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.199
 he's even in the substitute bench 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.030
 of life football is that way I think 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.290
 that sometimes you're up and sometimes 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.240
 I happen to be a 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.980
 down and well you do not have to lower the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.620
 head and keep fighting day 10 that 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.890
 it means that it is walking and here for you 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.360
 He is a player which I learn a lot 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.520
 when I train, it's a player that I look at 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.840
 much 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.730
 and it's too big for everyone on the river 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.620
 who felt here also when 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.330
 they arrived after the safe match 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.160
 they saw all the people who were here 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.570
 supporting the campus as you saw the whole 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.770

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.600
 comrades that I am in a match 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.400
 difficult and good the truth that is a 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.800
 enormous joy because it gives you 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.410
 I trust everything to the whole team and I think 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.119
 that the campus be shown 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.430

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.990

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.240

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.740
 also be the first one you 're 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.350

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.680
 once I get there try to do it 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.090

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.830

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.060
