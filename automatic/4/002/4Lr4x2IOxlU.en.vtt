00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.139 
there is one downside about this by the
way<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.809> really<00:00:34.800> really<00:00:35.280> wish<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.760> was<00:00:35.880> an<00:00:36.000> auto

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
way I really really wish it was an auto

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.049 
way I really really wish it was an auto
fire<00:00:36.420> weapon<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.770> basically<00:00:38.280> if<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.700> spam

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
fire weapon but basically if you spam

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.660 
fire weapon but basically if you spam
click<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:39.960> emulate<00:00:40.500> auto<00:00:40.860> fire<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.489> that

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
click you can emulate auto fire but that

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.459 
click you can emulate auto fire but that
is<00:00:41.969> gonna<00:00:42.210> be<00:00:42.570> killing<00:00:42.870> your<00:00:42.960> fingers<00:00:43.320> that's

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
is gonna be killing your fingers that's
