00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.270 
little bit and how many breaks the
American<00:03:50.319> that<00:03:50.440> second<00:03:50.769> half<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.099> I<00:03:51.160> only

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
American that second half and I only

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.490 
American that second half and I only
half<00:03:51.430> chances<00:03:51.910> did<00:03:52.060> we<00:03:52.209> make<00:03:52.330> not<00:03:52.569> many<00:03:52.780> and

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
half chances did we make not many and

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.780 
half chances did we make not many and
I'm<00:03:53.620> thinking<00:03:53.769> well<00:03:53.890> look<00:03:54.069> we<00:03:54.580> hadn't<00:03:54.730> done

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
I'm thinking well look we hadn't done

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.030 
I'm thinking well look we hadn't done
that<00:03:54.849> for<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.180> first<00:03:55.420> 32<00:03:56.379> minutes<00:03:56.709> for<00:03:56.920> these

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
that for the first 32 minutes for these

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.350 
that for the first 32 minutes for these
last<00:03:57.160> eight<00:03:57.370> minutes<00:03:57.549> of<00:03:57.670> counts<00:03:57.970> who's<00:03:58.060> doing

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
last eight minutes of counts who's doing

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.640 
last eight minutes of counts who's doing
it<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.569> then<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:59.049> start<00:03:59.290> thinking<00:03:59.440> about

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
it and then you start thinking about

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.800 
it and then you start thinking about
well<00:03:59.950> all<00:04:00.640> this<00:04:00.910> how<00:04:01.209> this<00:04:01.420> might<00:04:01.599> look

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
well all this how this might look

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.170 
well all this how this might look
towards<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.230> back<00:04:02.379> end<00:04:02.560> there<00:04:02.769> so<00:04:02.980> but<00:04:03.909> at<00:04:04.060> the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
towards the back end there so but at the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.319 
towards the back end there so but at the
same<00:04:04.390> time<00:04:04.629> I<00:04:04.930> think<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:05.890> do<00:04:06.040> think<00:04:06.340> looking

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
same time I think you do think looking

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.759 
same time I think you do think looking
for<00:04:07.569> something<00:04:07.870> I'm<00:04:08.170> sure<00:04:08.349> we'll<00:04:08.560> come<00:04:08.680> on

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
for something I'm sure we'll come on

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.920 
for something I'm sure we'll come on
with<00:04:08.890> something<00:04:09.190> but<00:04:09.569> easier<00:04:10.569> said<00:04:10.750> than<00:04:10.870> done

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930
