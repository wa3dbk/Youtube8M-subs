hey guys this mystery jeans tech here

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.220 
hey guys this mystery jeans tech here
and<00:00:02.550> today<00:00:02.850> I'm<00:00:03.000> going<00:00:03.149> over<00:00:03.360> my<00:00:03.510> Mac<00:00:03.899> Mini

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
and today I'm going over my Mac Mini

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.760 
and today I'm going over my Mac Mini
server<00:00:04.620> with<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.460> two<00:00:06.029> raid0<00:00:06.720> drives<00:00:07.140> first

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
server with the two raid0 drives first

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.500 
server with the two raid0 drives first
I'll<00:00:07.919> give<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.189> little<00:00:08.429> bit<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.670> specs<00:00:08.940> it's

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
I'll give you a little bit of specs it's

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.589 
I'll give you a little bit of specs it's
running<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.900> quad<00:00:10.380> core<00:00:10.679> Intel<00:00:11.219> i7<00:00:11.519> with<00:00:12.420> 2

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
running the quad core Intel i7 with 2

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.410 
running the quad core Intel i7 with 2
gigahertz<00:00:12.929> per<00:00:13.290> core<00:00:13.679> 8<00:00:14.250> gigabytes<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.880> ddr3

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
gigahertz per core 8 gigabytes of ddr3

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.540 
gigahertz per core 8 gigabytes of ddr3
1333<00:00:16.340> megahertz<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:18.240> Intel<00:00:18.750> HD

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
1333 megahertz and the Intel HD

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.970 
1333 megahertz and the Intel HD
integrated<00:00:20.550> graphics<00:00:20.789> 3000<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:22.289> 512

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
integrated graphics 3000 with 512

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.540 
integrated graphics 3000 with 512
megabytes<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.670> memory<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.680> this<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
megabytes of memory and this is the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.779 
megabytes of memory and this is the
server<00:00:27.150> line<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:27.960> means<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:29.580> is

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
server line so that means that this is

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.840 
server line so that means that this is
kind<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.210> like<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.710> beefy<00:00:31.710> Mac<00:00:32.160> Mini<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.759> it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
kind of like the beefy Mac Mini so it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.180 
kind of like the beefy Mac Mini so it
has<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.180> quad<00:00:33.420> core<00:00:33.630> i7<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.620> only<00:00:34.770> downside

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
has the quad core i7 the only downside

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.780 
has the quad core i7 the only downside
would<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.850> Intel<00:00:36.329> HD<00:00:36.660> 3000<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.129> what<00:00:38.760> I

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
would be that Intel HD 3000 so what I

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.750 
would be that Intel HD 3000 so what I
ended<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.239> doing<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> put<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.710> computer<00:00:41.550> in

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
ended up doing is I put this computer in

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.020 
ended up doing is I put this computer in
a<00:00:41.790> raid<00:00:42.360> 0<00:00:42.829> so<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.860> put<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> two<00:00:44.399> drives<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
a raid 0 so I put the two drives in it

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.180 
a raid 0 so I put the two drives in it
comes<00:00:45.360> with<00:00:45.660> 2<00:00:45.989> 500<00:00:46.320> gig<00:00:47.120> 7200<00:00:48.120> rpm<00:00:48.629> drives<00:00:49.190> so

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
comes with 2 500 gig 7200 rpm drives so

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.790 
comes with 2 500 gig 7200 rpm drives so
I<00:00:50.219> put<00:00:50.640> those<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:52.110> put<00:00:52.320> those<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
I put those in and I put those in and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860 
I put those in and I put those in and
raid<00:00:53.039> 0<00:00:53.489> or<00:00:53.850> actually<00:00:54.300> they<00:00:54.420> came<00:00:54.660> with<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
raid 0 or actually they came with the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.840 
raid 0 or actually they came with the
Mac<00:00:55.050> Mini<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.500> put<00:00:55.739> them<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.980> raid<00:00:56.219> 0<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
Mac Mini so I put them in raid 0 and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.750 
Mac Mini so I put them in raid 0 and
raid<00:00:57.239> 0<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.109> stripe<00:00:58.559> data<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.340> puts<00:00:59.550> two

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
raid 0 is stripe data so it puts two

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.479 
raid 0 is stripe data so it puts two
drives<00:01:00.120> into<00:01:00.629> one<00:01:01.160> one<00:01:02.160> kind<00:01:02.430> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
drives into one one kind of

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.280 
drives into one one kind of
configuration<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.539> let's<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:03.870> ahead<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.080> open

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
configuration so let's go ahead and open

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.050 
configuration so let's go ahead and open
up<00:01:04.500> Disk<00:01:04.739> Utility<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.610> kind<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.850> get<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
up Disk Utility so you can kind of get a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.929 
up Disk Utility so you can kind of get a
better<00:01:06.810> idea<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.500> right<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.880> see

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
better idea so right here we can see

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.730 
better idea so right here we can see
that<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.750> main<00:01:09.960> partition<00:01:10.560> main

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that we have the main partition main

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.830 
that we have the main partition main
drive<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:11.460> made<00:01:11.700> up<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.000> these<00:01:12.210> huge<00:01:12.600> hard

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
drive that's made up of these huge hard

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.630 
drive that's made up of these huge hard
drives<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.439> that's<00:01:13.650> called<00:01:13.920> Macintosh<00:01:14.159> HD

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
drives and that's called Macintosh HD

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.880 
drives and that's called Macintosh HD
and<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.720> see<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.990> there's<00:01:16.259> raid<00:01:16.560> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and we can see that there's raid and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.710 
and we can see that there's raid and
it's<00:01:17.070> calls<00:01:17.310> an<00:01:17.520> apple<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.000> raid<00:01:18.210> right<00:01:18.420> here

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it's calls an apple of raid right here

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.130 
it's calls an apple of raid right here
so<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.640> drive<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.450> drive<00:01:21.689> so

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
so this is one drive this to drive so

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.960 
so this is one drive this to drive so
what<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.380> does<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.920> kind<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.400> pairs<00:01:23.700> these

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
what it does is it kind of pairs these

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.399 
what it does is it kind of pairs these
drives<00:01:24.270> together<00:01:24.479> they're<00:01:24.900> still<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
drives together they're still in that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.080 
drives together they're still in that
there's<00:01:25.710> no<00:01:25.890> hardware<00:01:26.490> difference<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.060> don't

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
there's no hardware difference you don't

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.300 
there's no hardware difference you don't
have<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> change<00:01:27.570> any<00:01:27.810> hardware<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.189> has

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
have to change any hardware it just has

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.370 
have to change any hardware it just has
to<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.460> hooked<00:01:29.640> up<00:01:29.850> normally<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:31.110> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
to be hooked up normally and then you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.039 
to be hooked up normally and then you
just<00:01:31.619> kind<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.210> built<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> software

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
just kind of built it in the software

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.499 
just kind of built it in the software
you<00:01:34.140> go<00:01:34.350> ahead<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.710> put<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.009> raid<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.390> it

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
you go ahead and put in a raid and so it

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.810 
you go ahead and put in a raid and so it
uses<00:01:36.689> both<00:01:37.350> drives<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.979> combination<00:01:38.640> so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
uses both drives in combination so

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.179 
uses both drives in combination so
whenever<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.150> write<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.659> simple<00:01:40.200> fire<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.710> file

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
whenever I write a simple fire to file

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.700 
whenever I write a simple fire to file
to<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.810> computer<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.990> kind<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.259> writes<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.619> to

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
to the computer it kind of writes it to

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.460 
to the computer it kind of writes it to
both<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.850> really<00:01:45.060> cool<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.689> definitely

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
both so it's really cool it's definitely

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.539 
both so it's really cool it's definitely
a<00:01:46.530> speed<00:01:46.770> bump<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.159> I'm<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> show<00:01:47.520> you

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
a speed bump so I'm going to show you

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.249 
a speed bump so I'm going to show you
some<00:01:47.850> speed<00:01:48.119> tests<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.570> I'm<00:01:48.659> also<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.200> to

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
some speed tests and I'm also going to

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.109 
some speed tests and I'm also going to
show<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:50.100> I've<00:01:50.189> gotten<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.790> be<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
show you what I've gotten it to be the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.030 
show you what I've gotten it to be the
highest<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> speed<00:01:52.110> test<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.770> let's<00:01:52.920> go

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
highest and the speed test so let's go

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.030 
highest and the speed test so let's go
ahead<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.310> put<00:01:53.460> these<00:01:53.640> off<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> side<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
ahead and put these off to the side and

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
ahead and put these off to the side and
we'll<00:01:56.040> go<00:01:56.250> ahead<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.549> open<00:01:57.000> up<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.479> black

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
we'll go ahead and open up the black

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.940 
we'll go ahead and open up the black
magic<00:01:58.320> disk<00:01:59.009> speed<00:01:59.280> test<00:02:00.469> so<00:02:01.469> right<00:02:01.680> there<00:02:01.920> we

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
magic disk speed test so right there we

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.889 
magic disk speed test so right there we
got<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.430> speed<00:02:03.060> test<00:02:03.270> I'm<00:02:03.450> gonna<00:02:03.600> go<00:02:03.780> ahead

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
got the speed test I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.510 
got the speed test I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.290> give<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.740> start

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
and just give it a start

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.969 
and just give it a start
and<00:02:05.850> I've<00:02:06.600> been<00:02:06.750> noticing<00:02:07.049> I've<00:02:07.380> been<00:02:07.649> getting

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
and I've been noticing I've been getting

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.130 
and I've been noticing I've been getting
up<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.160> 180<00:02:09.090> right<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.400> 184<00:02:11.400> breed<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.300> usually

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
up to 180 right and 184 breed so usually

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.820 
up to 180 right and 184 breed so usually
is<00:02:13.200> about

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
is about

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.750 
is about
it's<00:02:14.790> kind<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.120> like<00:02:15.240> matching<00:02:15.830> 161<00:02:16.830> 170<00:02:17.550> it's

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
it's kind of like matching 161 170 it's

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.480 
it's kind of like matching 161 170 it's
around<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.120> same<00:02:18.150> area<00:02:19.020> so<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.250> speed

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
around the same area so this the speed

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.400 
around the same area so this the speed
test<00:02:20.700> right<00:02:20.910> here<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.270> seeming<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.990> be<00:02:22.080> really

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
test right here is seeming to be really

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.320 
test right here is seeming to be really
good<00:02:22.560> we're<00:02:23.070> getting<00:02:23.220> 170<00:02:24.290> 576<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.760> 174<00:02:26.760> so

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
good we're getting 170 576 and 174 so

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.750 
good we're getting 170 576 and 174 so
this<00:02:27.870> rewrite<00:02:28.440> speed<00:02:28.830> test<00:02:29.100> on<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.610> is

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
this rewrite speed test on this is

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.200 
this rewrite speed test on this is
compared<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:31.080> can<00:02:31.350> kind<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.520> compete<00:02:33.000> with

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
compared to it can kind of compete with

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.300 
compared to it can kind of compete with
some<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.660> lower<00:02:33.930> end<00:02:34.230> solid-state<00:02:34.980> drives

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
some of the lower end solid-state drives

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.630 
some of the lower end solid-state drives
and<00:02:35.780> it's<00:02:36.780> definitely<00:02:37.410> awesome<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.370> speed

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
and it's definitely awesome the speed

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.160 
and it's definitely awesome the speed
test<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.060> you're<00:02:39.150> getting<00:02:39.360> without<00:02:39.840> even

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
test that you're getting without even

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.650 
test that you're getting without even
buying<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.470> solid<00:02:40.800> C<00:02:40.980> Drive<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.910> overall<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
buying a solid C Drive so overall the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.250 
buying a solid C Drive so overall the
speed<00:02:42.900> bump

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
speed bump

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.290 
speed bump
it's<00:02:43.410> definitely<00:02:43.950> noticeable<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.730> common

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
it's definitely noticeable in common

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.500 
it's definitely noticeable in common
tasks<00:02:45.650> it's<00:02:46.650> actually<00:02:47.550> pretty<00:02:47.760> fast<00:02:48.090> opening

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
tasks it's actually pretty fast opening

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.050 
tasks it's actually pretty fast opening
up<00:02:48.630> applications<00:02:49.490> rendering<00:02:50.490> video<00:02:50.820> it's

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
up applications rendering video it's

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.720 
up applications rendering video it's
definitely<00:02:51.540> much<00:02:51.750> faster<00:02:52.260> but<00:02:52.800> on<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.520> thing

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
definitely much faster but on the thing

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.640 
definitely much faster but on the thing
that<00:02:53.940> I'm<00:02:54.030> kind<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.780> at<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:54.930> point<00:02:55.050> about<00:02:55.440> is

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
that I'm kind of at this point about is

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.180 
that I'm kind of at this point about is
boot<00:02:55.950> times<00:02:56.220> aren't<00:02:56.520> as<00:02:58.010> significant<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.070> an

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
boot times aren't as significant of an

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.370 
boot times aren't as significant of an
upgrades<00:02:59.640> compared<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.270> solid-state<00:03:00.840> drive

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
upgrades compared to a solid-state drive

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.370 
upgrades compared to a solid-state drive
so<00:03:02.120> these<00:03:03.120> speed<00:03:03.450> tests<00:03:03.750> are<00:03:03.840> pretty<00:03:03.990> good<00:03:04.170> the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
so these speed tests are pretty good the

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.980 
so these speed tests are pretty good the
best<00:03:04.560> I've<00:03:04.740> gotten<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.840> probably<00:03:06.840> right

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
best I've gotten it is probably right

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.170 
best I've gotten it is probably right
now<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:08.010> B<00:03:08.250> test<00:03:08.520> which<00:03:08.670> we<00:03:08.820> have<00:03:09.000> right

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
now and this B test which we have right

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.490 
now and this B test which we have right
here<00:03:09.470> 179<00:03:10.470> right<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:11.160> 184<00:03:12.090> treed<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.990> this<00:03:13.320> B

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
here 179 right and 184 treed so this B

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.990 
here 179 right and 184 treed so this B
test<00:03:13.740> that<00:03:13.950> we<00:03:14.040> all<00:03:14.160> right<00:03:14.340> here<00:03:14.550> is<00:03:14.640> showing<00:03:14.670> a

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
test that we all right here is showing a

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.130 
test that we all right here is showing a
pretty<00:03:15.210> good<00:03:15.570> speed<00:03:16.530> it's<00:03:17.150> 161<00:03:18.150> right<00:03:18.870> which

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
pretty good speed it's 161 right which

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.500 
pretty good speed it's 161 right which
is<00:03:19.290> excellent

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
is excellent

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.070 
is excellent
