00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
which sounds really dumb i know but see

which sounds really dumb i know but see
the<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:04.089> basic<00:01:04.449> four<00:01:04.720> is<00:01:06.180> 155<00:01:10.050> at<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.230> spine

you<00:01:12.130> know<00:01:12.250> pretty<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.860> think<00:01:15.460> it's<00:01:15.580> supposed<00:01:16.270> to

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
you know pretty I think it's supposed to

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.730 
you know pretty I think it's supposed to
be<00:01:16.540> maybe<00:01:16.720> a<00:01:16.840> little<00:01:16.990> bit<00:01:17.170> less<00:01:17.350> than<00:01:17.500> that<00:01:17.620> i'm

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
be maybe a little bit less than that i'm

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.370 
be maybe a little bit less than that i'm
probably<00:01:17.920> just<00:01:18.070> measuring<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:18.580> wrong<00:01:18.760> but

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
probably just measuring it wrong but

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.230 
probably just measuring it wrong but
yeah<00:01:20.380> some<00:01:20.680> are<00:01:20.800> on<00:01:20.890> there<00:01:21.040> like<00:01:21.190> 14<00:01:21.580> 15<00:01:21.610> and

or the the secondary edge was really
kind<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.590> a<00:01:56.799> little<00:01:57.220> bit<00:01:57.340> steeper<00:01:57.760> than<00:01:57.909> I<00:01:57.970> like

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180

and really short and really toothy it

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.450 
and really short and really toothy it
was<00:02:02.020> sharp<00:02:02.290> but<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:02.560> was<00:02:02.650> like<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.799> toothy<00:02:03.189> sharp

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
was sharp but it was like a toothy sharp

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.289 
was sharp but it was like a toothy sharp
so<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.729> took<00:02:03.880> a<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:05.460> findout<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.729> little<00:02:07.030> edge

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
so I took a I findout the little edge

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.930 
so I took a I findout the little edge

buffing wheel and you can see there's a

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.550 
buffing wheel and you can see there's a
few<00:02:55.450> scratches<00:02:55.810> but<00:02:56.110> for<00:02:56.739> like<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:58.239> 80<00:02:58.540> or<00:02:59.500> i

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
few scratches but for like the 80 or i

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.080 
few scratches but for like the 80 or i
paid<00:02:59.950> like<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.160> hundred<00:03:00.459> dollars<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.940> get<00:03:01.030> this

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
paid like a hundred dollars to get this

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.199 
paid like a hundred dollars to get this
ship<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.540> me<00:03:01.660> it's<00:03:02.530> like<00:03:02.739> quite<00:03:03.280> shiny<00:03:03.940> and

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.970 
ship to me it's like quite shiny and
really<00:03:04.569> really<00:03:04.780> nice<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.260> it's<00:03:05.590> really

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.630 
really really nice and it's really
smooth<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:08.920> think<00:03:09.130> it's<00:03:09.310> going<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.549> be<00:03:09.610> a

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
smooth so I think it's going to be a

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.000 
smooth so I think it's going to be a
great<00:03:09.850> cutter<00:03:10.360> for<00:03:10.569> wood<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:10.989> stuff<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.470> was

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
great cutter for wood and stuff I was

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.180 
great cutter for wood and stuff I was
like<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:12.459> haven't<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:13.440> haven't<00:03:14.440> tested<00:03:14.799> it<00:03:15.040> out

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
like I haven't I haven't tested it out

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.090 
like I haven't I haven't tested it out
in<00:03:15.370> any<00:03:15.519> wood<00:03:15.819> yet<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:16.630> i<00:03:16.660> might<00:03:16.900> as<00:03:16.930> well<00:03:17.200> on

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
in any wood yet so i might as well on

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.860 
in any wood yet so i might as well on
camera<00:03:18.489> here<00:03:18.820> just<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.299> little<00:03:19.329> bit<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:19.810> i<00:03:21.870> mean

good not much resistance yeah that cuts
really<00:03:33.489> deep<00:03:33.730> in<00:03:33.880> there<00:03:34.290> without<00:03:35.290> actually

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
really deep in there without actually

really deep in there without actually
too<00:03:35.980> much<00:03:36.160> force<00:03:36.370> i'm<00:03:36.579> kind<00:03:36.850> of<00:03:36.940> using<00:03:37.209> two

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
too much force i'm kind of using two

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.530 
too much force i'm kind of using two
hands<00:03:37.570> but<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:38.380> handle<00:03:38.799> just<00:03:39.030> this<00:03:40.030> Red<00:03:40.299> Sea

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
handle just has such a good grip on it I

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.259 
handle just has such a good grip on it I
really<00:03:43.180> dig<00:03:43.359> this<00:03:43.510> it's<00:03:44.290> really<00:03:44.709> really<00:03:44.890> thin

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
really dig this it's really really thin

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.870 
really dig this it's really really thin
grind<00:03:46.269> on<00:03:46.510> this<00:03:46.690> bad<00:03:46.900> boy<00:03:47.310> let's<00:03:48.310> see<00:03:48.459> if<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:48.850> can

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
grind on this bad boy let's see if I can

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.830 
grind on this bad boy let's see if I can
show<00:03:49.239> you<00:03:49.440> it's<00:03:50.440> upside<00:03:50.769> down<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:50.950> know<00:03:51.160> but

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.539 

just<00:03:55.840> kind<00:03:56.620> of<00:03:56.650> slides<00:03:56.920> off<00:03:58.380> yeah<00:03:59.380> I<00:03:59.769> mean<00:04:00.489> it's

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
just kind of slides off yeah I mean it's

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:11.509 
just kind of slides off yeah I mean it's
like<00:04:02.760> 15<00:04:03.760> 16<00:04:04.209> like<00:04:06.569> 16,000<00:04:07.569> 15,000<00:04:08.560> a

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.030 

millimeter<00:04:12.519> behind<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:12.910> edge<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:14.709> see<00:04:14.889> like

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
millimeter behind the edge you see like

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.150 
millimeter behind the edge you see like
right<00:04:15.190> there<00:04:16.260> so<00:04:17.260> that's<00:04:17.410> like<00:04:17.560> pretty<00:04:17.859> damn

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
right there so that's like pretty damn

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.560 
right there so that's like pretty damn
thin<00:04:18.549> and<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:20.970> seems<00:04:21.970> like<00:04:22.120> it's<00:04:22.270> a<00:04:22.330> really

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
thin and it seems like it's a really

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.430 
thin and it seems like it's a really
good<00:04:22.659> cutter<00:04:22.990> so<00:04:23.260> far

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
good cutter so far

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.560 
good cutter so far
you<00:04:27.460> kind<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.490> go<00:04:28.640> in<00:04:28.730> at<00:04:28.850> an<00:04:28.880> angle<00:04:29.090> in<00:04:29.390> there

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
you kind of go in at an angle in there

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:36.820 
you kind of go in at an angle in there
but<00:04:29.810> I<00:04:32.620> mean<00:04:33.940> that's<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:35.440> some<00:04:36.440> pretty<00:04:36.650> decent

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
but I mean that's a some pretty decent

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.260 
but I mean that's a some pretty decent
geometry<00:04:37.490> on<00:04:37.640> a<00:04:37.670> on<00:04:38.540> a<00:04:38.600> knife<00:04:38.900> right<00:04:39.110> there<00:04:40.270> but

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
geometry on a on a knife right there but

geometry on a on a knife right there but
what<00:04:41.450> I<00:04:41.480> paid<00:04:41.720> for<00:04:41.750> it's<00:04:42.730> just<00:04:43.730> a<00:04:43.820> nice<00:04:43.970> little

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
what I paid for it's just a nice little

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.140 
what I paid for it's just a nice little
sliver<00:04:44.630> of<00:04:44.750> Almack's<00:04:45.260> with<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.820> with<00:04:46.820> a<00:04:46.850> really

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
sliver of Almack's with a with a really

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.190 
sliver of Almack's with a with a really
good<00:04:47.330> rubber<00:04:47.570> handle<00:04:47.990> on<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.140> and<00:04:49.870> so<00:04:50.870> far<00:04:51.080> I'm

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
good rubber handle on it and so far I'm

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.390 
good rubber handle on it and so far I'm
really<00:04:51.290> digging<00:04:51.560> it<00:04:51.710> if<00:04:51.860> you<00:04:51.980> have<00:04:52.100> a<00:04:52.130> chance

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
really digging it if you have a chance

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.670 
really digging it if you have a chance
if<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:53.480> have<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.630> chance<00:04:53.810> to<00:04:54.020> get<00:04:54.230> one<00:04:54.380> of<00:04:54.530> these

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
if you have a chance to get one of these

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.860 
if you have a chance to get one of these
I<00:04:55.250> think<00:04:55.910> the<00:04:56.000> club<00:04:56.210> point<00:04:56.390> version<00:04:56.720> would<00:04:56.810> be

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
I think the club point version would be

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.030 
I think the club point version would be
very<00:04:57.170> cool<00:04:57.500> as<00:04:57.680> well<00:04:57.860> but<00:04:59.590> it'd<00:05:00.590> be<00:05:00.620> a<00:05:00.740> very

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
very cool as well but it'd be a very

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.370 
very cool as well but it'd be a very
delicate<00:05:01.550> delicate<00:05:02.090> tiny<00:05:02.660> little<00:05:02.930> tip<00:05:03.230> on

delicate delicate tiny little tip on

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.040 
delicate delicate tiny little tip on

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
there this is real thin I'll show these

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.320 
there this is real thin I'll show these
next<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.500> each<00:05:06.620> other<00:05:09.640> so<00:05:10.640> you<00:05:10.940> can<00:05:11.060> see<00:05:11.180> it's

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
next to each other so you can see it's

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.880

it's<00:05:11.600> pretty<00:05:12.140> damn<00:05:12.410> thin<00:05:14.170> but<00:05:15.170> yeah<00:05:15.320> be<00:05:15.860> a

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
really hate about buses other than the

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.130 
really hate about buses other than the
fact<00:05:25.850> that<00:05:25.970> they<00:05:26.150> don't<00:05:26.330> come<00:05:26.510> sharpen<00:05:26.960> very

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
well sometimes and the tips are often

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.790 
well sometimes and the tips are often
rounded<00:05:29.810> or<00:05:29.990> at<00:05:30.080> least<00:05:30.260> with<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.470> ones<00:05:30.620> i've

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800

I kind of hate but i'll just make a
kydex<00:05:37.280> one<00:05:37.570> probably<00:05:38.570> do<00:05:38.690> something<00:05:38.900> exactly

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
the same as this because it works out

a<00:05:45.440> bit<00:05:45.650> so<00:05:45.919> i<00:05:46.160> might<00:05:46.310> figure<00:05:46.460> out<00:05:46.610> some<00:05:46.820> other

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
a bit so i might figure out some other

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.780 
a bit so i might figure out some other
method<00:05:48.020> of<00:05:48.230> putting<00:05:48.380> it<00:05:48.560> working<00:05:49.430> it<00:05:49.520> on<00:05:49.610> there

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
method of putting it working it on there

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.700 
method of putting it working it on there
