I mean the file in Romania I realized

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.200 
I mean the file in Romania I realized
that<00:00:20.360> one<00:00:20.900> month<00:00:21.140> its<00:00:21.470> equal<00:00:22.250> with<00:00:22.460> 10<00:00:23.000> years

that one month its equal with 10 years

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.560 
that one month its equal with 10 years
of<00:00:23.390> area<00:00:24.080> because<00:00:24.770> all<00:00:25.220> these<00:00:25.580> funds<00:00:25.940> in<00:00:26.270> what

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
of area because all these funds in what

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.510 
of area because all these funds in what
month<00:00:26.780> is<00:00:27.080> it<00:00:27.110> super<00:00:27.590> ability<00:00:27.980> person<00:00:28.280> you

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
month is it super ability person you

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.400

know<00:00:28.610> you<00:00:28.970> never<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:29.510> never<00:00:29.540> take<00:00:29.990> all<00:00:30.230> these

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
know you never you never take all these

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.440 
know you never you never take all these
funds<00:00:30.680> in<00:00:31.490> one<00:00:33.640> particular

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
funds in one particular

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.380 
funds in one particular
I<00:00:36.510> mean<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:36.960> not<00:00:37.050> difficult<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:38.000> it's<00:00:39.000> rare

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
I mean it's not difficult but it's rare

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.320 
I mean it's not difficult but it's rare
I<00:00:39.720> think<00:00:39.960> also<00:00:40.380> for<00:00:40.800> example<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.580> property

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
I think also for example this property

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.620 
I think also for example this property
singers<00:00:42.660> like<00:00:42.780> Pavarotti<00:00:43.250> Domingo<00:00:44.390> there<00:00:45.390> was

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
singers like Pavarotti Domingo there was

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.690 
singers like Pavarotti Domingo there was
some<00:00:46.020> image<00:00:46.470> and<00:00:46.740> they<00:00:46.980> became<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.520> famous

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
some image and they became so famous

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.110 
some image and they became so famous
just<00:00:48.300> because<00:00:48.570> they<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:49.020> also<00:00:50.120> something

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
just because they have also something

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.330 
just because they have also something
commercial<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.590> with<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.890> free<00:00:53.100> tennis

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
commercial you know with the free tennis

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.280 
commercial you know with the free tennis
it<00:00:53.850> was<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> fair<00:00:54.450> amount<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:54.870> commercial

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
it was a fair amount the commercial

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.790 
it was a fair amount the commercial
fellow<00:00:55.470> so<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.130> think<00:00:56.520> they<00:00:57.739> try<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.180> make<00:01:00.180> also

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
fellow so I think they try to make also

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.430 
fellow so I think they try to make also
to<00:01:01.800> mix<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.760> commercial<00:01:03.330> with<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.050> know<00:01:04.140> with

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
to mix the commercial with you know with

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.820 
to mix the commercial with you know with
the<00:01:04.500> Oprah<00:01:04.800> so<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.250> think<00:01:05.780> it's<00:01:06.780> difficult<00:01:07.440> to

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the Oprah so I think it's difficult to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.980 
the Oprah so I think it's difficult to
have<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.250> these<00:01:08.490> fans<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.509> on<00:01:09.869> the
