how do you use the metal that we are DS
metalder<00:00:50.579> replace<00:00:51.300> what<00:00:51.630> you<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.020> yeah

but<00:01:34.479> as<00:01:34.570> you<00:01:34.720> can<00:01:34.810> see<00:01:34.870> the<00:01:35.710> last<00:01:35.920> time<00:01:36.190> we<00:01:37.120> shut

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
but as you can see the last time we shut

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.150 
but as you can see the last time we shut
the<00:01:37.600> took<00:01:38.080> a<00:01:38.140> shot<00:01:38.350> of<00:01:38.470> this<00:01:38.560> quarter

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
the took a shot of this quarter

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.010 
the took a shot of this quarter
there<00:01:39.700> was<00:01:39.790> nothing<00:01:40.060> but<00:01:40.150> rust<00:01:40.390> from<00:01:40.660> the<00:01:40.840> back

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
there was nothing but rust from the back

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.810 
there was nothing but rust from the back
end<00:01:41.050> up<00:01:41.530> to<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.910> wheelhouse<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:44.580> kind<00:01:45.580> of<00:01:45.670> all

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
end up to the wheelhouse so kind of all

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.580 
end up to the wheelhouse so kind of all
that<00:01:46.180> rust<00:01:46.510> and<00:01:48.300> up<00:01:49.300> front<00:01:49.600> here<00:01:49.900> there<00:01:50.410> was

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
that rust and up front here there was

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.330 
that rust and up front here there was
nothing<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.850> was<00:01:52.000> just<00:01:53.430> open<00:01:54.660> and<00:01:55.660> so<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.800> took<00:01:57.160> a

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
nothing it was just open and so I took a

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.960 
nothing it was just open and so I took a
piece<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.580> metal<00:01:57.910> and<00:01:59.070> cut<00:02:00.070> it<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.460> width<00:02:00.670> of

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
piece of metal and cut it the width of

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.850 
piece of metal and cut it the width of
this<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.600> had<00:02:01.720> to<00:02:01.810> be<00:02:01.869> flared<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.500> little<00:02:02.710> bit

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
this it had to be flared a little bit

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.100 
this it had to be flared a little bit
and<00:02:03.570> wrapped<00:02:04.570> it<00:02:04.780> here<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.820> welded<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.539> to

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
and wrapped it here and welded it to

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.250 
and wrapped it here and welded it to
there<00:02:08.470> then<00:02:09.310> took<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.640> piece<00:02:09.880> of<00:02:10.030> metal<00:02:10.330> on<00:02:10.810> the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
there then took a piece of metal on the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.970 
there then took a piece of metal on the
inside<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.820> overlapped<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.500> metal<00:02:14.830> that

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
inside and overlapped the metal that

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.699 
inside and overlapped the metal that
could<00:02:15.190> be<00:02:15.340> welded<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.410> got<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.560> down

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
could be welded and got it down

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.000 
could be welded and got it down
everything<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:19.450> welded<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:20.739> I'd<00:02:20.860> have

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
everything and welded it so I'd have

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.490 
everything and welded it so I'd have
something<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.430> metal<00:02:21.760> right<00:02:22.239> panel<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.410> I'd

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
something to metal right panel so I'd

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.810 
something to metal right panel so I'd
have<00:02:23.620> something<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.070> weld<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:26.400> then<00:02:27.400> I

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
have something to weld to and then I

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.410 
have something to weld to and then I
take<00:02:28.570> fiberglass<00:02:29.410> it's<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.280> fine<00:02:30.610> fiberglass

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
take fiberglass it's a fine fiberglass

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.890 
take fiberglass it's a fine fiberglass
mesh<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.700> it's<00:02:34.000> almost<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.299> body<00:02:34.630> filler

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
mesh and it's almost like body filler

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.350 
mesh and it's almost like body filler
and<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.410> just<00:02:35.680> start<00:02:35.980> building<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.060> it's

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
and you just start building it and it's

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.850 
and you just start building it and it's
you<00:02:37.570> can<00:02:37.630> kind<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:37.959> mold<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.350> way<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.530> want

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
you can kind of mold it the way you want

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.930 
you can kind of mold it the way you want
to<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.750> then<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.860> next<00:02:42.130> step<00:02:42.310> after<00:02:42.580> this

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
to and then the next step after this

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.270 
to and then the next step after this
will<00:02:43.420> be<00:02:44.010> taken<00:02:45.010> body<00:02:45.280> filler<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:47.160> going<00:02:48.160> over

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
will be taken body filler and going over

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.830 
will be taken body filler and going over
this<00:02:49.560> because<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:51.010> sands<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.579> lot<00:02:51.730> easier<00:02:52.600> than

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
this because it sands a lot easier than

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.729 
this because it sands a lot easier than
this<00:02:52.989> fiberglass<00:02:53.739> fiberglass<00:02:54.489> is<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:55.739> you

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
this fiberglass fiberglass is just you

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.400 
this fiberglass fiberglass is just you
know<00:02:57.100> it's<00:02:57.220> hard<00:02:57.459> as<00:02:57.579> a<00:02:57.610> rock<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.269> you<00:02:58.570> can<00:02:58.720> you

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
know it's hard as a rock and you can you

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.729 
know it's hard as a rock and you can you
can't<00:02:59.680> mold<00:02:59.950> too<00:03:00.940> much<00:03:01.150> with<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.630> as<00:03:02.019> easily<00:03:02.380> as

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
can't mold too much with it as easily as

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.680 
can't mold too much with it as easily as
you<00:03:02.799> can<00:03:03.040> with<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.430> body<00:03:03.610> filler<00:03:03.910> that's<00:03:04.510> kind

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
you can with the body filler that's kind

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.630 
you can with the body filler that's kind
of<00:03:04.720> like<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.870> drop

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
of like a drop

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.830 
of like a drop
right<00:03:07.270> yeah<00:03:07.990> so<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:10.120> then<00:03:10.240> we<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:10.570> know<00:03:10.630> we'll

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
right yeah so and then we you know we'll

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.770 
right yeah so and then we you know we'll
have<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:10.990> nice<00:03:13.290> smooth<00:03:14.290> quarter<00:03:15.040> panel<00:03:15.340> and

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
have a nice smooth quarter panel and

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.520 
have a nice smooth quarter panel and
it's<00:03:16.780> strong<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.690> should<00:03:19.900> last<00:03:20.080> another

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
it's strong and it should last another

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:30.510 
it's strong and it should last another
4050<00:03:21.370> years<00:03:22.410> hopefully<00:03:27.450> right<00:03:28.450> real<00:03:28.960> legit<00:03:29.520> we

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
4050 years hopefully right real legit we

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.070 
4050 years hopefully right real legit we
have<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.760> do<00:03:30.970> some<00:03:31.150> more<00:03:31.240> sanding<00:03:31.600> up<00:03:31.690> here<00:03:31.900> but

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
have to do some more sanding up here but

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.500 
have to do some more sanding up here but
we'll<00:03:32.680> take<00:03:32.860> that<00:03:33.010> before<00:03:33.940> we<00:03:34.060> etch<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.360> will

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
we'll take that before we etch it will

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.180 
we'll take that before we etch it will
take<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.230> same<00:03:35.470> thing<00:03:35.680> we<00:03:35.830> did<00:03:35.950> on<00:03:36.010> the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
take the same thing we did on the

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.290 
take the same thing we did on the
fenders<00:03:36.580> and<00:03:36.730> doors<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:38.760> we'll<00:03:39.760> spray<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.150> on

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
fenders and doors and we'll spray it on

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.280 
fenders and doors and we'll spray it on
there<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:41.100> let<00:03:42.100> it<00:03:42.190> soak<00:03:42.430> for<00:03:42.700> about<00:03:43.260> two<00:03:44.260> or

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
there and let it soak for about two or

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.220 
there and let it soak for about two or
three<00:03:44.380> minutes<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:45.010> then<00:03:45.100> wipe<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.120> off<00:03:46.300> and

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
three minutes and then wipe it off and

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.350 
three minutes and then wipe it off and
then<00:03:48.160> we're<00:03:48.340> ready<00:03:48.550> to<00:03:49.050> go<00:03:50.050> ahead<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:51.360> metal

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
then we're ready to go ahead and metal

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.850 
then we're ready to go ahead and metal
etch<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:52.720> or<00:03:53.200> whatever<00:03:53.500> else<00:03:53.680> we<00:03:53.890> need<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.130> do

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
etch it or whatever else we need to do

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.800 
etch it or whatever else we need to do
put<00:03:56.860> that<00:03:57.010> in<00:03:57.220> primer<00:03:57.430> on<00:03:57.670> it<00:03:57.700> we<00:03:58.390> got<00:03:58.510> to<00:03:58.600> we

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
put that in primer on it we got to we

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.479 
put that in primer on it we got to we
got<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:58.989> put<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.320> etching<00:03:59.890> primer<00:04:00.070> over<00:04:00.250> the

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
got to put the etching primer over the

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.960 
got to put the etching primer over the
hole<00:04:00.670> anything<00:04:01.510> is<00:04:01.630> exposed<00:04:02.730> we'll<00:04:03.730> have<00:04:03.850> to

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
hole anything is exposed we'll have to

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.800 
hole anything is exposed we'll have to
put<00:04:04.120> that<00:04:04.270> over<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.930> whole<00:04:05.080> car<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:07.180> then<00:04:07.540> you

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
put that over the whole car and then you

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.810 
put that over the whole car and then you
know<00:04:07.930> we're<00:04:08.170> going<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.100> go<00:04:09.370> ahead<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.640> climb

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
know we're going to go ahead and climb

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.920 
know we're going to go ahead and climb
it<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.790> metal<00:04:13.500> should<00:04:14.500> last<00:04:14.920> a<00:04:15.400> long<00:04:15.700> time

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
it and the metal should last a long time

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.890 
it and the metal should last a long time
so<00:04:16.930> I'll<00:04:17.080> be<00:04:18.720> okay<00:04:19.720> what<00:04:20.530> we<00:04:20.620> have<00:04:20.650> here<00:04:20.859> is<00:04:21.250> a

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
so I'll be okay what we have here is a

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.270 
so I'll be okay what we have here is a
frame<00:04:22.900> majoring<00:04:23.320> device<00:04:23.560> it's<00:04:23.919> called<00:04:23.979> the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
frame majoring device it's called the

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.150 
frame majoring device it's called the
touch<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:26.020> almost<00:04:26.229> looks<00:04:26.440> like<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.590> robot<00:04:26.950> but

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
touch it almost looks like a robot but

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.230 
touch it almost looks like a robot but
it<00:04:27.790> hit<00:04:28.620> its<00:04:29.700> computerized<00:04:30.700> and<00:04:32.640> within<00:04:33.640> this

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
it hit its computerized and within this

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.469 
it hit its computerized and within this
laptop<00:04:34.479> it<00:04:35.140> has<00:04:35.380> all<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.800> vehicles

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
laptop it has all the vehicles

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.409 
laptop it has all the vehicles
dimensions<00:04:37.479> and<00:04:37.720> specs<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:39.370> when<00:04:40.120> we<00:04:40.240> get

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
dimensions and specs and when we get

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.940 
dimensions and specs and when we get
ready<00:04:40.570> to<00:04:40.630> use<00:04:40.720> it<00:04:41.050> we<00:04:41.380> just<00:04:41.620> have<00:04:41.830> to

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
ready to use it we just have to

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.430 
ready to use it we just have to
calibrate<00:04:42.190> it<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:42.970> then<00:04:43.479> we'll<00:04:43.630> go<00:04:43.780> around<00:04:44.110> to

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
calibrate it and then we'll go around to

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.740 
calibrate it and then we'll go around to
each<00:04:44.470> place<00:04:44.950> on<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:45.280> car<00:04:45.550> on<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.240> front<00:04:46.479> end

each place on the car on the front end

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.230 
each place on the car on the front end
and<00:04:47.910> we'll<00:04:48.910> touch<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:50.229> damaged<00:04:50.650> area<00:04:51.240> to

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
and we'll touch the damaged area to

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.920 
and we'll touch the damaged area to
another<00:04:52.530> point<00:04:53.530> of<00:04:53.770> reference<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.810> will

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
another point of reference and it will

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.469 
another point of reference and it will
let<00:04:56.050> us<00:04:56.110> know<00:04:56.229> how<00:04:56.680> far<00:04:57.430> out<00:04:57.990> the<00:05:00.000> how<00:05:01.000> far<00:05:01.270> out

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
let us know how far out the how far out

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.280 
let us know how far out the how far out
or<00:05:01.750> in

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
or in

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.570 
or in
the<00:05:04.290> damages<00:05:04.950> to<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:06.530> inner<00:05:07.530> rail

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
the damages to the inner rail

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.440 
the damages to the inner rail
it'll<00:05:09.330> major<00:05:09.510> control<00:05:10.080> arms<00:05:11.180> quite<00:05:12.180> a<00:05:12.210> unique

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
it'll major control arms quite a unique

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.410 
it'll major control arms quite a unique
little<00:05:12.870> machine<00:05:13.230> I<00:05:13.790> think<00:05:14.790> the<00:05:15.030> hardest<00:05:15.300> thing

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
little machine I think the hardest thing

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.090 
little machine I think the hardest thing
about<00:05:15.600> this<00:05:16.110> machine<00:05:16.290> is<00:05:16.590> just<00:05:16.710> learning<00:05:16.950> how

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
about this machine is just learning how

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.500 
about this machine is just learning how
use<00:05:17.340> it<00:05:17.520> it's<00:05:18.510> pretty<00:05:19.790> kind<00:05:20.790> of<00:05:20.880> high-tech<00:05:21.240> for

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
use it it's pretty kind of high-tech for

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.860 
use it it's pretty kind of high-tech for
an<00:05:21.690> old<00:05:21.810> guy<00:05:21.960> like<00:05:21.990> me<00:05:22.520> but<00:05:23.520> it<00:05:23.670> works<00:05:23.880> a<00:05:24.180> lot

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
an old guy like me but it works a lot

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.480 
an old guy like me but it works a lot
easier<00:05:25.260> in<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.410> old<00:05:25.530> days<00:05:25.740> when<00:05:25.950> we<00:05:26.010> used<00:05:26.130> to

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
easier in the old days when we used to

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.640 
easier in the old days when we used to
take<00:05:27.270> measures<00:05:27.660> and<00:05:27.960> tram<00:05:28.230> gauges<00:05:28.740> all<00:05:28.980> that

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
take measures and tram gauges all that

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.130 
take measures and tram gauges all that
and<00:05:32.060> then<00:05:33.060> it<00:05:33.210> will<00:05:33.330> give<00:05:33.510> us<00:05:33.690> a<00:05:33.840> readout<00:05:34.080> a

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
and then it will give us a readout a

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.430 
and then it will give us a readout a
printout<00:05:37.140> of<00:05:38.420> the<00:05:39.420> points<00:05:39.870> that<00:05:40.050> we're

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
printout of the points that we're

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.230 
printout of the points that we're
measuring<00:05:40.680> and<00:05:42.050> let<00:05:43.050> us<00:05:43.170> know<00:05:43.790> if<00:05:44.790> we<00:05:45.090> have

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
measuring and let us know if we have

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.100 
measuring and let us know if we have
pulled<00:05:46.020> it<00:05:46.200> far<00:05:46.470> enough<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:47.690> the<00:05:48.690> vehicles

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
pulled it far enough and the vehicles

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:58.690 
pulled it far enough and the vehicles
back<00:05:49.320> into<00:05:50.000> specifications<00:05:51.000> by<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.240> factory
