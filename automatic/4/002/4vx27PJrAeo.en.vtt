amazing stuff I'm going to do maybe with

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.130 
amazing stuff I'm going to do maybe with
a<00:01:44.040> kitchen<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.360> pieces<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.899> this

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
a kitchen if I have pieces like this

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.590 
a kitchen if I have pieces like this
they'll<00:01:46.439> obviously<00:01:46.649> get<00:01:47.009> windows<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:48.090> inside

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
they'll obviously get windows on inside

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.100 
they'll obviously get windows on inside
for<00:01:49.729> I'll<00:01:50.729> put<00:01:50.909> another<00:01:50.939> layer<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.720> here

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
for I'll put another layer on here

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.530 
for I'll put another layer on here
though<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.640> I'll<00:01:53.640> put<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.000> under<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.479> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
though and I'll put this under so you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.940 
though and I'll put this under so you
see<00:01:54.780> how<00:01:54.950> high<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.340> would<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.700> home

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.850 

Jin<00:02:00.159> would<00:02:00.369> be<00:02:00.549> like<00:02:00.729> that<00:02:02.759> also<00:02:03.759> going<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.090> get

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.130 

be<00:02:08.860> like<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.580> think<00:02:10.360> that's<00:02:10.629> good<00:02:10.929> but

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
be like that I think that's good but

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.720 
be like that I think that's good but
then<00:02:11.349> with<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.530> counters<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.160> might<00:02:12.340> just<00:02:12.519> put

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
then with the counters I might just put

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.479 
then with the counters I might just put
these<00:02:13.230> instead<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.379> that<00:02:14.530> other<00:02:14.560> thing<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.280> I

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
these instead of that other thing that I

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:24.420 
these instead of that other thing that I
asked<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:15.940> about<00:02:16.200> um<00:02:22.019> sure<00:02:23.040> archway<00:02:24.040> windows

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
stays perfectly fine but anyway if I

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.979 
stays perfectly fine but anyway if I
could<00:04:16.560> just<00:04:16.590> switch<00:04:17.010> out<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.400> inside<00:04:18.030> too<00:04:18.510> so

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
could just switch out the inside too so

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.979 
could just switch out the inside too so
there's<00:04:19.980> nothing<00:04:20.160> big<00:04:20.459> there<00:04:20.670> ah<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:21.239> got<00:04:21.750> some

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
i figured if i put it in like the office

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.460 
i figured if i put it in like the office
or<00:04:28.620> something<00:04:28.830> over<00:04:29.250> here<00:04:30.260> button<00:04:31.260> right

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
or something over here button right

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.410 
or something over here button right
there<00:04:31.790> yeah<00:04:32.790> i<00:04:33.270> think<00:04:33.540> that<00:04:33.720> look<00:04:33.990> nice<00:04:34.140> so<00:04:35.420> um

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420

oh they don't fit now but that kind of
sucks<00:04:42.090> i<00:04:42.300> guess<00:04:42.480> i<00:04:42.600> could<00:04:42.660> build<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.140> into<00:04:43.410> a

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
sucks i guess i could build that into a

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.390 
sucks i guess i could build that into a
wall<00:04:43.740> really<00:04:45.530> as<00:04:46.530> you<00:04:46.680> can<00:04:46.770> see<00:04:47.010> there<00:04:47.190> it's

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.770 
wall really as you can see there it's
kind<00:04:47.700> of<00:04:47.790> built<00:04:48.090> in<00:04:48.240> your<00:04:48.419> long<00:04:49.250> like<00:04:50.250> that

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
kind of built in your long like that

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.590 
kind of built in your long like that
maybe<00:04:51.780> I'd<00:04:52.169> be<00:04:52.350> good<00:04:52.500> idea<00:04:52.770> to<00:04:52.950> go<00:04:53.100> Donna<00:04:53.600> but

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.430 
maybe I'd be good idea to go Donna but
um<00:04:55.130> what<00:04:56.130> I<00:04:56.190> really<00:04:56.490> would<00:04:56.640> like<00:04:56.820> concern<00:04:57.540> is
