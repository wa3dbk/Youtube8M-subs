00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.520
 here he is the John Deere forage harvester 7000 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.230
 the device is an added value superlative 13 tons is seven meters long 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.099
 and almost four meters high from a monster for the rough he can barely 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.910
 be the talk 24 centimeters thick rollers and the textile plant cut the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.560
 taken up to four millimeters small plants 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.660
 the huge is controlled more with a normal steering wheel and the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.380
 Joystick for the appropriate intentions from the cabin can the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.580
 Driver not only set the exact hex size but down to that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.539
 Measure grams exactly how Philipp grain grass or maize has already been processed 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.300
 The John Deere forage harvester is also the pride of farmer Tomas 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.030
 Schletterer just got his latest farm machine from the John Deere 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.670
 Representative picked up and drove them to the field for a first test drive 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.370
 far sea eating competitions failed now it can start immediately in the test to farmer 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.860
 Schletterer "Let the scythe in the shed and has its complete field in 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.630
 just under an hour 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.200
 And all thanks to this man Walter Winkler has the huge 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.610
 Forage harvester made such a tiny little bit just right for our farmers 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.950
 Schletterer who does it with his 1 80 in one to 87 yes even just two 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.470
 Centimeters tall 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.470
 who actually controlled the whole vehicle 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.280
 we the rain is quite a lot of value or main goal I am 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.860
 Main feature against beer on the appearance of the vehicle it was 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.160
 ultimately a model 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.680
 that one must also recognize as a guideline 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.240
 very important 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.070
 it is the individual parts i and the coloring of the model 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.640
 the detailed report always after the coloring and after the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.420
 Functionality to announce the players we have to represent 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.150
 the challenge was in this case 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.220
 at the knee plant this work is very filigree and up to the largest Nehberg 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.350
 what is being used at John Deere has a span of over new tenants 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.300
 as far as the chosen Prix can win 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.360
 and the Semira can not be quantified automatically the CDA is the must have been 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.280
 the moderators Christoph represent that was actually the challenge so 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.190
 simple is that at least looks easy 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.100
 The barn of Bauer Schlatterer is a whole lot smaller 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.139
 become 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:25.329
 it almost seems like he has to grow soon but in scale h0 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:26.369
 is not that a problem
