whatever<00:02:03.930> believe<00:02:04.890> mine<00:02:05.100> black<00:02:05.460> because<00:02:05.969> I

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
whatever believe mine black because I

like like people and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.220 
like like people and
okay<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.030> whenever<00:02:09.480> you're<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.870> game<00:02:09.990> you

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
okay so whenever you're in a game you

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.600 
okay so whenever you're in a game you
have<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.410> hotkey<00:02:10.680> that<00:02:11.010> you<00:02:11.100> hit<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.430> start

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
have a hotkey that you hit to start

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.760 
have a hotkey that you hit to start
recording<00:02:11.910> while<00:02:12.240> this<00:02:12.390> program<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.870> open<00:02:13.020> but

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.470 
recording while this program is open but
let's<00:02:13.950> say<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.220> game<00:02:14.400> has<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.850> hotkey<00:02:15.240> bound

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
let's say the game has that hotkey bound

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.780 
let's say the game has that hotkey bound
to<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> controlling<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.350> game<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.490> doesn't

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.880

work<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.180> start<00:02:18.360> recording<00:02:18.660> well<00:02:19.440> what<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.770> do

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
work to start recording well what you do

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.440
