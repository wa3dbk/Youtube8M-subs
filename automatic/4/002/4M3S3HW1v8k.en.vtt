00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.570 
it's kind of nice like if you can see
the<00:02:52.640> bunny<00:02:53.150> rabbit<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:54.710> can<00:02:54.890> change<00:02:55.160> the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
the bunny rabbit and you can change the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.840 
the bunny rabbit and you can change the
speed<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.840> when<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.680> compresses<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.459> it

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
speed of it when it compresses of it

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.540 
speed of it when it compresses of it
coming<00:02:59.120> back<00:02:59.420> out<00:03:00.130> can't<00:03:01.130> really<00:03:01.250> show<00:03:01.459> you

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
coming back out can't really show you

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.430 
coming back out can't really show you
here<00:03:01.760> because<00:03:01.910> when<00:03:02.420> it's<00:03:02.570> this<00:03:02.840> cold<00:03:03.140> the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
here because when it's this cold the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.930 
here because when it's this cold the
shocks<00:03:03.740> don't<00:03:04.310> even<00:03:04.580> work<00:03:06.459> this<00:03:07.459> feature<00:03:07.790> is

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
shocks don't even work this feature is

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.150 
shocks don't even work this feature is
called<00:03:08.209> lockout<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:09.440> if<00:03:09.560> you're<00:03:09.650> climbing<00:03:09.950> a

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
called lockout so if you're climbing a

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.040 
called lockout so if you're climbing a
hill<00:03:10.190> since<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:12.640> mountain<00:03:13.640> bike

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
hill since this is a a mountain bike

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.020 
hill since this is a a mountain bike
neither<00:03:15.050> downhill<00:03:15.650> when<00:03:16.580> you're<00:03:16.790> climbing

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
neither downhill when you're climbing

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.290 
neither downhill when you're climbing
hills<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:18.370> sometimes<00:03:19.370> it's<00:03:19.610> hard<00:03:19.880> for<00:03:20.180> you<00:03:20.239> to

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
hills you sometimes it's hard for you to

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.540 
hills you sometimes it's hard for you to
go<00:03:20.450> up<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.660> hill<00:03:20.690> because<00:03:21.020> the<00:03:22.010> shop<00:03:22.250> keeps

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
go up the hill because the shop keeps

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.240 
go up the hill because the shop keeps
compressing<00:03:23.239> while<00:03:23.630> you<00:03:23.720> go<00:03:23.840> up<00:03:23.989> you<00:03:24.260> can<00:03:25.010> lock

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
compressing while you go up you can lock

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.580 
compressing while you go up you can lock
it<00:03:25.459> out<00:03:25.550> and<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:25.970> will<00:03:26.239> stop<00:03:27.050> impressing<00:03:27.830> up

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
it out and it will stop impressing up

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.050 
it out and it will stop impressing up
then<00:03:30.590> over<00:03:30.739> there<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:32.350> preload<00:03:33.350> which<00:03:34.070> not

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
then over there is preload which not

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.729 
then over there is preload which not
quite<00:03:35.360> sure<00:03:35.390> what<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.810> is<00:03:35.900> but<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.230> think<00:03:36.560> you

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
quite sure what it is but I think you

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.400 
quite sure what it is but I think you
want<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.040> on<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:38.450> minus<00:03:38.810> not<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.530> plus<00:03:39.830> side

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
want it on the minus not the plus side

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.790 
want it on the minus not the plus side
so<00:03:42.410> 28<00:03:42.920> speed<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:43.670> there's<00:03:43.850> eight<00:03:44.090> here<00:03:44.800> and
