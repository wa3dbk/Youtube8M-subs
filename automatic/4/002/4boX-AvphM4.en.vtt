 Ferris wheel where blue cross today I train the 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.030
 subject without a doubt was not the game 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.580
 past in which he started losing the 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.320
 'cement machine' neither the party 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.490
 that is looming in front of the santos lagoon 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.640
 this Friday the topic was what both 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.860
 he wanted to comment say clarify joseph 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.160
 jesus crown because he told them the 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.240
 he really sat in the press room 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.700
 practically waited for a partner 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.980
 he threw the question but the speech as 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.260
 I had perfectly prepared I wanted 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.570
 clarify or clarify the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.520
 situation with miguel herrera and that 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.010
 famous interview let's listen with the 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.650
 attention I'm not happy with that clear 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.170
 our talk has been made public 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.140
 I had with him 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.059
 it really is something it was something personal something 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.059
 between one person and another which 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.840
 he always stays in the dressing room 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.479
 and it's been a while since this 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.970
 conversation that we had I do not make me kind 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.170
 not after speaking it initially with 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.530
 miguel that makes it public but good 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.150
 everyone has their point of view 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.799
 the person in charge answers me that no 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.930
 they were just little ones 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:27.210
 details that I hurried on some 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.310
 exits and well I told him the truth that 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.430
 I respect the decision of respect you 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.970
 decision and if you answer me and also you 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.450
 I want to say that no one has set me up to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.240
 impose someone and told me not 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.649
 well I said I respect your decision I like 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.330
 You always know it will always follow 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.950
 working 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.810
 I'm going to do to the classmates and the most 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.899
 important is the group I told you many 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.550
 thank you and ended the talk later 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.479
 also the doorman of the machine 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.789
 blue cross cement ceased to glimpse no 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.679
 I affirm it I do not affirm it although we wanted 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.770
 that really would commit but left 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.990
 see that a new one is difficult 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.640
 assistance to a possible call in the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.190
 National selection 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.769
 I also depend not on the sessions 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.230
 techniques like I 've always said I'm going 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.090
 to always be with the selection in this 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.330
 yes yes 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.490
 there was a lack of understanding between 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.060
 two people 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.150
 style and good I'll think about this 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.310
 moment I am unique exclusively 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.860
 concentrated in blue cross back and with 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.520
 you there are no major news the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.160
 training was a training 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.650
 normal where several members of the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.780
 blue cross team that stayed 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.970
 shooting at the goal in a 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.090
 really very, very relaxed atmosphere 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.370
 and fun reiterated this Friday 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.360
 will face the saints in the tower 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.360
 forward machine
