and<00:01:58.810> that<00:01:59.810> way<00:01:59.960> we<00:02:00.080> get<00:02:00.230> an<00:02:00.560> accurate

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
and that way we get an accurate

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.990 
and that way we get an accurate
representation<00:02:01.220> of<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.700> frames<00:02:02.330> per<00:02:02.510> second

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
representation of the frames per second

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.250

not<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.030> whole<00:02:05.270> lot<00:02:05.420> going<00:02:05.630> on<00:02:05.840> right<00:02:05.900> now<00:02:06.080> you

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
not a whole lot going on right now you

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.070 
not a whole lot going on right now you
see<00:02:06.500> we're<00:02:06.650> staying<00:02:06.950> about<00:02:07.160> 50<00:02:07.840> well<00:02:08.840> just

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
see we're staying about 50 well just

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.040 
see we're staying about 50 well just
over<00:02:09.560> 50<00:02:09.979> frames<00:02:10.190> per<00:02:10.520> second<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.600> this<00:02:11.840> is

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
over 50 frames per second and this is

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.120 
over 50 frames per second and this is
outside<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.280> lot<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.910> see<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.480> lot<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.660> dots

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
outside so a lot to see a lot of dots

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.240 
outside so a lot to see a lot of dots
debris<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.930> don't<00:02:17.930> actually<00:02:18.140> play<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.680> on<00:02:18.800> ultra

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
debris I don't actually play it on ultra

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.580 
debris I don't actually play it on ultra
I<00:02:19.430> just<00:02:19.610> wanted<00:02:19.820> to<00:02:19.880> run<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:20.360> in<00:02:20.810> ultra<00:02:21.290> just

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
I just wanted to run this in ultra just

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.470 
I just wanted to run this in ultra just
as<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.490> baseline<00:02:22.910> because<00:02:23.180> we're<00:02:23.300> going<00:02:23.420> to

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
as a baseline because we're going to

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.360 
as a baseline because we're going to
look<00:02:23.600> at<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.930> argument<00:02:24.650> over<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.920> radeon

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
look at the argument over the radeon

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.940 
look at the argument over the radeon
7950<00:02:26.150> nets<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:26.930> see<00:02:27.050> how<00:02:27.140> well<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.380> runs<00:02:27.709> it

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
7950 nets and see how well it runs it

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.940 
7950 nets and see how well it runs it
and<00:02:28.930> then<00:02:29.930> just<00:02:30.200> as<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.380> drink<00:02:30.680> we're<00:02:30.770> going<00:02:30.890> to

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
and then just as a drink we're going to

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.970 
and then just as a drink we're going to
run<00:02:31.160> some<00:02:31.190> crossfire<00:02:32.000> benchmarks<00:02:32.930> with<00:02:33.709> this

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
run some crossfire benchmarks with this

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.050 
run some crossfire benchmarks with this
car<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:35.830> 7950<00:02:36.830> as<00:02:37.550> they<00:02:37.730> do<00:02:37.790> crossfire

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
car and the 7950 as they do crossfire

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.810 
car and the 7950 as they do crossfire
also<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.390> ESRB<00:02:41.780> does<00:02:42.110> not<00:02:42.290> rate<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.830> comments

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
also the ESRB does not rate the comments

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.320 
also the ESRB does not rate the comments
section<00:02:44.270> of<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.510> window<00:02:44.810> left<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:46.330> nobody

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
section of the window left so nobody

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.280 
section of the window left so nobody
gets<00:02:47.420> me<00:02:47.630> if<00:02:47.750> somebody<00:02:48.020> says<00:02:48.260> something

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
gets me if somebody says something

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.790 
gets me if somebody says something
offensive

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.870 

again<00:02:55.800> anybody<00:02:56.160> want<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.340> watch<00:02:56.459> me<00:02:56.640> done

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
again anybody want to watch me done

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.550 
again anybody want to watch me done
probably<00:02:57.720> about<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.080> happen<00:02:58.260> any<00:02:58.680> second<00:02:59.250> now

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
probably about to happen any second now

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.520 
probably about to happen any second now
yet<00:03:01.560> all<00:03:01.680> I'm<00:03:01.800> trying<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.069> do<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.250> show<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
yet all I'm trying to do is show the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.040 
yet all I'm trying to do is show the
performance<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.310> games<00:03:05.489> giving<00:03:09.050> well

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
performance that the games giving well

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.920 
performance that the games giving well
at<00:03:10.860> least<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.160> keeps<00:03:11.190> me<00:03:11.459> with<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.700> flat<00:03:12.660> kill

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
at least that keeps me with a flat kill

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.500 
at least that keeps me with a flat kill
death<00:03:13.470> ratio<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.970> see<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.180> goes<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.450> the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
death ratio you see it goes in the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.870 
death ratio you see it goes in the
spring<00:03:15.690> like<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.930> locks<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.349> about<00:03:16.560> 60<00:03:18.050> but

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
spring like that locks it about 60 but

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.060 
spring like that locks it about 60 but

it may partly anything over 45 frames
per<00:03:33.500> second<00:03:33.950> is<00:03:34.130> smooth<00:03:34.580> but<00:03:35.030> that's<00:03:35.240> just<00:03:35.360> me

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
per second is smooth but that's just me

everybody's<00:03:36.140> different<00:03:37.600> but<00:03:38.600> anything<00:03:39.200> lower

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
everybody's different but anything lower

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:52.810 
everybody's different but anything lower
than<00:03:39.590> 45<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.280> can<00:03:40.370> really<00:03:40.790> tell<00:03:51.250> again<00:03:52.250> just

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
than 45 I can really tell again just

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.630 
than 45 I can really tell again just
running<00:03:53.030> around<00:03:53.770> not<00:03:54.770> really<00:03:55.100> doing<00:03:55.340> much<00:03:55.459> of

anything

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:18.060

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.220 

well<00:04:19.070> there<00:04:19.550> we<00:04:19.670> go<00:04:19.700> positive<00:04:20.450> killed<00:04:20.660> it<00:04:20.750> all

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
well there we go positive killed it all

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.650 
well there we go positive killed it all
right<00:04:21.500> guys<00:04:21.800> well<00:04:22.040> there's<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.370> look<00:04:22.660> real

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
right guys well there's a look real

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.520 
right guys well there's a look real
quick<00:04:23.690> at<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.380> performance<00:04:24.890> of<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.580> r9<00:04:26.530> 280x

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
quick at the performance of the r9 280x

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.350 
quick at the performance of the r9 280x
and<00:04:27.980> how<00:04:28.040> well<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.340> performs<00:04:28.640> a<00:04:28.790> battlefield<00:04:29.060> 4

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
and how well it performs a battlefield 4

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.270 
and how well it performs a battlefield 4
