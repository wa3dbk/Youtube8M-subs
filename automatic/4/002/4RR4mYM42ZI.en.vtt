know fpv stands for first-person view so

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.560 
know fpv stands for first-person view so
it<00:00:26.270> has<00:00:26.450> a<00:00:26.480> camera<00:00:27.050> on<00:00:27.170> it<00:00:27.200> that<00:00:28.010> actually

it has a camera on it that actually
records<00:00:29.570> and<00:00:29.810> sends<00:00:30.350> video<00:00:31.280> to<00:00:32.180> the

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
records and sends video to the

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.340 
records and sends video to the
transmitter<00:00:33.050> real<00:00:33.739> time<00:00:34.160> as<00:00:34.520> you<00:00:34.579> fly<00:00:35.350> when

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
transmitter real time as you fly when

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.229 
transmitter real time as you fly when
the<00:00:36.410> transmitter<00:00:36.920> has<00:00:37.010> this<00:00:37.309> really<00:00:37.520> nice<00:00:37.820> big

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
the transmitter has this really nice big

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.960 
the transmitter has this really nice big
screen<00:00:38.570> on<00:00:38.870> it<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:39.230> you<00:00:39.289> can<00:00:39.530> actually<00:00:39.820> look<00:00:40.820> at

only get about I've gotten like five or
six<00:01:47.779> minute<00:01:48.079> flights<00:01:48.409> this<00:01:48.709> thing<00:01:49.009> definitely

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
six minute flights this thing definitely

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.050 
six minute flights this thing definitely
uses<00:01:50.950> batteries<00:01:51.950> really<00:01:52.279> quick<00:01:52.549> just<00:01:52.849> being

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
uses batteries really quick just being

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.849 
uses batteries really quick just being
with<00:01:53.419> the<00:01:53.569> size<00:01:53.840> especially<00:01:54.649> if<00:01:54.740> you've<00:01:54.829> got

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
with the size especially if you've got

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.789 
with the size especially if you've got
the<00:01:55.130> protective<00:01:55.639> frame<00:01:55.909> on<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:56.630> then<00:01:57.319> to

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
the protective frame on it and then to

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.359 
the protective frame on it and then to
send<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.399> video<00:01:58.909> back<00:01:59.619> this<00:02:00.619> is<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.009> antenna

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
send the video back this is the antenna

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.300 
send the video back this is the antenna
here<00:02:01.759> I<00:02:02.139> believe<00:02:03.139> that<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:03.679> know<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:03.950> takes

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
here I believe that you know that takes

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.669 
here I believe that you know that takes
up<00:02:04.549> some<00:02:04.789> battery<00:02:05.119> power<00:02:05.389> to<00:02:05.539> set<00:02:06.020> an<00:02:06.109> fpv

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
up some battery power to set an fpv

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.219 
up some battery power to set an fpv
signal<00:02:07.159> back<00:02:07.429> to<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:07.669> transmitter<00:02:08.239> and<00:02:08.539> then

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
signal back to the transmitter and then

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.110 
signal back to the transmitter and then
the<00:02:09.319> transmitter<00:02:09.800> itself<00:02:10.190> also<00:02:10.789> goes<00:02:11.090> through

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
the transmitter itself also goes through

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.860 
the transmitter itself also goes through
batteries<00:02:11.810> quite<00:02:12.110> quick<00:02:12.560> having<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.160> big

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
batteries quite quick having this big

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.230 
batteries quite quick having this big
backlit<00:02:14.870> LCD<00:02:15.110> screen<00:02:15.830> on<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.670> only<00:02:16.850> takes

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
backlit LCD screen on it it only takes

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.420 
backlit LCD screen on it it only takes
four<00:02:17.600> double<00:02:17.990> A<00:02:18.080> batteries<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:18.890> suggest

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
four double A batteries so I suggest

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.449 
four double A batteries so I suggest
getting<00:02:19.550> some<00:02:19.880> rechargeable<00:02:20.540> bad

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
getting some rechargeable bad

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.710 
getting some rechargeable bad
because<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.640> will<00:02:22.790> go<00:02:22.970> through<00:02:23.000> batteries

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
because you will go through batteries

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.619 
because you will go through batteries
very<00:02:24.049> quick<00:02:24.409> with<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:24.739> transmitter<00:02:25.629> there

is<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.780> slot<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.439> you<00:02:27.470> can<00:02:27.560> put<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.890> micro<00:02:28.280> SD

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
is a slot that you can put a micro SD

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.970 
is a slot that you can put a micro SD
card<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.299> does<00:02:29.510> not<00:02:29.720> come<00:02:30.049> with<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.439> card<00:02:30.680> but

know you can look at it really easily
and<00:02:58.400> your<00:02:58.909> hands<00:02:59.239> don't<00:02:59.540> block<00:02:59.870> it<00:03:00.109> or

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
and your hands don't block it or

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.059 
and your hands don't block it or
anything

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
anything

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.509 
anything
I<00:03:01.209> do<00:03:02.209> wish<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:03.170> could<00:03:03.409> change<00:03:04.190> the

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
I do wish that you could change the

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.879 
I do wish that you could change the
angle<00:03:05.000> like<00:03:05.209> if<00:03:05.329> it<00:03:05.450> had<00:03:05.599> a<00:03:05.629> little<00:03:05.930> mechanism

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
angle like if it had a little mechanism

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.770 
angle like if it had a little mechanism
that<00:03:07.280> allowed<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.730> tilt<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.209> change<00:03:08.510> because

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
that allowed the tilt to change because

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.190 
that allowed the tilt to change because
I<00:03:08.959> did<00:03:09.170> find<00:03:09.560> sometimes<00:03:09.889> that<00:03:10.459> my<00:03:10.639> my<00:03:11.629> low

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
I did find sometimes that my my low

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.170 
I did find sometimes that my my low
angle<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.650> held<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.189> transmitter<00:03:13.730> wasn't

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
angle I held the transmitter wasn't

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.030 
angle I held the transmitter wasn't
exactly<00:03:14.510> ultimate<00:03:15.170> for<00:03:15.409> viewing<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.889> screen

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
exactly ultimate for viewing the screen

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.179 
exactly ultimate for viewing the screen
and<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.299> also<00:03:17.450> wish<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.959> had<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:20.409> loop<00:03:21.409> strap<00:03:21.859> like

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
and I also wish it had a loop strap like

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.449 
and I also wish it had a loop strap like
her<00:03:23.000> strap<00:03:23.450> loops<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.079> you<00:03:24.139> can<00:03:24.379> connect<00:03:25.340> a

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
her strap loops so you can connect a

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.520 
her strap loops so you can connect a
neck<00:03:25.730> strap<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.359> it<00:03:26.389> and<00:03:26.750> you<00:03:26.989> know<00:03:27.109> put<00:03:27.410> your

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
neck strap to it and you know put your

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.289 
neck strap to it and you know put your
neck<00:03:27.799> strap<00:03:28.099> on<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.579> not<00:03:28.760> have<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:29.120> worry

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
neck strap on and not have to worry

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.789 
neck strap on and not have to worry
about<00:03:29.449> dropping<00:03:29.870> this<00:03:30.260> because<00:03:30.650> you

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
about dropping this because you

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.800 
about dropping this because you
definitely<00:03:30.980> don't<00:03:31.250> want<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.519> drop<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:32.000> it's

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
definitely don't want to drop it it's

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.430 
definitely don't want to drop it it's
all<00:03:32.959> plastic<00:03:33.620> it's<00:03:33.799> not<00:03:34.510> super<00:03:35.510> durable<00:03:35.840> it's

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
all plastic it's not super durable it's

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.170 
all plastic it's not super durable it's
you<00:03:36.709> know<00:03:36.829> plastic<00:03:37.099> nimble's<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:37.909> everything

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
you know plastic nimble's and everything

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.059 
you know plastic nimble's and everything
but<00:03:38.329> it<00:03:38.419> does<00:03:38.599> feel<00:03:38.870> nice<00:03:39.169> and<00:03:39.199> it<00:03:39.560> works<00:03:39.769> well

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
but it does feel nice and it works well

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.490 
but it does feel nice and it works well
I<00:03:40.519> mean<00:03:41.120> you've<00:03:41.269> got<00:03:41.480> dual<00:03:41.750> rates<00:03:42.079> you<00:03:42.409> know

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
I mean you've got dual rates you know

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.289 
I mean you've got dual rates you know
you<00:03:42.620> can<00:03:42.739> change<00:03:42.980> between<00:03:43.190> normal<00:03:43.639> and<00:03:43.879> expert

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
you can change between normal and expert

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.990 
you can change between normal and expert
mode<00:03:44.510> with<00:03:44.750> clicking<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.230> right<00:03:45.409> stick<00:03:46.000> and

mode with clicking the right stick and

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.250 
mode with clicking the right stick and
there's<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.239> lot<00:03:47.480> of<00:03:47.629> different<00:03:48.049> you<00:03:48.109> can

there's a lot of different you can

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.449 
there's a lot of different you can
change<00:03:48.560> all<00:03:48.799> the<00:03:48.919> rates<00:03:49.159> and<00:03:49.400> everything

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459

so<00:04:01.159> be<00:04:01.310> sure<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.549> keep<00:04:01.849> your<00:04:02.030> eye<00:04:02.060> out<00:04:02.180> for<00:04:02.359> that

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
so be sure to keep your eye out for that

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.740 
so be sure to keep your eye out for that
I<00:04:03.549> think<00:04:04.549> really<00:04:04.760> that's<00:04:04.970> about<00:04:05.180> all<00:04:05.329> I<00:04:05.419> had<00:04:05.629> to

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
I think really that's about all I had to

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.860 
I think really that's about all I had to
say<00:04:05.959> about<00:04:05.989> it<00:04:06.319> in<00:04:07.280> this<00:04:07.519> video<00:04:07.879> so<00:04:08.329> let's<00:04:08.359> go

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
say about it in this video so let's go

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.379 
say about it in this video so let's go
check<00:04:09.079> out<00:04:09.199> some<00:04:09.229> flight<00:04:09.560> footage<00:04:10.389> alright

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
check out some flight footage alright

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.629 
check out some flight footage alright
this<00:04:11.510> is<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.750> indoor<00:04:12.440> flight<00:04:12.919> review<00:04:13.340> of<00:04:13.489> the

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
this is the indoor flight review of the

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.319 
this is the indoor flight review of the
hubsan<00:04:13.879> fpv<00:04:14.750> x4<00:04:15.669> I'm<00:04:16.669> just<00:04:16.849> going<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.060> try<00:04:17.269> to

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
hubsan fpv x4 I'm just going to try to

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.210 
hubsan fpv x4 I'm just going to try to
do<00:04:17.539> a<00:04:17.570> little<00:04:17.780> flying<00:04:18.199> here<00:04:18.560> in<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.739> kitchen

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220

if you want to see a more traditional
outdoor<00:04:23.630> fpv<00:04:24.560> flight<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:25.220> already<00:04:26.000> uploaded

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
outdoor fpv flight I already uploaded

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.589 
outdoor fpv flight I already uploaded
one<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.250> check<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.430> video<00:04:28.699> description<00:04:28.729> for

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
one so check the video description for

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.500 
one so check the video description for
the<00:04:29.659> link<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:30.139> that<00:04:30.289> so<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:30.680> can<00:04:30.919> see<00:04:31.510> what

the link to that so you can see what

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.360 
the link to that so you can see what
this<00:04:32.659> thing<00:04:32.960> flies<00:04:33.320> like<00:04:33.650> in

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
this thing flies like in

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.570 
this thing flies like in
actual<00:04:34.729> fpv<00:04:35.530> I'll<00:04:36.530> try<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:36.860> do<00:04:37.040> a<00:04:37.070> little<00:04:37.340> bit

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
actual fpv I'll try to do a little bit

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.000 
actual fpv I'll try to do a little bit
of<00:04:37.610> fpv<00:04:38.240> here<00:04:38.600> indoors<00:04:39.020> but<00:04:39.440> it's<00:04:39.560> pretty<00:04:39.740> hard

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
of fpv here indoors but it's pretty hard

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.760 
of fpv here indoors but it's pretty hard
inside<00:04:40.550> so<00:04:41.150> what<00:04:42.020> I'm<00:04:42.139> going<00:04:42.260> to<00:04:42.320> do<00:04:42.470> is<00:04:42.620> I'm

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
inside so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.100 
inside so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:04:42.800> to<00:04:42.979> just<00:04:43.130> start<00:04:43.370> recording<00:04:43.550> video<00:04:44.360> on

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
going to just start recording video on

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.890 
going to just start recording video on
the<00:04:45.949> transmitter<00:04:46.790> and<00:04:47.090> I'll<00:04:47.180> put<00:04:47.389> that<00:04:47.600> in<00:04:47.660> the

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
the transmitter and I'll put that in the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.689 
the transmitter and I'll put that in the
picture<00:04:48.440> in<00:04:48.590> picture<00:04:48.620> so<00:04:49.250> you<00:04:49.310> can<00:04:49.400> get<00:04:49.610> an

picture in picture so you can get an

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.670 
picture in picture so you can get an
idea<00:04:50.060> of<00:04:50.150> what<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:50.660> recorded<00:04:51.139> video<00:04:51.260> looks

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
idea of what the recorded video looks

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.280 
idea of what the recorded video looks
like<00:04:52.240> but<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.360> start<00:04:53.600> I'm<00:04:53.750> just<00:04:53.930> going<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.110> show

you how it flies and as you can see it
is<00:04:56.840> just<00:04:57.010> insanely<00:04:58.030> stable<00:04:59.770> really<00:05:00.770> nice<00:05:01.250> slow

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
is just insanely stable really nice slow

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:09.830 
is just insanely stable really nice slow
flying<00:05:04.270> just<00:05:05.270> really<00:05:05.690> precise

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.770 

so<00:05:10.380> just<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.770> really<00:05:11.180> really<00:05:12.180> nice<00:05:12.360> flying

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
so just a really really nice flying

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.340 
so just a really really nice flying
little<00:05:13.050> quadcopter<00:05:13.950> so<00:05:14.700> now<00:05:14.880> let's<00:05:15.090> try<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.420> do

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
little quadcopter so now let's try to do

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.340 
little quadcopter so now let's try to do
some<00:05:16.620> fpv<00:05:17.280> it<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:18.930> hard<00:05:19.320> to<00:05:19.530> do<00:05:20.090> indoors

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
some fpv it is hard to do indoors

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.029 
some fpv it is hard to do indoors
there's<00:05:22.350> my<00:05:22.590> flight<00:05:22.889> test<00:05:23.220> shirt

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.809 

oh<00:05:27.069> my<00:05:27.729> gosh<00:05:27.909> it's<00:05:28.240> so<00:05:28.830> it's<00:05:29.830> so<00:05:30.039> weird

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
oh my gosh it's so it's so weird

oh my gosh it's so it's so weird
I<00:05:30.939> got<00:05:31.180> a<00:05:31.210> cheat<00:05:31.749> so<00:05:32.740> yeah<00:05:32.949> it's<00:05:33.369> easier<00:05:33.879> when

00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:34.119 
I got a cheat so yeah it's easier when

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:36.719 
I got a cheat so yeah it's easier when
you<00:05:34.270> can<00:05:34.449> stay<00:05:35.020> indoors<00:05:35.589> and<00:05:36.129> kind<00:05:36.369> of<00:05:36.460> keep

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
you can stay indoors and kind of keep

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.019 
you can stay indoors and kind of keep
some<00:05:37.089> forward<00:05:37.860> momentum<00:05:38.860> when<00:05:39.580> you're<00:05:39.759> trying

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:40.029 
some forward momentum when you're trying

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:43.920 
some forward momentum when you're trying
to<00:05:40.240> just<00:05:40.599> do<00:05:40.899> fpv<00:05:41.619> just<00:05:42.009> hovering<00:05:42.669> and<00:05:43.029> in<00:05:43.779> a

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
to just do fpv just hovering and in a

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.170 
to just do fpv just hovering and in a
small<00:05:44.289> area<00:05:44.649> it<00:05:45.129> gets<00:05:45.460> it<00:05:45.939> gets<00:05:45.999> pretty<00:05:46.569> tricky

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
small area it gets it gets pretty tricky

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.989 
small area it gets it gets pretty tricky
especially<00:05:49.180> when<00:05:49.779> you're<00:05:50.520> facing<00:05:51.520> yourself

00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:51.999 
especially when you're facing yourself

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:57.719 
especially when you're facing yourself
oh<00:05:52.860> I'm<00:05:53.860> running<00:05:54.039> into<00:05:54.399> something<00:05:56.129> it<00:05:57.129> is<00:05:57.430> fun

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
oh I'm running into something it is fun

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.339 
oh I'm running into something it is fun
the<00:05:58.319> all<00:05:59.319> right<00:05:59.469> back<00:05:59.770> to<00:05:59.919> normal

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
the all right back to normal

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:06.540 
the all right back to normal
let's<00:06:02.349> put<00:06:02.529> it<00:06:02.589> on<00:06:02.620> expert<00:06:03.159> mode<00:06:05.129> turn<00:06:06.129> flips

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
let's put it on expert mode turn flips

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.269 
let's put it on expert mode turn flips
off<00:06:06.759> so<00:06:07.059> I'll<00:06:07.240> accidentally<00:06:07.719> flip<00:06:08.110> so<00:06:08.949> you<00:06:09.159> can

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
off so I'll accidentally flip so you can

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:12.119 
off so I'll accidentally flip so you can
see<00:06:09.460> you<00:06:09.580> can<00:06:09.759> get<00:06:09.939> it<00:06:10.360> can<00:06:10.509> get<00:06:10.659> quick<00:06:11.129> that's

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
see you can get it can get quick that's

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:16.019 
see you can get it can get quick that's
for<00:06:12.520> sure<00:06:13.469> nice<00:06:14.469> very<00:06:15.129> fast<00:06:15.550> stable

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:16.029 
for sure nice very fast stable

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:18.299 
for sure nice very fast stable
pirouettes<00:06:16.749> oh<00:06:17.020> my<00:06:17.199> gosh<00:06:17.379> the<00:06:17.740> screens<00:06:18.099> going

00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:18.309 
pirouettes oh my gosh the screens going

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:23.389 
pirouettes oh my gosh the screens going
crazy

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:23.399 

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:26.600 

so<00:06:24.399> yeah<00:06:24.520> I'll<00:06:24.580> probably<00:06:24.729> do<00:06:25.089> some<00:06:25.389> more<00:06:25.419> fpv

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
so yeah I'll probably do some more fpv

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.579
