00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
that the system is turning on so in the

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.200 
that the system is turning on so in the
full<00:00:07.770> boot<00:00:08.010> up<00:00:08.130> sequence<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.670> game<00:00:08.849> for

full boot up sequence of the game for
the<00:00:09.330> record<00:00:09.630> account<00:00:09.900> so<00:00:10.110> there's<00:00:10.320> my<00:00:10.469> TV

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
the record account so there's my TV

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.200 
the record account so there's my TV
there's<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.340> system<00:00:11.820> turning<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:14.089> there<00:00:15.089> we

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
there's a system turning it on there we

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.859 
there's a system turning it on there we
go<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:15.990> prop<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.560> up<00:00:16.770> again<00:00:17.359> use<00:00:18.359> waverace

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
go so I prop this up again use waverace

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.779 
go so I prop this up again use waverace
to<00:00:19.140> prop<00:00:19.350> up<00:00:19.529> my<00:00:19.590> camera<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:22.400> we'll<00:00:23.400> try<00:00:23.670> again

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
to prop up my camera and we'll try again

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:40.160 
to prop up my camera and we'll try again
for<00:00:24.180> another<00:00:24.330> record<00:00:36.770> board<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.930> I'm<00:00:40.050> gonna

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
for another record board and I'm gonna

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.770 
for another record board and I'm gonna
choose<00:00:40.530> halfway<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:42.390> hopefully<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:44.600> can<00:00:45.600> break

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
choose halfway so hopefully I can break

00:00:45.780 --> 00:01:15.770 
choose halfway so hopefully I can break
it<00:00:45.930> again

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.760 

and<00:01:16.380> how<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.600> get<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.990> start<00:01:19.230> I'm<00:01:19.560> doing

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and how you can get the start I'm doing

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:36.690 
and how you can get the start I'm doing
too<00:01:19.920> good<00:01:20.070> right<00:01:20.250> now

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.660 

laughs<00:01:38.980> forty-eight<00:01:39.980> thousand<00:01:40.520> two<00:01:40.640> hundred

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
laughs forty-eight thousand two hundred

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.340 
laughs forty-eight thousand two hundred
and<00:01:41.060> something<00:01:41.480> plus<00:01:41.690> that<00:01:41.840> final<00:01:42.140> trick

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
and something plus that final trick

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.230 
and something plus that final trick
would<00:01:42.500> have<00:01:42.590> put<00:01:42.740> me<00:01:42.860> over<00:01:42.890> fifty<00:01:43.340> one<00:01:43.550> but<00:01:44.000> I

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
would have put me over fifty one but I

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
would have put me over fifty one but I
ran<00:01:44.420> out<00:01:44.510> of<00:01:44.570> time<00:01:44.810> let's<00:01:45.770> try<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.010> again

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
ran out of time let's try it again

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.420 
ran out of time let's try it again
that's<00:01:48.260> what<00:01:48.410> always<00:01:48.530> gets<00:01:48.650> me<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.190> damn

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
that's what always gets me is the damn

00:01:49.430 --> 00:02:07.289 
that's what always gets me is the damn
time<00:01:49.760> limit<00:01:50.090> at<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.300> end

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:38.949 

our<00:02:07.840> momentum

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.250 

there<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.709> go<00:02:40.150> fifty<00:02:41.150> nine<00:02:41.359> thousand<00:02:42.170> one

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
there you go fifty nine thousand one

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.640 
there you go fifty nine thousand one
hundred<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.799> twenty<00:02:43.219> four<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:46.310> I

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
hundred and twenty four so that is I

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.170 
hundred and twenty four so that is I
don't<00:02:48.650> like<00:02:48.890> twelve<00:02:49.219> thousand<00:02:49.700> more<00:02:49.879> than<00:02:50.060> the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
don't like twelve thousand more than the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.259 
don't like twelve thousand more than the
current<00:02:50.450> record<00:02:50.629> that's<00:02:50.989> on<00:02:51.109> Twin<00:02:51.349> Galaxies

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
is the new real world record so thanks

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.539 
is the new real world record so thanks
for<00:03:33.290> watching<00:03:33.650> guys<00:03:33.799> I'm<00:03:34.069> gonna<00:03:34.189> have<00:03:34.400> to

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
for watching guys I'm gonna have to

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.860 
for watching guys I'm gonna have to
compress<00:03:34.939> this<00:03:35.090> video<00:03:35.389> to<00:03:35.510> under<00:03:35.689> ten

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
compress this video to under ten

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.679 
compress this video to under ten
megabytes<00:03:36.290> so<00:03:36.469> that<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:36.829> fits<00:03:37.569> with<00:03:38.569> the

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:38.689 
megabytes so that it fits with the

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:40.509 
megabytes so that it fits with the
submission<00:03:38.989> guidelines<00:03:39.349> between<00:03:39.950> galaxies

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
submission guidelines between galaxies

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.309 
submission guidelines between galaxies
so<00:03:40.819> when<00:03:41.450> I<00:03:41.480> upload<00:03:41.840> this<00:03:42.019> it's<00:03:42.230> probably

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
so when I upload this it's probably

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.140 
so when I upload this it's probably
gonna<00:03:42.560> be<00:03:42.620> really<00:03:42.709> really<00:03:43.159> small<00:03:43.579> but<00:03:43.879> then

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
gonna be really really small but then

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.300 
gonna be really really small but then
probably<00:03:44.479> bad<00:03:44.629> quality<00:03:45.139> but<00:03:45.379> anyways<00:03:46.069> there

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
probably bad quality but anyways there

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.409 
probably bad quality but anyways there
it<00:03:46.400> is<00:03:46.489> guys<00:03:46.699> thanks<00:03:47.060> a<00:03:47.120> lot<00:03:47.150> for<00:03:47.239> watching
