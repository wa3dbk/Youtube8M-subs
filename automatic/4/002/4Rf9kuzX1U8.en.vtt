00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.710
 Evil is so fate and cruel sentence, 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:38.700
 How could I send you? Only my fault 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.000
 your punishment. Harmony is gone again. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 But I will give you a song in silence And I will be with you again. 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.399
 Close your eyes, listen to a lullaby 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.399
 And you can sleep peacefully. 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.770
 Suddenly a pony came out, like the sun blinding, 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.000
 And looking at the kingdom, sighing, she smiled and said: 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.200
 "No pony is more beautiful and just loved 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.600
 than me." 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.200
 And her reign was so brilliant 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:57.349
 That long shadow cast. But she fell on her sister, that 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:02.110
 darker And made the nights and days of 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.810
 darker. 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.540
 Sleep well my sister, 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:19.500
 Rest in the light of the Moon, Let the lullaby fly away 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.500
 In the distance, Through the cold and darkness from the earth. 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:36.100
 Peace and coolness carry night And my grief behind you. 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.110
 Luna, you did not know my love, 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.810
 Sorry for being so blind. 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.000
 Soon, she noticed a pony 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.200
 What glory sister went around. Love is not well deserved 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.200
 To her, 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.400
 And I saw her pain only grew. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.300
 The path to the spotlight was too sweet, 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:26.400
 He will capture the mind as an enemy. And the stupid pony did not interfere 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.910
 To destroy yourself the one that needed her so. 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.240
 Sleep well my sister, 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:45.240
 In the light of the moon rest. 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.700
 Let the lullaby fly away, Through cold and darkness from the earth. 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.700
 Peace and coolness carry night 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.300
 And my grief behind me. 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.650
 Luna, you did not know my love, 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.200
 Maybe your mind does not know the trouble. 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.800
 And forgive me for being so blind. 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:56.800
 In the years before us Fear and total darkness. 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:07.400
 I did not even think about facing it like this 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:18.100
 Let the winters of snowy hundreds Reach quickly, I pray. 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:31.200
 I love, miss and sing to you. 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:53.300
 And today you will sleep, Moonlight is as soft as a bed. 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:11.900
 And again forgetting the pain and sadness I fall asleep, and taking off, I aspire to you. 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:31.300
 Sleep ...
