00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:04.720 
hey guys my name is average Gatsby and

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.789 
hey guys my name is average Gatsby and
I'm<00:00:05.259> making<00:00:05.650> a<00:00:06.150> video<00:00:07.150> on<00:00:07.600> singularity<00:00:08.440> real

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:08.799 
I'm making a video on singularity real

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:11.939 
I'm making a video on singularity real
quick<00:00:09.209> but<00:00:10.209> just<00:00:10.509> showing<00:00:11.139> you<00:00:11.200> that<00:00:11.349> I<00:00:11.829> am

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:11.949 
quick but just showing you that I am

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:18.020 
quick but just showing you that I am
playing<00:00:12.369> on<00:00:12.549> sanity<00:00:13.179> and<00:00:15.299> yeah<00:00:16.299> so<00:00:16.620> basically

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 
playing on sanity and yeah so basically

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.670 
playing on sanity and yeah so basically
right<00:00:19.030> here<00:00:19.210> i'm<00:00:19.330> showing<00:00:19.630> that<00:00:20.560> i'm<00:00:20.650> using

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
right here i'm showing that i'm using

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.970 
right here i'm showing that i'm using
zayeed<00:00:21.370> with<00:00:21.580> the<00:00:22.020> m-29<00:00:23.020> sniper<00:00:23.350> rifle<00:00:23.770> I

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
zayeed with the m-29 sniper rifle I

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.520 
zayeed with the m-29 sniper rifle I
think<00:00:24.550> your<00:00:25.240> squad<00:00:25.510> mates<00:00:25.540> if<00:00:25.900> they<00:00:26.050> can<00:00:26.230> use<00:00:26.500> a

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
think your squad mates if they can use a

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.279 
think your squad mates if they can use a
sniper<00:00:26.860> rifle<00:00:27.250> there's<00:00:27.910> nothing<00:00:28.240> better<00:00:28.390> a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
sniper rifle there's nothing better a

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.429 
sniper rifle there's nothing better a
plane<00:00:29.920> has<00:00:29.950> a<00:00:30.100> depth<00:00:30.520> and<00:00:30.789> I<00:00:31.570> think<00:00:32.020> I'm<00:00:32.169> level

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
plane has a depth and I think I'm level

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.700 
plane has a depth and I think I'm level
four<00:00:32.739> right<00:00:33.460> here<00:00:33.489> but<00:00:34.379> can't<00:00:35.379> say<00:00:35.499> for<00:00:35.559> sure

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
four right here but can't say for sure

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.450 
four right here but can't say for sure
up<00:00:36.339> on<00:00:36.489> my<00:00:36.579> guys<00:00:36.760> up<00:00:36.940> there<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:39.100> know<00:00:39.129> they<00:00:39.309> get

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
up on my guys up there you know they get

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.299 
up on my guys up there you know they get
a<00:00:39.489> full<00:00:39.699> field<00:00:39.909> of<00:00:40.030> fire<00:00:40.239> and<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:41.739> I<00:00:41.920> eat<00:00:42.100> just

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
a full field of fire and as I eat just

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.410 
a full field of fire and as I eat just
rapes<00:00:42.789> with<00:00:42.999> that<00:00:43.530> sniper<00:00:44.530> rifle<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:45.219> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
rapes with that sniper rifle and the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.290 
rapes with that sniper rifle and the
disruptor<00:00:46.420> I'm<00:00:46.539> oh<00:00:46.690> so<00:00:47.010> anyway<00:00:48.010> what<00:00:48.760> I<00:00:48.789> am

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
disruptor I'm oh so anyway what I am

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.340 
disruptor I'm oh so anyway what I am
trying<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:49.929> show<00:00:49.989> here<00:00:50.199> is<00:00:50.710> that<00:00:51.489> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
trying to show here is that a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.520 
trying to show here is that a
singularity<00:00:53.350> actually<00:00:54.129> does<00:00:55.089> affect<00:00:55.659> no

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
singularity actually does affect no

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.209 
singularity actually does affect no
matter<00:00:56.769> if<00:00:57.639> they<00:00:58.059> have<00:00:58.179> barrier<00:00:58.719> armor<00:00:59.530> or

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
matter if they have barrier armor or

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.849 
matter if they have barrier armor or
shield<00:01:00.519> on<00:01:00.760> it<00:01:00.969> doesn't<00:01:01.569> do<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.899> same<00:01:02.229> it

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
shield on it doesn't do the same it

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.799 
shield on it doesn't do the same it
doesn't<00:01:03.100> do<00:01:03.159> the<00:01:03.249> same<00:01:03.489> thing<00:01:03.789> like<00:01:04.690> it's

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
doesn't do the same thing like it's

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.560 
doesn't do the same thing like it's
supposed<00:01:04.989> to<00:01:05.140> but<00:01:05.940> you<00:01:06.940> know<00:01:07.000> see<00:01:07.180> right<00:01:07.360> there

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
supposed to but you know see right there

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.690 
supposed to but you know see right there
he<00:01:07.600> didn't<00:01:07.930> have<00:01:08.020> any<00:01:08.110> shield<00:01:08.350> on<00:01:08.560> so<00:01:08.860> you<00:01:09.580> know

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
he didn't have any shield on so you know

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.510 
he didn't have any shield on so you know
everyone<00:01:10.180> knows<00:01:10.360> about<00:01:10.540> that<00:01:11.400> what<00:01:12.400> I'm

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
everyone knows about that what I'm

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.390 
everyone knows about that what I'm
trying<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.820> show<00:01:12.910> and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
trying to show and

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.600 
trying to show and
well<00:01:16.030> I'm<00:01:16.360> not<00:01:16.510> doing<00:01:16.810> it<00:01:16.930> yet<00:01:16.960> but<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:18.400> you<00:01:18.520> can

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
well I'm not doing it yet but as you can

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.450 
well I'm not doing it yet but as you can
see<00:01:18.820> as<00:01:19.060> I<00:01:19.210> did<00:01:19.360> with<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:19.800> m29<00:01:20.800> is<00:01:21.130> just

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
see as I did with that m29 is just

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.970 
see as I did with that m29 is just
ridiculous<00:01:22.360> it's<00:01:22.750> like<00:01:23.080> I<00:01:23.320> feel<00:01:23.530> like<00:01:23.830> they

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
ridiculous it's like I feel like they

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.800 
ridiculous it's like I feel like they
really<00:01:24.010> kicked<00:01:24.550> up<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.790> accuracy<00:01:25.300> for<00:01:25.690> them

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
really kicked up the accuracy for them

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.870 
really kicked up the accuracy for them
okay<00:01:26.260> now<00:01:26.380> look<00:01:26.530> at<00:01:26.740> look<00:01:27.340> at<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.550> guy<00:01:27.670> who's

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
okay now look at look at the guy who's

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.610 
okay now look at look at the guy who's
actually<00:01:28.060> being<00:01:28.390> hit<00:01:28.600> by<00:01:28.630> singularity<00:01:29.380> now<00:01:29.560> he

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
actually being hit by singularity now he

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.730 
actually being hit by singularity now he
has<00:01:29.860> full<00:01:30.130> shield<00:01:30.460> on<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:32.110> he's<00:01:32.320> totally

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
has full shield on but he's totally

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.890 
has full shield on but he's totally
incapacitated<00:01:33.370> it<00:01:34.180> just<00:01:34.330> keeps<00:01:34.420> bumping<00:01:34.690> him

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
incapacitated it just keeps bumping him

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.210 
incapacitated it just keeps bumping him
around<00:01:35.080> and<00:01:35.320> he's<00:01:35.500> trying<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.890> you<00:01:36.190> know

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
around and he's trying to you know

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.490 
around and he's trying to you know
because<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.670> AI<00:01:36.850> is<00:01:37.090> smarter<00:01:37.960> and<00:01:38.350> he's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
because the AI is smarter and he's

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.030 
because the AI is smarter and he's
trying<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:38.830> walk<00:01:39.040> out<00:01:39.280> of<00:01:39.400> it<00:01:39.550> but<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:41.050> this<00:01:41.980> is

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
trying to walk out of it but and this is

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.430 
trying to walk out of it but and this is
a<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.910> know<00:01:43.030> I've<00:01:43.300> got<00:01:43.570> one<00:01:43.900> point<00:01:44.200> in

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
a you know I've got one point in

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.930 
a you know I've got one point in
singularity<00:01:45.070> at<00:01:45.160> this<00:01:45.310> point<00:01:45.580> because<00:01:45.700> I'm

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
singularity at this point because I'm

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.690 
singularity at this point because I'm
solo<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.630> so<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:48.490> know<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:50.590> is<00:01:50.650> as<00:01:51.010> as<00:01:51.280> weak

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
solo and so you know this is as as weak

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.790 
solo and so you know this is as as weak
as<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:51.910> can<00:01:52.210> be<00:01:52.450> with<00:01:52.869> singularity<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.650> it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
as you can be with singularity and it

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.070 
as you can be with singularity and it
has<00:01:53.920> that<00:01:54.100> kind<00:01:54.250> of<00:01:54.340> effect<00:01:54.869> I'm<00:01:55.869> going<00:01:56.020> to

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
has that kind of effect I'm going to

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.120 
has that kind of effect I'm going to
show<00:01:56.400> later<00:01:57.400> on<00:01:57.640> how<00:01:58.260> all<00:01:59.260> right<00:01:59.470> here<00:01:59.740> boom

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
show later on how all right here boom

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.440 
show later on how all right here boom
just<00:02:01.060> blow<00:02:01.270> them<00:02:01.390> up<00:02:01.600> with<00:02:01.750> warp<00:02:03.240> I'm<00:02:04.240> going<00:02:04.360> to

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
just blow them up with warp I'm going to

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.480 
just blow them up with warp I'm going to
try<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.630> show<00:02:04.930> how<00:02:05.770> when<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.310> upgrade

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
try to show how when you upgrade

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.290 
try to show how when you upgrade
singularity<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:08.110> affects<00:02:08.470> more<00:02:08.679> than<00:02:08.770> one<00:02:09.040> guy

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
singularity it affects more than one guy

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.000 
singularity it affects more than one guy
just<00:02:10.300> because<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.860> AoE<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.700> singularity

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
just because that the AoE of singularity

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.699 
just because that the AoE of singularity
even<00:02:15.010> if<00:02:15.130> when<00:02:15.400> they<00:02:15.520> have<00:02:15.760> barrier<00:02:16.450> shield<00:02:17.380> or

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
even if when they have barrier shield or

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.690 
even if when they have barrier shield or
armor<00:02:18.070> on<00:02:18.989> increases<00:02:19.989> as<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.160> goes<00:02:21.280> on<00:02:21.459> but

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
armor on increases as it goes on but

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.150 
armor on increases as it goes on but
basically<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.900> know<00:02:23.019> I<00:02:23.230> see<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.680> lot<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:23.890> people

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
basically you know I see a lot of people

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.550 
basically you know I see a lot of people
in<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.310> forms<00:02:24.610> talking<00:02:25.060> about<00:02:25.209> how<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.720> know

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
in the forms talking about how you know

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.729 
in the forms talking about how you know
all<00:02:26.590> singularity<00:02:27.480> sucks<00:02:28.739> singularities

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
all singularity sucks singularities

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.690 
all singularity sucks singularities
worthless<00:02:30.250> same<00:02:30.880> as<00:02:31.030> pole<00:02:31.300> um<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:33.459> know<00:02:33.580> it's

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
worthless same as pole um you know it's

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.009 
worthless same as pole um you know it's
very<00:02:33.760> different<00:02:34.030> see<00:02:34.300> once<00:02:34.480> again<00:02:34.570> look<00:02:34.900> how

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
very different see once again look how

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.020 
very different see once again look how
he's<00:02:35.560> kind<00:02:35.769> of<00:02:35.800> being<00:02:35.920> stunned<00:02:36.280> like<00:02:36.550> it's

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
he's kind of being stunned like it's

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.970 
he's kind of being stunned like it's
like<00:02:37.239> he<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.989> know<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.140> walked<00:02:38.530> up<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.830> mail

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
like he you know I walked up and mail

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.580 
like he you know I walked up and mail
like<00:02:39.160> him<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.340> bunch<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:40.600> it's<00:02:40.780> really<00:02:40.989> you<00:02:41.500> know

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
like him a bunch so it's really you know

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.470 
like him a bunch so it's really you know
it's<00:02:41.709> really<00:02:41.830> useful<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.459> it<00:02:42.580> gets<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:43.180> hell<00:02:43.450> of

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
it's really useful and it gets a hell of

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.240 
it's really useful and it gets a hell of
a<00:02:43.630> lot<00:02:43.750> more<00:02:43.810> useful<00:02:44.140> when<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.800> upgrade<00:02:44.920> it

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
a lot more useful when you upgrade it

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.820 
a lot more useful when you upgrade it
and<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:46.480> know<00:02:46.510> don't<00:02:46.989> be<00:02:47.080> afraid<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.380> stick<00:02:47.680> it

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
and you know don't be afraid to stick it

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.040 
and you know don't be afraid to stick it
on<00:02:47.920> people

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
on people

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.780 
on people
have<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:50.160> know<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.400> got<00:02:50.640> shields<00:02:51.000> are<00:02:51.480> got<00:02:51.720> a

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
have you know the got shields are got a

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.920 
have you know the got shields are got a
armor<00:02:53.790> or<00:02:53.910> anything<00:02:54.270> like<00:02:54.300> that<00:02:54.450> because<00:02:54.780> it

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
armor or anything like that because it

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.140 
armor or anything like that because it
is<00:02:55.500> very<00:02:55.530> effective<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.760> cooldown<00:02:57.120> is

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
is very effective and the cooldown is

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.640 
is very effective and the cooldown is
pretty<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.930> know<00:02:57.960> it's<00:02:58.170> only<00:02:58.350> four<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.620> a

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
pretty you know it's only four and a

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.490 
pretty you know it's only four and a
half<00:02:58.680> seconds<00:02:59.220> drops<00:02:59.850> even<00:03:00.030> lower<00:03:00.360> as<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.230> go

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
half seconds drops even lower as you go

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.110 
half seconds drops even lower as you go
on<00:03:01.740> so<00:03:02.070> look<00:03:02.250> at<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.460> I<00:03:02.490> mean<00:03:02.730> like<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.090> know

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
on so look at that I mean like you know

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.610 
on so look at that I mean like you know
they<00:03:03.330> were<00:03:03.390> barely<00:03:03.630> even<00:03:03.840> those<00:03:04.320> two<00:03:04.470> guys

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
they were barely even those two guys

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.260 
they were barely even those two guys
really<00:03:05.070> even<00:03:05.250> able<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.820> get<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:05.970> shot<00:03:06.240> off

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
really even able to get a shot off

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.330 
really even able to get a shot off
because<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.900> one<00:03:07.080> guy<00:03:07.230> was<00:03:07.470> just<00:03:07.500> distracted

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
because the one guy was just distracted

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.690 
because the one guy was just distracted
by<00:03:08.780> singularity<00:03:09.800> like<00:03:10.800> that<00:03:12.020> so<00:03:13.020> yeah<00:03:13.700> just

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
by singularity like that so yeah just

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.090 
by singularity like that so yeah just
putting<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.180> out<00:03:15.360> there<00:03:15.470> for<00:03:16.470> people<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.890> see

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
putting this out there for people to see

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.850 
putting this out there for people to see
so<00:03:17.520> we<00:03:17.700> actually<00:03:17.910> have<00:03:18.270> some<00:03:18.540> evidence<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:19.200> the

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
so we actually have some evidence of the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.510 
so we actually have some evidence of the
effectiveness<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.550> singularity
