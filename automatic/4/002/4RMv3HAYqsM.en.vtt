00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.170 
going to climb the ladder our kids
actually<00:01:28.439> make<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> ladder<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.250> supervised<00:01:29.880> it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
actually make the ladder I supervised it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.880 
actually make the ladder I supervised it
to<00:01:30.329> make<00:01:30.450> sure<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.780> used<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.470> right<00:01:31.619> hardware

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
to make sure we used the right hardware

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.179 
to make sure we used the right hardware
we<00:01:32.159> used<00:01:32.340> long<00:01:32.939> four<00:01:33.450> inch<00:01:33.630> deck<00:01:33.930> screws<00:01:34.189> this

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
we used long four inch deck screws this

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.270 
we used long four inch deck screws this
is<00:01:35.400> two<00:01:35.549> by<00:01:35.700> four<00:01:35.970> pressure<00:01:36.240> treated<00:01:36.509> lumber

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
is two by four pressure treated lumber

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.660 
is two by four pressure treated lumber
alright<00:01:38.280> let's<00:01:38.759> climb<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.479> ladder

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.550 

I<00:01:44.700> used<00:01:45.700> vinyl<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.870> we<00:01:46.960> had<00:01:47.080> left<00:01:47.200> over<00:01:47.470> from

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
I used vinyl that we had left over from

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.890 
I used vinyl that we had left over from
the<00:01:47.710> house<00:01:47.920> at<00:01:48.610> this<00:01:48.790> little<00:01:48.940> porch<00:01:49.270> area<00:01:49.570> I

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
the house at this little porch area I

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.630 
the house at this little porch area I
would<00:01:50.020> have<00:01:50.200> used<00:01:50.350> it<00:01:50.500> for<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:51.220> flooring<00:01:51.550> of

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
would have used it for the flooring of

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.040 
would have used it for the flooring of
the<00:01:51.729> entire<00:01:52.030> treehouse<00:01:52.330> except<00:01:52.810> I<00:01:52.900> didn't

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
the entire treehouse except I didn't

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.910 
the entire treehouse except I didn't
have<00:01:53.170> enough<00:01:53.729> let's<00:01:54.729> go<00:01:54.940> ahead<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.270> go<00:01:55.390> up

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
have enough let's go ahead and go up

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.830 
have enough let's go ahead and go up
like<00:01:56.920> I<00:01:57.040> said<00:01:57.250> about<00:01:57.430> 10<00:01:57.640> ft<00:01:57.940> dasu<00:01:58.090> gram<00:01:58.300> we
