00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:05.020
 now 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.040
 the 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.449
 anp 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:10.479
 the 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:14.649
 police came to a state of affairs and then everything is on but I also with 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:17.529
 young talents the festival what do you think of that 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.779
 but I seemed nice and is the event 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.579
 divide important that the team succeed years younger younger chefs a motivated 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:26.220
 killings 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.779
 and that the connoisseurs shared by the event die 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.660
 happy everyone is tired 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.380
 i made three judges both choirs yes all with a bommel message 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.450
 something to actually give and so it was crazy it was a kind of plastic 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.340
 preparation 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.000
 because our kitchen is always on a classic basis 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.140
 based 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.180
 and i'm there 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.820
 however, I have two preparations for the violence 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.820
 with the voices and became hard 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.550
 it is actually even though it is almost unused, but it is tasty 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.340
 last and what they do with each other and coffee and illnesses 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.200
 on the trees last 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.990
 kadhafi chore coffee 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.980
 he had cane sugar 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.820
 and I think that this combination works very well, so that's why 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.409
 we also like that they did a lot with monuments people has a hard time 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.180
 game is experience is good taste you can tell something more about that I 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.930
 know that kind as the west with the ornamental that gets then they will soon 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.330
 worked out that it is a nice lake 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.900
 only then judge as an employer 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.200
 he typifies good food and always comes first 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.540
 paramaribo wherever 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.590
 our guests taste and a product is not to be forgotten 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.420
 and would like to be introduced 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.420
 and no there in terms of experience this gives extra inspections and can choke storytelling 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.860
 much is already being done within other craftsmanship and that we too 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.500
 we can do and if there can still have certain clothes and thought of 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.680
 only we have to arrange the guests 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.779
 are you there are doing extremely well with the pius xii 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:14.510
 what is done in the future is still among the dead and they end up 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.960
 just on 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.919
 then i'll take him go again 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:20.379
 and the service goes from the dishes to Serbia 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:24.539
 that clothing it's all there shouldn't be said wellink 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.339
 the old ones and I only have weekly vision 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.759
 so that people come to that site and 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:34.889
 getting something served 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.459
 if you if you can't get anywhere else and that of course takes a lot of time 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.369
 lots of Energie 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.969
 and then we essentially try and try to do that for each other 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.579
 and all those young chefs were watching his audience 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.199
 You really shouldn't tip a month everyone should throw to the 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.989
 intelligence services are called other moves and 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.670
 for you a response very much 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.429
 and for as wsw and top 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:03:02.279
 we have to be serious and then you have to specialize and completely 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.019
 fully anchored 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.839
 if someone else is nice with his car 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:10.159
 gerson is called and media group breda or fewer 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.309
 I think the idea lives 9 follow the vision and carried away 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:19.199
 before there is an important win I don't get the hang of the fact that I am very good or 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.680
 people do insufficient but just do ten things just super well 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:24.209
 and then you come on thinking
