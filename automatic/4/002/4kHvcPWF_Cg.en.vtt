architecture today we've given a tour of

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.560 
architecture today we've given a tour of
these<00:00:17.950> two<00:00:18.189> homes<00:00:18.460> which<00:00:18.970> were<00:00:19.150> built<00:00:19.390> in

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
these two homes which were built in

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.880 
these two homes which were built in
conjunction<00:00:19.750> with<00:00:20.110> Habitat<00:00:20.560> for<00:00:20.590> Humanity

and<00:00:29.169> we<00:00:29.980> had<00:00:30.130> a<00:00:30.160> tour<00:00:30.520> that<00:00:31.270> 30<00:00:31.840> people<00:00:32.079> came<00:00:32.380> up

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
and we had a tour that 30 people came up

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.370 
and we had a tour that 30 people came up
on<00:00:32.739> to<00:00:33.190> tour<00:00:33.430> these<00:00:33.640> two<00:00:33.880> homes<00:00:34.149> so<00:00:35.140> a<00:00:35.200> number

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
on to tour these two homes so a number

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.020 
on to tour these two homes so a number
of<00:00:35.530> different<00:00:35.620> technologies<00:00:36.460> on<00:00:36.670> these<00:00:36.820> two

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
of different technologies on these two

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.150 
of different technologies on these two
homes<00:00:37.329> our<00:00:37.870> focus<00:00:38.469> really<00:00:38.710> is<00:00:38.829> on

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
homes our focus really is on

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.850 
homes our focus really is on
affordability<00:00:39.730> with<00:00:40.149> Habitat<00:00:40.719> certainly<00:00:41.290> but

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
affordability with Habitat certainly but

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.540 
affordability with Habitat certainly but
as<00:00:42.040> well<00:00:42.250> energy<00:00:42.820> efficiency<00:00:44.280> products<00:00:45.280> that

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
as well energy efficiency products that

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.240 
as well energy efficiency products that
are<00:00:45.700> brought<00:00:45.970> in<00:00:46.180> from<00:00:46.600> local<00:00:47.530> distributors

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
are brought in from local distributors

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.900 
are brought in from local distributors
and<00:00:48.610> suppliers<00:00:49.890> manufacturing<00:00:50.890> so<00:00:51.400> this<00:00:51.670> is

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
and suppliers manufacturing so this is

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.200 
and suppliers manufacturing so this is
the<00:00:52.090> boiler<00:00:52.720> for<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.960> house<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.730> boiler

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
the boiler for the house and the boiler

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.120 
the boiler for the house and the boiler
is<00:00:55.360> handling<00:00:55.989> both<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.800> heating

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
is handling both the heating

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.319 
is handling both the heating
requirements<00:00:57.790> and<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.930> domestic<00:00:59.440> hot<00:00:59.560> water

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
requirements and the domestic hot water

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.020 
requirements and the domestic hot water
the<00:01:01.329> heating<00:01:01.720> is<00:01:02.020> in-floor<00:01:02.649> radiant<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.910> if

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
the heating is in-floor radiant so if

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.630 
the heating is in-floor radiant so if
you<00:01:04.119> actually<00:01:04.299> touch<00:01:04.689> the<00:01:04.899> floor<00:01:05.110> in<00:01:05.320> here<00:01:05.640> you

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
you actually touch the floor in here you

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.780 
you actually touch the floor in here you
can<00:01:06.850> feel<00:01:07.149> that<00:01:07.180> it's<00:01:07.540> warm<00:01:07.840> so<00:01:08.579> we've<00:01:09.579> got

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
can feel that it's warm so we've got

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.530 
can feel that it's warm so we've got
those<00:01:10.180> orange<00:01:10.750> tubes<00:01:11.079> there<00:01:11.439> as<00:01:11.710> you<00:01:11.950> can<00:01:12.130> see

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
those orange tubes there as you can see

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.910 
those orange tubes there as you can see
those<00:01:13.540> are<00:01:13.720> all<00:01:13.780> dropping<00:01:14.380> down<00:01:14.590> into<00:01:14.829> the

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
those are all dropping down into the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.029 
those are all dropping down into the
concrete<00:01:15.429> and<00:01:15.819> they're<00:01:16.509> spread<00:01:16.869> out

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
concrete and they're spread out

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.440 
concrete and they're spread out
throughout<00:01:18.039> the<00:01:18.100> entire<00:01:18.249> house<00:01:18.729> it's

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
throughout the entire house it's

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.629 
throughout the entire house it's
actually<00:01:19.929> split<00:01:20.409> into<00:01:20.439> two<00:01:20.950> separate<00:01:21.369> zones

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:21.639 
actually split into two separate zones

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:25.859 
actually split into two separate zones
so<00:01:22.630> there's<00:01:22.840> six<00:01:23.670> circuits<00:01:24.670> three<00:01:25.569> of<00:01:25.719> them

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
so there's six circuits three of them

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.239 
so there's six circuits three of them
were<00:01:25.990> for<00:01:26.229> kind<00:01:26.560> of<00:01:26.649> the<00:01:26.709> back<00:01:26.920> half<00:01:27.219> the

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249 
were for kind of the back half the

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:29.669 
were for kind of the back half the
bedrooms<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.659> other<00:01:28.810> three<00:01:29.200> handle<00:01:29.590> the

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
bedrooms and the other three handle the

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.370 
bedrooms and the other three handle the
front<00:01:30.009> part<00:01:30.249> so<00:01:31.090> there's<00:01:31.299> two<00:01:31.509> thermostats<00:01:31.899> so

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
front part so there's two thermostats so

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.379 
front part so there's two thermostats so
you<00:01:32.469> can<00:01:32.649> adjust<00:01:33.549> the<00:01:33.670> temperatures<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.119> little

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:34.389 
you can adjust the temperatures a little

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:36.149 
you can adjust the temperatures a little
bit<00:01:34.509> to<00:01:34.990> run<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.200> little<00:01:35.499> cooler<00:01:35.770> in<00:01:35.920> the

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
bit to run a little cooler in the

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.599 
bit to run a little cooler in the
bedrooms<00:01:36.579> maybe<00:01:36.880> at<00:01:37.090> night<00:01:38.219> so<00:01:39.219> the<00:01:39.310> boiler

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
bedrooms maybe at night so the boiler

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.219 
bedrooms maybe at night so the boiler
generates<00:01:40.029> hot<00:01:40.209> water<00:01:40.450> circulates<00:01:41.109> it

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
generates hot water circulates it

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.129 
generates hot water circulates it
through<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.469> floor<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.950> heat<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.189> house<00:01:42.369> and

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:43.139 
through the floor to heat the house and

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:45.480 
through the floor to heat the house and
you'll<00:01:44.139> find<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:44.619> boiler<00:01:44.950> there's<00:01:45.159> a<00:01:45.249> heat

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
you'll find the boiler there's a heat

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.419 
you'll find the boiler there's a heat
exchanger<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.240> then<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:46.899> little<00:01:47.259> five<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:48.159> six

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
exchanger and then a little five to six

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.849 
exchanger and then a little five to six
gallon<00:01:48.880> storage<00:01:49.329> tank<00:01:49.659> for<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.529> domestic

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
gallon storage tank for the domestic

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.399 
gallon storage tank for the domestic
water<00:01:51.310> side<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.659> when<00:01:52.810> there's<00:01:52.959> a<00:01:53.049> call<00:01:53.229> for

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
water side so when there's a call for

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.949 
water side so when there's a call for
domestic<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.579> boiler<00:01:54.969> heats<00:01:55.240> up<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.749> water

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
domestic the boiler heats up the water

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.199 
domestic the boiler heats up the water
inside<00:01:56.579> circulates<00:01:57.579> it<00:01:57.759> through<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.029> heat

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
inside circulates it through the heat

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:00.449 
inside circulates it through the heat
exchanger<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.959> then<00:01:59.560> your<00:01:59.709> domestic<00:02:00.130> waters

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
exchanger and then your domestic waters

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.059 
exchanger and then your domestic waters
on<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.670> other<00:02:00.819> sides<00:02:01.149> and<00:02:01.509> it's<00:02:02.170> separated

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
on the other sides and it's separated

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.830 
on the other sides and it's separated
one<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.609> cool<00:02:03.849> things<00:02:03.880> on<00:02:04.240> this<00:02:04.359> boiler<00:02:04.719> is

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
one of the cool things on this boiler is

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.769 
one of the cool things on this boiler is
the<00:02:05.020> fencing<00:02:05.409> it's<00:02:06.039> a<00:02:06.189> single<00:02:06.670> pipe<00:02:06.880> that's

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:07.779 
the fencing it's a single pipe that's

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:10.350 
the fencing it's a single pipe that's
got<00:02:07.990> another<00:02:08.229> pipe<00:02:08.560> inside<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:10.179> your

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
got another pipe inside of it so your

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.300 
got another pipe inside of it so your
flue<00:02:10.569> gases<00:02:11.020> go<00:02:11.200> out<00:02:11.410> through<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.040> center

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
flue gases go out through the center

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.110 
flue gases go out through the center
pipe<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.849> it<00:02:13.450> pulls<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.959> combustion<00:02:14.590> air

pipe and it pulls the combustion air

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.370 
pipe and it pulls the combustion air
into<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.300> outer<00:02:16.569> pipe

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380

the<00:02:17.710> way<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.220> boiler<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.480> efficient<00:02:20.050> is

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
the way this boiler is so efficient is

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.580 
the way this boiler is so efficient is
because<00:02:21.130> it's<00:02:21.810> condensing<00:02:22.810> part<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.350> the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
because it's condensing part of the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.660 
because it's condensing part of the
steam<00:02:24.370> that's<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.060> flue<00:02:25.240> gas<00:02:26.460> so<00:02:27.460> by

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
steam that's in the flue gas so by

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.170 
steam that's in the flue gas so by
having<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.390> flue<00:02:28.630> gas<00:02:28.870> inside<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:30.100> your<00:02:30.370> cold

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
having the flue gas inside in your cold

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.040 
having the flue gas inside in your cold
air<00:02:31.780> that's<00:02:32.260> being<00:02:32.440> sucked<00:02:32.860> from<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> outside

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
air that's being sucked from the outside

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.810 
air that's being sucked from the outside
you're<00:02:35.050> actually<00:02:35.320> preheating<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.100> air<00:02:36.490> that

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
you're actually preheating the air that

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.640 
you're actually preheating the air that
the<00:02:37.120> boiler<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:37.660> using<00:02:38.050> for<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.320> combustion

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
the boiler is using for the combustion

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.950 
the boiler is using for the combustion
process<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.760> it's<00:02:40.750> condensing<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:43.120> flue

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
process and it's condensing the flue

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.530 
process and it's condensing the flue
gasses<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.440> much<00:02:44.920> more<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.670> when<00:02:46.420> you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
gasses that much more and when you

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.870 
gasses that much more and when you
condense<00:02:46.960> the<00:02:47.140> flue<00:02:47.320> gasses<00:02:47.770> you<00:02:47.920> get<00:02:48.160> hot

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
condense the flue gasses you get hot

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.180 
condense the flue gasses you get hot
commentator<00:02:49.600> that<00:02:50.200> rolls<00:02:50.410> back<00:02:50.710> through<00:02:51.070> the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
commentator that rolls back through the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.040 
commentator that rolls back through the
boiler<00:02:51.610> through<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.000> heat<00:02:52.150> exchanger<00:02:52.180> and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
boiler through the heat exchanger and

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.910 
boiler through the heat exchanger and
you<00:02:53.650> can<00:02:53.830> exchange<00:02:54.070> some<00:02:54.580> of<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.790> heat<00:02:55.920> so

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
you can exchange some of that heat so

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.620 
you can exchange some of that heat so
that's<00:02:57.220> how<00:02:57.430> it's<00:02:57.640> actually<00:02:57.790> more<00:02:58.120> efficient

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
that's how it's actually more efficient

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.600 
that's how it's actually more efficient
is<00:02:58.750> because<00:02:59.080> when<00:02:59.260> condensing<00:02:59.890> flue<00:03:00.130> gases

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
is because when condensing flue gases

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.400 
is because when condensing flue gases
and<00:03:00.910> absorbing<00:03:01.840> some<00:03:02.020> of<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.140> heat<00:03:02.380> that

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
and absorbing some of the heat that

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.010 
and absorbing some of the heat that
would<00:03:02.770> normally<00:03:03.070> be<00:03:03.430> lost<00:03:03.850> out<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.630> vents

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
would normally be lost out of the vents

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.840 
would normally be lost out of the vents
