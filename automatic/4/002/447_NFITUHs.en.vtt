00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.259
 cyberport presents the new google 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.120
 nexus 7 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.160
 the google nexus 7 is an absolute one 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.719
 blockbuster and already since the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.750
 first version of one of the most sought after 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.980
 products on the tablet market now has 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.580
 Google published a successor 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.320
 this success story is seamless 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.230
 no wonder that we continue 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.240
 also worried about a nexus 7 2013 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.460
 and find out with this test report 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.579
 want what the device makes so popular 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.860
 the technical data google nexus 7 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.579
 measures 11 4 cm height 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.030
 20 cm wide and 8 7 mm deep 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.700
 at a total weight of 290 grams 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.039
 the screen is a 7 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.629
 inch big ips display with one 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.780
 resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels in the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.239
 inside the nexus 7 works a 1 5 ghz 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.300
 qualcomm snapdragon quad core processor 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.910
 with 2 gigabytes of memory of the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.400
 application memory is 16 or 32 gb 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.650
 however, it can not be expanded 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.210
 at first glance hardly ever 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.130
 big differences between the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.630
 predecessors from the last year and the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.850
 this year's model noticeable 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.280
 only on closer inspection can one recognize 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.509
 one or the other difference is like that 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.880
 second version with eight and a half 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.180
 millimeter deep now a bit slimmer and 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.920
 with 290 grams a good 50 grams lighter in 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.780
 connection with the wide edges can 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.340
 The tablet therefore also quite simply with 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.810
 to be held only one hand 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.600
 beyond that is the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.790
 Processing quality perfectly that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.270
 chic design can convince as well 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.729
 our thumb goes up 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.020
 Google has a big google display 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.390
 made a jump forward 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.869
 the seven inch big ips screen 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.340
 now offers a high resolution of 1920 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:54.710
 x 1200 pixels what a pixel density of 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.360
 323 pp corresponds to fonts and pictures 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.140
 are therefore even sharper than when 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.689
 predecessor 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.189
 thanks to the ips technology that offers 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.319
 gets a very big perspective 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.420
 area without falsifying the colors 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.539
 the brightness values ​​will have changed 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.340
 also increased with 545 candela per 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.890
 Square one becomes downright 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.540
 thus illuminated is the use of 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.530
 free and sunny sky very much 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.480
 comfortable 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.459
 the colors are indeed a good piece 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.530
 contrast poorer than for example at 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.599
 Samsung tablets the case is for 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.360
 But they also seem more realistic 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.190
 give the best grade we look at now 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.900
 the inner values ​​of the nexus 7 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.569
 the heart is a qualcomm 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.030
 snapdragon s4 pro quad core processor 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.579
 with a core day of up to 1 5 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.650
 gigahertz supports the cpu of 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.299
 two gigabytes of RAM and through 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.859
 This comes clear once again 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.230
 more powerful than the pre-model 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:48.530
 has become all games and apps 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.440
 run absolutely smoothly the thumbs up 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.180
 operating system is called android 4.3 where 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.650
 it is an update compared to 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.450
 the otherwise typical installed 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.819
 Android 4.2.2010 in this software package 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.950
 Above all, it is the optional virus scanner 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.900
 with apps and downloads on it 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.790
 Have virtual pests checked 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.130
 now comes the support 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.959
 of restricted profiles with users 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.780
 Profiles can be created as well 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.639
 opengl es 2.0 that the graphics performance 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.440
 improved and new graphics features 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.299
 offers the use of the 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.549
 Android operating system is like 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.630
 used to be completely flawless and fluent 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.430
 we find great 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.790
 By the way, perplexed communication is via 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.770
 wireless bluetooth 4.0 or nfc where the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.240
 could not find any problems 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.180
 In addition, there are still several 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.430
 sensors, a gyroscope and a GPS module 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.140
 on board with regard to equipment 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.600
 So no wishes remain 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.730
 open what we unfortunately miss 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.320
 is a sd-card slot around the built-in 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.930
 expand flash memory 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.690
 whoever depending on the model with 16 or 32 gb 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.010
 but can do without it so 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.020
 we are really happy with this 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.660
 but not a pity 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.040
 google now has a 5 in the photo area 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.410
 megapixel camera on the back 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.140
 The quality goes for a tablet 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.030
 okay in the absence of led flash light should 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.070
 you can only take snapshots 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.920
 on the front is still 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.300
 a 12 megapixel camera for video chats 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.940
 we give a good one 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.680
 A word about the battery is like this 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.950
 usually firmly installed and offers with 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.330
 its 3950 milliamps even 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.400
 a little less power than when 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.350
 predecessor the useful life has changed 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.880
 therefore a little shortened and is enclosed 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.010
 five to seven hours of operation 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.770
 as long as you do not just play non-stop 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.610
 or surfing we give a good one again 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.160
 summarize 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.660
 the google nexus 7 brings everything 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.980
 with what you get from a tablet of this 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.050
 size can expect 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.150
 it looks good is top processed 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.760
 brings a lot of performance and lets 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.410
 total no big wish openly about 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.700
 the quality of the camera we can 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.680
 goodbye 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.120
 the missing possibility the memory too 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.100
 expand as well as the light 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.110
 deterioration of battery life tarnish 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.600
 our overall picture a little bit considering 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.460
 the unbeatable price we want 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.000
 but again both eyes shut and 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.000
 give five out of five of his stars
