00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.469
 today we will make spaghetti 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.639
 let's take it in catalog and cut out 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.430
 ah 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.670
 a pack of spaghetti noodles 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.670
 noodles 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.670
 if they have two catalogs or there are two photos 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.670
 same much better 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.680
 if they do not get to have two the same good 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.280
 on the other side they can put a paper of 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.280
 a plain color 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.409
 let's take a ribbon of style 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.409
 transparent 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.590
 and we are going to cover one of the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.590
 while images 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.149
 two 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:10.710
 and then we're going to take the other one 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.550
 let's take it 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.170
 in my son if the essence of the tape 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.480
 forgiveness is wide that about although they are 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:36.350
 duct for each side 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.350
 we put our reverse 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.220
 Y 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.030
 and we knew 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.819
 5 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.830
 we connect the top end 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.990
 and down we are going to fold 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.690
 so that we do not leave the videos by 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.690
 down 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.380
 d 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.950
 so I have the package left over and it 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.950
 located and the bass is closed 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:12.170
 in real real ideas 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.170
 we take the measure 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.989
 and that we're going to let it stand out 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.730
 take the measure they would like for 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.970
 example for easy 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:32.510
 cut and they will put more the same 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.360
 videos are going to put us back so that 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.260
 look more quantity for us to have 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.150
 what entity 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.450
 and we cut them back to the intro of 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.450
 lifetime 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.340
 and we can put more 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.570
 the amount you want 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.570
 and matches them mos 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.389
 They can be as short as they want 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:07.569
 so that it did not come out we're going to place 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.920
 vinilic glue 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:13.520
 a drop inside 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.520
 to me 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.650
 from our package 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.240
 and thus our a janine are ready 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.240
 It's our spaghetti 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.389
