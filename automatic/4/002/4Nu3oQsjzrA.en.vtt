sector
I<00:04:58.580> see<00:04:59.570> if<00:04:59.750> you<00:04:59.960> keep<00:05:00.169> telling<00:05:00.560> yourself<00:05:00.650> that

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
I see if you keep telling yourself that

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.610 
I see if you keep telling yourself that
then<00:05:01.820> you're<00:05:02.000> gonna<00:05:02.150> feel<00:05:02.450> that<00:05:02.480> way<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.530> it's

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
then you're gonna feel that way and it's

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.260 
then you're gonna feel that way and it's
gonna<00:05:03.860> make<00:05:04.100> it<00:05:04.130> harder<00:05:04.550> for<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:05.060> worse

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.610 
so you might as well not you know zap
yourself<00:05:08.480> mentally<00:05:08.690> as<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.140> how<00:05:09.230> hot<00:05:09.410> it<00:05:09.530> is

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620

about how hot it is think about getting

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.409 
about how hot it is think about getting
better<00:05:27.380> think<00:05:28.040> about<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.400> next<00:05:28.580> rep<00:05:28.850> think

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
better think about the next rep think

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.320 
better think about the next rep think
about<00:05:29.630> playing<00:05:29.900> fast<00:05:30.970> think<00:05:31.970> about<00:05:32.150> your

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.089 

got<00:05:46.800> me<00:05:46.919> a<00:05:46.979> cold<00:05:47.250> tub<00:05:47.490> it's<00:05:47.729> a<00:05:47.940> deep<00:05:48.479> burn<00:05:49.099> it

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
got me a cold tub it's a deep burn it

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:55.520 
got me a cold tub it's a deep burn it
hurts<00:05:50.340> so<00:05:50.520> good<00:05:53.569> the<00:05:54.569> cold<00:05:54.810> tub<00:05:55.050> is<00:05:55.319> both

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
hurts so good the cold tub is both

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.559 
hurts so good the cold tub is both
refreshing<00:05:56.340> and<00:05:56.460> painful<00:05:56.940> at<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.120> same<00:05:57.300> time

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:57.569 
refreshing and painful at the same time

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:03.409 
refreshing and painful at the same time
it's<00:05:57.900> a<00:05:58.400> and<00:05:59.400> something<00:05:59.789> you<00:05:59.879> have<00:06:00.030> to<00:06:00.060> do<00:06:02.419> the

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
it's a and something you have to do the

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.629 
it's a and something you have to do the
ice<00:06:03.569> baths<00:06:03.840> are<00:06:04.020> tremendous<00:06:04.919> car<00:06:05.400> theory

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
ice baths are tremendous car theory

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.279 
ice baths are tremendous car theory
behind<00:06:05.819> it<00:06:06.090> is<00:06:06.210> if<00:06:06.419> we<00:06:06.569> can<00:06:06.750> bring<00:06:06.930> their<00:06:07.080> core

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
behind it is if we can bring their core

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.200 
behind it is if we can bring their core
temperature<00:06:07.740> down<00:06:07.949> their<00:06:08.520> body<00:06:08.759> will<00:06:09.030> not

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
temperature down their body will not

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.610 
temperature down their body will not
have<00:06:09.419> to<00:06:09.539> work<00:06:09.720> as<00:06:09.930> hard<00:06:09.960> to<00:06:10.289> recover

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
have to work as hard to recover

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.320 
have to work as hard to recover
therefore<00:06:11.159> they<00:06:11.250> won't<00:06:11.400> be<00:06:11.580> as<00:06:11.669> fatigued<00:06:12.060> and

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
therefore they won't be as fatigued and

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.029 
therefore they won't be as fatigued and
hopefully<00:06:12.629> they'll<00:06:12.750> be<00:06:12.870> better<00:06:13.080> for<00:06:13.710> the<00:06:13.800> next

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
hopefully they'll be better for the next

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.129 
hopefully they'll be better for the next
practice<00:06:14.509> one<00:06:15.509> minute<00:06:15.750> your<00:06:15.900> body

temperature is probably 110 or whatever
in<00:06:18.629> the<00:06:18.719> next<00:06:18.960> minute<00:06:19.229> you<00:06:19.319> jump<00:06:19.530> in<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:19.680> cold

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
in the next minute you jump in the cold

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.279 
in the next minute you jump in the cold
tub<00:06:20.039> it's<00:06:20.250> like<00:06:20.340> 50<00:06:20.580> degrees<00:06:21.289> occasionally
