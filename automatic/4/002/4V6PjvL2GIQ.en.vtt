no<00:00:02.260> hang-ups<00:00:02.530> camber<00:00:02.950> is<00:00:03.070> our<00:00:03.250> new<00:00:03.460> 3d<00:00:03.699> camber

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:04.240 
no hang-ups camber is our new 3d camber

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.079 
no hang-ups camber is our new 3d camber
design<00:00:04.540> that<00:00:05.259> really<00:00:05.649> combines<00:00:06.129> the<00:00:06.370> best<00:00:06.730> of

rocker with the best of positive camber

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.879 
rocker with the best of positive camber
what<00:00:09.849> it<00:00:09.969> does<00:00:10.179> and<00:00:10.480> where<00:00:10.719> it<00:00:11.259> differentiates

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
what it does and where it differentiates

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.119 
what it does and where it differentiates
from<00:00:12.490> other<00:00:12.670> designs<00:00:13.210> is<00:00:13.480> with<00:00:14.259> the<00:00:14.589> diamond

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129
