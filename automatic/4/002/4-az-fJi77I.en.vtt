my name on it using a PNG I'm just using

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.760 
my name on it using a PNG I'm just using
Photoshop<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.150> create<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.570> file<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.140> then

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
Photoshop to create that file and then

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.280 
Photoshop to create that file and then
you<00:03:13.890> can<00:03:13.920> also<00:03:14.610> there<00:03:15.330> we<00:03:15.420> go<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.050> kind<00:03:16.260> of

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
you can also there we go this is kind of

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.870 
you can also there we go this is kind of
a<00:03:16.410> funky<00:03:16.650> looking<00:03:17.040> one<00:03:17.220> right<00:03:17.400> here<00:03:17.670> if<00:03:17.760> you

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
a funky looking one right here if you

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.130 
a funky looking one right here if you
turn<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.180> on<00:03:18.270> in<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.510> middle<00:03:18.780> with<00:03:18.960> this

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
turn it on in the middle with this

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.990 
turn it on in the middle with this
screen<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.500> doesn't<00:03:19.650> make<00:03:19.860> much<00:03:20.070> sense<00:03:20.100> but

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
screen it doesn't make much sense but

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.930 
screen it doesn't make much sense but
you'll<00:03:21.150> notice<00:03:21.330> that<00:03:21.630> lines<00:03:21.930> up<00:03:22.230> exactly<00:03:22.940> with

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
you'll notice that lines up exactly with

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.270 
you'll notice that lines up exactly with
this<00:03:24.120> split<00:03:24.510> screen<00:03:24.870> view<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:25.800> you<00:03:25.890> see<00:03:26.070> me

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
this split screen view so you see me

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.230 
this split screen view so you see me
there<00:03:26.460> on<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.580> left<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.940> says<00:03:26.970> Brian

brushwood Austin Texas and I just put

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.800 
brushwood Austin Texas and I just put
live<00:03:29.310> via<00:03:29.640> Skype<00:03:29.910> on<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.360> other<00:03:30.480> side<00:03:30.720> because

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
people I actually take random calls from

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.400 
people I actually take random calls from
the<00:03:35.880> public<00:03:36.060> for<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:36.540> have<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.840> ever<00:03:37.290> seen

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
that dog when I take random calls from

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.340 
that dog when I take random calls from
people<00:03:39.030> never<00:03:41.540> it<00:03:42.540> seems<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:42.930> every<00:03:43.140> calls

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
people never it seems like every calls

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.480 
people never it seems like every calls
random<00:03:43.770> on<00:03:43.890> your<00:03:44.010> show<00:03:45.830> all<00:03:46.830> right<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:47.310> we

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
random on your show all right so we

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.550 
random on your show all right so we
could<00:03:47.700> go<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.880> step<00:03:48.390> farther<00:03:48.720> on<00:03:49.080> this<00:03:49.320> and

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
could go a step farther on this and

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.890 
could go a step farther on this and
actually<00:03:49.710> do<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.160> quad<00:03:50.820> effect<00:03:51.420> now<00:03:51.630> in<00:03:51.780> this

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
actually do the quad effect now in this

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.200 
actually do the quad effect now in this
case<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.500> quad<00:03:52.740> laser<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.400> quad<00:03:53.640> laser<00:03:53.850> as<00:03:54.120> I

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
case the quad laser the quad laser as I

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.090 
case the quad laser the quad laser as I
like<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.570> call<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:55.050> in<00:03:55.260> this<00:03:55.620> case<00:03:55.860> we<00:03:56.070> only

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
like to call it in this case we only

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.800 
like to call it in this case we only
have<00:03:56.400> three<00:03:56.640> cameras<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.210> are<00:03:57.270> being<00:03:57.540> used

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
have three cameras that are being used

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.510 
have three cameras that are being used
so<00:03:57.990> I<00:03:58.020> fill<00:03:58.320> in<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.650> fourth<00:03:58.950> spot

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
so I fill in the fourth spot

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.640 
so I fill in the fourth spot
with<00:03:59.760> sort<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.180> static<00:04:00.600> animation<00:04:01.230> this<00:04:01.470> is

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
with sort of a static animation this is

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.220 
with sort of a static animation this is
just<00:04:01.830> a<00:04:01.950> looping<00:04:02.310> BB<00:04:02.670> logo<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.540> goes<00:04:03.720> all<00:04:04.050> the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
just a looping BB logo that goes all the

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.170 
just a looping BB logo that goes all the

we'll go to the wide shot right here so
you<00:04:08.370> can<00:04:08.460> see<00:04:08.760> over<00:04:09.120> here<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.390> video<00:04:09.600> effects

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
you can see over here in video effects

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.870 
you can see over here in video effects
we've<00:04:10.320> got<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.650> side-by-side<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.610> just

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
we've got the side-by-side I just

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.060 
we've got the side-by-side I just
created<00:04:12.150> another<00:04:12.510> module<00:04:12.870> for<00:04:13.410> video<00:04:13.680> video

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
created another module for video video

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.340 
created another module for video video
effects<00:04:14.430> over<00:04:15.030> here<00:04:15.240> for<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.510> quad<00:04:15.840> setup

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350
