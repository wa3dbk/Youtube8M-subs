00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
this point I believe the next game is

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.130 
this point I believe the next game is
against<00:04:19.729> Palace<00:04:20.209> which<00:04:20.450> if<00:04:20.690> we<00:04:20.780> don't<00:04:20.959> leave

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.040 
against Palace which if we don't leave
or<00:04:21.440> when<00:04:21.620> that<00:04:21.890> I<00:04:21.919> think<00:04:22.539> january<00:04:23.539> is<00:04:23.870> just

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.540 
or when that I think january is just
going<00:04:24.140> to<00:04:24.229> be<00:04:24.289> so<00:04:24.500> important<00:04:24.950> and<00:04:25.039> get<00:04:25.190> at
