00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.260
 lagged behind because all 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.340

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.470

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.790
 micro chapati objectives the quality of the 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.850

 in this episode it's a top-10 knife 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.180
 so I have a lot of clips so between 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.449
 other cases and I had blue links 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.610
 related finally brief so here I have nothing 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.860
 else to say simply 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.930
 that's it, I'm launching it's gone so 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.360
 tenth position there are players 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.589
 sir a31 which starts smoothly in 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.080
 June then what girls in the wind 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.350

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.699
 here are diving in the top 5 meters play well 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:08.960
 the same place the game up of this plan 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:12.500
 in fact it's a candy on the map 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:19.369
 career on the 200 it's simple with 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:22.549
 the same and it's still pretty have 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.740
 continued in eighth position with the 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.899
 bluetones players 37 who makes a clip and 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.359
 I always wanted to do on since at 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.009
 300 or butt knife in a few 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.229
 souls have affected so frankly 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.640
 welcome to you dude two girls since 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.789
 three years knows it never succeed 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.789
 so a poor linen the table or 37 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.810
 no there so in 7th place we have the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.700
 aqualife player by programming 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.960
 frankly I told myself horrified 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.250
 not very nice and friendly led to 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.600
 nothing but just look at the time that the 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.250
 Cameroon arrived I saw a small 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.190
 stopwatch we'll just watch the 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.950
 time that puts the tomahawk but ten 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.050
 270 seconds to arrive I do not understand 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.670
 I do not know if they are there we the enemy 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.399
 it's actually a friend or something 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.630
 like that but I thought the guy 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.010
 that he came there he saw near and at 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.700
 Morocco he made the cynical cydia taraabt 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.590
 and we hang on 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.330
 he wanted to do I have fun with him in 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.520
 know nothing what and to finish list the 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.920
 price the second tomahawk but I think 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.380
 that he was a little more to boost or 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.720
 trafficked into the forest lost to you sixth 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.700
 place the player bfk usap 721 they have 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.650
 do a one shot I avoid three small 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.070

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.710
 screen 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.650

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.230

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.450

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.610
 remained in the course of a shot there more 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.110
 person who is watching alive and he 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:00.650
