00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:09.969
 the unique and inimitable for which it is the 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.889
 product that revolutionized the world 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:16.119
 of ultra-thin and has laptops 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:18.030
 made of a worthy read a new one 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.880
 also design icon 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.880
 like his cousins mac pro even better 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.950
 don't take us inside 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.990
 entirely in aluminum with technology 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.390
 unibody then excavated from it 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.270
 from the same cock arrived 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.570
 is present in two versions are versions 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.760
 for 11 and 13 years 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.769
 right now we 're showing you the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.260
 let's make 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:44.600
 ultra-thin portable than for 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.149
 guarantee reduced weight 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.350
 the small footprint only a series of 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.980
 things that apple has designed 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.730
 verona there is no type of c 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.730
 German tax authorities 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.530
 id software just for you 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.260
 Keep yourself for the thickness there 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.019
 it would have been bad 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.390
 to allow too 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.790
 but his engineer 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.200
 design a device that could be 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.909
 used for judgments and others 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.670
 machines then a dvd player in 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.159
 you will not see macbook air aluminum 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.390
 always very fine mounts a series of 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.120
 doors on the right side 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.100
 a sd card reader from which i 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.750
 I can also do if high capacity 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.960
 when starting the machine with the system 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.640
 operating a USB 2 port than the new one 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.740
 thunderbolt then a door that 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.500
 allows to work with graphics and 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.759
 video 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.220
 in cascade at a time 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.290
 performance 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.720
 on the left side of my macbook air 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.950
 we have the door for the power supply 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.140
 bank safe with magnetic connector 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.810
 another usb port 2 that the output for le 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.329
 headphones 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.159
 the microphone in this handset is 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.830
 integrated and is represented by these 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.200
 little dots still says 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.820
 Exit 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.490
 inside of 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.810
 we opened this morning 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.770
 always a backlit keyboard 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.810
 any if a pair of integrated speakers 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.910
 below the screen 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.970
 the trap and multi gesture 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.250
 glass fiber 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.920
 and is that the screens from 11 to 13 inches 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.880
 depending on the staff 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.680
 at 13 inches it has a footprint of 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.680
 council 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.910
 while the eleven 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.460
 guarantees extreme portability 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.480
 you have big chunks more or less common 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.300
 all these machines angle 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.440
 portentous performances in the sense that 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.330
 from the start of the machine the way of the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.900
 about 40 minutes before application 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.200
 seconds 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.239
 mounts not proprietary ssd and therefore 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.830
 a disp has given that not a disc but one 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.130
 extremely high capacity memory 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.900
 fast extremely state 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.420
 the macbook air line like all the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.410
 apple machines mount the new system 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.980
 operating lion or ester 10.7 in this 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.050
 time for the updated version 10.7.2 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.629
 as recited from single to ionadi series 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.489
 that there is a native 64 bit system that 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.830
 of course to use all the 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.150
 resources to distribute them within the 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.230
 application processes and with 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.069
 a series d 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.210
 the functions related to the system itself 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.220
 inside the suite 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.780
 the apple and therefore the applications 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.210
 pre-installed available on all 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.310
 machines there is the suite highlights he has 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.140
 represented by these icons in the center 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.770
 and then iphone from a member of 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.880
 garageband iweb then a suite 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.550
 complete for content creation 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.530
 audio via photographic music and 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.530
 his chestnuts and that of corn to the heart
