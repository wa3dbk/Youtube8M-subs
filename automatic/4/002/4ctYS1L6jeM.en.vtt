think it's really important to do so
because<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.629> has<00:01:03.629> been<00:01:03.809> said<00:01:04.049> maybe<00:01:04.350> you've

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
because as has been said maybe you've

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.469 
because as has been said maybe you've
heard<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> world<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.640> flat<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
heard this is that the world is flat the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.770 
heard this is that the world is flat the
idea<00:01:06.900> being<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.909> our<00:01:08.909> students<00:01:09.510> our

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
idea being that our students our

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.289 
idea being that our students our
children<00:01:10.650> are<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.580> competing<00:01:11.970> if

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
children are going to be competing if

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.910 
children are going to be competing if
they're<00:01:12.450> not<00:01:12.570> already<00:01:12.680> competing<00:01:13.680> with

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
they're not already competing with

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.570 
they're not already competing with
students<00:01:14.549> from<00:01:14.580> around<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.360> world<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.580> so

students from around the world and so

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.080 
students from around the world and so
it's<00:01:17.729> really<00:01:17.939> important<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.479> we're<00:01:18.810> able<00:01:19.140> to

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
it's really important that we're able to

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.219 
it's really important that we're able to
have<00:01:21.090> our<00:01:21.119> students<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> same

opportunities to get jobs to have

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.609 
opportunities to get jobs to have
careers<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:26.580> those<00:01:26.850> areas<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:28.350> know<00:01:28.439> here's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
about all of this is because the changes

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.880 
about all of this is because the changes
are<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.490> rapid<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.930> school<00:01:34.170> systems<00:01:34.619> as

teachers<00:01:47.610> coming<00:01:47.970> into<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.509> profession<00:01:49.110> who

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
teachers coming into the profession who

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.020 
teachers coming into the profession who
are<00:01:49.350> digital<00:01:49.770> natives<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:50.640> younger

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
are digital natives just like younger

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.200 
are digital natives just like younger
right<00:01:51.619> right<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> know<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.159> they<00:01:53.460> live<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.970> every

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
right right I know it they live it every

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.179 
right right I know it they live it every
day<00:01:54.240> they<00:01:54.509> walk<00:01:54.720> around<00:01:54.899> with<00:01:55.229> an<00:01:55.380> iPad<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
day they walk around with an iPad and

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.130 
day they walk around with an iPad and
their<00:01:56.369> cell<00:01:57.060> phones<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.600> all<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> other

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
their cell phones and all of the other

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170 
their cell phones and all of the other
technology<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> important<00:01:59.579> thing<00:01:59.729> for<00:01:59.759> us<00:01:59.939> in

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
technology the important thing for us in

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.510 
technology the important thing for us in
schools<00:02:00.509> though<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.079> remember<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:02.219> we're

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
schools though is to remember that we're

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
schools though is to remember that we're
preparing<00:02:03.000> kids<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.420> jobs<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.960> don't<00:02:04.079> even

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
preparing kids for jobs that don't even

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.499 
preparing kids for jobs that don't even
exist<00:02:04.560> yet<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.280> technology<00:02:05.939> will<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.270> at<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
exist yet and technology will be at the

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.180 
exist yet and technology will be at the
core<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:08.039> them

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
core of that and to have them

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.070 
core of that and to have them
comfortable<00:02:08.789> with<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> use<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.239> technology

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
comfortable with the use of technology

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.140 
comfortable with the use of technology
and<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> ability<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:11.009> change<00:02:11.039> into<00:02:11.580> adapt<00:02:12.000> is

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
and the ability to change into adapt is

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.550 
and the ability to change into adapt is
going<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.360> be<00:02:12.480> very<00:02:12.629> important<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.290> them

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
going to be very important to them

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.600 
going to be very important to them
you<00:02:13.650> know<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:13.950> interesting<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.370> say<00:02:14.580> that

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
you know it is interesting you say that

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.860 
you know it is interesting you say that
because<00:02:14.790> i<00:02:15.000> have<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.360> tell<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.540> if<00:02:15.660> I'm<00:02:15.750> being

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
because i have to tell you if I'm being

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.449 
because i have to tell you if I'm being
honest<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.260> math<00:02:16.530> science<00:02:16.920> were<00:02:17.190> not<00:02:17.340> my

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
honest that math science were not my

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.040 
honest that math science were not my
best<00:02:17.670> subjects<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.150> school<00:02:18.180> because<00:02:18.510> what<00:02:19.020> I

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
best subjects in school because what I

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.660 
best subjects in school because what I
often<00:02:19.260> thought<00:02:19.500> was<00:02:19.739> when<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.340> heck<00:02:20.459> am<00:02:20.489> I

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
often thought was when the heck am I

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.830 
often thought was when the heck am I
going<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.880> use<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.480> know<00:02:21.599> what<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.750> mean

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
going to use this you know what I mean

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.570 
going to use this you know what I mean
although<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.230> love<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.680> read<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.430> knew

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
although I love to read and I knew

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.979 
although I love to read and I knew
that's<00:02:23.760> where<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:23.970> wanted<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.360> take<00:02:24.480> my<00:02:24.690> my

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
that's where I wanted to take my my

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.140 
that's where I wanted to take my my
profession<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.890> other<00:02:26.069> subjects<00:02:26.790> math<00:02:26.940> and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
profession the other subjects math and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.089 
profession the other subjects math and
science<00:02:27.360> were<00:02:27.420> not<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.319> know<00:02:28.440> important

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
science were not that you know important

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.940 
science were not that you know important
to<00:02:29.160> me<00:02:29.430> but<00:02:29.730> at<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.120> end<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.450> day<00:02:30.660> kids<00:02:31.590> do

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
to me but at the end of the day kids do

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.559 
to me but at the end of the day kids do
need<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.220> know<00:02:32.519> this<00:02:32.700> because<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.120> world<00:02:33.300> has

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
need to know this because the world has

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.530 
need to know this because the world has
changed<00:02:33.630> has<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.410> not<00:02:34.760> absolutely<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.060> I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
changed has it not absolutely and I

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.040 
changed has it not absolutely and I
think<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.290> instruction<00:02:38.330> has<00:02:39.330> changed

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
think that the instruction has changed

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.839 
think that the instruction has changed
and<00:02:40.170> probably<00:02:40.560> needs<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.920> continue<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.580> change

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
and probably needs to continue to change

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.150 
and probably needs to continue to change
I<00:02:42.150> think<00:02:43.069> back<00:02:44.069> when<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.519> was<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:44.790> school<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
I think back when I was in school the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.100 
I think back when I was in school the
teachers<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.370> math<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.790> science<00:02:48.269> they<00:02:48.750> were

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
teachers of math and science they were

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.559 
teachers of math and science they were
more<00:02:49.319> theoretical<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.190> they<00:02:51.030> weren't<00:02:51.299> as

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
more theoretical and they weren't as

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.059 
more theoretical and they weren't as
prepared<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:52.170> answer<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.560> questions<00:02:52.890> well

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
prepared to answer the questions well

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.160 
prepared to answer the questions well
how<00:02:53.310> am<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.549> going<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:54.120> use<00:02:54.390> this<00:02:54.630> what<00:02:54.900> does<00:02:55.049> it

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
how am I going to use this what does it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.949 
how am I going to use this what does it
mean<00:02:55.470> for<00:02:55.500> my<00:02:55.950> life<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.480> quick<00:02:57.720> answer

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
mean for my life and so the quick answer

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.059 
mean for my life and so the quick answer
is<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:59.220> stem<00:03:00.090> science<00:03:00.690> technology<00:03:01.069> that

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
is that stem science technology that

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.750 
is that stem science technology that
needs<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.670> be<00:03:02.849> engaging<00:03:03.810> we<00:03:04.620> have<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.250> make<00:03:05.610> it

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
needs to be engaging we have to make it

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.180 
needs to be engaging we have to make it
applicable<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:07.200> what<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.560> students<00:03:08.069> are

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
applicable to what the students are

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.890 
applicable to what the students are
actually<00:03:08.459> experiencing<00:03:09.330> in<00:03:09.450> their<00:03:09.480> own<00:03:09.690> so

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
actually experiencing in their own so

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.770 
actually experiencing in their own so
how<00:03:10.140> do<00:03:10.940> instructors<00:03:11.940> do<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.330> how<00:03:12.510> do<00:03:12.569> they

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
how do instructors do that how do they

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.390 
how do instructors do that how do they
make<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.110> more<00:03:13.260> engaging<00:03:13.410> disengaging<00:03:14.190> mean

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
make it more engaging disengaging mean

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.210 
make it more engaging disengaging mean
fun<00:03:15.090> does<00:03:15.660> in<00:03:15.810> gauging<00:03:16.170> me<00:03:16.349> I<00:03:16.560> mean<00:03:16.739> what<00:03:17.160> does

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
fun does in gauging me I mean what does

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.000 
fun does in gauging me I mean what does
it<00:03:17.340> mean<00:03:17.489> well<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.209> think<00:03:18.420> certainly<00:03:19.260> fun<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.859> in

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
it mean well I think certainly fun is in

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.460 
it mean well I think certainly fun is in
there<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.370> think<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.209> engaging<00:03:21.570> is<00:03:21.959> making

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
there but I think of engaging is making

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.289 
there but I think of engaging is making
sure<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.799> we<00:03:22.859> don't<00:03:22.980> confuse<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.970> with<00:03:24.000> fun

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
sure that we don't confuse it with fun

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.349 
sure that we don't confuse it with fun
it's<00:03:24.510> engaging<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:26.040> can<00:03:26.250> be<00:03:26.400> hard<00:03:27.030> fun

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
well I want to always think schools can

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.330 
well I want to always think schools can
be<00:03:44.940> fun<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.239> should<00:03:45.690> be<00:03:45.870> fun<00:03:46.109> but<00:03:46.290> also<00:03:46.500> to

where your interests lie they can use

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.990 
where your interests lie they can use
math<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:52.620> science<00:03:53.069> because<00:03:53.459> if<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.700> want<00:03:53.910> to

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
math and science because if you want to

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.789 
math and science because if you want to
be<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.120> dancer<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.750> have<00:03:55.079> to<00:03:55.230> know<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.560> count

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
be a dancer you have to know the count

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.039 
be a dancer you have to know the count
and<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.130> rhythm<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.639> music<00:03:56.850> so<00:03:57.329> it<00:03:57.750> comes

and the rhythm and music so it comes

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.199 
and the rhythm and music so it comes
into<00:03:58.350> every<00:03:58.799> facet<00:03:58.829> of<00:03:59.310> our<00:03:59.459> lives<00:03:59.519> it's<00:03:59.940> about

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
into every facet of our lives it's about

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.629 
into every facet of our lives it's about
relevancy<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.170> helping<00:04:01.889> kids<00:04:02.040> understand

relevancy and helping kids understand

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.430 
relevancy and helping kids understand
that<00:04:02.760> no<00:04:02.880> matter<00:04:02.910> what<00:04:03.359> it<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.540> they<00:04:03.810> aspire<00:04:04.230> to

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
that no matter what it is they aspire to

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.710 
that no matter what it is they aspire to
do<00:04:04.650> math<00:04:05.370> is<00:04:05.670> going<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.090> be<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.209> part<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.569> that

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
do math is going to be a part of that

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.140 
do math is going to be a part of that
but<00:04:06.900> what<00:04:07.109> kinds<00:04:07.410> of<00:04:07.500> resources<00:04:07.799> can<00:04:08.670> we<00:04:08.850> use

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
but what kinds of resources can we use

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.259 
but what kinds of resources can we use
to<00:04:09.600> keep<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:10.200> momentum<00:04:10.380> going<00:04:10.910> well<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.150> think

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
to keep that momentum going well I think

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.000 
to keep that momentum going well I think
that<00:04:13.579> having<00:04:14.579> the<00:04:14.790> technology<00:04:15.450> available<00:04:16.010> so

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
that having the technology available so

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.080 
that having the technology available so
that<00:04:17.039> it's<00:04:17.850> not<00:04:18.510> just<00:04:18.900> for<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.500> few

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
that it's not just for a few

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.990 
that it's not just for a few
in<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.959> sense<00:04:22.230> we<00:04:22.770> say<00:04:22.980> that<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.340> trans<00:04:23.610> that

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
in a sense we say that the trans that

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.870 
in a sense we say that the trans that
that<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.419> technology<00:04:24.870> is<00:04:25.260> transparent<00:04:26.010> as

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
that the technology is transparent as

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.270 
that the technology is transparent as
transparent<00:04:27.690> as<00:04:27.780> paper<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.530> pencil<00:04:28.860> we<00:04:29.040> take

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
transparent as paper and pencil we take

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.280 
transparent as paper and pencil we take
all<00:04:29.430> that<00:04:29.580> for<00:04:29.820> granted<00:04:29.970> it's<00:04:30.600> not<00:04:30.840> about<00:04:31.110> the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
all that for granted it's not about the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.090 
all that for granted it's not about the
technology<00:04:31.790> it's<00:04:32.790> about<00:04:33.000> learning<00:04:33.860> using<00:04:34.860> the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
technology it's about learning using the

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.590 
technology it's about learning using the
technology<00:04:35.520> learning<00:04:35.580> would<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.360> agree<00:04:36.510> with

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
technology learning would you agree with

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.629 
technology learning would you agree with
that<00:04:36.750> I<00:04:36.900> would<00:04:37.080> absolutely<00:04:37.410> agree<00:04:38.220> with<00:04:38.610> that

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
that I would absolutely agree with that

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.280 
that I would absolutely agree with that
and<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:38.970> would<00:04:39.150> also<00:04:39.300> say<00:04:39.660> that<00:04:39.690> more<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.199> more

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
and I would also say that more and more

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.500 
and I would also say that more and more
schools<00:04:40.710> are<00:04:40.860> becoming<00:04:41.330> Community<00:04:42.330> Learning

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
schools are becoming Community Learning

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.420 
schools are becoming Community Learning
Center's<00:04:43.050> so<00:04:43.199> it's<00:04:43.350> not<00:04:43.560> just<00:04:43.979> about<00:04:44.130> what

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
Center's so it's not just about what

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.490 
Center's so it's not just about what
happens<00:04:44.850> during<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.270> school<00:04:45.570> day<00:04:45.600> for

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
happens during the school day for

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.230 
happens during the school day for
students<00:04:46.949> it's<00:04:47.070> about<00:04:47.340> how<00:04:47.550> that<00:04:47.760> building

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
students it's about how that building

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.670 
students it's about how that building
and<00:04:48.330> those<00:04:48.479> resources<00:04:48.870> are<00:04:49.229> used<00:04:49.410> in<00:04:49.590> the

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
and those resources are used in the

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.800 
and those resources are used in the
community<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:50.280> that<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.760> parent<00:04:51.180> has<00:04:51.330> access

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
community so that the parent has access

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.719 
community so that the parent has access
and<00:04:52.050> can<00:04:52.110> become<00:04:52.290> comfortable<00:04:52.919> with<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.250> with
