00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
yeah you know when he just told us we

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.250 
yeah you know when he just told us we
couldn't<00:04:10.980> focus<00:04:11.310> on<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.670> offensive<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.360> you

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
couldn't focus on the offensive and you

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.230 
couldn't focus on the offensive and you
know<00:04:13.440> that<00:04:13.680> much<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.250> we<00:04:14.610> really<00:04:14.790> didn't<00:04:15.120> pay

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
know that much and we really didn't pay

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.270 
know that much and we really didn't pay
attention<00:04:15.270> on<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.080> defense<00:04:16.470> event<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.160> he

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
attention on the defense event so he

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.100 
attention on the defense event so he
just<00:04:17.459> told<00:04:17.700> us<00:04:17.850> it<00:04:18.060> really<00:04:18.209> starts<00:04:18.600> on<00:04:18.690> defense

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
just told us it really starts on defense

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.830 
just told us it really starts on defense
we<00:04:19.350> just<00:04:19.590> did<00:04:19.860> a<00:04:19.890> lot<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.299> defense<00:04:21.299> in<00:04:21.420> practice

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
we just did a lot of defense in practice

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.330 
we just did a lot of defense in practice
you<00:04:21.989> know<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.290> I<00:04:22.350> think<00:04:22.590> that's<00:04:22.830> what<00:04:22.980> changed

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
you know and I think that's what changed

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:35.999 
you know and I think that's what changed
for<00:04:23.490> us<00:04:24.110> front<00:04:25.110> right

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:44.439 

I'll<00:04:37.009> probably<00:04:37.279> not<00:04:42.399> yeah<00:04:43.399> it<00:04:43.699> really<00:04:43.849> has<00:04:44.029> you

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
I'll probably not yeah it really has you

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.299 
I'll probably not yeah it really has you
know<00:04:44.599> it<00:04:44.749> really<00:04:44.869> helped<00:04:45.289> us<00:04:45.379> you<00:04:45.619> know<00:04:45.769> helped

00:04:46.299 --> 00:04:46.309 
know it really helped us you know helped

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:48.669 
know it really helped us you know helped
out<00:04:46.429> a<00:04:46.459> lot<00:04:46.579> of<00:04:47.109> individual<00:04:48.109> players<00:04:48.349> and<00:04:48.619> I

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:48.679 
out a lot of individual players and I

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:50.019 
out a lot of individual players and I
think<00:04:48.919> it<00:04:49.009> brought<00:04:49.189> us<00:04:49.339> together<00:04:49.489> as<00:04:49.759> a<00:04:49.789> team

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:50.029 
think it brought us together as a team

00:04:50.029 --> 00:05:03.099 
think it brought us together as a team
or<00:04:50.529> very<00:04:51.529> bad<00:05:00.249> i<00:05:01.359> think<00:05:02.359> the<00:05:02.539> sec<00:05:03.079> tournament

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:03.109 
or very bad i think the sec tournament

00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:05.469 
or very bad i think the sec tournament
you<00:05:03.889> know<00:05:04.069> once<00:05:04.729> we<00:05:04.789> started<00:05:05.149> listening<00:05:05.329> to

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
you know once we started listening to

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.299 
you know once we started listening to
what<00:05:05.659> coach<00:05:05.839> one<00:05:06.439> has<00:05:06.619> to<00:05:06.649> do<00:05:06.949> you<00:05:07.159> know<00:05:07.279> I

00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:07.309 
what coach one has to do you know I

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:08.799 
what coach one has to do you know I
think<00:05:07.669> that's<00:05:07.879> when<00:05:08.059> they<00:05:08.119> all<00:05:08.269> changed<00:05:08.659> for

00:05:08.799 --> 00:05:08.809 
think that's when they all changed for

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:26.169 
think that's when they all changed for
us<00:05:22.899> yeah<00:05:23.899> you<00:05:24.139> know<00:05:24.489> we<00:05:25.489> haven't<00:05:25.789> really<00:05:25.909> been

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
and it just shows you know that we were

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.309 
and it just shows you know that we were
strong<00:05:58.969> enough<00:05:58.999> to<00:05:59.449> actually<00:05:59.779> bring<00:06:00.169> it

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 
strong enough to actually bring it

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.589 
strong enough to actually bring it
together<00:06:00.439> and<00:06:00.919> reach<00:06:01.189> our<00:06:01.339> goals<00:06:01.549> got<00:06:02.269> one<00:06:02.449> on

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
together and reach our goals got one on

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:19.970 
together and reach our goals got one on
the<00:06:02.689> right<00:06:02.869> and<00:06:03.259> to<00:06:03.289> the<00:06:03.439> left

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:31.340 

oh<00:06:28.100> yeah<00:06:29.100> i<00:06:29.310> think<00:06:29.460> i<00:06:29.970> think<00:06:30.630> we<00:06:30.930> come<00:06:31.170> together

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.260 
oh yeah i think i think we come together
because<00:06:31.800> we<00:06:32.010> were<00:06:32.100> tired<00:06:32.310> of<00:06:32.460> losing<00:06:32.850> you<00:06:33.150> know

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
because we were tired of losing you know

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.390 
because we were tired of losing you know
I<00:06:33.300> think<00:06:33.450> we<00:06:33.720> have<00:06:33.750> a<00:06:33.900> bunch<00:06:34.170> of<00:06:34.290> people<00:06:34.620> that

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
I think we have a bunch of people that

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.160 
I think we have a bunch of people that
are<00:06:35.520> competitors<00:06:35.970> on<00:06:36.150> this<00:06:36.300> team<00:06:36.510> and<00:06:36.540> we

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.170 
are competitors on this team and we

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.290 
are competitors on this team and we
weren't<00:06:37.350> used<00:06:37.680> to<00:06:37.800> losing<00:06:38.040> so<00:06:38.550> whenever<00:06:39.060> we

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
weren't used to losing so whenever we

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
weren't used to losing so whenever we
had<00:06:39.450> to<00:06:39.600> do<00:06:39.780> to<00:06:40.290> change<00:06:40.500> that<00:06:40.710> I<00:06:40.800> think<00:06:41.010> we<00:06:41.130> did
