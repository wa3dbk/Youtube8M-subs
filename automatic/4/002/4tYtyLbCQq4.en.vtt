some<00:02:50.349> tests<00:02:50.590> together<00:02:51.209> test<00:02:52.209> three<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.540> had<00:02:52.840> my

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
some tests together test three I had my

some tests together test three I had my
first<00:02:53.380> two<00:02:53.560> tests<00:02:53.800> we<00:02:53.920> were<00:02:54.040> pretty<00:02:54.220> good<00:02:54.400> and

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
first two tests we were pretty good and

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.080 
first two tests we were pretty good and
then<00:02:54.730> test<00:02:55.090> three<00:02:55.300> I<00:02:55.330> had<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.690> little<00:02:56.459> crash<00:02:57.459> so

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
then test three I had a little crash so

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.850 
then test three I had a little crash so
I<00:02:58.120> kind<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.840> hurt<00:02:58.959> my<00:02:58.989> time<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.319> little<00:02:59.440> bit<00:02:59.650> but

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
I kind of hurt my time a little bit but

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.449 
I kind of hurt my time a little bit but
then<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.819> rest<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.120> day<00:03:01.209> went<00:03:01.420> pretty<00:03:01.480> good<00:03:02.459> my

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
then the rest of day went pretty good my

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.040 
then the rest of day went pretty good my
next<00:03:03.730> three<00:03:03.880> four<00:03:04.239> tests<00:03:04.510> were<00:03:04.690> pretty<00:03:04.900> good

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
next three four tests were pretty good

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.080 
next three four tests were pretty good
so<00:03:05.319> overall<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.280> think<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.580> day<00:03:06.760> went<00:03:06.910> well<00:03:09.090> day

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
so overall I think the day went well day

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.630 
so overall I think the day went well day
three<00:03:10.709> they<00:03:11.709> told<00:03:11.950> us<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.190> was<00:03:12.310> going<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.489> be

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
three they told us it was going to be

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.030 
three they told us it was going to be
better<00:03:12.940> terrain<00:03:13.180> but<00:03:13.930> whoever<00:03:14.260> said<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.590> was

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
better terrain but whoever said that was

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.520 
better terrain but whoever said that was
a<00:03:15.330> little<00:03:16.330> out<00:03:16.420> there<00:03:16.480> i<00:03:16.720> think<00:03:17.049> as<00:03:17.230> there<00:03:17.410> was

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
a little out there i think as there was

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.729 
a little out there i think as there was
a<00:03:17.560> straight<00:03:17.950> i<00:03:18.459> left<00:03:19.030> check<00:03:19.299> too<00:03:19.569> and<00:03:19.989> i<00:03:20.470> looked

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
a straight i left check too and i looked

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.770 
a straight i left check too and i looked
out<00:03:20.860> at<00:03:20.980> my<00:03:21.069> watch<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.340> was<00:03:21.640> 20<00:03:22.090> minutes<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:22.510> San

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
out at my watch it was 20 minutes of San

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.380 
out at my watch it was 20 minutes of San
whoops<00:03:23.080> out<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.400> back<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.000> was<00:03:25.209> pretty

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
whoops out and back so that was pretty

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.630 
whoops out and back so that was pretty
interesting<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:26.110> uh<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.530> struggled<00:03:27.310> early<00:03:27.519> on

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
interesting and uh I struggled early on

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.280 
interesting and uh I struggled early on
with<00:03:27.819> my<00:03:27.940> ankle<00:03:28.299> but<00:03:28.540> everything<00:03:29.170> that's

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
with my ankle but everything that's

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.559 
with my ankle but everything that's
going<00:03:29.530> good<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:30.549> crashed<00:03:30.850> in<00:03:31.060> one<00:03:31.330> test

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
going good and I crashed in one test

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.990 
going good and I crashed in one test
today<00:03:31.870> which<00:03:32.230> cost<00:03:32.709> me<00:03:32.860> about<00:03:33.010> 20<00:03:33.430> seconds<00:03:33.850> so

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
today which cost me about 20 seconds so

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.610 
today which cost me about 20 seconds so
that<00:03:34.030> kind<00:03:34.330> of<00:03:34.390> bummed<00:03:34.600> out<00:03:34.720> my<00:03:34.930> whole<00:03:35.140> day<00:03:35.319> but

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
that kind of bummed out my whole day but

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.500 
that kind of bummed out my whole day but
other<00:03:36.130> than<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.430> nailed<00:03:37.000> all<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.180> tests

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
other than that I nailed all the tests

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.720 
other than that I nailed all the tests
and<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.319> other<00:03:38.680> Junior<00:03:39.069> is<00:03:39.340> doing<00:03:39.370> really

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
and the other Junior is doing really

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.030 
and the other Junior is doing really
good<00:03:39.970> today<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:40.299> I<00:03:40.510> think<00:03:40.600> I<00:03:41.530> think<00:03:41.829> we<00:03:41.920> should

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
good today so I think I think we should

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.330 
good today so I think I think we should
be<00:03:42.160> right<00:03:42.310> up<00:03:42.340> there<00:03:42.459> for<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.000> overall<00:03:44.340> that's

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
be right up there for the overall that's

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.949 
be right up there for the overall that's
why<00:03:45.489> hand<00:03:45.730> guards<00:03:46.030> are<00:03:46.180> working<00:03:46.450> like<00:03:46.570> a<00:03:46.600> dream

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
why hand guards are working like a dream

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.559 

the<00:04:12.859> women's<00:04:13.219> team<00:04:13.310> i<00:04:13.549> think<00:04:13.819> is<00:04:13.879> in<00:04:14.060> third<00:04:14.420> or

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
the women's team i think is in third or

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.779 
the women's team i think is in third or
fourth<00:04:14.840> overall<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:15.590> but<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.549> was<00:04:16.639> after

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
fourth overall and but that was after

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.310 
fourth overall and but that was after
yesterday<00:04:17.359> so<00:04:17.419> i<00:04:17.570> don't<00:04:17.750> know<00:04:17.840> about<00:04:17.959> today

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320

and me and Mandy had some really good
test<00:04:21.199> times<00:04:21.500> so<00:04:21.949> I<00:04:22.280> think<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:23.270> think<00:04:23.600> it's<00:04:23.690> gonna

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
test times so I think I think it's gonna

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:31.930 
test times so I think I think it's gonna
be<00:04:23.930> good
