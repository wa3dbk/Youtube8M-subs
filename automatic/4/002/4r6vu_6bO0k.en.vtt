00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.210 

sit<00:04:21.780> one<00:04:21.900> more<00:04:21.989> time

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.140 

so<00:04:26.220> this<00:04:26.370> time<00:04:26.520> she'll<00:04:26.699> kick<00:04:26.849> up<00:04:26.940> with<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
with our not good leg it's a much more

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.189 
with our not good leg it's a much more
challenging<00:04:40.430> all<00:04:41.430> right<00:04:41.520> so<00:04:41.729> she<00:04:41.789> keeps

pulling these ribs in keeps lengthening
this<00:04:45.569> tailbone<00:04:46.169> and<00:04:46.590> then<00:04:47.159> maybe<00:04:47.400> she<00:04:47.669> can

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699
