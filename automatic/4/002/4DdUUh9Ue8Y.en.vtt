these<00:03:46.590> two<00:03:46.799> pieces<00:03:47.190> out<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.720> will<00:03:48.720> unscrew

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
these two pieces out I will unscrew

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.680 
these two pieces out I will unscrew
these<00:03:49.650> two<00:03:49.709> guys<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:52.850> those<00:03:53.850> two<00:03:54.120> bolts<00:03:54.389> on

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
these two guys and those two bolts on

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.190 
these two guys and those two bolts on
that<00:03:54.870> side<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.549> you<00:03:56.549> will<00:03:56.730> have<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.930> two

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
that side and you will have the two

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.309 
that side and you will have the two
white<00:03:58.530> support<00:03:59.040> bars<00:03:59.310> separately<00:04:00.109> then<00:04:01.109> you

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
white support bars separately then you

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.069 
white support bars separately then you
get<00:04:01.739> this<00:04:02.190> separately<00:04:02.819> this<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.870> bar

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
get this separately this is the bar

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.069 
get this separately this is the bar
that's<00:04:04.290> suppose<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.829> two<00:04:05.040> pieces<00:04:05.730> together

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
that's suppose the two pieces together

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:13.130 
that's suppose the two pieces together
and<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:08.450> will<00:04:09.450> take<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:09.959> apart<00:04:10.380> and

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
and I will take this apart and

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.460 

this<00:04:13.950> will<00:04:14.190> be<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.430> third<00:04:14.640> piece<00:04:15.200> this<00:04:16.200> right

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
this will be the third piece this right

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.099 
this will be the third piece this right
here<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.890> white<00:04:17.100> piece<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:18.690> seat<00:04:18.900> will

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
here the white piece and the seat will

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.690 
here the white piece and the seat will
come<00:04:19.350> off<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:22.500> basically<00:04:23.100> should<00:04:23.400> be<00:04:23.520> it

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
come off and that basically should be it

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:34.760 
come off and that basically should be it
I<00:04:24.000> have<00:04:24.750> one<00:04:24.990> barbell<00:04:28.370> right<00:04:29.370> here<00:04:30.650> but<00:04:33.770> you

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
I have one barbell right here but you

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.790
