within<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.700> three<00:00:47.850> players<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.300> actually

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
within the three players you actually

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.119 
within the three players you actually
have<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> use<00:00:48.750> different<00:00:49.289> pokemon<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.890> for

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
have to use different pokemon so for

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.250 
have to use different pokemon so for
example<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.670> Ray<00:00:51.210> uses<00:00:51.570> kangaskhan<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
example if Ray uses kangaskhan that I

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.709 
example if Ray uses kangaskhan that I
can't<00:00:52.500> use<00:00:52.649> Kangaskhan<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.309> Matt<00:00:53.520> uses<00:00:53.730> you

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
can't use Kangaskhan if Matt uses you

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.090 
can't use Kangaskhan if Matt uses you
know<00:00:54.809> mall<00:00:55.020> while<00:00:55.170> deny<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.620> rain<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
know mall while deny the rain and I

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.180 
know mall while deny the rain and I
could<00:00:56.309> use<00:00:56.430> mall<00:00:56.640> while<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.809> case

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
could use mall while so for this case

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.920 
could use mall while so for this case

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.539 
preview on Venus or was the only thing
that<00:01:28.229> really<00:01:28.439> caught<00:01:28.710> my<00:01:28.770> attention<00:01:28.860> as<00:01:29.430> well

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
that really caught my attention as well

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.280 
that really caught my attention as well
as<00:01:29.640> reading<00:01:30.210> class<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.509> need<00:01:30.630> reading<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.140> would

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
as reading class I need reading so would

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.080 
as reading class I need reading so would
most<00:01:31.470> likely<00:01:31.650> be<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.829> mega<00:01:32.070> Pokemon<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.670> didn't

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
most likely be the mega Pokemon I didn't

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.700 
most likely be the mega Pokemon I didn't
really<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.390> any<00:01:33.509> good<00:01:33.600> ways<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.320> take<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> out

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
really have any good ways to take it out

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.289 
really have any good ways to take it out
so<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> decided<00:01:35.369> bisharp<00:01:35.850> would<00:01:35.939> probably<00:01:36.210> be

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
so I decided bisharp would probably be

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.210 
so I decided bisharp would probably be
the<00:01:36.450> best<00:01:36.600> way<00:01:36.840> relying<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.350> assurance<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the best way relying on assurance and a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.399 
the best way relying on assurance and a
combo<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.049> gonna<00:01:40.140> go<00:01:40.320> with

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
combo with that so I'm gonna go with

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.530 
combo with that so I'm gonna go with
Aerodactyl<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.100> manectric<00:01:41.670> instead<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
Aerodactyl and manectric instead of the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.569 
Aerodactyl and manectric instead of the
aerodactyl<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.470> bit<00:01:43.680> short<00:01:43.829> pump<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.310> hoping

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
aerodactyl a bit short pump I was hoping

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.639 
aerodactyl a bit short pump I was hoping
I<00:01:44.670> lead<00:01:44.880> with<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.780> right<00:01:46.020> away<00:01:46.110> I'm<00:01:46.439> already

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
I lead with and right away I'm already

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.139 
I lead with and right away I'm already
kind<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.950> frustrated<00:01:47.430> because<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.700> know<00:01:47.820> Bishop

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
kind of frustrated because I know Bishop

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.240 
kind of frustrated because I know Bishop
would<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> fantastic<00:01:48.990> job<00:01:49.259> against<00:01:49.740> both<00:01:50.040> my

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
would do a fantastic job against both my

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.219 
would do a fantastic job against both my
opponent's<00:01:50.610> pokemon<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:51.149> don't<00:01:51.600> mega<00:01:51.810> evolve

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
opponent's pokemon I don't mega evolve

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.690 
opponent's pokemon I don't mega evolve
manectric<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.950> because<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.490> see<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
manectric just because I don't see the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.179 
manectric just because I don't see the
need<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.180> right<00:01:54.659> away<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> section<00:01:56.009> comes

need to right away and the section comes
into<00:01:56.460> play<00:01:56.670> which<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.149> really<00:01:57.420> important<00:01:57.930> in

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
into play which is really important in

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.990 
into play which is really important in

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
would have just been able to take it out

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.560 
would have just been able to take it out
at<00:05:07.440> this<00:05:07.560> point<00:05:07.680> even<00:05:08.220> if<00:05:08.430> he<00:05:08.610> didn't<00:05:09.000> target

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
at this point even if he didn't target

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.150 
at this point even if he didn't target
himself<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.199> game<00:05:10.320> was<00:05:10.470> pretty<00:05:10.590> much<00:05:10.800> over<00:05:10.949> at

himself the game was pretty much over at
my<00:05:11.280> point<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:11.789> so<00:05:11.970> I<00:05:12.000> was<00:05:12.240> able<00:05:12.510> to<00:05:12.900> use<00:05:13.520> Rotom

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
my point and so I was able to use Rotom

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.070 
my point and so I was able to use Rotom
