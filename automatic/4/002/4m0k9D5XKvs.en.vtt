00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.330 

so<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:20.940> we've<00:01:21.180> got<00:01:21.360> our<00:01:22.340> accessory<00:01:23.340> strap

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
so here we've got our accessory strap

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.340 
so here we've got our accessory strap
this<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.550> the<00:01:27.480> simplest<00:01:27.840> setup<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.200> could

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
this is the simplest setup we could

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.220 
this is the simplest setup we could
think<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.130> execute<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.480> allow<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
think of and execute to allow you to

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.110 
think of and execute to allow you to
easily<00:01:31.380> carry<00:01:31.770> your<00:01:31.980> stuff<00:01:32.070> onto<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.910> off<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
easily carry your stuff onto and off the

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.050 
easily carry your stuff onto and off the
mountain<00:01:33.420> no<00:01:34.230> tools<00:01:34.530> involved<00:01:35.040> no<00:01:35.340> knots<00:01:35.610> no

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
mountain no tools involved no knots no

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.900 
mountain no tools involved no knots no
anything<00:01:36.780> involved<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.130> way<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.370> works<00:01:38.580> is

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
anything involved so the way it works is

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
anything involved so the way it works is
just<00:01:40.280> do<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> loop<00:01:42.860> it's<00:01:43.860> not<00:01:44.040> secure<00:01:44.660> and<00:01:45.660> on

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
just do a loop it's not secure and on

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:59.000 
just do a loop it's not secure and on
the<00:01:46.080> other<00:01:46.200> end<00:01:46.410> here<00:01:50.180> same<00:01:51.180> thing<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.680> now<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
the other end here same thing so now you

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.610 
the other end here same thing so now you
can<00:01:59.250> wrap<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.729> strap<00:01:59.940> anything<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.720> bend

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
can wrap and strap anything you can bend

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.830 
can wrap and strap anything you can bend
it<00:02:01.710> around<00:02:01.979> corners<00:02:02.430> change<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> length<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
it around corners change the length the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.900 
it around corners change the length the
other<00:02:03.960> thing<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.260> we<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.220> do<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.610> need

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
other thing that we can do if you need

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.109 
other thing that we can do if you need
something<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.300> be<00:02:06.360> shorter<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.910> let's

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
something to be shorter is you do let's

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.330 
something to be shorter is you do let's
say<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.270> double<00:02:09.479> wrap<00:02:09.720> or<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> triple<00:02:10.920> wrap<00:02:11.160> or

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
say a double wrap or a triple wrap or

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.910 
say a double wrap or a triple wrap or
more<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:12.140> that's<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.350> like<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.680> you've

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
more and that's just like that you've

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.760 
more and that's just like that you've
got<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.070> shorter<00:02:14.760> strap<00:02:14.970> now<00:02:15.290> so<00:02:16.290> I'll<00:02:16.590> just

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
got a shorter strap now so I'll just

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:27.520 
got a shorter strap now so I'll just
bring<00:02:17.070> over<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.370> jerrican

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.100 

go<00:02:28.530> back<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.160> single<00:02:30.090> for<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.720> big<00:02:30.870> Gary

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
go back to the single for the big Gary

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.330 
go back to the single for the big Gary
came<00:02:31.320> here<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.660> rack<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:37.140> designed<00:02:37.380> so

in a bag like this these are all the
loose<00:04:01.650> parts<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:03.890> you<00:04:04.890> end<00:04:05.069> up<00:04:05.250> putting<00:04:05.760> it

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
loose parts and you end up putting it

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.449 
loose parts and you end up putting it
together<00:04:06.120> into<00:04:06.599> two<00:04:06.750> pieces<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.099> the

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
together into two pieces this is the

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.819 
together into two pieces this is the
front<00:04:08.730> with<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.569> small<00:04:09.810> angle<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.650> then<00:04:10.769> this

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
front with the small angle and then this

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.020 
front with the small angle and then this
is<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.069> back<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.459> get<00:04:11.549> a<00:04:11.609> little<00:04:11.730> bit<00:04:11.910> of

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
is the back so you get a little bit of

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.610 
is the back so you get a little bit of
tilt<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.780> show<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.049> how<00:04:13.140> that<00:04:13.230> works<00:04:13.440> in<00:04:13.560> the

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
tilt to show you how that works in the

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.890 
tilt to show you how that works in the
second<00:04:16.130> stack<00:04:17.130> up<00:04:17.280> all<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.489> parts<00:04:17.760> in<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.970> row

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.980 

you<00:04:22.550> put<00:04:23.550> in<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.760> locator<00:04:24.090> on<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.330> side<00:04:24.539> so

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
you put in the locator on the side so

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.830 
you put in the locator on the side so
that<00:04:25.139> will<00:04:25.260> go<00:04:25.380> like<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.490> and<00:04:27.590> then<00:04:29.840> strap

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
that will go like that and then strap

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.920 
that will go like that and then strap
sits<00:04:31.139> like<00:04:31.860> this<00:04:31.889> and<00:04:32.370> then<00:04:33.030> on<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.240> inside<00:04:33.419> of

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
sits like this and then on the inside of

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.580 
sits like this and then on the inside of
the<00:04:34.260> snowmobile<00:04:35.539> you<00:04:36.539> use<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.110> same<00:04:37.229> looping

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
the snowmobile you use the same looping

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.120 
the snowmobile you use the same looping
system<00:04:38.000> or<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.120> strap<00:04:39.539> boom<00:04:40.229> over<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:41.010> goes

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
system or the strap boom over it goes

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.089 
system or the strap boom over it goes
like<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.990> two<00:04:43.169> parts<00:04:43.440> mate<00:04:46.099> and

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
like that and the two parts mate and

00:04:47.099 --> 00:05:01.230 
like that and the two parts mate and
you're<00:04:47.220> good<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.430> go

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:14.650 

I'll<00:05:02.240> show<00:05:02.450> you<00:05:02.510> guys<00:05:02.660> that<00:05:02.870> works<00:05:13.330> so<00:05:14.330> as<00:05:14.360> you

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
I'll show you guys that works so as you

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.080 
I'll show you guys that works so as you
can<00:05:14.780> see<00:05:14.860> snowbirds<00:05:15.860> already<00:05:16.070> on<00:05:16.190> this<00:05:16.850> sled

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
can see snowbirds already on this sled

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.750 
can see snowbirds already on this sled
this<00:05:17.300> is<00:05:17.390> a<00:05:17.450> compact<00:05:17.750> rack<00:05:18.020> and<00:05:18.410> we<00:05:19.190> got<00:05:19.400> it

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
this is a compact rack and we got it

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.330 
this is a compact rack and we got it
leveraged<00:05:20.480> out<00:05:20.660> to<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:20.900> back<00:05:21.110> of<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.860> board

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
leveraged out to the back of the board

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.830 
leveraged out to the back of the board
so<00:05:22.700> that<00:05:22.730> you've<00:05:22.940> got<00:05:23.060> lots<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.360> rider<00:05:23.570> space

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
so that you've got lots of rider space

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.060 
so that you've got lots of rider space
just<00:05:24.080> show<00:05:24.140> them<00:05:24.260> how<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.380> room<00:05:24.620> there<00:05:24.770> is<00:05:24.890> it

just show them how the room there is it
happy<00:05:25.700> so<00:05:26.390> this<00:05:26.540> is<00:05:26.690> what's<00:05:26.900> uh<00:05:27.110> it's<00:05:27.650> not

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
happy so this is what's uh it's not

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.840 
happy so this is what's uh it's not
taking<00:05:28.100> up<00:05:28.390> over<00:05:29.390> top<00:05:30.220> so<00:05:31.220> that's<00:05:31.400> you<00:05:31.760> got

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
taking up over top so that's you got

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.060 
taking up over top so that's you got
plenty<00:05:32.000> of<00:05:32.150> room<00:05:32.300> to<00:05:32.360> still<00:05:32.600> maneuver<00:05:33.070> around

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
plenty of room to still maneuver around

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:44.560 
plenty of room to still maneuver around
so<00:05:34.520> when<00:05:34.640> you're<00:05:42.730> but<00:05:43.730> you<00:05:43.910> could<00:05:44.120> mount<00:05:44.300> it

they'll<00:06:00.200> just<00:06:00.230> sit<00:06:00.860> like<00:06:00.890> this<00:06:01.040> for<00:06:01.670> the<00:06:01.940> rest

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
they'll just sit like this for the rest

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.900 
they'll just sit like this for the rest
for<00:06:02.390> their<00:06:02.540> for<00:06:02.930> your<00:06:03.050> riding<00:06:03.440> without<00:06:03.740> your

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
for their for your riding without your

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.340 
for their for your riding without your
snowboards<00:06:04.910> and<00:06:05.840> then<00:06:05.930> when<00:06:06.050> you<00:06:06.110> want<00:06:06.200> to

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
snowboards and then when you want to

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:25.250 
snowboards and then when you want to
keep<00:06:06.440> this<00:06:06.590> board<00:06:06.919> yes

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.240 

and<00:06:26.260> just<00:06:26.470> like<00:06:26.590> that<00:06:26.710> you're<00:06:26.920> ready<00:06:27.070> to<00:06:27.190> go

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
and just like that you're ready to go

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.340 
and just like that you're ready to go
back<00:06:27.400> up<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.670> mountain<00:06:27.790> so<00:06:28.540> obviously<00:06:29.260> you

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
back up the mountain so obviously you

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.710 
back up the mountain so obviously you
can<00:06:29.410> put<00:06:29.620> one<00:06:29.800> on<00:06:29.890> either<00:06:30.010> side<00:06:30.130> as<00:06:30.670> you<00:06:31.420> saw

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
can put one on either side as you saw

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.540 
can put one on either side as you saw
before<00:06:31.930> I<00:06:32.110> had<00:06:32.440> the<00:06:32.530> jerry<00:06:32.710> cans<00:06:32.950> in<00:06:33.100> here<00:06:33.370> with

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
before I had the jerry cans in here with

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.300 
before I had the jerry cans in here with
the<00:06:33.670> snowboard<00:06:34.030> already<00:06:34.270> on<00:06:34.390> so<00:06:34.770> so<00:06:35.770> it's<00:06:36.160> all

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
the snowboard already on so so it's all

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.330 
the snowboard already on so so it's all
set<00:06:37.000> up<00:06:37.120> so<00:06:37.240> you<00:06:37.300> can<00:06:38.040> don't<00:06:39.040> get<00:06:39.130> any

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
set up so you can don't get any

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.010 
set up so you can don't get any
interference<00:06:39.820> that<00:06:39.940> way<00:06:40.090> and<00:06:40.600> you<00:06:40.690> can<00:06:40.840> just

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
interference that way and you can just

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.110 
interference that way and you can just
carry<00:06:41.350> lots<00:06:41.650> of<00:06:41.800> fuel<00:06:41.920> and<00:06:42.190> lots<00:06:42.340> of<00:06:42.550> boards

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
carry lots of fuel and lots of boards

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.650 
carry lots of fuel and lots of boards
whenever<00:06:43.360> you<00:06:43.450> want<00:06:45.090> so<00:06:46.090> now<00:06:46.120> I'll<00:06:46.360> walk<00:06:46.510> you

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
whenever you want so now I'll walk you

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.290 
whenever you want so now I'll walk you
over<00:06:46.720> to<00:06:46.990> the<00:06:47.110> ski<00:06:47.350> set<00:06:47.620> up<00:06:49.710> the<00:06:50.710> ski<00:06:50.950> saps

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
over to the ski set up the ski saps

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.520 
over to the ski set up the ski saps
almost<00:06:52.300> identical<00:06:52.750> to<00:06:52.780> the<00:06:52.870> snowboard<00:06:53.170> setup

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
almost identical to the snowboard setup

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.170 
almost identical to the snowboard setup
except<00:06:54.070> we<00:06:54.490> just<00:06:54.520> have<00:06:54.760> to<00:06:54.850> make<00:06:54.970> room<00:06:55.120> for

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
except we just have to make room for

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.030 
except we just have to make room for
obviously<00:06:55.600> the<00:06:55.690> different<00:06:55.990> geometry<00:06:56.440> this<00:06:56.980> is

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
obviously the different geometry this is

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.550 
obviously the different geometry this is
pretty<00:06:57.790> leveraged<00:06:58.150> at<00:06:58.270> the<00:06:58.390> back<00:06:58.570> as<00:06:59.320> you<00:06:59.350> can

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
pretty leveraged at the back as you can

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:07.170 
pretty leveraged at the back as you can
see<00:06:59.740> but<00:07:04.710> so<00:07:05.710> no<00:07:05.860> problem<00:07:06.190> there<00:07:06.220> you<00:07:06.730> just<00:07:06.970> jam

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
see but so no problem there you just jam

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:17.220 
see but so no problem there you just jam
the<00:07:15.330> little<00:07:16.330> trick<00:07:16.510> here<00:07:16.540> to<00:07:16.690> get<00:07:16.840> stuff<00:07:17.050> on

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.230 
the little trick here to get stuff on

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.380 
the little trick here to get stuff on
but<00:07:17.440> you<00:07:17.530> come<00:07:17.710> in<00:07:17.860> here<00:07:18.130> the<00:07:19.120> end<00:07:19.240> of<00:07:19.330> your

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.390 
but you come in here the end of your

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:38.480 
but you come in here the end of your
ride<00:07:19.600> and<00:07:20.310> just<00:07:21.570> fire<00:07:22.570> the<00:07:23.430> strap<00:07:24.430> over<00:07:24.580> top

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:38.490 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.850 

and<00:07:39.490> they'll<00:07:39.700> sit<00:07:39.940> there<00:07:39.970> so<00:07:40.360> you<00:07:40.450> can<00:07:40.860> grab

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:41.860 
and they'll sit there so you can grab

00:07:41.860 --> 00:08:05.489 
and they'll sit there so you can grab
your<00:07:42.010> poles

00:08:05.489 --> 00:08:05.499 

00:08:05.499 --> 00:08:09.819 

and<00:08:06.499> you're<00:08:06.649> good<00:08:06.829> so<00:08:07.609> I<00:08:08.439> think<00:08:09.439> that's<00:08:09.679> all

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:09.829 
and you're good so I think that's all

00:08:09.829 --> 00:08:12.429 
and you're good so I think that's all
the<00:08:10.009> setups<00:08:10.479> everything<00:08:11.479> is<00:08:11.809> compatible<00:08:12.139> with

00:08:12.429 --> 00:08:12.439 
the setups everything is compatible with

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:14.049 
the setups everything is compatible with
everything<00:08:12.619> else<00:08:12.829> you<00:08:13.009> can<00:08:13.279> fire<00:08:13.699> it<00:08:13.819> in<00:08:13.939> and

00:08:14.049 --> 00:08:14.059 
everything else you can fire it in and

00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:18.099 
everything else you can fire it in and
out<00:08:14.179> and<00:08:14.919> there<00:08:15.919> you<00:08:16.009> go
