 I'll do it myself to help you. 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.270
 doubts that are more 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.450
 frequent 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.610
 I will help but life here is just to 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.000
 talk a little bit about what's going to be 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.250
 rolling in the channel and for those who do not 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.500
 know I'm the good point guard I have one 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.559
 another channel that calls any way 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.629
 in the description then it will be very difficult 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.609
 care of two channels the same time and 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.010
 others my home that is also from minecraft 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.090
 also put things expensive came to 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.770
 xii of a daycare tutorial passes in 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.240
 channel takes a look you see how it is 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.470
 that is right 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.479
 so I do not know if anyone will help me 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.880
 Because I know a lot of staff 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.450
 personnel that manages the server 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.400
 Can video then maybe help me? 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.409
 maybe not but it does not matter, I just know 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.570
 I'll post videos just to help. 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.159
 that you will certainly record some 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.030
 events that happen from time to time 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.680
 important as the warrior event 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.430
 before he was a gladiator but now he has 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.460
 name for warrior and good lately 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.829
 It's alright, baby, it's the limit. 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.100
 maximum to 90 people staff so much 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.500
 thing then just do not know what usually 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.740
 is full at the three-hour 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.259
 usually the warrior event that the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.119
 most important event of the Serbian 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.770
 I'll explain a little bit but I'll make one 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.270
 video for you guys I'll show you a bit of 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.969
 event 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.219
 Warrior goes I had a battle of 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.229
 clans the case you are only this way you can 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.500
 To fight alone, everybody has a problem. 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.379
 So we stay the whole week. 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.450
 training or mining to catch 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.620
 money and buy 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.489
 hard to fight in the warrior event 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.870
 so it 's a really cool event and 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.930
 able to re-divide the team of 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.900
 channel showing this event everything else 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.819
 right 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.220
 Another thing I'm going to teach you is 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.590
 how to buy items is quite easy but 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.730
 also teach a lot of people ask everything 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.010
 more 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.879
 in the personal description about the Serbian will 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.830
 being the site will have the ipi goes to the 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.810
 skype that serves to clear questions for 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.870
 the suggestions you have that help 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.160
 also very often are the Swiss in 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:55.310
 very useful and for complaints or if 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.040
 some plate or something you curse 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.130
 Can I come here on Skype to add people? 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.910
 will select and you say what happened is 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.819
 very easy and put person is basically 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.769
 I hope you subscribe to the 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.280
 I can also channel most of the 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:18.319
 Are you watching the server's are? 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.329
 players or game is not good then it's more 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.870
 Anyway, I do not think so. 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.190
 You guys are going to enjoy it a lot and that's it. 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.200
 I hope that you have 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.420
 video briefly return to serve and not 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.819

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.389

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.810

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.650

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.489
 the next 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.489
