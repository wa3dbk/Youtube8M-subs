00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
rotated them all the time they seemed

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.350 
rotated them all the time they seemed
this<00:01:49.100> one<00:01:49.370> I<00:01:49.400> mean<00:01:49.640> don't<00:01:49.790> get<00:01:49.850> me<00:01:49.910> wrong<00:01:50.030> it's

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
this one I mean don't get me wrong it's

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.270

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
just like it rotates it's nice and loose

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.410 
just like it rotates it's nice and loose
but<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:53.330> won't<00:01:53.900> come<00:01:54.080> out<00:01:54.230> like<00:01:55.100> at<00:01:55.370> all<00:01:55.730> like

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
but it won't come out like at all like

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.690 
but it won't come out like at all like
the<00:01:56.690> flares<00:01:56.930> just<00:01:57.230> too<00:01:57.410> big<00:01:57.650> and<00:01:57.920> every<00:01:58.460> time<00:01:58.670> I

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
the flares just too big and every time I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.600 
the flares just too big and every time I
try<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.030> go<00:01:59.270> like<00:01:59.660> it<00:02:00.170> doesn't<00:02:00.500> hurt<00:02:00.830> per<00:02:01.340> se

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
try and go like it doesn't hurt per se

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.880 
try and go like it doesn't hurt per se
when<00:02:02.330> I<00:02:02.360> try<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:02.720> push<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.170> out<00:02:03.290> but<00:02:03.560> it's<00:02:03.710> just

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
when I try and push it out but it's just

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.680 
when I try and push it out but it's just
like<00:02:04.010> you<00:02:04.130> can<00:02:04.310> tell<00:02:04.520> is<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.700> tension<00:02:05.090> there<00:02:05.480> and

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
like you can tell is a tension there and

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.660 
like you can tell is a tension there and
I<00:02:06.080> don't<00:02:06.230> want<00:02:06.530> to<00:02:06.620> just<00:02:06.800> like<00:02:06.950> blow<00:02:07.310> out<00:02:07.490> my

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
I don't want to just like blow out my

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.639 
I don't want to just like blow out my
ear<00:02:07.940> or<00:02:08.179> rip<00:02:08.420> my<00:02:08.599> ear<00:02:08.840> pulling<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:09.319> out<00:02:09.409> like

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
ear or rip my ear pulling it out like

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.410 
ear or rip my ear pulling it out like
it's<00:02:09.859> obviously<00:02:10.340> not<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.879> problem<00:02:11.359> like

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
it's obviously not a problem like

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.210 
it's obviously not a problem like
it's<00:02:12.480> not<00:02:12.630> too<00:02:13.020> tight<00:02:13.260> or<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.709> pressures<00:02:14.069> and

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
it's not too tight or the pressures and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.830 
it's not too tight or the pressures and
too<00:02:14.370> big<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.550> it's<00:02:14.880> gonna<00:02:15.000> blow<00:02:15.240> out<00:02:15.420> my<00:02:15.569> ear

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
too big that it's gonna blow out my ear

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.780 
too big that it's gonna blow out my ear
it's<00:02:16.349> just<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.650> flavor<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.160> too<00:02:17.340> big<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.670> my

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
it's just the flavor is too big in my

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.030 
it's just the flavor is too big in my
ears<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.150> isn't<00:02:18.540> used<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.680> can't

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
ears just isn't used to it so I can't

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.839 
ears just isn't used to it so I can't
get<00:02:20.190> out

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
get out

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.020 
get out
but<00:02:21.560> I'm<00:02:22.560> guessing<00:02:22.860> in<00:02:23.160> due<00:02:23.310> time<00:02:23.520> if<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.880> just

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
but I'm guessing in due time if I just

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.870 
but I'm guessing in due time if I just
leave<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.830> I've<00:02:25.830> been<00:02:26.040> washing<00:02:26.550> around

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
leave it in and I've been washing around

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.970 
leave it in and I've been washing around
it<00:02:27.239> pulling<00:02:27.660> out<00:02:27.780> as<00:02:27.930> far<00:02:28.140> as<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.290> will<00:02:28.560> and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
it pulling out as far as it will and

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.440 
it pulling out as far as it will and
pulling<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:29.610> out<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.880> just<00:02:29.970> trying<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.270> get

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
pulling it out and just trying to get

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.940 
pulling it out and just trying to get
the<00:02:30.600> soap<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.989> there<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.350> I've<00:02:31.440> been<00:02:31.590> rubbing

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
the soap in there and I've been rubbing

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.800 
the soap in there and I've been rubbing
oil<00:02:32.160> around<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.670> edges<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.209> around<00:02:33.690> the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
oil around the edges and around the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.780 
oil around the edges and around the
sides<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.739> try<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.069> naturally<00:02:35.430> just<00:02:35.489> loosen

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
sides to try and naturally just loosen

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.090 
sides to try and naturally just loosen
up<00:02:35.850> I've<00:02:36.030> been<00:02:36.060> pulling<00:02:36.510> on<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> bit<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.739> when

my<00:02:56.610> ears<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.630> now<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.930> have<00:02:57.959> plugs<00:02:58.739> that

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
my ears so now that I have plugs that

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.150 
my ears so now that I have plugs that
are<00:02:59.040> closer<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.670> 7/8<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.930> want<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.410> have<00:03:01.890> taped

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
are closer to 7/8 I want to have taped

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.190 
are closer to 7/8 I want to have taped
nearly<00:03:02.549> as<00:03:02.640> much<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.120> my<00:03:03.390> ear<00:03:03.630> can<00:03:03.930> make<00:03:04.080> it

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
nearly as much and my ear can make it

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.830 
nearly as much and my ear can make it
70s<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:05.400> I'll<00:03:05.940> probably<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.360> another<00:03:06.569> video

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
70s so I'll probably have another video

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.229 
70s so I'll probably have another video
before<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.560> make<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.160> 7/8<00:03:08.580> definitely<00:03:09.150> have

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
before I make it to 7/8 definitely have

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.390 
before I make it to 7/8 definitely have
a<00:03:09.450> video<00:03:09.780> or<00:03:09.930> two<00:03:09.959> by<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.739> one<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.100> let<00:03:11.250> you
