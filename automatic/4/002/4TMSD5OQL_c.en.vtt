00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.650 

probably<00:01:27.830> wondering<00:01:28.250> why<00:01:28.730> I<00:01:29.150> am<00:01:29.630> a

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
probably wondering why I am a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.580 
probably wondering why I am a

why I have to shape-shift all the time

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.860 
why I have to shape-shift all the time
well<00:01:33.950> my<00:01:34.220> real<00:01:34.670> father<00:01:34.970> said<00:01:35.300> it<00:01:35.390> was<00:01:35.420> because

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
well my real father said it was because

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.100 
well my real father said it was because
I<00:01:36.170> was<00:01:36.650> special<00:01:37.100> or<00:01:37.220> something<00:01:37.400> like<00:01:37.729> that<00:01:38.110> but

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
I was special or something like that but

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.690 
I was special or something like that but
that's<00:01:39.380> kind<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.770> hard<00:01:39.950> considering<00:01:40.430> I'm<00:01:40.670> a

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
that's kind of hard considering I'm a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.460 
that's kind of hard considering I'm a
teenager<00:01:41.119> that<00:01:41.270> goes<00:01:41.690> to<00:01:41.869> school<00:01:42.229> on<00:01:42.350> a

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
teenager that goes to school on a

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.530 
teenager that goes to school on a
regular<00:01:42.500> basis<00:01:43.369> but<00:01:43.910> since<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.210> am<00:01:44.240> a

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
regular basis but since I am a

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.510 
regular basis but since I am a
dissection<00:01:44.990> I<00:01:45.170> guess<00:01:45.590> that's<00:01:45.830> a<00:01:45.920> good<00:01:46.100> thing

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
dissection I guess that's a good thing

instead of her but that's not true at
all

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
all

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.140 
all
and<00:03:11.720> having<00:03:12.590> this<00:03:12.739> power<00:03:13.040> comes<00:03:13.610> with<00:03:13.760> tons<00:03:13.970> of

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
and having this power comes with tons of

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.449 
and having this power comes with tons of
consequences<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:15.140> don't<00:03:15.680> understand<00:03:16.160> what<00:03:16.310> she

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
consequences I don't understand what she

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.069 
consequences I don't understand what she
wanted<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:16.970> would<00:03:17.299> trade<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:17.630> power<00:03:17.870> for

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
wanted I would trade this power for

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.680 
wanted I would trade this power for
anything<00:03:18.380> else<00:03:18.620> any<00:03:18.920> day<00:03:19.070> just<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:20.000> be<00:03:20.150> normal

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
anything else any day just to be normal

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.479 
anything else any day just to be normal
she<00:03:21.049> was<00:03:21.140> lucky<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.620> not<00:03:21.739> have<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.950> power<00:03:22.220> like

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
she was lucky to not have a power like

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.699 
she was lucky to not have a power like
this<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:23.079> want<00:03:24.079> to<00:03:24.140> be<00:03:24.230> normal

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
this I want to be normal

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.550 
this I want to be normal
instead<00:03:25.250> this<00:03:25.489> monster<00:03:26.660> she<00:03:27.049> doesn't<00:03:27.230> have<00:03:27.410> to

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
instead this monster she doesn't have to

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.400 
instead this monster she doesn't have to
constantly<00:03:28.010> hide<00:03:28.310> herself<00:03:28.459> in<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:28.970> shadows

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
constantly hide herself in the shadows

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.199 
constantly hide herself in the shadows
but<00:03:30.410> I<00:03:30.470> guess<00:03:30.769> there's<00:03:31.370> ups<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:31.849> downs<00:03:32.000> in

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
but I guess there's ups and downs in

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.230 
but I guess there's ups and downs in
life

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
life

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.240 
life
and<00:03:33.330> I<00:03:33.720> guess<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.380> was<00:03:34.500> just<00:03:34.680> blowing<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.070> down

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
and I guess I was just blowing it down

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.510 
and I guess I was just blowing it down
but<00:03:35.970> all<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.270> do<00:03:36.570> is<00:03:37.080> deal<00:03:37.500> with<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.740> and

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
but all I can do is deal with it and

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.090 
but all I can do is deal with it and
maybe<00:03:38.850> one<00:03:39.180> day<00:03:39.390> I'll<00:03:39.780> realize<00:03:40.440> how<00:03:40.620> special<00:03:40.890> I

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
maybe one day I'll realize how special I

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.160 
maybe one day I'll realize how special I
am
