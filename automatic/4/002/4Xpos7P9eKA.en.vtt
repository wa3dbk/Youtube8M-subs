00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
they must have thought that the things

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.560

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
bigger while these things here or

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.210 
bigger while these things here or

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.899 
these are piranha plants don't look too
too<00:01:16.740> much<00:01:16.890> bigger<00:01:17.100> even<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:17.520> I'm<00:01:17.610> pretty<00:01:17.820> sure

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
too much bigger even but I'm pretty sure

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.940 
too much bigger even but I'm pretty sure
they<00:01:18.240> are<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.689> bit<00:01:19.110> bigger<00:01:19.380> there's<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> orange

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
they are a bit bigger there's the orange

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.649 
they are a bit bigger there's the orange
jam<00:01:20.310> there<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> always<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:20.970> them<00:01:21.060> mixed<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
jam there I always get them mixed up to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.719 
jam there I always get them mixed up to
be<00:01:22.250> between<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.750> yellow<00:01:24.750> gym<00:01:25.170> oh<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
be between the yellow gym oh and it's a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.870 
be between the yellow gym oh and it's a
bonus<00:01:26.939> round<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:28.340> think<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.430> drops<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.729> back

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
bonus round I think it drops you back

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.990 
bonus round I think it drops you back
with<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.650> awkwardly<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.820> don't

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
with it with to awkwardly so I don't

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.210 
with it with to awkwardly so I don't
have<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.180> worry<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.509> much<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.990> think<00:01:34.320> even<00:01:35.009> if

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
have to worry that much I think even if

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.710 
have to worry that much I think even if
you<00:01:35.250> die<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.520> still<00:01:35.850> got<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.150> backward<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.689> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
you die it still got to backward to a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.710 
you die it still got to backward to a
crackers<00:01:37.700> then<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:38.880> underneath<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.540> don't

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.630 
like I'm not sure I'm pretty sure those
things<00:02:21.870> are<00:02:21.959> bigger<00:02:22.200> anyway<00:02:22.860> three<00:02:23.250> boxes
