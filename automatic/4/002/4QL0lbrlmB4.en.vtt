00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.180
 10 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.180
 she 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.550
 hello everyone here you tobo presented by 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.130
 thomas in this video we're going 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.500
 learn to echo it effect or 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.210
 clown effect then and these two names 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.770
 different 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.029
 called on youtube and that you 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.740
 allow to do this effect that I 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.870
 think you've already seen just a little 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.510
 in Europe 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.400
 so that's why you can clone as 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.570
 these up 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.390
 so we will use the same type and the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.830
 last time and in fact it's great 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.820
 simple to make 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.280
 so you go on after effects again 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.380
 once after effects and software to 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.809
 to have on the internet that is not free 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.680
 but you can find it for free 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.660
 so just what are we going to do 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.340
 already we go get our clip so 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.620
 I 'll go get in the gopro 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.540
 up and I know it's this one so I 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.530
 take it into play slips it here in my 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.390
 project then hop I'll take it I 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.270
 want the crisis and on our proposals 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.320
 like those here and there I'm going to cut 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:19.530
 and at the size that I want so that's 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:22.200
 here and there I surrender the calq 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.490
 so it's a super simple effect 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.229
 frankly and it can do but 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.710
 really stylish on your videos 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.939
 so that's so hop and as soon as he is 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.040
 cut in here so I decide to 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.990
 do it now because it's a bit of a 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.869
 next to the other tutorial of the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.330
 last time so I find it pretty 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.560
 pretty so there you have two solutions 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:51.259
 so always you need a fixed shot 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.840
 and not a plan that moves so here is 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.970
 another little anecdote so you have to 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.500
 of course make a mask around your 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.549
 character but you have the choice either 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.860
 you want to really do that 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.740
 precisely where is it a pretty plan 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.060
 far and so make a square but the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.130
 problem of the bus and that is precisely 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.649
 since it's a great position 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.000
 there is something that will be seen in 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.680
 do we will see that there is a second 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.239
 picture from above but really light 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.519
 when it's far away it will not be when 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.580
 these loans as here will be seen so we 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.870
 rather 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.560
 use the feather app so we're already going 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.820
 take the duplicate the duplicate and the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.590
 that alcon to duplicate what we will do 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.720
 is that for example me I want it 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.740
 start here the next so I'm going 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.870
 take my pen tool and I'll hop 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:43.030
 like these draw around my 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:48.360
 hop character 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.360
 so we can do that precisely the right one 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.710
 so that's it except that I'm not going 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.780
 do it that way so that was a 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.380
 way you show me I'm going to do 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.880
 rather the fastest way to win 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.750
 time at the rate level but otherwise 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.310
 you will do exactly the same 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.720
 thing that me except with the tool 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.880
 feathers me I'm going to take beauty 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:12.000
 rectangle and I drew my rectangle 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:18.700
 around the person so there we go 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:23.080
 in addition like this is now I 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.230
 will take my clip and move it by 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.350
 example here so here I have my first 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.350
 bike 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.040
 except that the calm view ascari from above 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.720
 it does not work so what it takes 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.120
 make 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.290
 you're going to close the pro go where there is the 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.890
 mask pressed on m 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.080
 and again mm here and there you 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.640
 go take masks route you 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.730
 go click on the little time you 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.730
 have it right here and you click on the 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.380
 drawing masks like those here it is 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.440
 justified 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:00.040
 so we will take the tool here and we 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.530
 see everything up there what am I 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.890
 done there it's good we resume the plot up 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.450
 we arrive here 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.830
 alas what we will do is like you 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.490
 see we have the clip the second clip that 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.480
 comes right behind 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.860
 and well it's very simple we 'll settle 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.670
 the edges so to adjust the edges 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.640
 times then twice 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:23.480
 hop me I'll adjust the edges so 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.200
 here and here 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.660
 so as you will see we see the 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.360
 two characters and if we go ahead 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.710
 the character will disappear is 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.330
 normal because your mask is moving forward 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.020
 not and to move it forward 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.810
 Well, it's very simple. 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.400
 move forward in time you clicked 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.970
 on the chrono purchases not you go 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.669
 move forward one will say your square 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.010
 like this well it's going to create a key 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:53.010
 is basically shoes watching her move 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.740
 all alone so then the convoys 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.669
 pure we will take this little square and 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.540
 there as you can see it's not going 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.100
 the more we click twice we just have it and 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.919
 you do exactly the same if you 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.690
 So have the pen tool up there up there 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.870
 disappear What do we do it 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.650
 sees moving the little square so at 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.790
 to go slowly because I was 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.680
 asked to go more slowly in my 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.490
 so tutorial the last time I had been 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.380
 hyper bits what has bothered some 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.350
 people that's perfectly normal 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.669
 so me what I advise you to 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.140
 do is pause on the video 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:30.890
 and resume if you really have a 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:33.800
 worry there what I did was I 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:40.470
 attack you so always have to settle 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:41.970
 your layer like this I move it up 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.880
 and we still have our two characters 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.020
 we must not shrink that because 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.260
 that otherwise you'll see that it's okay 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.020
 fall 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.720
 annoying on the next 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.970
 and then as soon as you get here is going 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.210
 you need to increase the old 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.310
 clip underneath like those see 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.650
 except that the beds will disappear I'm going 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.229
 resume a route that is there and I'm going 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.289
 move it to the exit as 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.030
 these up is downright when he goes out 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.900
 of the frame I want to go out that because 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.139
 it is important 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.060
 then here it is really very 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.159
 simple you take your clip or do 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.940
 copy paste so control these 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:21.710
 controls go on mac os control these 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.020
 checks will surely go on windows 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:29.389
 forgiveness on max and starts his orders 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:32.750
 but alas you move your your 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:36.229
 third guy and there you go 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:39.740
 do right click merge mode and you 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:41.060
 go obscure is the same on the 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.530
 second each time you add a 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:49.430
 clip or obscure so right click 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:50.750
 me to merge and obscure and that's it 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.270
 see that it makes a little clearer the 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.979
 photo and as you can see we have 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.979
 our clown so if you see that there is a 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:59.150
 little flaw like here hop I'll you 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:00.800
 show for example there is a small 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.090
 default what are we doing seen that 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.610
 this is the second clip we take the 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.529
 second click we take the route and we 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.360
 spreads a little bit and where does that the 

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:10.550
 number of times you want a little bit me 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.529
 will put some I do not know 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.409
 you just have to move them and 

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:16.909
 normally it's good here you can 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:18.949
 see it after it's really a finished 

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:20.479
 so that's it if you do it more 

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:21.800
 precisely as you see as you 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:24.169
 can see it we see small squares 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.300
 here and slight outlines you use 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:27.889
 the tool more but you do it the same 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.259
 as you do on the squares 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:32.599
 and it's exactly the same thing and 

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:34.430
 it's very simple so that's what 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:36.080
 it's me of my inactivity these days 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.419
 because ben I am currently working 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.430
 and do not forget to go visit my 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.110
 chain 8 hours and do not forget to go 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.509
 see also my last two videos of 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.940
 youtube that are precisely these effects 

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:49.630
 friendly with the bike to try 

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.630
 tulle hi everyone
