00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.850
 the 10 mx 10 m is the new one 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.769
 frequency converter up to 4 kw of 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.019
 integrated in our gear motors 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.430
 three simulate in conveyor technology 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:34.690
 sets new standards application 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.150
 the sense mx 410 m can be separately or as 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.930
 order options the symbol ordered 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:44.200
 be in combination with the symbol of 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.750
 10 mx 10 m and factory before in operation 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.330
 Taken with all moda data 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.410
 already be set and he thus 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.239
 ready to use is delivered 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.430
 Further optimizations can be done via dip 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.070
 switch and potentiometer made 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.980
 as well as the gop 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.220
 and the comfortable parameterized uhls 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.490
 starter and in ta portal with star trek 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.850
 despite its compact design are in 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.610
 cinemaxx g 110 m all current world 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.590
 buses like profibus profinet ethernet / ip 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.630
 uss and cottbus already integrated 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.450
 as is the safety function 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.490
 theo by default clarified which about 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.520
 an error 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.380
 entrance and controlled by profisafe 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.390
 can be 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.430
 other external components such as 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.409
 Safety switching devices are for this purpose 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.430
 we do not require conveyor technology 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.689
 Application has the mmx g110 over 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.240
 integrated functions such as quick step 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.880
 limit switch logic and base sps 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.060
 functionality resulting from the sps 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.500
 Cycle time independent and reproducible 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.259
 can be reacted 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.830
 the installation of the drive unit consists 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.380
 from the above and 10 mx going 10 m can 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.630
 very flexible done that all 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.479
 installation locations are permissible and the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.549
 unit with a degree of protection up to 166 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.910
 disposal by the integrated 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:17.700
 transmission of 24 volts and 400 volts 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.370
 as well as the communication in fall 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.420
 other external components such as 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.420
 distributor 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.400
 not least in mx 110 m g is directly 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.200
 integrated into the animal portal 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.930
 and offers all the advantages of 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.819
 Integrated engineering of 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.349
 automation and drive technology 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.170
 They crossed mobile with the mobile phone 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.959
 limit judge mmx continuous 10 m 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.170
 the ideal drive system for everyone 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.489
 applications where a compact 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.489
 decentralized solution is required
