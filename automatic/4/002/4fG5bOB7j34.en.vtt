00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
when it gets to beta when solar sukkah

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.280 
when it gets to beta when solar sukkah
finally<00:01:20.580> gets<00:01:20.790> into<00:01:21.090> beta<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:21.840> hoping

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
finally gets into beta which I'm hoping

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.370 
finally gets into beta which I'm hoping
to<00:01:22.650> do<00:01:22.770> some<00:01:22.979> time<00:01:23.640> soon<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.960> gets<00:01:25.110> into

to do some time soon when that gets into

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.039 
to do some time soon when that gets into
beta<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.799> world<00:01:26.070> will<00:01:26.280> probably<00:01:26.909> get

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
beta the world will probably get

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.749 
beta the world will probably get
regenerated<00:01:28.049> anew<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.340> when<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.579> comes

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
regenerated anew and then when it comes

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.480 
regenerated anew and then when it comes
out<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.939> beta<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.509> go<00:01:30.659> into<00:01:30.810> normal<00:01:31.490> just

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
out of beta to go into normal just

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.780 
out of beta to go into normal just
normal<00:01:32.579> solid<00:01:33.210> shook<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.110> will<00:01:34.380> be

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
normal solid shook up then it will be

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.999

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
something server does have then it comes

stone<00:03:14.370> absolutely<00:03:15.330> fine<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.780> can't<00:03:15.810> do

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
stone absolutely fine but you can't do

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.099 
stone absolutely fine but you can't do
anything<00:03:16.200> with<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.220> am<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.269> there's

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
anything with it so I am and there's

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.990 
anything with it so I am and there's
been<00:03:19.290> no<00:03:19.320> update<00:03:19.799> for<00:03:20.100> like<00:03:20.280> two<00:03:20.489> weeks<00:03:20.519> he

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
been no update for like two weeks he

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.910 
been no update for like two weeks he
went<00:03:21.209> on<00:03:21.329> a<00:03:21.359> big<00:03:21.600> binge<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:22.109> updates<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.799> stuff

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
went on a big binge of updates and stuff

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.470 
went on a big binge of updates and stuff
lat<00:03:23.130> but<00:03:23.670> then<00:03:23.760> apparently<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.329> know<00:03:24.450> the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
lat but then apparently you know the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.449 
lat but then apparently you know the
forge<00:03:25.079> craft<00:03:25.410> one<00:03:25.590> started<00:03:26.040> again<00:03:26.220> it's<00:03:26.370> been

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
forge craft one started again it's been

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.890 
forge craft one started again it's been
playing<00:03:26.700> on<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.209> then<00:03:27.329> that's<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.750> you

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
playing on that and then that's it you

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.009 
playing on that and then that's it you
know<00:03:29.060> there's<00:03:30.060> nothing<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.510> there<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.930> I'm

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
know there's nothing in there and I'm

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.130 
know there's nothing in there and I'm
really<00:03:31.440> time<00:03:31.769> with<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.040> idea<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.310> taking<00:03:32.549> out

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
really time with the idea of taking out

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.449 
really time with the idea of taking out
it's<00:03:34.140> got<00:03:34.290> no<00:03:34.470> world<00:03:34.709> genin<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.250> could<00:03:35.430> be

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
it's got no world genin so it could be

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.949 
it's got no world genin so it could be
added<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.940> later<00:03:36.209> date<00:03:36.480> but<00:03:36.510> at<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.870> moment

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
added in a later date but at the moment

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.440 
added in a later date but at the moment
it's<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.410> nothing<00:03:37.560> there<00:03:37.829> for<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.850> keep<00:03:39.299> it

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
it's just nothing there for to keep it

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.559 
it's just nothing there for to keep it
in<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:40.010> have<00:03:41.010> however<00:03:41.609> been<00:03:41.910> playing<00:03:42.299> on<00:03:42.450> the

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
in I have however been playing on the

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:43.849 
in I have however been playing on the
server<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.900> little<00:03:43.200> bit<00:03:43.290> as<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.500> can<00:03:43.620> see<00:03:43.769> I've

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
server a little bit as you can see I've

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.220 
server a little bit as you can see I've
just<00:03:44.160> done<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.400> little<00:03:44.609> bit<00:03:44.819> not<00:03:45.600> too<00:03:45.630> much<00:03:45.810> and

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
just done a little bit not too much and

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.620 
just done a little bit not too much and
I<00:03:47.040> have<00:03:47.400> found<00:03:47.639> a<00:03:47.819> couple<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.209> issues<00:03:48.389> and

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
I have found a couple of issues and

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.629 
I have found a couple of issues and
problems<00:03:48.930> myself<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:50.250> I'm<00:03:50.340> going<00:03:50.489> to<00:03:50.549> be

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
problems myself that I'm going to be

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.210 
problems myself that I'm going to be
fixing<00:03:51.000> in<00:03:51.180> alpha<00:03:51.989> 10<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.769> if<00:03:52.829> you<00:03:52.920> have<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.069> look

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
fixing in alpha 10 so if you have a look

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.920 
fixing in alpha 10 so if you have a look
in<00:03:53.340> here<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.609> can<00:03:53.730> see<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.090> copper<00:03:54.690> ores

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
in here you can see this copper ores

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.550 
in here you can see this copper ores
from<00:03:55.500> three<00:03:56.370> different<00:03:57.120> places<00:03:57.959> thermal

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
from three different places thermal

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.900 
from three different places thermal
foundation<00:03:59.100> which<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.370> what<00:03:59.549> it<00:03:59.639> should<00:03:59.670> be

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
foundation which is what it should be

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.640 
foundation which is what it should be
that's<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.630> one<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:00.870> should<00:04:01.019> be<00:04:01.079> generating

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
that's the one that should be generating

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.650 
that's the one that should be generating
but<00:04:02.069> I've<00:04:02.160> also<00:04:02.310> got<00:04:02.579> mechanism<00:04:03.209> copper<00:04:03.540> are

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
but I've also got mechanism copper are

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.080 
but I've also got mechanism copper are
an<00:04:03.870> electrical<00:04:04.709> aged<00:04:04.859> copper<00:04:05.250> are<00:04:05.549> that<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:05.970> do

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
an electrical aged copper are that I do

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.270 
an electrical aged copper are that I do
need<00:04:06.329> to<00:04:06.450> go<00:04:06.569> in<00:04:06.690> there<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.019> saw<00:04:07.260> out<00:04:07.500> also<00:04:07.799> tin

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
need to go in there and saw out also tin

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.309 
need to go in there and saw out also tin
I<00:04:08.489> do<00:04:08.730> have<00:04:09.000> two<00:04:09.209> different<00:04:09.420> types<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:09.900> tin<00:04:10.139> and

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
I do have two different types of tin and

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.809 
I do have two different types of tin and
a<00:04:10.620> pretty<00:04:10.889> shot<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.430> I'm<00:04:11.519> going<00:04:11.609> to<00:04:11.670> come

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
a pretty shot that I'm going to come

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.559 
a pretty shot that I'm going to come
across<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:13.639> electrical<00:04:14.639> age<00:04:14.819> ten<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.180> don't<00:04:15.480> know

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
across a electrical age ten I don't know

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.090 
across a electrical age ten I don't know
if<00:04:15.630> they<00:04:15.750> actually<00:04:15.930> have<00:04:16.320> an<00:04:16.470> electrical<00:04:16.979> edge

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
if they actually have an electrical edge

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.979 
if they actually have an electrical edge
tin<00:04:17.400> but<00:04:17.639> Sir<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:18.000> never<00:04:18.389> know<00:04:18.539> if<00:04:18.660> they<00:04:18.780> do

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
tin but Sir you never know if they do

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.270 
tin but Sir you never know if they do
I'll<00:04:19.260> have<00:04:19.289> to<00:04:19.410> go<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.680> sort<00:04:19.889> that<00:04:20.010> out<00:04:20.100> as

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
I'll have to go and sort that out as

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.760 
I'll have to go and sort that out as
well<00:04:20.459> so<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.570> is<00:04:21.599> predominantly<00:04:22.320> like<00:04:22.560> I'm

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
well so this is predominantly like I'm

predominantly going to be testing this

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.140 
predominantly going to be testing this
out<00:05:52.170> once<00:05:52.950> we've<00:05:53.160> done<00:05:53.310> a<00:05:53.370> few<00:05:53.580> more<00:05:53.730> bits<00:05:53.970> and

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
out once we've done a few more bits and

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.940 
out once we've done a few more bits and
bobs<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.450> testings<00:05:54.900> to<00:05:55.080> fire<00:05:55.230> then<00:05:55.560> the

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
bobs and testings to fire then the

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.280 
bobs and testings to fire then the
version<00:05:56.700> will<00:05:56.820> end<00:05:57.000> up<00:05:57.120> towards<00:05:57.720> the<00:05:57.840> public

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
version will end up towards the public

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.070 
version will end up towards the public
but<00:05:58.770> in<00:05:58.800> alpha<00:05:59.340> I<00:05:59.520> really<00:06:00.240> think<00:06:00.420> that<00:06:00.660> you

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
but in alpha I really think that you

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.470 
but in alpha I really think that you
know<00:06:01.530> it<00:06:01.710> won't<00:06:01.950> be<00:06:02.010> long<00:06:02.220> between<00:06:02.490> it<00:06:03.120> going

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
know it won't be long between it going

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.120 
know it won't be long between it going
on<00:06:03.600> this<00:06:03.810> server<00:06:04.080> to<00:06:04.590> actually<00:06:04.950> being

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
released on public in alpha I really

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.170 
released on public in alpha I really
don't<00:06:07.560> think<00:06:07.590> it'll<00:06:07.890> be<00:06:07.950> long<00:06:08.160> if<00:06:08.370> at<00:06:08.700> all<00:06:08.910> you

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
don't think it'll be long if at all you

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.820 
don't think it'll be long if at all you
know<00:06:09.630> we<00:06:09.840> might<00:06:09.960> just<00:06:10.020> be<00:06:10.320> keeping<00:06:10.620> up<00:06:10.710> with
