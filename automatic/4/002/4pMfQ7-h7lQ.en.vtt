in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.820 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:03.240> use<00:00:03.449> heat<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.959> get<00:00:04.170> rid<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.350> wood-boring

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
to use heat to get rid of wood-boring

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.000 
to use heat to get rid of wood-boring
insects<00:00:05.400> inside<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.120> lumber<00:00:06.649> this<00:00:07.649> big

plywood<00:00:08.670> box<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.360> my<00:00:09.719> solution<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.559> what<00:00:10.920> it

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
plywood box is my solution and what it

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.310 
plywood box is my solution and what it
is<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.550> plywood<00:00:11.849> clamped<00:00:12.540> together<00:00:12.660> with<00:00:13.080> some

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
is is plywood clamped together with some

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.039 
is is plywood clamped together with some
pieces<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.160> wood<00:00:14.309> around<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.820> edges<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.389> a

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
pieces of wood around the edges and a

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.040 
pieces of wood around the edges and a
small<00:00:16.440> wood<00:00:16.740> stove<00:00:17.070> sat<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.580> one<00:00:17.789> end<00:00:18.090> with<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
small wood stove sat on one end with the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.929 
small wood stove sat on one end with the
lumber<00:00:19.410> or<00:00:19.619> furniture<00:00:20.130> or<00:00:20.369> whatever<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.880> is

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
lumber or furniture or whatever it is

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.150 
lumber or furniture or whatever it is
you<00:00:21.119> need<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.390> treat<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.109> set<00:00:22.350> what<00:00:23.130> I

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
you need to treat on this set what I

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.800 
you need to treat on this set what I
have<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.580> there<00:00:23.670> right<00:00:23.880> now<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.119> two<00:00:24.330> tables

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
have in there right now is two tables

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.750 
have in there right now is two tables
and<00:00:24.990> some<00:00:25.230> lumber<00:00:25.470> for<00:00:25.710> making<00:00:26.010> another<00:00:26.220> table

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
and some lumber for making another table

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.939 
and some lumber for making another table
I<00:00:26.789> make<00:00:27.359> farm<00:00:27.599> tables<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.199> reclaimed<00:00:28.619> wood

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
I make farm tables out of reclaimed wood

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.420 
I make farm tables out of reclaimed wood
and<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:30.269> occasion<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.230> reclaimed<00:00:31.920> wood<00:00:32.040> will

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and on occasion the reclaimed wood will

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.790 
and on occasion the reclaimed wood will
have<00:00:33.020> something<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.050> powder<00:00:34.410> post<00:00:34.649> beetles

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
have something like powder post beetles

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.130 
have something like powder post beetles
still<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> wood<00:00:35.820> chewing<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> up<00:00:36.540> this

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
still in the wood chewing it up this

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.840 
still in the wood chewing it up this
gives<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.649> nice<00:00:37.829> character<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> ones

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
gives it a nice character but the ones

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.490 
gives it a nice character but the ones
that<00:00:39.000> are<00:00:39.090> still<00:00:39.300> living<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.899> want<00:00:40.140> them<00:00:40.230> dead

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that are still living you want them dead

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.040 
that are still living you want them dead
so<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.520> solution<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.329> need<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> wood

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
so the solution you need to get the wood

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.389 
so the solution you need to get the wood
hot<00:00:43.410> very<00:00:44.190> hot<00:00:44.579> well<00:00:45.239> not<00:00:45.390> too<00:00:45.600> hot<00:00:45.809> about<00:00:46.649> 150

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
hot very hot well not too hot about 150

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.580 
hot very hot well not too hot about 150
degrees<00:00:47.520> I'll<00:00:48.000> do<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.870> need<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
degrees I'll do it and you just need the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.560 
degrees I'll do it and you just need the
core<00:00:49.920> temperature<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> way<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> get<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.030> 150

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
core temperature the way to get to 150

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.389 
core temperature the way to get to 150
degrees<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.230> I'm<00:00:52.829> sure<00:00:53.010> there's<00:00:53.219> all

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
degrees and I'm sure there's all

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.830 
degrees and I'm sure there's all
different<00:00:53.430> kinds<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.210> ways<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.629> do<00:00:54.809> this

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
different kinds of ways you can do this

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.830 
different kinds of ways you can do this
but<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.309> had<00:00:56.550> rigged<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:56.969> at

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
but this is what I had rigged up at

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930 
but this is what I had rigged up at
least<00:00:58.109> temporarily<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:59.219> see<00:00:59.430> if<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.730> method

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
least temporarily to see if this method

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.150 
least temporarily to see if this method
will<00:01:00.239> work<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.690> I'm<00:01:01.350> sure<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.649> will<00:01:01.770> because<00:01:02.129> I

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
will work and I'm sure it will because I

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.799 
will work and I'm sure it will because I
have<00:01:02.340> an<00:01:02.460> oven<00:01:02.670> thermometer<00:01:02.789> inside<00:01:03.510> that

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
have an oven thermometer inside that

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.580 
have an oven thermometer inside that
says<00:01:04.019> I'm<00:01:04.140> at<00:01:04.260> about<00:01:04.439> 175<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.519> 200<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.590> it's

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
says I'm at about 175 to 200 and it's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.450 
says I'm at about 175 to 200 and it's
only<00:01:07.770> down<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.400> about<00:01:08.490> 150<00:01:09.350> one<00:01:10.350> time<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:11.430> uh

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
only down to about 150 one time but uh

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.910 
only down to about 150 one time but uh
but<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.119> far<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.630> staying<00:01:12.869> nice<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.260> toasty

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
but so far so staying nice and toasty

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.530 
but so far so staying nice and toasty
inside<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.490> reached<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.030> felt<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> wood

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
inside now reached and it felt the wood

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.690 
inside now reached and it felt the wood
can't<00:01:16.049> even<00:01:16.259> touch<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:18.140> so<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.799> said<00:01:20.040> wood

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
can't even touch it so like I said wood

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.730 
can't even touch it so like I said wood
stove<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.509> side<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> plywood

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
stove on this side then I have a plywood

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.399 
stove on this side then I have a plywood
divider<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.700> leaning<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.150> against<00:01:24.570> my<00:01:24.750> table

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
divider just leaning up against my table

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.929 
divider just leaning up against my table
that's<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.009> side<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.610> rest<00:01:26.790> of

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
that's on this side and the rest of

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.510 
that's on this side and the rest of
lumber<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.360> kind<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.570> stacked<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.259> there

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
lumber just kind of stacked up in there

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.719 
lumber just kind of stacked up in there
so<00:01:29.520> let's<00:01:29.700> go<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.270> closer<00:01:30.509> look<00:01:31.729> got

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
so let's go in for a closer look got

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.819 
so let's go in for a closer look got
this<00:01:32.970> moving<00:01:33.390> blanket<00:01:33.780> kind<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.079> flapped<00:01:34.380> over

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
this moving blanket kind of flapped over

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.090 
this moving blanket kind of flapped over
a<00:01:35.070> gap<00:01:35.729> where<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.240> reach<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
a gap where I can reach in and on the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.270 
a gap where I can reach in and on the
inside<00:01:38.549> got<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.420> oven<00:01:39.750> thermometer<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:41.159> you

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
inside got this oven thermometer and you

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.200 
inside got this oven thermometer and you
see<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> current<00:01:42.090> temperature<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:43.790> 175<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
see the current temperature is 175 and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.600 
see the current temperature is 175 and
I've<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.110> got<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.290> sitting<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.040> top<00:01:47.369> of

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
I've just got that sitting on the top of

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.690 
I've just got that sitting on the top of
the<00:01:47.790> table<00:01:48.229> on<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.829> opposite<00:01:50.220> side<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the table on the opposite side as the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.069 
the table on the opposite side as the
wood<00:01:50.880> stove<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.420> think<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.750> gives<00:01:51.930> me<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
wood stove and I think that gives me a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.170 
wood stove and I think that gives me a
pretty<00:01:52.320> good<00:01:52.500> indicator<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.979> temperature<00:01:53.460> on

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
pretty good indicator of temperature on

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.700 
pretty good indicator of temperature on
this<00:01:54.509> end<00:01:54.780> I've<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.110> got<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> couple

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
this end I've just got a couple

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.370 
this end I've just got a couple
erlin<00:01:55.979> clamps<00:01:56.390> holding<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> plywood<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.229> end

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
erlin clamps holding the plywood the end

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.490 
erlin clamps holding the plywood the end
cap<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:59.040> and<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.540> where<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.840> access<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
cap on and this is where I access the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.770 
cap on and this is where I access the
wood<00:02:01.680> stove<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:03.060> example

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
wood stove so for example

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.910 
wood stove so for example
when<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:05.810> need<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.170> add<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.320> little<00:02:06.530> more<00:02:06.710> would

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
when I need to add a little more would

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.190 
when I need to add a little more would
just<00:02:07.189> unclamp<00:02:07.579> those<00:02:07.790> clamps<00:02:08.119> got<00:02:08.780> some<00:02:08.929> small

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
just unclamp those clamps got some small

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.080 
just unclamp those clamps got some small
chunks<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.649> wood<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.890> fit<00:02:10.069> this<00:02:10.250> small<00:02:10.489> wood

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
chunks of wood to fit this small wood

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.530 
chunks of wood to fit this small wood
stove<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:12.349> I<00:02:12.410> just<00:02:12.590> move<00:02:12.770> this<00:02:12.980> over<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:14.150> then

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
stove and I just move this over and then

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.790 
stove and I just move this over and then
there<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.560> piece<00:02:15.770> of

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
there it is this is a piece of

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.070 
there it is this is a piece of
galvanized<00:02:16.790> little<00:02:17.239> sheet<00:02:17.450> metal<00:02:17.750> just<00:02:17.900> as<00:02:18.050> a

heat shield to a five-way is burning it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.850 
heat shield to a five-way is burning it
today<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:20.959> just<00:02:21.200> drop<00:02:21.410> those<00:02:21.590> pieces<00:02:23.769> here's<00:02:24.769> a

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
today I just drop those pieces here's a

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.860 
today I just drop those pieces here's a
side<00:02:25.160> view<00:02:25.190> let<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.910> see<00:02:26.150> where<00:02:26.450> everything

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
side view let you see where everything

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.800 
side view let you see where everything
is<00:02:26.900> positioned<00:02:27.530> in<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.370> container<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.690> was

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
is positioned in the container it was

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.729 
is positioned in the container it was
two<00:02:30.050> tables<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.819> some<00:02:32.209> extra<00:02:32.540> boards<00:02:32.930> so

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
two tables and in some extra boards so

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.559 
two tables and in some extra boards so
you<00:02:33.800> got<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.280> wood<00:02:34.459> stove<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.150> plywood

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
you got the wood stove the plywood

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.020 
you got the wood stove the plywood
divider<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.560> two<00:02:36.769> tables<00:02:37.010> in<00:02:37.459> some<00:02:37.670> extra

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
divider the two tables in some extra

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.840 
divider the two tables in some extra
boards<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:39.590> most<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:39.980> this<00:02:40.100> facing<00:02:40.580> there<00:02:40.730> was

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
boards so most of this facing there was

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.570 
boards so most of this facing there was
taken<00:02:41.209> up<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.569> kind<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:42.590> reduce<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:42.980> amount<00:02:43.459> of

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
taken up to kind of reduce the amount of

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.960 
taken up to kind of reduce the amount of
wasted<00:02:44.450> air<00:02:45.350> space<00:02:48.040> well<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.160> about<00:02:49.280> does<00:02:49.459> it

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
wasted air space well that about does it

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.580 
wasted air space well that about does it
the<00:02:50.090> total<00:02:50.390> amount<00:02:50.599> of<00:02:50.690> time<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.049> lumber<00:02:51.440> was

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
the total amount of time the lumber was

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.800 
the total amount of time the lumber was
inside<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.519> box<00:02:52.760> was<00:02:53.120> about<00:02:53.330> four<00:02:53.599> hours

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
inside the box was about four hours

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.690 
inside the box was about four hours
pretty<00:02:54.650> sure<00:02:54.830> it's<00:02:54.980> going<00:02:55.099> to<00:02:55.160> do<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.489> was<00:02:55.670> a

pretty sure it's going to do it was a

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.860 
pretty sure it's going to do it was a

constant 175 to 200 degrees and 150 is
the<00:02:59.900> temperature<00:03:00.470> from<00:03:01.400> research<00:03:01.849> that<00:03:02.510> I've

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
the temperature from research that I've

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.390 
the temperature from research that I've
done<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.319> really<00:03:03.560> have<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.890> hit<00:03:04.099> and

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
done that you really have to hit and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.520 
done that you really have to hit and
it's<00:03:04.940> not<00:03:05.090> just<00:03:05.450> hit<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.930> temperature<00:03:06.380> and

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
it's not just hit the temperature and

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.150 
it's not just hit the temperature and
you're<00:03:06.650> done

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
you're done

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.620

report back to you and let you know how
this<00:03:23.630> whole<00:03:23.870> experiment<00:03:24.319> worked<00:03:24.739> out<00:03:24.950> if<00:03:25.250> it

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
this whole experiment worked out if it

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.069 
this whole experiment worked out if it
works<00:03:25.609> out<00:03:25.819> good<00:03:26.060> I'm<00:03:26.630> going<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.840> end<00:03:26.989> up

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
works out good I'm going to end up

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.750 
works out good I'm going to end up
making<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.410> more<00:03:27.560> permanent<00:03:27.829> situation<00:03:28.190> with<00:03:28.730> a

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
larger wood stove with and a higher

capacity for stacking up lumber and that

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.699 
capacity for stacking up lumber and that
would<00:03:35.540> be<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.660> future<00:03:36.049> video<00:03:36.200> if<00:03:37.120> all<00:03:38.120> goes<00:03:38.150> well

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
would be a future video if all goes well
