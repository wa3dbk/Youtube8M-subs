recommend you guys checking out all of
the<00:01:36.390> other<00:01:36.540> transformers<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.590> even

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the other transformers because even

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.230 
the other transformers because even
though<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> tank<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.150> could

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
though we have a tank here that could

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.840 
though we have a tank here that could
fire<00:01:39.479> missiles<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.380> actually<00:01:41.189> fire<00:01:41.460> shells

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
fire missiles or actually fire shells

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.149 
fire missiles or actually fire shells
and<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.329> planes<00:01:42.720> fire<00:01:42.990> missiles<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.890> cars

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and the planes fire missiles the cars

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.800 
and the planes fire missiles the cars
are<00:01:44.340> actually<00:01:44.430> really<00:01:44.880> fast<00:01:45.210> compared<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
are actually really fast compared to the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.330 
are actually really fast compared to the
tank<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.140> they<00:01:46.350> all<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.680> their<00:01:46.829> advantages

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
tank so they all have their advantages

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.830 
tank so they all have their advantages
and<00:01:47.399> disadvantages<00:01:47.549> now<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> highly<00:01:48.450> recommend

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and disadvantages now I highly recommend

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.600 
and disadvantages now I highly recommend
you<00:01:48.899> guys<00:01:49.020> craft<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> different<00:01:50.340> armor

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
you guys craft all the different armor

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.429 
you guys craft all the different armor
sets<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.119> kind<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.360> take<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> look<00:01:51.810> at<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.140> so

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
sets to kind of take a look at that so

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.929 
sets to kind of take a look at that so
anyways<00:01:52.740> guys<00:01:52.799> moving<00:01:53.220> right<00:01:53.340> along<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.610> have

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
anyways guys moving right along we have

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.880 
anyways guys moving right along we have
these<00:01:54.090> sub-woofer<00:01:54.540> armor<00:01:55.170> set<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.829> is

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
these sub-woofer armor set and this is

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.469 
these sub-woofer armor set and this is
pretty<00:01:56.310> much<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.820> VirB<00:01:56.969> armor<00:01:57.270> set

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
pretty much like the VirB armor set

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.840 
pretty much like the VirB armor set
except<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.990> blue<00:01:58.290> car<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.520> model

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
except it's a blue car and the model

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.520 
except it's a blue car and the model
itself<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.270> actually<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.600> bit<00:02:00.750> more<00:02:00.780> detail<00:02:01.350> so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
itself is actually a bit more detail so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.420 
itself is actually a bit more detail so
let's<00:02:01.649> go<00:02:01.710> ahead<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:01.950> put<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.310> this

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
skin kind of inside of our model and you

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.070 
skin kind of inside of our model and you
saw<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.090> happen<00:02:31.240> while<00:02:31.570> I<00:02:31.600> was<00:02:31.660> driving<00:02:32.020> in

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
saw that happen while I was driving in

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.960 
saw that happen while I was driving in
the<00:02:32.140> car<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.860> kind<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.100> ignored<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.490> just<00:02:33.730> to

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
the car and I kind of ignored it just to

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.090 
the car and I kind of ignored it just to
get<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.480> my<00:02:34.600> point<00:02:34.870> but<00:02:35.080> anyways<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:36.070> reason

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
get to my point but anyways the reason

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.920 
get to my point but anyways the reason
this<00:02:36.580> happens<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.090> because<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.630> supposed<00:02:37.810> to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
this happens is because it's supposed to

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.390 
this happens is because it's supposed to
give<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:38.140> invisibility<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.070> mod<00:02:39.220> itself

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
give you invisibility in the mod itself

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.490 
give you invisibility in the mod itself
but<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:39.970> have<00:02:40.270> to<00:02:40.390> manually<00:02:40.840> put<00:02:41.050> invisibility

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
but I have to manually put invisibility

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.560 
but I have to manually put invisibility
on<00:02:41.860> for<00:02:42.130> six<00:02:42.340> minutes<00:02:42.520> so<00:02:43.120> that's<00:02:43.270> basically

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
on for six minutes so that's basically

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.210 
on for six minutes so that's basically
how<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.840> solve<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.230> problem<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:45.100> can

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
how you solve that problem you can

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.280 
how you solve that problem you can
easily<00:02:45.610> just<00:02:45.850> use<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.600> updated<00:02:46.959> version<00:02:47.140> of

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
easily just use the updated version of

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.960 
easily just use the updated version of
the<00:02:47.440> mod<00:02:47.590> or<00:02:47.830> maybe<00:02:48.070> just<00:02:48.370> this<00:02:48.489> particular

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
two shots the reload isn't that long but

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.870 
two shots the reload isn't that long but
it's<00:04:25.020> still<00:04:25.230> something<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:25.920> keep<00:04:26.070> in<00:04:26.220> mind<00:04:26.250> of

believe so let's go ahead and grab that
and<00:04:42.120> this<00:04:42.690> is<00:04:42.810> basically<00:04:42.960> what<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.350> Energon

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
and this is basically what the Energon

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.200 
and this is basically what the Energon
crossbow<00:04:44.010> is<00:04:44.130> is<00:04:44.250> a<00:04:44.370> continuous<00:04:44.850> stream<00:04:45.150> of

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
crossbow is is a continuous stream of

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.780 
crossbow is is a continuous stream of
like<00:04:45.720> energy<00:04:46.200> going<00:04:46.380> towards<00:04:46.950> your<00:04:47.310> enemy<00:04:47.700> and
