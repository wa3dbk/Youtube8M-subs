most

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.440 
most

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
just because you just start seeing the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.130 
just because you just start seeing the
fuzzies<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.670> know<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.140> it's

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
fuzzies and this and you know the it's

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.249 
fuzzies and this and you know the it's

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
just not as nice as it is when you first

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.280 
just not as nice as it is when you first
get<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.710> done<00:01:55.890> or<00:01:56.189> week<00:01:56.700> or<00:01:57.119> whatever<00:01:57.719> week<00:01:58.110> or

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
get it done or week or whatever week or

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.560 
get it done or week or whatever week or
so<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.950> starts<00:01:59.490> getting<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.909> little<00:02:00.119> fuzzies

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
