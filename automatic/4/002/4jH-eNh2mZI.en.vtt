00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.220
 a more serious experiment was the odyssey 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.149
 of 30 years of the chrysler to create a 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.149
 jet engine 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.709
 in October 1963 the new car arrived 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.610
 of the chrysler powered by a 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.650
 turbine 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.590
 created by the best designers 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.419
 Italians of the company guide the engine 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.880
 the ter bain had 80 percent 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.189
 less than parts that a normal car the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.740
 Chrysler promoted its simplicity and its 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.750
 power with its sheer power to 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.150
 instantaneous acceleration and its capacity 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.370
 for the ascension the driver is 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.410
 ensures the maximum maneuverability that 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.110
 can get in a normal tourism 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.110
 even the steepest slopes 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.030
 the engine of the car worked 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.010
 sucking air into the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.270
 compressor where the temperature and the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.820
 air pressure increased 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.560
 spectacularly then the air was 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.330
 introduced under pressure in a burner 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.270
 where it mixed with the fuel and 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.740
 exploited then the gases were 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.900
 they expanded through a series of 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.540
 turbine wheels to convert the 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.210
 thermal energy in mechanical energy 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.070
 spinning the wheels of the car the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.540
 power and maneuverability of the terrain 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.880
 they were on par with any other 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.890
 vehicle but its acceleration was slow 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.190
 due to its delay to mesh with the 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.130
 transmission 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.690
 but the car had a feature 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.420
 fascinating it worked with any 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.380
 fuel liquid gasoline perfume 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.480
 even with corn oil finally the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.160
 project was considered unfeasible due to 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.720
 that the production costs would be 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.790
 too high 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.890
 another problem was to create new 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.810
 alloys capable of withstanding the high 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.940
 operating temperatures of 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.550
 term explained the Italian company that 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.010
 He made 50 cars on tour and sent them 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.200
 to the us for their evaluation and they are 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.210
 put the engine here after seven years 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.010
 when the project was canceled due to 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.380
 Customs tax reasons are 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.950
 they destroyed all the vehicles in 109 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.950
