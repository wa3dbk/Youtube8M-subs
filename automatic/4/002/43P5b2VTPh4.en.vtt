00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
him but this material is really thin so

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.380

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
it wasn't working very well with the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.180 
it wasn't working very well with the
ultrafeed<00:00:42.930> which<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.290> an<00:00:43.440> industrial<00:00:43.710> really

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
ultrafeed which is an industrial really

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.490 
ultrafeed which is an industrial really
powerful<00:00:44.640> machine<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.690> since<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.260> we've

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
powerful machine so since then we've

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.990 
powerful machine so since then we've
gone<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> fabric<00:00:47.309> store<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.579> gotten<00:00:47.969> some

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
test fabric before we actually use the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.569 
test fabric before we actually use the
sunbrella<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.570> which<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.579> $33

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
as you can see which means we'll need

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.660 
as you can see which means we'll need
more<00:01:12.150> fabric<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.950> kind<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.549> the
