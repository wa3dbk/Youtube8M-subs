00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
just a little too difficult so I just

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.000 
just a little too difficult so I just
decided<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> make<00:00:56.969> them<00:00:57.500> some<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.770> house

replica<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.150> harder<00:01:06.720> because<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.260> an

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
replica but it's harder because it's an

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.560 
replica but it's harder because it's an
actual<00:01:07.740> game<00:01:07.950> not<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> blocky<00:01:09.200> type<00:01:10.200> game
