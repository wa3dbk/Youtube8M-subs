00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
people seem confused on that between

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.229 
people seem confused on that between

title updates and server-side updates
but<00:03:15.600> I'll<00:03:15.630> get<00:03:16.500> more<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.799> depth<00:03:16.980> on<00:03:17.100> that<00:03:17.130> on

but I'll get more in depth on that on

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.410 
but I'll get more in depth on that on
some<00:03:17.519> other<00:03:17.610> scrims<00:03:17.970> because<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.239> was

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
some other scrims because this was

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.349 
some other scrims because this was
actually<00:03:18.600> almost<00:03:18.870> over<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:19.500> on<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:21.239> know

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.849 
actually almost over but on you know
that's<00:03:21.900> just<00:03:21.989> for<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.290> people<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.650> don't

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
a little over my screen instead of

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.720 
a little over my screen instead of
getting<00:03:36.690> body<00:03:36.870> but<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.440> need<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.220> take<00:03:38.400> him<00:03:38.549> out

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109

I just kind of moved around the pillars
and<00:03:40.290> uh<00:03:40.850> made<00:03:41.850> sure<00:03:42.120> not<00:03:42.359> to<00:03:42.420> die<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:44.370> know

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
even though I put myself in a bad

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.000 
even though I put myself in a bad
situation<00:03:45.750> like<00:03:46.170> four<00:03:46.410> times<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.859> should

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
situation like four times and should

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.920 
situation like four times and should
have<00:03:47.130> died<00:03:47.280> but<00:03:47.489> that's<00:03:48.480> just<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.690> way<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
have died but that's just the way the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.789 
have died but that's just the way the
game<00:03:48.959> goes<00:03:49.109> sometimes<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:51.780> really<00:03:52.350> really

entire game you know what you know how

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.050 
entire game you know what you know how
it<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.069> once<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.370> get<00:03:59.489> something<00:03:59.670> like<00:03:59.760> that

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
it is once you get something like that

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.729 
it is once you get something like that
like<00:04:00.359> i<00:04:00.450> got<00:04:00.600> in<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.720> first<00:04:00.870> round<00:04:01.109> you<00:04:01.680> know

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
like i got in the first round you know

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.080 
like i got in the first round you know
any<00:04:01.980> time<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.400> get<00:04:02.489> some<00:04:02.640> kind<00:04:02.819> of<00:04:02.850> ridiculous

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
any time you get some kind of ridiculous

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.059 
any time you get some kind of ridiculous
clip<00:04:03.480> like<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.810> rest<00:04:04.019> of<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:04.200> map<00:04:04.440> all<00:04:04.709> you

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
clip like the rest of the map all you

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.770 
clip like the rest of the map all you
can<00:04:05.220> think<00:04:05.280> about<00:04:05.519> is<00:04:05.850> just<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.480> know<00:04:06.569> doing

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
can think about is just you know doing

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.780 
can think about is just you know doing
it<00:04:06.959> again<00:04:07.200> yeah<00:04:07.890> that's<00:04:08.190> what<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.370> was<00:04:08.400> thinking

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
it again yeah that's what I was thinking

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.129 
it again yeah that's what I was thinking
every<00:04:08.940> time<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.150> picked<00:04:09.329> up<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.569> work<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:09.930> got

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
every time I picked up to work so I got

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.539 
every time I picked up to work so I got
kind<00:04:10.319> of<00:04:10.380> greedy<00:04:10.590> on<00:04:10.799> shots<00:04:11.069> didn't<00:04:11.370> really

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
kind of greedy on shots didn't really

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.879 
kind of greedy on shots didn't really
take<00:04:11.730> my<00:04:11.850> time<00:04:12.030> normally<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:13.049> know<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.380> won't

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
take my time normally you know I won't

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.830 
take my time normally you know I won't
pull<00:04:14.130> off<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.340> quad<00:04:14.700> like<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.180> but<00:04:15.450> I'll<00:04:15.600> be

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
pull off a quad like that but I'll be

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.449 
pull off a quad like that but I'll be
very<00:04:16.139> consistent<00:04:16.560> with<00:04:16.889> torque<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.310> know<00:04:17.430> i

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
very consistent with torque you know i

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.879 
very consistent with torque you know i
will<00:04:18.030> hit<00:04:18.239> at<00:04:18.450> least<00:04:18.690> half<00:04:19.049> my<00:04:19.289> shots<00:04:19.590> because

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
will hit at least half my shots because

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.620 
will hit at least half my shots because
they're<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.160> usually<00:04:20.579> get<00:04:20.639> pretty<00:04:20.940> simple

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
they're I usually get pretty simple

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.450 
they're I usually get pretty simple
shots<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.320> I'm<00:04:22.380> good<00:04:22.710> at<00:04:22.800> being<00:04:23.010> patient<00:04:23.220> with

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
shots and I'm good at being patient with

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.360 
shots and I'm good at being patient with
it<00:04:24.229> but<00:04:25.229> as<00:04:25.470> you<00:04:25.590> can<00:04:25.680> see<00:04:25.860> in<00:04:25.919> this<00:04:26.010> video<00:04:26.190> i

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
it but as you can see in this video i

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.290 
it but as you can see in this video i
just<00:04:26.460> kind<00:04:26.820> of

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
just kind of

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.659 
just kind of
wing<00:04:27.449> that<00:04:27.659> I<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:28.319> know<00:04:28.379> I<00:04:28.650> didn't<00:04:29.310> play<00:04:29.460> for

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
wing that I you know I didn't play for
