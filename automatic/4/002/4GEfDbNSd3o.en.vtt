00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.900
 hey people welcome to a new one 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.790
 tutorial on the best goals 13 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.510
 In this tutorial I will show you 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.820
 so we cad the form in the 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.220
 School can open even if they are from 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.530
 administrator has been disabled 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.220
 yes, there is one anyway 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.500
 possibility that offers us but only 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.780
 with windows xp thus with windows 8 30 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.710
 that it does not work there and at 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.800
 windows 7 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.130
 I'm sure but most 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.170
 schools still have windows xp 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.910
 yes and I say this quite simply we 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.530
 make a legal in ours 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.070
 desired order or simply on the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.780
 desktop then go to new and 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.570
 text document do not love it we can 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.219
 also quite normal to start all 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.280
 programs accessories and editor go that 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:09.869
 is actually exactly the same 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:14.979
 we write the first line as always pure 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.200
 and in the second just co.com yes and 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.450
 that was already on file 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.679
 Save under me I am now 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.289
 just cmd point b match 5 you break 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.840
 So call the work is important 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.060
 the point because behind it is the brt 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.299
 So point patch then he goes on 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.649
 to save 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.630
 yes then we have them here on the 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.389
 desktop or where it is still there 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.549
 can have saved there now 

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:46.859
 Just open that's it then have it 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:50.619
 we already here the cmd with cmd points 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:52.740
 xetra system 230 cmd exe and if I have 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.079
 tell the prompt to open 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.479
 So you can already differentiated that 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:03.939
 already I say and made a difference 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.240
 but if we find so now I think so 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.520
 I think 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.960
 So difference is there but you 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.200
 Of course you can do as much as you can 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.730
 with whom you should share stand up 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.580
 Users are not that right 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.870
 it's probably there you can almost 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.340
 do nothing 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.570
 yes and we can command that of course 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.070
 also open differently 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.400
 because it is now the chromatic 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.610
 Windows button selected we just go 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.710
 at work or start up 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.430
 start work place then go on 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:42.690
 Now give windows local disk 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.140
 just hit system 32 and celebrate like that 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.580
 a message comes with the coming 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.090
 Chancellor's message is coming, you go 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.470
 simply display on folder contents 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.370
 I will I could hide it 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.489
 to let 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.810
 so it must be there already with you 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.900
 is you simply decree today 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.989
 Show and then just give yourself if 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:09.800
 Your system at the right time 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:15.260
 euro keyboard a cmd will be special 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:19.530
 our command to use for ms-dos 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.150
 So and the water already at the tutorial 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.450
 I hope I could help you 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.620
