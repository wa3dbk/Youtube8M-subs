00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
gentlemen so I have a theory here

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.630 
gentlemen so I have a theory here
knowing<00:05:08.840> as<00:05:09.050> he<00:05:09.290> he<00:05:09.950> will<00:05:10.100> think<00:05:10.370> we<00:05:10.520> will

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
knowing as he he will think we will

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.430 
knowing as he he will think we will
shoot<00:05:10.790> this<00:05:11.030> one<00:05:11.270> in<00:05:11.479> this<00:05:11.630> one<00:05:11.810> which<00:05:12.080> he<00:05:12.260> was

shoot this one in this one which he was

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.760 
shoot this one in this one which he was
right<00:05:12.680> so<00:05:13.669> he<00:05:13.850> therefore<00:05:14.090> planet<00:05:14.870> is<00:05:14.990> c4<00:05:15.410> here

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770

a<00:06:10.640> bit<00:06:10.670> different<00:06:10.850> in<00:06:11.240> this<00:06:11.390> video<00:06:11.660> well<00:06:11.990> that

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
a bit different in this video well that

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.380 
a bit different in this video well that
is<00:06:12.380> because<00:06:12.770> I<00:06:12.800> have<00:06:13.280> bought<00:06:13.790> a<00:06:14.090> microphone

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
is because I have bought a microphone

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.450 
is because I have bought a microphone
arm<00:06:14.990> so<00:06:15.230> I<00:06:15.260> can<00:06:15.500> bring<00:06:15.650> the<00:06:15.800> mic<00:06:15.950> closer<00:06:16.190> to<00:06:16.370> my

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
arm so I can bring the mic closer to my

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.870 
arm so I can bring the mic closer to my
face

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
face

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.940
