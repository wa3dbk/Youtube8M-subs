00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.889
 nice and warm 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.450
 the last thing we knew 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.040
 a lot of time in the kitchen at 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.080
 inside to make a big weight then 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.639
 we want it is fast and good 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.269
 what are we doing walls not going 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.500
 well 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.850
 what I owe to you this way 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.070
 have aluminum have the same strings 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.359
 and nasri barbecue same principle for 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.310
 apples data we will compensate with a 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.900
 season we take it back brings back your veil 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.789
 admits even lagging on baby for 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.500
 start borrowing size 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.210
 we just cut it roughly in 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.180
 four options like that it'll go to 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.219
 to cook more being they will taste well 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.980
 the dane the same thing for the union does not 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:44.559
 will anticipate our winner like that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.280
 like that it smells good the delahaye that that 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.110
 scared of quebec 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.370
 the ion that bought me is what it makes 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.989
 a big difference for the recipe 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.420
 final no there have we done that we can 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.680
 take even easier than ever to 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.050
 salou market to buy my children 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.449
 and myself are produced since it's 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.359
 although after that it's still 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.340
 there for the same purpose for need of 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.710
 need to have this movie in china because 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:12.930

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.460
 I would like my friend with the author 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.830
 finally at the same time the problem is 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.970
 when you are given nothing, it's you 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.680
 will put some olive oil 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.820
 it can seasonings that except at y 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.080
 go generously which is that of 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.510
 potatoes I have to be 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.480
 sounded since the normal one believes he is going 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.310

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.930
 Selick put the same two 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.280
 cooking every five minutes we throw 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.290
 a little peek place is the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.850
 star of the soui the coqueleux v is this 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.710
 that they will know is that we 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.690

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.190
 add m all that this one i the page 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.310

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.260
 I still think the white meat yet 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.649
 about the press equivalent in 158 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.140
 elite 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.110
 it will stylists were steamed 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.730
 at the same time it will change the taste that 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.769
 will change the sauce that will change the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.590
 taste of anti gambling needs limiting to 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.180
 games if with the charter is lived by 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.140
 naxos one click we will return from elsewhere

 we're going to end this season have done 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.570
 to grill for that instead of that 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.430
 traditional yet if I take a 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.410
 baguette 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.120
 I like to listen like that and I do two 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.019
 beautiful hockey pieces a new 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.370
 piece that we want to grill on the 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.769
 barbecue made to grill them on the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.850
 lived before I do not want to burn them this 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.890
 happened the crime 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.630
 I'll be a little bit like that 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.360
 nature we go there as an adult 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.250
 we will the guys from the American side beat 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.250
 I send it directly to the barbecue 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:04.810
 we can actually put oil 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:06.460
 as recalled accounts of life 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.690
 for sure we come back 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.890
 the first ascent navia is that 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.730
 now he knows how to do a lot of 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.770
 noise 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.030
 it's cooked I wanted to turn 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.520
 regularly I hold in the background 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.330
 also holds as many children as possible 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.040
 these heats I'm delegate that's the 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.660
 day and night 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.340
 we will put them back this price you 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.910
 will have common on the mouth we're just going 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.800
 knock them down 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.960
 I'm not going to send them to your hands 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.310

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.270
 the bottom the fans cross on and you have 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.530
 your run kids at the restaurant 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.110
 when you want to mark the steaks 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.220
 it's simple always noon we have omitted 10 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.380
 10 and one at 11:50 still i10 switch to 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.980
 -10 then the grid and 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.080
 regulatory 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.010

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.450

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.960
 that's how I it falls a bit is 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.960
 perfect like that 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.040
 we can take by mazars game stops 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.470
 a little just closed two missteps you 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.930
 know we'll start with salad 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.730
 want to enslave whole it's all fan 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.659
 to take pieces and then cut where one 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.440
 can still be so fun his wish that a 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:23.010
 presentation and but social pieces 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.780
 on fire it's for a short time dry 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.220
 as usual to eat his three 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:35.180
 dirtyh frames of the texture of 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:35.180
 Special interior offered bacon 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:43.010
 just find rudely games 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.010
 figurines half of the portfolio 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.620
 counting we will finish with a little more 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.610
 early by hockey mazars like this one 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.440
 be just a small neighborhood of this top 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.150
 14 like that makes each person 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:06.690
 may be to his liking after that we'll 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:13.250
 to send them the aggression then 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:17.330
 we see steam escaping its boiling 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.330
 also but directly on the grill 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.690
 cantons want to go back it's healthy 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:29.400
 we come we pick up and science where we 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.500
 comes it comes from times we are very 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.080
 the elephant here oromo type between try 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.419
 to weave the hair grass and conflict 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.639
 we keep the game here that is not it 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.409
 psa it reduces anyway 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.539
 quietly hockey when we're done 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:50.159

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:53.490
 mm we will pick up juice if we see 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:55.440
