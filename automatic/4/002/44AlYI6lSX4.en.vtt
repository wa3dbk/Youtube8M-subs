00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.750 

so<00:00:00.709> previously<00:00:01.709> I<00:00:01.800> made<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.040> video<00:00:02.190> showing<00:00:02.340> the

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
so previously I made a video showing the

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.140 
so previously I made a video showing the
the<00:00:03.030> effects<00:00:03.750> of<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:04.020> extremely<00:00:04.680> high<00:00:05.150> rear

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
the effects of the extremely high rear

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.379 
the effects of the extremely high rear
camber<00:00:06.390> link<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:06.960> extremely<00:00:07.379> low<00:00:08.389> rear

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
camber link and the extremely low rear

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.589 
camber link and the extremely low rear
camber<00:00:09.660> link<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.139> how<00:00:10.370> affected<00:00:11.370> roll<00:00:11.599> left

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
camber link and how affected roll left

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.919 
camber link and how affected roll left
and<00:00:12.840> right<00:00:13.099> with<00:00:14.099> lateral<00:00:14.460> forces<00:00:14.809> you<00:00:15.809> can

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
and right with lateral forces you can

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:16.820 
and right with lateral forces you can
look<00:00:16.049> at<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.260> video<00:00:16.440> I'm<00:00:16.500> not<00:00:16.529> going<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.770> go

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
look at that video I'm not going to go

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.200 
look at that video I'm not going to go
into<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.279> time<00:00:17.430> suffice<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.910> say<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
into that this time suffice to say the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.019 
into that this time suffice to say the
side<00:00:18.359> with<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.720> higher<00:00:19.580> link<00:00:20.580> had<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> lower

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
side with the higher link had a lower

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.269 
side with the higher link had a lower
roll<00:00:21.359> center<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.869> rolled<00:00:22.800> significantly

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
roll center and rolled significantly

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.800 
roll center and rolled significantly
more<00:00:23.490> when<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> lateral<00:00:24.090> force<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.480> applied<00:00:24.689> to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
more when a lateral force is applied to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.689 
more when a lateral force is applied to
that<00:00:25.050> side<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.380> car<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.980> lot<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.580> people

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
that side of the car so a lot of people

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.820 
that side of the car so a lot of people
wonder<00:00:27.119> why<00:00:27.359> does<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.990> actually<00:00:28.230> happen<00:00:28.470> it

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
wonder why does that actually happen it

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.900 
wonder why does that actually happen it
looks<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.220> would<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> opposite

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
looks like it would be the opposite

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.759 
looks like it would be the opposite
thing<00:00:30.090> look<00:00:30.480> at<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.779> Lincoln<00:00:31.500> they're<00:00:31.619> like

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
thing look at this Lincoln they're like

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.780 
thing look at this Lincoln they're like
well<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.279> know<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.570> car<00:00:34.399> chassis<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
well you know the car chassis the the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.880 
well you know the car chassis the the
inner<00:00:35.969> brace<00:00:36.270> has<00:00:36.570> way<00:00:37.020> more<00:00:37.050> leverage<00:00:37.710> on

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
inner brace has way more leverage on

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.170 
inner brace has way more leverage on
this<00:00:38.070> side<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.670> actually<00:00:38.910> mounted

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
this side and it's actually mounted

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.639 
this side and it's actually mounted
under<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.480> brace<00:00:39.750> here<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.230> make<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
under the brace here to make the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.770 
under the brace here to make the
situation<00:00:41.129> very<00:00:41.399> extreme<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.149> shows<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.540> on

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
situation very extreme so it shows up on

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.770 
situation very extreme so it shows up on
video<00:00:43.530> well<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.300> thinking<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
video well that's not thinking of the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.299 
video well that's not thinking of the
forces<00:00:46.170> correctly<00:00:47.000> when<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> car<00:00:48.420> rolls<00:00:49.309> when

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
forces correctly when the car rolls when

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.389 
forces correctly when the car rolls when
that<00:00:50.430> shock<00:00:50.670> tower<00:00:50.879> wants<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.860> push<00:00:52.860> down<00:00:53.129> as

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that shock tower wants to push down as

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.420 
that shock tower wants to push down as
the<00:00:53.610> car<00:00:53.820> rolls<00:00:53.930> and<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.170> camber<00:00:55.559> link<00:00:55.770> wants

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the car rolls and that camber link wants

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.490 
the car rolls and that camber link wants
to<00:00:56.520> push<00:00:56.730> outward<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.260> remember

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
to push outward you have to remember

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.490 
to push outward you have to remember
that<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.940> stopping<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.539> roll<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:01.170> is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that what is stopping the roll there is

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.840 
that what is stopping the roll there is
the<00:01:02.430> spring<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.539> shock<00:01:04.140> between<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.129> arm

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the spring on the shock between the arm

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.420 
the spring on the shock between the arm
and<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:07.140> tower<00:01:07.350> there<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.770> hinge<00:01:08.040> point<00:01:08.310> at

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and the tower there that hinge point at

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.719 
and the tower there that hinge point at
the<00:01:08.520> hinge<00:01:08.700> pin<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.799> what<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.010> not<00:01:11.490> obvious

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the hinge pin so what is not obvious

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
the hinge pin so what is not obvious
that<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.270> happening<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
that is happening is that there is a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.440 
that is happening is that there is a
very<00:01:14.630> significant<00:01:15.630> downward<00:01:16.200> force<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
very significant downward force and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.060 
very significant downward force and
lateral<00:01:18.450> force<00:01:18.780> being<00:01:19.170> placed<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.770> tire

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
lateral force being placed on this tire

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.200 
lateral force being placed on this tire
so<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:21.000> happens<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.689> there's<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:23.090> hinge<00:01:24.090> pin

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
so what happens is there's a hinge pin

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.539 
so what happens is there's a hinge pin
there<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> bottom<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.619> hub<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.159> mean<00:01:26.430> we

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
there at the bottom of the hub I mean we

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.740 
there at the bottom of the hub I mean we
all<00:01:26.670> know<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.000> there<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.150> can't<00:01:27.420> get<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.689> on

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
all know it's there I can't get it on

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.600 
all know it's there I can't get it on
the<00:01:27.840> video<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.259> well<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.189> point<00:01:29.430> is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the video really well and the point is

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.460 
the video really well and the point is
is<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.790> when<00:01:30.030> you're<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.390> corner<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.049> your

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
is that when you're in a corner and your

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.190 
is that when you're in a corner and your
car<00:01:31.740> wants<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.369> go<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:33.299> way<00:01:33.570> because<00:01:33.930> you're

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
car wants to go this way because you're

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.240 
car wants to go this way because you're
turning<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:35.070> way<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.900> you<00:01:36.900> know<00:01:37.250> forces

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
turning this way and you know forces

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
turning this way and you know forces
pushing<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.909> way<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.810> tire<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.380> going

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
pushing it this way this tire is going

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.249 
pushing it this way this tire is going
to<00:01:40.799> go<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.509> bottom<00:01:42.659> hinge<00:01:42.990> pin

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
to go like this on the bottom hinge pin

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.200 
to go like this on the bottom hinge pin
and<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.369> actually<00:01:44.549> take<00:01:45.030> this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
and it's going to actually take this

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.469 
and it's going to actually take this
link<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.780> pull<00:01:46.649> against<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> chassis<00:01:47.880> this

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
link and pull against the chassis this

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.910 
link and pull against the chassis this
is<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> opposite<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.229> how<00:01:49.380> people<00:01:49.680> think<00:01:49.770> of

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
is the opposite of how people think of

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.700 
is the opposite of how people think of
it<00:01:50.009> people<00:01:50.220> think<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:50.640> oh<00:01:50.880> well<00:01:51.149> I'm

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
it people think of it as oh well I'm

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.080 
it people think of it as oh well I'm
having<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.799> car<00:01:53.009> push<00:01:53.340> against<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> tire<00:01:53.939> all

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
having a car push against the tire all

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.030 
having a car push against the tire all
in<00:01:54.180> reality<00:01:54.600> pushing<00:01:55.259> against<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.619> tire<00:01:55.799> it

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
in reality pushing against a tire it

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.109 
in reality pushing against a tire it
already<00:01:56.219> wants<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.579> go<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.850> way<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:56.969> it's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
already wants to go that way and it's

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.399 
already wants to go that way and it's
already<00:01:57.360> trying<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.930> way<00:01:58.049> because<00:01:58.170> of

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
already trying to go that way because of

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.630 
already trying to go that way because of
the<00:01:58.469> force<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.860> applied<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> tracking

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
the force is applied on the tracking

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.469 
the force is applied on the tracking
this<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.820> what<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.030> keep<00:02:00.210> telling<00:02:00.450> people

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
this is what I keep telling people

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.120 
this is what I keep telling people
you're<00:02:01.079> thinking<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> force<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.950> wrong

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
you're thinking of the force is wrong

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.679 
you're thinking of the force is wrong
you<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.240> context

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
you have to think of it in the context

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.990 
you have to think of it in the context
of<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> tire<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:05.040> lateral<00:02:05.460> force<00:02:05.729> and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
of the tire and it's lateral force and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.550 
of the tire and it's lateral force and
it's<00:02:06.119> downward<00:02:06.540> force<00:02:06.810> how<00:02:07.140> that's<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.500> to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
it's downward force how that's going to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.109 
it's downward force how that's going to
affect<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.610> prove<00:02:08.849> how<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.270> happens

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
affect it and to prove how this happens

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.759 
affect it and to prove how this happens
we've<00:02:10.239> got<00:02:10.420> this<00:02:10.509> arbor<00:02:10.899> plate<00:02:11.110> they're<00:02:11.379> just

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
we've got this arbor plate they're just

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.470 
we've got this arbor plate they're just
the<00:02:11.860> corner<00:02:12.190> holding<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.519> tire<00:02:12.730> just<00:02:13.120> as<00:02:13.300> it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
the corner holding the tire just as it

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.089 
the corner holding the tire just as it
there's<00:02:13.989> an<00:02:14.140> extreme<00:02:14.500> amount<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:14.860> traction

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
there's an extreme amount of traction

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.369 
there's an extreme amount of traction
there<00:02:15.459> like<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.849> know<00:02:15.879> is<00:02:16.510> good<00:02:16.930> attraction

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
there like you know is good attraction

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.180 
there like you know is good attraction
situation<00:02:17.860> as<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.069> can<00:02:18.220> possibly<00:02:18.430> have<00:02:19.170> so

what<00:02:21.190> I'm<00:02:21.280> going<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.430> do<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.879> just<00:02:22.060> pop<00:02:22.239> off

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
what I'm going to do is just pop off

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.360 
what I'm going to do is just pop off
this<00:02:22.750> link<00:02:23.170> which<00:02:23.379> is<00:02:23.530> raised<00:02:23.769> up<00:02:23.980> extremely

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
this link which is raised up extremely

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.539 
this link which is raised up extremely
high<00:02:25.200> pop<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.379> off<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.950> here<00:02:27.069> we<00:02:27.160> go

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
high pop it off and here we go

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.979 
high pop it off and here we go
and<00:02:29.160> we're<00:02:30.160> going<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.310> sit<00:02:30.519> it<00:02:30.610> there<00:02:30.989> now

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
and we're going to sit it there now

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.589 
and we're going to sit it there now
watch<00:02:32.470> what<00:02:32.680> happens<00:02:32.739> as<00:02:33.400> we<00:02:33.819> push<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.390> car

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
watch what happens as we push the car

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.270 
watch what happens as we push the car
this<00:02:34.750> direction<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:38.500> tire<00:02:38.739> wants<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.129> roll

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
this direction that tire wants to roll

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.809 
this direction that tire wants to roll
over<00:02:40.200> if<00:02:41.200> had<00:02:41.560> had<00:02:41.680> been<00:02:41.830> connected<00:02:42.340> here<00:02:42.610> to

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
over if had had been connected here to

over if had had been connected here to
this<00:02:42.940> camber<00:02:43.390> link<00:02:43.599> position<00:02:44.579> that<00:02:45.579> force

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
this camber link position that force

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.000 
this camber link position that force
would<00:02:46.450> have<00:02:46.569> pulled<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.900> car<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.349> motivated

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
would have pulled the car and motivated

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.009 
would have pulled the car and motivated
to<00:02:48.280> roll<00:02:48.959> because<00:02:49.959> this<00:02:50.440> side<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.829> higher<00:02:52.019> it's

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
to roll because this side is higher it's

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.100 
to roll because this side is higher it's
got<00:02:53.230> more<00:02:53.440> lever<00:02:53.739> arm<00:02:54.660> against<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.690> fulcrum

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
got more lever arm against the fulcrum

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.000 
got more lever arm against the fulcrum
of<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:58.120> hinge<00:02:58.540> pin<00:02:58.720> here<00:02:58.989> since<00:02:59.860> this

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
of the of the hinge pin here since this

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.850 
of the of the hinge pin here since this
side<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:00.519> lower<00:03:01.200> while<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.470> car<00:03:02.680> may<00:03:02.829> have

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
side is lower while the car may have

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.479 
side is lower while the car may have
more<00:03:03.190> leverage<00:03:03.459> on<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:05.590> wheel<00:03:05.799> moving<00:03:06.129> the

more leverage on the wheel moving the

wheel has far less leverage to pull the
chassis<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.959> is<00:03:11.230> why<00:03:11.470> when<00:03:12.129> you<00:03:12.280> look<00:03:12.579> at

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
chassis this is why when you look at

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.670 
chassis this is why when you look at
chassis<00:03:13.120> roll<00:03:13.360> there's<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:14.049> whole<00:03:14.319> bunch<00:03:14.500> of

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
chassis roll there's a whole bunch of

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.080 
chassis roll there's a whole bunch of
different<00:03:14.769> intersecting<00:03:15.519> lines<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.030> it

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
different intersecting lines and it

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.220 
different intersecting lines and it
creates<00:03:16.480> a<00:03:16.889> virtual<00:03:17.889> point<00:03:18.280> around<00:03:19.120> which<00:03:19.540> the

creates a virtual point around which the

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.550 
creates a virtual point around which the
cars<00:03:20.440> weight<00:03:20.680> rolls<00:03:21.120> it's<00:03:22.120> not<00:03:22.389> as<00:03:22.720> simple<00:03:23.440> as

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
cars weight rolls it's not as simple as

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.840 
cars weight rolls it's not as simple as
just<00:03:23.709> looking<00:03:23.799> oh<00:03:24.130> there's<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.609> lot<00:03:24.700> of

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
just looking oh there's a lot of

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.920 
just looking oh there's a lot of
leverage<00:03:25.060> here<00:03:25.299> because<00:03:25.540> I'm<00:03:25.660> pushing

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
leverage here because I'm pushing

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.860 
leverage here because I'm pushing
against<00:03:26.139> the<00:03:26.200> tire<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.829> reality<00:03:27.720> pushing<00:03:28.720> this

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
against the tire in reality pushing this

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.750 
against the tire in reality pushing this
direction<00:03:29.349> that<00:03:29.799> tire<00:03:30.040> wants<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.430> go<00:03:30.519> that<00:03:30.639> way

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
direction that tire wants to go that way

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.259 
direction that tire wants to go that way
already

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
already

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.089 
already
it's<00:03:31.420> this<00:03:31.690> guy<00:03:31.870> that's<00:03:32.170> pulling<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.560> chassis

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
it's this guy that's pulling the chassis

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.930 
it's this guy that's pulling the chassis
this<00:03:33.370> direction<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:34.900> why<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:36.700> ends

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
this direction and that is why it ends

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.220 
this direction and that is why it ends
up<00:03:37.030> working<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.569> way<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:37.690> it<00:03:37.930> does<00:03:38.049> it's

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
up working the way that it does it's

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.409 
up working the way that it does it's
very<00:03:38.290> counterintuitive<00:03:38.739> but<00:03:39.430> hopefully<00:03:39.880> this

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
very counterintuitive but hopefully this

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.900 
very counterintuitive but hopefully this
demonstrates<00:03:40.989> why<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.319> upper<00:03:42.280> link<00:03:42.430> produces

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
demonstrates why the upper link produces
