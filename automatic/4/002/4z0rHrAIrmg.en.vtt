00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.860
 Hello and 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.880
 Welcome to a further 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.250
 result of 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.250
 the painting school today I want the 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.160
 You can do it pretty easily 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.119
 impressive black and white drawings 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.250
 make 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.580
 even the old masters have the 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.930
 Technique used for your drawings 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.119
 I have them for you a little bit 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.119
 simplified and modernized 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.590
 so it is now possible for you too 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.140
 get along with it 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.180
 I would like to give you the surface tint 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.110
 a simple landscape motif 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.540
 demonstrate 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.250
 look over my shoulder and now 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.250
 get to know the technology 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.650
 For the technology to work itself 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.159
 The white drawing paper with coal dust 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.040
 Tapping off that works best if you do that 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.170
 powder with a paper kitchen towel 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.040
 evenly distributed it arises 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.310
 nice clear sign reason my 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.430
 sign instrument is the plasticine i 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.799
 use it like a brush 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.189
 image areas that should become white 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.770
 I add from the tint out the 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.680
 gray I leave there where then too 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.820
 later the objects in my picture 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.740
 the trees are recognizable 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.200
 Of course, at the beginning this is still very much the case 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.390
 abstract but already after a few 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.290
 minutes you can see the silhouette of 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.290
 recognize trees 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.470
 details and lighting effects can be 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.840
 to generate quite easily 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.080
 The lump is formed into a point 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.050
 and then similar to a stamp directly 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.880
 topped up from the top 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.660
 so then arise small lines or 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:09.170
 points can be the brightness 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.170
 Create effects in the picture quite simply 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.480
 do not produce special effects when 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.410
 I wipe my hand over the tint 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.630
 A bright gray tone arises 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.930
 here in my example the foreground 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.000
 my picture because the light side of the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.390
 meadow I lay then with the plasticine 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.100
 free as a result in the light 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.410
 Vibrant grass surface of the fir tree in the 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.510
 foreground is still too bright and must 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.160
 become darker 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.250
 I do not do that with the 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.890
 coal dust but with black 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.630
 Pastel colors and the soft sponge 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.800
 so that I can very well the form of 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.100
 draw tree 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.980
 I start up and broaden that 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.600
 steered downwards 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.420
 with the broad side of the sponge 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.310
 I can work flat and very well 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.260
 so fast with the black one 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.260
 Pastel colors create the shape 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.780
 draw the thin branches of the fir-tree 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.780
 I with the edge of the sponge 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.459
 the black pastel colors are now set 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.530
 the tree in the foreground of 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.780
 background stops gray 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.220
 and both together create the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.530
 spatial depth in my drawing the 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.920
 other tree trunks I also prefer 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.349
 with the edge of the sponge with the 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.550
 wide side I wish the dense 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:45.330
 bushes as you can tell taste me 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.220
 Carefully approach the motive 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.010
 first the black pastel colors 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.500
 slightly increased 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:59.019
 not too much and if necessary I work 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:01.060
 I'm still pulling something in the foreground 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:05.140
 with the edge of the sponge it still 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.540
 a few shrubs have the shadow effects 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.660
 on the meadow arise on the same 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.660
 wise 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.470
 then it goes to the background again 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.690
 I complete the foliage and put more 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.490
 branches and stems 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.490
 This will make the background more dense 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.260
 Now I'm pulling the tip of the 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.620
 plasticine there are more light effects and 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.229
 Pointed lights thus create important light 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.080
 dark effects the spatial depth in 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.300
 bring my drawing 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.460
 Here you can again in detail very much 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.180
 nice to see me with the tip of the 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.669
 rubbers the tint just remove 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.030
 increase and already lies the white 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:58.320
 you can free the paper 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.180
 do not design effects 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.870
 Finally, I bring with black 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.139
 pastel colors some corrections 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.090
 the branches and the needles of the fir-tree 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:13.150
 will be further condensed the 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.360
 shadow effects additionally reinforced and 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.180
 complements the finished black white 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.460
 Although drawing shows only a few details 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.909
 but still works through her 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.430
 bring light effects in front of everything 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:30.539
 the bright dark effects spatial depth 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.539
 in the motive 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.460
 as you have seen, you can go in 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.170
 short time with little effort one 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.020
 impressive quite extraordinary 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.120
 create black and white drawing if 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.010
 you want to work you can find 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.550
 on my website a little 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.170
 Instructions with the material list if you 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.360
 even more about the surface tint 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.790
 then you want to know yours 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.180
 deepen your knowledge with my learning program 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.240
 the dvd with the e book shows you step 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.700
 step by step how the technology works 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:08.000
 and how you too learn this technique 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:13.450
 you can find more information on
