00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.219
 let's open today a French oyster of 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.469
 mother not then it's a very concave oyster 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.349
 simple that has two parts a flat 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.910
 another concave the part with the ass of the 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:24.170
 sample will be between asia us 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.609
 we count 123 of the length of the oyster here 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.910
 we puncture with the lace that very 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.339
 simple click we put the lace 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.100
 one centimeter in and now 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:37.309
 then we have a brad and the clack 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.329
 we have open then we cut a nerve 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.289
 in this way 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.039
 we have an oyster open simply 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:49.589
 no broken shell without news tape or 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.760
 that the oyster is wide open and can 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.269
 make anyone not a 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.269
 professional 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.379
 How to know an oyster is good or bad 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.720
 it is very important the oyster can not give 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.820
 many clues to know if it 's good or 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.940
 bad when opening the oyster for example 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.460
 open an oyster 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.670
 If the other does not have water in it 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.310
 this case does have its water 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.070
 means that the oyster is still breathing 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.700
 with its own water again the smell if 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.090
 the oyster or the 'bad bad sign too and 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.040
 also if the color of the oyster a little 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.530
 weird you also have to be very careful 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.260
 with it 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.090
 the most important thing that the oyster has to 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.670
 having your water your own water is what 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.320
 allows the oyster to breathe well 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.600
 do a filtration auto and 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.909
 wake up the same now we go to the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.920
 most important part of all how 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.680
 taste an oyster 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.950
 I as an expert in oysters I like it 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.580
 taste a natural oyster like that 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.010
 A) Yes 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.100
 Take pleasure out of the oyster bust 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.920
 but at the most if you like it 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.150
 put something a touch to the oyster would be 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.100
 a touch of pepper 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.420
 not long then a lemon droplet 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.010
 and they always live well 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.090
 and later 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.090
 to taste the oyster
