but I think what happened as the
afternoon<00:01:38.880> went<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.829> she<00:01:40.829> became<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.549> little

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
afternoon went on is she became a little

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.780 
afternoon went on is she became a little
flipping<00:01:42.299> at<00:01:42.390> times<00:01:42.659> cute<00:01:43.619> at<00:01:43.740> times<00:01:44.040> she<00:01:44.610> was

digressing questioning the lawyer why is

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.920 
digressing questioning the lawyer why is
this<00:01:47.700> why<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.360> judge<00:01:48.600> had<00:01:48.810> to

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
he had reservations about this case

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.220 
he had reservations about this case
under<00:02:40.280> existing<00:02:40.549> georgia<00:02:41.150> case<00:02:41.450> law<00:02:41.689> that<00:02:41.900> he

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
under existing georgia case law that he

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.780 
under existing georgia case law that he
was<00:02:42.349> concerned<00:02:42.500> as<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:42.980> whether<00:02:43.069> or<00:02:43.310> not<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
was concerned as to whether or not the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.580 
was concerned as to whether or not the
causation<00:02:44.209> issue<00:02:44.540> should<00:02:44.780> really<00:02:45.200> go<00:02:45.379> to<00:02:45.440> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
causation issue should really go to the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.250 
causation issue should really go to the
jury<00:02:45.829> and<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.459> think<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.659> know<00:02:47.750> if<00:02:47.959> there

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
jury and I think that you know if there

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.869 
jury and I think that you know if there
was<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.530> finding<00:02:48.950> against<00:02:49.400> him<00:02:49.519> that<00:02:49.670> might

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
was a finding against him that might

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.220 
was a finding against him that might
have<00:02:50.000> been<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.120> motivating<00:02:50.629> factor<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:51.049> there

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
have been a motivating factor that there

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.660 
have been a motivating factor that there
wouldn't<00:02:51.440> be<00:02:51.620> jail<00:02:51.859> time<00:02:51.889> in<00:02:52.250> this<00:02:52.310> instance

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
wouldn't be jail time in this instance

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.620 
wouldn't be jail time in this instance
what<00:02:53.329> if<00:02:53.620> knowing
