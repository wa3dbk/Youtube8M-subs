00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.080
 well, let's also tell you in 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.750
 our country the high tools 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.820
 technology and aeronautical development not 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.320
 they are alien to our homeland in the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.869
 this report we are going to know the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.699
 drones brand perÃº gentlemen like you what 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.430
 listen that fly over the territory 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.870
 Peruvian with real soldiers to do 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.789
 true ironman let's see them 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.949
 the drones have monopolized the covers 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:42.500
 international of the last times 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.180
 these metal birds do not have any 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.820
 soldier of flesh and bone inside 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.469
 they are unmanned aircraft that are 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.360
 used by the air offensive of 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.110
 united states and union countries 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.579
 European and our country is not far behind 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.620
 four small planes that look like 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.110
 toy are seen in the air base of the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.850
 souls but for the department of 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.059
 development of force operations 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.880
 Peruvian air this soft are no 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.710
 game here on the airstrip of 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.899
 the air base the palms in furrow 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.970
 we can see that in collaboration with the 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:17.240
 Ministry of Defense and Concytec has 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.399
 elaborated has pasted on the other hand the 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.770
 better known as force drones 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.720
 from Peru are ready to 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.550
 overfly the Peruvian territory and 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.740
 conduct disaster monitoring 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.960
 natural and why not also perform 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.370
 the detection of clandestine tracks in 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.460
 our country 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.980
 Pegasus is made of wood balsa measures 2 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.290
 points 70 meters in span and it was the 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.690
 First manufactured drone from Peru 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.880
 far we see a plane with a pilot 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.130
 inside asking for permission to 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.870
 land to the control tower this 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.060
 drone also requires 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.680
 request air space and there is a 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.650
 significant deployment of personnel 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.120
 tactical operational and strategic between 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.400
 ero engineers and specialists 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.710
 nautical which are prepared so that 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.160
 moose flight and successfully meet your 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.649
 mission all this development this has been 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.870
 carried out by Peruvian personnel and a 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.830
 external and good advice we already have some 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.750
 optimal results we already have this 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.790
 flying aircraft and distance to make 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.080
 the employee but actively 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.170
 benefits of using a drone 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.060
 There are several among them the ease of 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.740
 space in the cockpit for 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.560
 accommodate all types of system 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.660
 communication control and operation this 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.000
 plane is operated from a station 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.620
 ground control where it is monitored by 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.599
 intelligence software 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.610
 and you see the images that the device 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.700
 captures from this camera visible spectrum 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.470
 which has recognition functions 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.870
 observation and surveillance also counts 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.250
 with infrared vision and a radar 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.840
 synthetic opening 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.030
 We are in the control station of 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.709
 land from which control is made 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.010
 the whole flight of the aerial vehicle does not 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.920
 manned in this part you have all the 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.989
 control where this program and you see and you 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.800
 visualize the whole development of the flight 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.660
 of the scheduled flight plan 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.110
 and likewise we can zoom 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.990
 detect any particular target and 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.700
 approach collaboration and missions 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.650
 of control of drug trafficking and fight 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.480
 against terrorism makes the drones 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.700
 electronic intelligence equipment 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.560
 very important in territories such as 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.450
 VRAE and tracking 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.390
 radiation and detection of plantations 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.680
 illegal coca and marijuana also have 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.740
 charged great importance in the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.510
 research of the ecological environment and 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.820
 meteorological of our entire territory 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.800
 to warn of climate changes is a 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.960
 system of this video that has two 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.000
 cameras one to make day shots and 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.830
 another to make night shot at a time 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.770
 this system allows to make calm of 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.540
 objectives in real time is to say a 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.960
 once the plane is say a height 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.850
 from 500 to 1000 meters we do it 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.220
 objective we treat it from place and 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.920
 it will automatically follow all the 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.630
 time these planes are manufactured and 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.550
 assembled in our country with 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.470
 technology and labor clearly 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.170
 Peruvian drones carbon fiber 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.910
 a little bigger than pieces too 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.990
 they have aerospace technology 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.670
 Vanguard 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.650
 and are ready to fly over our 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.000
 rugged territory and serve our 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.000
 homeland as real soldiers 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.590
 well, you have witnessed 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.420
 then that these drones of these 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.400
 our Peruvian planes are 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.970
 developing at the service of our 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.970
 country
