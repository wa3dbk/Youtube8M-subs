these types of fats that again are gonna

these types of fats that again are gonna
be<00:00:47.550> higher<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.940> calories<00:00:48.180> are<00:00:48.750> still<00:00:49.289> healthy

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
be higher in calories are still healthy

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.369 
be higher in calories are still healthy
for<00:00:49.920> us<00:00:49.950> because<00:00:50.370> they're<00:00:50.489> not<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.379> give

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
for us because they're not going to give

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.529 
for us because they're not going to give
us<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.620> higher<00:00:52.860> risk<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.250> heart<00:00:53.579> disease<00:00:53.610> such

us a higher risk for heart disease such

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.029 
us a higher risk for heart disease such
as<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:54.870> things<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.620> would<00:00:55.829> come<00:00:56.010> from

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
as like things that would come from

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.819 
as like things that would come from
saturated<00:00:56.699> fats<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.750> again<00:00:58.020> looking<00:00:58.530> at<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
saturated fats so again looking at the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.560 
saturated fats so again looking at the
vegetable<00:00:59.280> sources<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.789> fat<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> great<00:01:00.449> way

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
vegetable sources of fat is a great way

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.360 
vegetable sources of fat is a great way
to<00:01:00.600> add<00:01:00.809> extra<00:01:01.079> calories<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.710> still<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> healthy

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
to add extra calories in still a healthy

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.030 
to add extra calories in still a healthy
way<00:01:02.629> also<00:01:03.629> keep<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.899> mind<00:01:03.960> calories<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.799> come

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
way also keep in mind calories do come

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.500 
way also keep in mind calories do come
from<00:01:05.189> protein<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.820> fat<00:01:06.000> as<00:01:06.210> well<00:01:06.420> as

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
from protein and fat as well as

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.149 
from protein and fat as well as
carbohydrates<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.710> even<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.010> you're

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
carbohydrates so even if you're

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.250 
carbohydrates so even if you're
monitoring<00:01:08.520> your<00:01:08.640> carbohydrates<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.689> may<00:01:10.110> not

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
monitoring your carbohydrates it may not

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320 
monitoring your carbohydrates it may not
want<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> add<00:01:10.619> choices<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.130> those<00:01:11.369> adding<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
want to add choices of those adding the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.210 
want to add choices of those adding the
choices<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.810> fat<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.140> protein<00:01:13.200> help<00:01:13.920> as<00:01:14.070> well

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
choices of fat and protein help as well

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.890 
choices of fat and protein help as well
be<00:01:14.970> careful<00:01:15.150> when<00:01:15.420> you're<00:01:15.540> looking<00:01:15.720> at<00:01:15.869> your

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
be careful when you're looking at your

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.260 
be careful when you're looking at your
dairies<00:01:16.350> because<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.340> milk<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.939> sometimes

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
dairies because the milk and sometimes

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.270 
dairies because the milk and sometimes
the<00:01:18.390> yogurt<00:01:18.689> will<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.080> carbohydrates<00:01:19.409> but

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the yogurt will have carbohydrates but

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.679 
the yogurt will have carbohydrates but
again<00:01:20.549> they're<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> good<00:01:20.939> source<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.270> protein

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
again they're a good source of protein

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.510 
again they're a good source of protein
and<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> good<00:01:22.590> source<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.950> calories<00:01:23.130> for

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and can be a good source of calories for

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.359 
and can be a good source of calories for
you<00:01:23.640> as<00:01:23.790> well<00:01:24.259> any<00:01:25.259> weight<00:01:25.560> lawn<00:01:25.740> plant<00:01:26.040> weight
