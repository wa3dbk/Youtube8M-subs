00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
he's a great guy to work with when it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.850 
he's a great guy to work with when it
comes<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.870> performance<00:01:55.290> capture<00:01:55.500> can<00:01:55.770> you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
comes to performance capture can you

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.170 
comes to performance capture can you
talk<00:01:55.980> about<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.370> technology<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.000> how<00:01:57.120> you

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
talk about the technology and how you

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.930 
talk about the technology and how you
worked<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.720> actors<00:01:58.610> yeah<00:01:59.610> we're<00:01:59.850> doing

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
worked with the actors yeah we're doing

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.000 
worked with the actors yeah we're doing
a<00:02:00.090> lot<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.270> stuff<00:02:00.510> that<00:02:00.540> some<00:02:01.020> that's<00:02:01.800> leading

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
a lot of stuff that some that's leading

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.550 
a lot of stuff that some that's leading
edge<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.460> terms<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.790> social<00:02:02.940> capture<00:02:03.510> and<00:02:04.229> in

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
edge in terms of social capture and in

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.130 
edge in terms of social capture and in
terms<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.130> way<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.670> use<00:02:06.140> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
terms of the way that we use the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.570 
terms of the way that we use the
technology<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.770> blend<00:02:07.979> shapes<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.489> way

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
technology the blend shapes and the way

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.879 
technology the blend shapes and the way
that<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.759> capture<00:02:09.030> performance<00:02:09.709> we<00:02:10.709> get

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:10.889 
that we capture performance we get

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.220 
that we capture performance we get
through<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.129> lot<00:02:11.579> in<00:02:11.609> a<00:02:11.849> day<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.030> think<00:02:12.420> one<00:02:13.200> of

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
through a lot in a day I think one of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.869 
through a lot in a day I think one of
the<00:02:13.349> big<00:02:13.499> differences<00:02:13.680> for<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.280> actors<00:02:14.609> is

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
the big differences for the actors is

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.970 
the big differences for the actors is
you<00:02:15.510> know<00:02:15.629> how<00:02:15.840> many<00:02:16.079> lines<00:02:16.319> we<00:02:16.530> shoot<00:02:16.829> in<00:02:16.920> a

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
you know how many lines we shoot in a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.470 
you know how many lines we shoot in a
day<00:02:17.129> compared<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.489> if<00:02:17.670> they're<00:02:17.819> working<00:02:18.060> TV<00:02:18.239> or

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
day compared to if they're working TV or

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.449 
day compared to if they're working TV or
film<00:02:18.629> it's<00:02:18.900> it's<00:02:19.290> pretty<00:02:19.650> grueling<00:02:19.950> for<00:02:20.310> them

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
film it's it's pretty grueling for them

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.550 
film it's it's pretty grueling for them
but<00:02:20.999> we<00:02:21.090> kept<00:02:21.269> people<00:02:21.510> capture<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.959> lot<00:02:22.469> of

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
but we kept people capture a lot of

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.220 
but we kept people capture a lot of
stuff<00:02:22.769> with<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:24.180> know<00:02:24.269> type<00:02:24.719> markers<00:02:25.049> on<00:02:25.139> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
stuff with you know type markers on the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.559 
stuff with you know type markers on the
face<00:02:25.439> and<00:02:25.469> full<00:02:26.219> facial<00:02:26.400> scans<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:27.180> get<00:02:27.299> to<00:02:27.480> get

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
face and full facial scans to get to get

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.690 
face and full facial scans to get to get
the<00:02:27.629> fidelity<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.109> the<00:02:28.170> model<00:02:28.439> and<00:02:29.069> we've<00:02:29.579> got

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
the fidelity in the model and we've got

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.089 
the fidelity in the model and we've got
a<00:02:29.730> great<00:02:29.909> process<00:02:30.379> for<00:02:31.379> building<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.859> Rings

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
a great process for building the Rings

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.739 
a great process for building the Rings
which<00:02:32.370> which<00:02:32.609> drive<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:32.909> facial<00:02:33.299> animation

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:33.749 
which which drive the facial animation

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.959 
which which drive the facial animation
and<00:02:33.870> give<00:02:33.959> us<00:02:34.049> that<00:02:34.170> fidelity<00:02:34.590> what<00:02:35.579> is<00:02:35.700> ps4

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:35.969 
and give us that fidelity what is ps4

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.449 
and give us that fidelity what is ps4
opened<00:02:36.510> up<00:02:36.599> in<00:02:36.779> terms<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.170> facial<00:02:37.859> capture<00:02:38.040> and

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
opened up in terms of facial capture and

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.069 
opened up in terms of facial capture and
performance<00:02:39.029> capture<00:02:39.180> technology<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:39.989> what

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
performance capture technology and what

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.559 
performance capture technology and what
you<00:02:40.170> guys<00:02:40.290> can<00:02:40.499> do<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.799> number<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.129> actors

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
you guys can do with a number of actors

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.209 
you guys can do with a number of actors
well<00:02:42.569> it's<00:02:43.079> awesome<00:02:43.560> just<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.739> processing

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
well it's awesome just the processing

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.440 
well it's awesome just the processing
power<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.609> we've<00:02:44.760> got<00:02:44.939> now<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.359> obviously

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
power that we've got now and obviously

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.509 
power that we've got now and obviously
we've<00:02:45.779> the<00:02:45.959> Killzone<00:02:46.889> engine<00:02:47.249> that<00:02:47.370> we've

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
we've the Killzone engine that we've

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.759 
we've the Killzone engine that we've
we've<00:02:47.879> kind<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.180> modified<00:02:48.689> quite<00:02:49.109> extensively

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
we've kind of modified quite extensively

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.369 
we've kind of modified quite extensively
to<00:02:50.189> to<00:02:50.549> suit<00:02:50.819> what<00:02:51.540> we<00:02:51.719> need<00:02:51.959> out<00:02:52.109> of<00:02:52.139> it

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
to to suit what we need out of it

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.599 
to to suit what we need out of it
compared<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.739> what<00:02:52.859> gorilla<00:02:53.099> need<00:02:53.279> out<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.430> it

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
compared to what gorilla need out of it

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.819 
compared to what gorilla need out of it
for<00:02:53.819> for<00:02:54.420> killzone<00:02:54.779> and<00:02:55.319> we've<00:02:55.439> put<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.620> lot<00:02:55.769> of

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
for for killzone and we've put a lot of

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.769 
for for killzone and we've put a lot of
focus<00:02:56.099> into<00:02:56.639> how<00:02:56.909> much<00:02:57.090> processing<00:02:57.450> we<00:02:57.599> use

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:57.779 
focus into how much processing we use

00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.750 
focus into how much processing we use
for<00:02:57.930> facial<00:02:58.290> animation<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.249> how<00:02:59.459> much<00:02:59.579> we

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
for facial animation and how much we

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.860 
for facial animation and how much we
allocate<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:02.219> gives<00:03:02.400> us<00:03:02.579> the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
allocate to that and that gives us the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.149 
allocate to that and that gives us the
fidelity<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:04.109> you<00:03:04.169> seen<00:03:04.379> until<00:03:04.680> Dorner<00:03:05.040> than

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
fidelity that you seen until Dorner than

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.039 
fidelity that you seen until Dorner than
the<00:03:05.249> filthy<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:05.579> expressions<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.419> the<00:03:07.019> eye

the filthy of expressions and the eye
movements<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.090> we're<00:03:09.090> very<00:03:09.120> we<00:03:09.629> take<00:03:09.779> a<00:03:09.810> long

the<00:03:12.209> emotions<00:03:12.719> right<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.049> come<00:03:13.200> across

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
the emotions right to come across

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.409 
the emotions right to come across
because<00:03:13.650> no<00:03:14.310> it's<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.489> horror<00:03:14.639> game<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.150> that

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
because no it's a horror game and that

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.289 
because no it's a horror game and that
the<00:03:15.629> the<00:03:15.900> emotion<00:03:16.859> of<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.669> those<00:03:17.879> characters

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
the the emotion of of those characters

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.269 
the the emotion of of those characters
needs<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.689> come<00:03:18.870> through<00:03:19.129> what<00:03:20.129> are<00:03:20.219> the

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:20.279 
needs to come through what are the

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:21.619 
needs to come through what are the
challenges<00:03:20.519> of<00:03:20.909> creating<00:03:21.120> interactive

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
challenges of creating interactive

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.879 
challenges of creating interactive
horror<00:03:22.139> I<00:03:24.109> think<00:03:25.109> I<00:03:25.260> think<00:03:25.469> some<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.739> the

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
horror I think I think some of the

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.080 
horror I think I think some of the
challenges<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.279> we've<00:03:26.489> tried<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.760> address

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
challenges that we've tried to address

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.470 
challenges that we've tried to address
of<00:03:27.359> being<00:03:27.540> them<00:03:27.779> the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
of being them the

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.520 
of being them the
making<00:03:30.480> death<00:03:30.720> fatal<00:03:31.850> to<00:03:32.850> raise<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.530> that

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
making death fatal to raise that that

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.010 
making death fatal to raise that that
sense<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:35.160> threat<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:35.970> sense<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.750> loss

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
sense of threat and that sense of loss

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.930 
sense of threat and that sense of loss
and<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.380> make<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.560> important<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.400> make<00:03:38.850> the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
and to make it important to make the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.190 
and to make it important to make the
decisions<00:03:39.360> important<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.810> keep<00:03:39.930> carriages

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
decisions important to keep carriages

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.180 
decisions important to keep carriages
alive<00:03:40.670> rather<00:03:41.670> than<00:03:42.770> learning<00:03:43.770> how<00:03:44.130> to

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
alive rather than learning how to

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.340 
alive rather than learning how to
survive<00:03:44.640> or<00:03:44.820> seeing<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.690> then<00:03:45.840> replaying<00:03:46.230> it

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
survive or seeing and then replaying it

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.690 
survive or seeing and then replaying it
and<00:03:46.470> replaying<00:03:46.770> it<00:03:46.890> until<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.280> can<00:03:47.400> survive

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
and replaying it until you can survive

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.280 
and replaying it until you can survive
it<00:03:47.880> obviously<00:03:48.300> none<00:03:48.480> till<00:03:48.660> dawn<00:03:48.840> when<00:03:49.170> your

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
it obviously none till dawn when your

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.170 
it obviously none till dawn when your
characters<00:03:49.590> dead<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:49.980> dead<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:50.850> story

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
characters dead the dead and the story

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.660 
characters dead the dead and the story
adapts<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.720> continues<00:03:52.230> without<00:03:52.320> them<00:03:52.710> so<00:03:53.010> one

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
adapts and continues without them so one

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.070 
adapts and continues without them so one
of<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.820> big<00:03:53.850> challenges<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.480> design<00:03:54.780> for<00:03:54.990> us

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
of the big challenges in design for us

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.720 
of the big challenges in design for us
was<00:03:55.260> how<00:03:55.350> do<00:03:55.410> we<00:03:55.590> do<00:03:55.740> that<00:03:55.770> still<00:03:56.520> give

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
was how do we do that still give

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.520 
was how do we do that still give
everybody<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.390> great<00:03:57.660> story<00:03:57.990> no<00:03:58.200> matter<00:03:58.230> how

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
everybody a great story no matter how

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.470 
everybody a great story no matter how
many<00:03:58.710> characters<00:03:59.130> live<00:03:59.400> or<00:03:59.550> survive<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.210> a

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
many characters live or survive and a

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.260 
many characters live or survive and a
great<00:04:00.780> nan<00:04:00.990> our<00:04:01.140> experience<00:04:01.830> so<00:04:02.070> pretty<00:04:02.910> huge

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
great nan our experience so pretty huge

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.330 
great nan our experience so pretty huge
design<00:04:03.570> challenges<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.260> but<00:04:04.440> we're

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
design challenges in that but we're

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.220 
design challenges in that but we're
thrilled<00:04:06.150> with<00:04:06.270> with<00:04:06.480> what<00:04:06.870> we've<00:04:07.020> come<00:04:07.140> out

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
thrilled with with what we've come out

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.350 
thrilled with with what we've come out
with<00:04:07.380> at<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.590> end<00:04:07.740> and<00:04:07.980> genuinely<00:04:08.970> people

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
with at the end and genuinely people

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.060 
with at the end and genuinely people
will<00:04:09.480> have<00:04:09.630> very<00:04:09.960> different<00:04:10.440> experiences

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
will have very different experiences

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.670 
will have very different experiences
very<00:04:11.460> different<00:04:11.850> stories<00:04:12.270> and<00:04:12.500> we<00:04:13.500> think

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
very different stories and we think

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.560 
very different stories and we think
they'll<00:04:14.100> all<00:04:14.220> be<00:04:14.340> great<00:04:14.520> stories<00:04:14.880> what<00:04:15.540> does

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
they'll all be great stories what does

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.950 
they'll all be great stories what does
that<00:04:15.690> open<00:04:15.930> up<00:04:16.110> for<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.350> replay<00:04:16.680> value<00:04:17.960> well

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960 
that open up for a replay value well

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.370 
that open up for a replay value well
yeah<00:04:19.350> i<00:04:19.410> think<00:04:20.330> there's<00:04:21.330> there's<00:04:22.080> two<00:04:22.230> things

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
yeah i think there's there's two things

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.600 
yeah i think there's there's two things
about<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:22.680> yet<00:04:23.010> there's<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.280> grip<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.580> i

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
about that yet there's a grip that i

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
about that yet there's a grip that i
will<00:04:23.820> say<00:04:23.970> there's<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.210> great<00:04:24.360> amount<00:04:24.540> of

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
will say there's a great amount of

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.420 
will say there's a great amount of
replay<00:04:24.930> value<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.860> other<00:04:25.890> thing<00:04:26.160> i<00:04:26.250> will<00:04:26.310> say

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
replay value the other thing i will say

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.310 
replay value the other thing i will say
though<00:04:26.730> is<00:04:26.760> once<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.510> know<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.840> story<00:04:28.110> and

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
though is once you know the story and

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.710 
though is once you know the story and
what's<00:04:28.440> really<00:04:28.710> going<00:04:29.010> on<00:04:29.130> then<00:04:29.850> playing<00:04:30.420> it<00:04:30.600> a

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
what's really going on then playing it a

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.390 
what's really going on then playing it a
second<00:04:31.110> time<00:04:31.140> will<00:04:31.590> be<00:04:31.710> a<00:04:31.740> very<00:04:31.950> different

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
second time will be a very different

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.800 
second time will be a very different
experience<00:04:32.520> because<00:04:33.060> you'll<00:04:33.360> have<00:04:33.390> knowledge

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
experience because you'll have knowledge

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.850 
experience because you'll have knowledge
that<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:34.050> didn't<00:04:34.290> have<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.470> first<00:04:34.650> time<00:04:34.830> that

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
that you didn't have the first time that

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.580 
that you didn't have the first time that
your<00:04:35.070> plate<00:04:35.250> and<00:04:35.720> put<00:04:36.720> sure<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.200> play<00:04:37.350> through

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
your plate and put sure to play through

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.470 
your plate and put sure to play through
it<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:37.800> try<00:04:37.980> and<00:04:38.100> get<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.250> different<00:04:38.940> result<00:04:39.210> a

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
it and try and get a different result a

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.360 
it and try and get a different result a
better<00:04:39.660> result<00:04:40.020> everyone<00:04:40.500> survived<00:04:40.860> or

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
better result everyone survived or

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.280 
better result everyone survived or
everyone<00:04:41.610> died<00:04:41.940> but<00:04:42.240> you're<00:04:42.870> trying<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.110> get

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
everyone died but you're trying to get

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.240 
everyone died but you're trying to get
yeah<00:04:44.100> this<00:04:44.220> great<00:04:44.460> replay<00:04:44.760> value<00:04:44.910> there
