00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
so far I'm excited about this bass I was

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.960 
so far I'm excited about this bass I was
asked<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.650> question<00:01:34.680> what<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.579> thought<00:01:35.820> about

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
asked a question what I thought about

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 
asked a question what I thought about
the<00:01:36.150> string<00:01:36.540> spacing<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.470> line<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.100> rid<00:01:38.310> of

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the string spacing on line and rid of

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.679 
the string spacing on line and rid of
the<00:01:38.460> straight<00:01:38.759> space<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.270> was<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.570> not

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the straight space it was really not

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.830 
the straight space it was really not
that<00:01:39.869> different<00:01:40.170> from<00:01:40.380> my<00:01:40.680> TRB<00:01:41.570> 1005<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> mean

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that different from my TRB 1005 I mean

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.120 
that different from my TRB 1005 I mean
it<00:01:42.930> made<00:01:43.079> me<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> little<00:01:43.530> bit<00:01:43.680> tighter<00:01:43.979> but

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
it made me a little bit tighter but

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
it made me a little bit tighter but
that's<00:01:44.790> not<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> whole<00:01:45.299> lot<00:01:45.509> at<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.020> it's

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
that's not a whole lot at all and it's

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.330 
that's not a whole lot at all and it's
not<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.560> much<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.890> difference<00:01:47.250> between

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
not that much of a difference between

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.149 
not that much of a difference between
