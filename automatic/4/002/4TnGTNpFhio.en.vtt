and<00:00:02.010> this<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.250> active<00:00:02.639> transport<00:00:03.110> now

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:04.910 
and this is active transport now

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.010 
and this is active transport now
before<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.000> understand<00:00:06.299> active<00:00:06.540> transport

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
before you understand active transport

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.900 
before you understand active transport
you<00:00:07.259> must<00:00:07.529> understand<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.340> principles<00:00:08.790> of

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
you must understand the principles of

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.110 
you must understand the principles of
diffusion<00:00:09.889> so<00:00:10.889> if<00:00:11.160> you're<00:00:11.309> not<00:00:11.460> sure<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:11.940> you

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
diffusion so if you're not sure that you

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.600 
diffusion so if you're not sure that you
need<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.450> check<00:00:12.809> up<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.370> make<00:00:14.370> sure<00:00:14.519> you

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
need to check up on it make sure you

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.029 
need to check up on it make sure you
clear<00:00:14.820> what's<00:00:15.030> happening<00:00:15.680> what<00:00:16.680> we've<00:00:16.830> got

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
clear what's happening what we've got

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.290 
clear what's happening what we've got
here<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:18.060> close-up<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:22.250> cell<00:00:23.250> membrane

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
here is a close-up of a cell membrane

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.790 
here is a close-up of a cell membrane
okay<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.359> if<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:24.900> were<00:00:24.960> just<00:00:25.140> looking<00:00:25.289> at<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
okay so if we were just looking at a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.279 
okay so if we were just looking at a
part<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.730> membrane<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.199> it

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
part of the membrane this is what it

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.250 
part of the membrane this is what it
might<00:00:28.439> look<00:00:28.619> like<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.099> our<00:00:29.250> green<00:00:29.990> bits<00:00:30.990> here

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
might look like so our green bits here

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.470 
might look like so our green bits here
represent<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.830> membrane<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.550> notice<00:00:33.270> that

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
represent the membrane and notice that

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.020 
represent the membrane and notice that
there<00:00:33.750> are<00:00:34.340> gaps<00:00:35.340> if<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:35.850> it's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
there are gaps if you like it's

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.119 
there are gaps if you like it's
permeable<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.899> will<00:00:37.020> let<00:00:37.290> some<00:00:37.620> substances

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
permeable it will let some substances

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.819 
permeable it will let some substances
through<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.520> somehow<00:00:38.820> small<00:00:39.180> substances<00:00:39.899> such

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
through so somehow small substances such

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.330 
through so somehow small substances such
things<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.540> oxygen<00:00:42.540> carbon<00:00:43.079> dioxide<00:00:43.340> are

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
things like oxygen carbon dioxide are

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.889 
things like oxygen carbon dioxide are
free<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.329> diffuse<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:47.030> however<00:00:48.030> if<00:00:48.719> we

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
free to diffuse in and out however if we

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.150 
free to diffuse in and out however if we
get<00:00:49.050> some<00:00:49.230> larger<00:00:49.649> substances<00:00:51.920> they<00:00:52.920> can't

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
get some larger substances they can't

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.660 
get some larger substances they can't
simply<00:00:53.460> pass<00:00:53.879> through<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.870> membrane<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
simply pass through the membrane and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.790 
simply pass through the membrane and
another<00:00:56.670> problem<00:00:57.000> we<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.390> if<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.320> wanted

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
another problem we have is if we wanted

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.729 
another problem we have is if we wanted
something<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.699> for<00:01:00.420> example<00:01:02.570> glucose<00:01:03.739> into

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
something like for example glucose into

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.149 
something like for example glucose into
our<00:01:04.799> cells<00:01:05.159> then<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.560> left<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.040> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
our cells then if we just left it to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.140 
our cells then if we just left it to
diffusion<00:01:09.140> we'd<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> problem<00:01:10.740> because

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
diffusion we'd have a problem because

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.399 
diffusion we'd have a problem because
glucose<00:01:12.150> would<00:01:12.330> diffuse<00:01:12.780> through<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.260> once

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
glucose would diffuse through but once

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.530 
glucose would diffuse through but once
it<00:01:13.590> reached<00:01:13.950> an<00:01:14.159> equal<00:01:14.640> concentration<00:01:15.479> on

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
it reached an equal concentration on

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.690 
it reached an equal concentration on
both<00:01:15.720> sides<00:01:16.049> outside<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> cell<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:16.979> inside

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
both sides outside the cell and inside

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.990 
both sides outside the cell and inside
the<00:01:17.909> cell<00:01:18.470> we<00:01:19.470> wouldn't<00:01:19.680> expect<00:01:19.890> diffusion<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the cell we wouldn't expect diffusion to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.960 
the cell we wouldn't expect diffusion to
be<00:01:21.530> working<00:01:22.530> or<00:01:22.740> selling<00:01:23.070> no<00:01:23.220> net<00:01:23.490> diffusion

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
be working or selling no net diffusion

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.340 
be working or selling no net diffusion
in<00:01:24.060> other<00:01:24.180> words<00:01:24.360> whatever<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.780> was<00:01:24.869> diffusing

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
in other words whatever it was diffusing

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.660 
in other words whatever it was diffusing
him<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.799> same<00:01:26.009> amount<00:01:26.130> would<00:01:26.340> also<00:01:26.520> be

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
him the same amount would also be

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850 
him the same amount would also be
diffusing<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.240> now<00:01:27.750> sometimes<00:01:28.290> cells<00:01:28.590> need

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
diffusing out now sometimes cells need

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.609 
diffusing out now sometimes cells need
to<00:01:28.890> build<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.610> concentration<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.470> is

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
to build up a concentration and this is

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.050 
to build up a concentration and this is
how<00:01:31.740> they're<00:01:31.920> doing<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.549> here's<00:01:32.729> our<00:01:32.820> cell

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
how they're doing so here's our cell

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.080 
how they're doing so here's our cell
membrane<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.689> structure<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:35.000> what<00:01:36.000> we

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
membrane this structure here is what we

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.390 
membrane this structure here is what we
call<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.750> carrier<00:01:37.729> protein<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.009> sits<00:01:41.250> in

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
call a carrier protein and it sits in

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.740 
call a carrier protein and it sits in
the<00:01:41.520> membrane<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.470> what<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.590> does<00:01:43.890> is

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
the membrane and what it does is

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.289 
the membrane and what it does is
molecules<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.899> glucose<00:01:46.850> they<00:01:47.850> move<00:01:48.119> into

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
molecules like glucose they move into

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.789 
molecules like glucose they move into
the<00:01:48.450> carrier<00:01:48.750> protein<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> carrier

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the carrier protein and the carrier

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.230 
the carrier protein and the carrier
protein<00:01:49.950> will<00:01:50.340> flip<00:01:50.610> its<00:01:50.820> shape<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:52.740> moves

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
protein will flip its shape and it moves

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.940 
protein will flip its shape and it moves
the<00:01:54.240> glucose<00:01:54.689> molecules<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.590> we'll<00:01:55.740> flip<00:01:55.890> a

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the glucose molecules in so we'll flip a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.139 
the glucose molecules in so we'll flip a
few<00:01:56.189> more<00:01:56.399> bits<00:01:56.579> through<00:01:57.020> here<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.140> go<00:01:58.850> now<00:01:59.850> at

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
few more bits through here we go now at

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.740 
few more bits through here we go now at
this<00:02:00.360> point<00:02:01.610> we<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.880> an<00:02:03.180> equal

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
this point we have an equal

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.580 
this point we have an equal
concentration<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.619> molecules<00:02:06.229> inside<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
concentration of molecules inside and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.540 
concentration of molecules inside and
outside<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.729> cell<00:02:09.410> however<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
outside of the cell however this is the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.900 
outside of the cell however this is the
good<00:02:11.910> bit<00:02:11.940> with<00:02:12.209> active<00:02:12.510> chance

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
good bit with active chance

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.370 
good bit with active chance
but<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.780> can<00:02:14.050> continue<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:16.450> transport<00:02:17.080> these

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
but it can continue to transport these

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.980 
but it can continue to transport these
molecules<00:02:18.100> through<00:02:18.570> even<00:02:19.570> though<00:02:19.720> there's<00:02:19.960> a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
molecules through even though there's a

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.750 
molecules through even though there's a
high<00:02:20.170> concentration<00:02:20.470> on<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.340> side<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
high concentration on this side the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.840

do this however three in order for this
to<00:02:39.490> work<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:40.620> need<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.800> presence<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.310> energy

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
to work you need the presence of energy

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.540 
to work you need the presence of energy
and<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:44.350> energy<00:02:44.380> comes<00:02:44.890> in<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.130> form<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.460> a

that fits into all of yourselves it's a
bit<00:02:56.770> more<00:02:56.920> complicated<00:02:57.310> at<00:02:57.670> what<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:57.880> can

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
bit more complicated at what you can

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.500 
bit more complicated at what you can
think<00:02:58.240> about<00:02:58.360> up<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.780> moment<00:02:58.960> so<00:02:59.260> ATP

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
think about up the moment so ATP

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.400 
think about up the moment so ATP
releases<00:03:01.510> its<00:03:01.630> energy<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:02.110> carrier

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
releases its energy to the carrier

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.440 
releases its energy to the carrier
protein<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.520> flips<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.910> molecule

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
protein and it flips the molecule

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.090 
protein and it flips the molecule
through<00:03:05.850> ATP<00:03:06.900> releases<00:03:07.900> energy<00:03:08.500> or<00:03:08.740> usable

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
through ATP releases energy or usable

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.100 
through ATP releases energy or usable
should<00:03:09.400> carry<00:03:09.700> protein<00:03:10.210> it<00:03:10.660> flips<00:03:11.020> the

should carry protein it flips the
molecule<00:03:11.590> through<00:03:12.240> so<00:03:13.240> ATP<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.740> different

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
molecule through so ATP is different

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.190

sorry<00:03:16.720> excuse<00:03:17.020> me

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
sorry excuse me

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.020 
sorry excuse me
exceptions<00:03:18.010> what<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.340> different<00:03:18.850> from

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
exceptions what is different from

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:28.550 
exceptions what is different from
diffusion<00:03:19.660> because<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.620> requires<00:03:21.070> energy<00:03:21.430> and

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.110 

it<00:03:29.560> can<00:03:29.860> move<00:03:30.070> molecules<00:03:32.940> against<00:03:33.940> the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
it can move molecules against the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:43.199 
it can move molecules against the
concentration<00:03:34.540> driven<00:03:41.520> but<00:03:42.520> it<00:03:42.640> does<00:03:42.910> require

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
concentration driven but it does require

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.479 
concentration driven but it does require
the<00:03:43.330> presence<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:44.050> these<00:03:44.440> carry<00:03:44.800> proteins<00:03:45.340> for

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
the presence of these carry proteins for

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.850 
the presence of these carry proteins for
