scaparelli<00:01:21.510> I<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.409> think<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.770> she<00:01:23.210> has

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
scaparelli I just think that she has

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.859 
scaparelli I just think that she has
such<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> whimsical<00:01:26.030> point<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.150> view<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.690> so

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
such a whimsical point of view and so

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.070 
such a whimsical point of view and so
avant-garde<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.770> she<00:01:29.009> seemed<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.840> very

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
avant-garde and she seemed to be very

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.340 
avant-garde and she seemed to be very
open<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:32.040> bringing<00:01:32.790> creative<00:01:33.390> ideas<00:01:33.930> together

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
open to bringing creative ideas together

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.560 
open to bringing creative ideas together
I<00:01:34.830> think<00:01:35.100> she<00:01:35.190> now<00:01:35.340> would<00:01:35.550> chew<00:01:36.149> me<00:01:36.300> up<00:01:36.330> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
I think she now would chew me up and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.040 
I think she now would chew me up and
spit<00:01:36.720> me<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:39.090> VNA<00:01:39.540> would<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.930> you
