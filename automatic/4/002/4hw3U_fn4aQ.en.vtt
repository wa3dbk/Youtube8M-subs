covering the shooting skill so this one
was<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> bit<00:00:15.210> tricky<00:00:15.450> compared<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> other

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
was a bit tricky compared to the other

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.019 
was a bit tricky compared to the other
ones<00:00:16.560> as<00:00:16.830> there's<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.460> many<00:00:17.520> different<00:00:17.880> ways

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
ones as there's so many different ways

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.560 
ones as there's so many different ways
and<00:00:18.300> kind<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.720> format<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.380> do<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.740> and

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
and kind of format you can do this and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.730 
and kind of format you can do this and
finding<00:00:21.570> like<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> really<00:00:22.080> good<00:00:22.260> or<00:00:22.410> at<00:00:22.500> least<00:00:22.529> a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
finding like a really good or at least a

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.019 
finding like a really good or at least a
really<00:00:22.890> efficient<00:00:23.369> method<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.699> doing<00:00:23.850> this

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
really efficient method of doing this

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.089 
really efficient method of doing this
was<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.080> be<00:00:25.170> really<00:00:25.410> honest<00:00:25.619> extremely

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
was I have to be really honest extremely

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.400 
was I have to be really honest extremely
hard<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.000> would<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.930> confirm<00:00:28.230> that

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
hard so I would like to confirm that

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.830 
hard so I would like to confirm that
today<00:00:28.769> may<00:00:29.099> not<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.550> best<00:00:29.730> method<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.750> it

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
today may not be the best method but it

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.330 
today may not be the best method but it
is<00:00:30.960> still<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> very<00:00:31.500> very<00:00:31.800> good<00:00:31.890> method<00:00:32.219> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
is still a very very good method and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.560 
is still a very very good method and
they<00:00:32.399> will<00:00:32.520> rank<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.850> your<00:00:33.000> shooting<00:00:33.300> very

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
they will rank of your shooting very

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.950 
they will rank of your shooting very
faster<00:00:33.989> that's<00:00:34.140> what<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.380> want<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.590> do<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.960> in

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
faster that's what you want to do and in

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.660 
faster that's what you want to do and in
yeah<00:00:37.170> that's<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.280> only<00:00:38.399> thing<00:00:38.579> I

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
yeah that's that but the only thing I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.639 
yeah that's that but the only thing I
would<00:00:38.730> say<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.270> if<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.540> are<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.899> level<00:00:40.170> 120

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
would say is if you are like level 120

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.560 
would say is if you are like level 120
because<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.219> think<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.550> need<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> be<00:00:41.879> level<00:00:42.149> 120

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
because I think you need to be level 120

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.200 
because I think you need to be level 120
to<00:00:43.320> buy<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.500> minigun<00:00:43.980> what<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.820> would<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.090> is

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
to buy the minigun what I would do is

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.610 
to buy the minigun what I would do is
buy<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:45.899> head<00:00:46.079> over<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
buy that and then head over to the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.709 
buy that and then head over to the
shooting<00:00:46.950> range<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:47.879> shoot<00:00:48.570> your

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
shooting range and then shoot your

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.029 
shooting range and then shoot your
minigun<00:00:49.020> there<00:00:49.230> cuz<00:00:49.440> apparently<00:00:49.890> that's

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
minigun there cuz apparently that's

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.740 
minigun there cuz apparently that's
meant<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.460> faster<00:00:50.940> that's<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.629> like

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
meant to be faster that's what we like

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.020 
meant to be faster that's what we like
the<00:00:51.840> fastest<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> game<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.030> obviously

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the fastest in the game but obviously

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.910 
the fastest in the game but obviously
I'm<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.329> 1120<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.320> guys<00:00:55.500> probably<00:00:55.739> aren't

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
I'm not 1120 you guys probably aren't

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.639 
I'm not 1120 you guys probably aren't
lever<00:00:56.100> 120<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.510> guess<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.230> could<00:00:58.379> call<00:00:58.530> this

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
lever 120 so I guess you could call this

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.260 
lever 120 so I guess you could call this
like<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> second<00:00:59.219> best<00:00:59.250> method<00:00:59.760> then<00:00:59.910> because

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
like the second best method then because

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
like the second best method then because
this<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.539> still<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> really<00:01:01.140> good<00:01:01.350> method<00:01:01.680> it's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
this is still a really good method it's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.529 
this is still a really good method it's
actually<00:01:02.160> lots<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.820> fun<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.120> well<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.420> also

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
actually lots of fun as well and also

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.080 
actually lots of fun as well and also
gets<00:01:03.840> your<00:01:03.899> stamina<00:01:04.229> up<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.619> lot<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.939> can't

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
gets your stamina up a lot so you can't

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820 
gets your stamina up a lot so you can't
go<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.450> two<00:01:06.570> skills<00:01:06.840> or<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.110> tier<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.530> yeah<00:01:07.799> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
go for two skills or one tier so yeah I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.710 
go for two skills or one tier so yeah I
would<00:01:08.100> recommend<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.670> way<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.479> yet

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
would recommend you this way but yet

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.050 
would recommend you this way but yet
again<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.200> are<00:01:10.229> 120<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.340> would<00:01:11.520> go<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
again if you are 120 then I would go and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.280 
again if you are 120 then I would go and
get<00:01:12.240> their<00:01:12.390> minigun<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.869> go<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.140> shooting

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
get their minigun and go to a shooting

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.140 
get their minigun and go to a shooting
range<00:01:13.380> right<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.909> is

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
range right so what you have to do is

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.060 
range right so what you have to do is
stop<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> survival<00:01:15.960> game<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.320> I'd<00:01:16.619> recommend

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
stop a survival game now I'd recommend

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.010 
stop a survival game now I'd recommend
you<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.250> host<00:01:17.460> your<00:01:17.610> own<00:01:17.670> game<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.720> can

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you to host your own game but you can

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.300 
you to host your own game but you can
play<00:01:19.229> with<00:01:19.439> other<00:01:19.590> people<00:01:19.979> doesn't<00:01:20.189> really

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
play with other people doesn't really

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
play with other people doesn't really
matter<00:01:20.520> either<00:01:20.670> way<00:01:20.930> in<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.080> game<00:01:22.140> players

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
matter either way in this game players

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.410 
matter either way in this game players
playing<00:01:22.740> by<00:01:22.890> myself<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.000> think<00:01:24.210> later

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
playing by myself and then I think later

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.370 
playing by myself and then I think later
on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> game<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.960> playing<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.290> another

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
on the game is playing with another

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.410 
on the game is playing with another
person<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.159> personally<00:01:27.060> find<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.240> better<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
person I personally find it better to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
person I personally find it better to
play<00:01:27.600> myself<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:28.320> obviously<00:01:29.040> there's

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
play myself because obviously there's

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.039 
play myself because obviously there's
more<00:01:29.460> enemies<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.909> kill<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.689> great<00:01:30.869> thing

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
more enemies to kill and the great thing

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.140 
more enemies to kill and the great thing
about<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.380> map<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.939> there's<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.030> much

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
about this map is that there's so much

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.609 
about this map is that there's so much
stuff<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.600> hide<00:01:33.869> behind<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.439> just

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
stuff you can hide behind so you just

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.260 
stuff you can hide behind so you just
keep<00:01:34.799> hunting<00:01:35.070> behind<00:01:35.400> stuff<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.880> then

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
keep hunting behind stuff and then

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.340 
keep hunting behind stuff and then
putting<00:01:36.479> your<00:01:36.659> gun<00:01:36.810> out<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.049> putting<00:01:37.259> your

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
putting your gun out or putting your

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.780 
putting your gun out or putting your
head<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:37.799> shooting<00:01:38.159> them<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.520> then

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
head out and then shooting them and then

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.399 
head out and then shooting them and then
go<00:01:38.909> back<00:01:39.090> behind<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:39.990> definitely<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
go back behind it so it's definitely the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.840 
go back behind it so it's definitely the
best<00:01:40.560> survival<00:01:41.040> map<00:01:41.189> compared<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.640> all<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
best survival map compared to all the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580 
best survival map compared to all the
other<00:01:41.970> ones<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.899> name<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.380> actual

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
other ones the name of this actual

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.810 
other ones the name of this actual
survival<00:01:43.920> map<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.280> believe<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.670> called

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
survival map I believe is called

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.030 
survival map I believe is called
industrial<00:01:45.180> plan<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.439> that's<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> map<00:01:46.860> you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
industrial plan so that's the map you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.710 
industrial plan so that's the map you
will<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.250> playing<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.729> now<00:01:48.180> I'd<00:01:48.299> recommend<00:01:48.659> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
will be playing on now I'd recommend you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.120 
will be playing on now I'd recommend you
to<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> lot<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.170> ammo<00:01:49.470> before<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.860> start

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
to get a lot of ammo before you start

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.770 
to get a lot of ammo before you start
doing<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.399> because<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.970> may<00:01:51.090> run<00:01:51.299> low<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.540> it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
doing this because you may run low on it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.179 
doing this because you may run low on it
and<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.290> think<00:01:52.619> they<00:01:52.680> give<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.890> some<00:01:53.070> ammo

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
and I do think they give you some ammo

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.399 
and I do think they give you some ammo
after<00:01:53.579> every<00:01:53.790> round<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.930> may<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.110> kind<00:01:55.380> of

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
after every round so that may be kind of

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.289 
after every round so that may be kind of
useful<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:56.040> think<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.549> do<00:01:56.700> need<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.909> pick<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.090> up

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
useful I think you do need to pick it up

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.490 
useful I think you do need to pick it up
it's<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.810> could<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.170> girl<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
it's like it I could have a girl on the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.319 
it's like it I could have a girl on the
floor<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.130> walk<00:01:59.310> over<00:01:59.520> it

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
floor if you just walk over it

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.030 
floor if you just walk over it
don't<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.049> ammo<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
don't get the ammo for it so but the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.109 
don't get the ammo for it so but the
other<00:02:02.159> requirement<00:02:02.520> for<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.030> be

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
other requirement for this is to be

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.300 
other requirement for this is to be
level<00:02:03.420> 15<00:02:03.930> obviously<00:02:04.560> most<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.070> guys<00:02:05.189> are

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
level 15 obviously most of you guys are

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.859 
level 15 obviously most of you guys are
gonna<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.490> level<00:02:05.729> 15<00:02:06.060> I'm<00:02:06.240> guessing<00:02:06.750> because

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
gonna be level 15 I'm guessing because

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.869 
gonna be level 15 I'm guessing because
that's<00:02:07.320> very<00:02:07.710> low<00:02:08.129> level<00:02:08.429> where<00:02:08.580> does<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.789> take

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
that's very low level where does it take

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.760 
that's very low level where does it take
long<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.179> get<00:02:09.270> there<00:02:09.390> at<00:02:09.509> all<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.319> also<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.739> Oh

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
long to get there at all and also the Oh

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.930 
long to get there at all and also the Oh
climb<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.160> needs<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.489> need<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.700> start

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
climb it needs that you need to start

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.649 
climb it needs that you need to start
want<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.180> traverse<00:02:12.420> missions<00:02:12.900> now

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
want to traverse missions now

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.119

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
at the very beginning I can actually get

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.399 
at the very beginning I can actually get
this<00:02:15.310> survival<00:02:15.610> map<00:02:15.970> because<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.750> hadn't
