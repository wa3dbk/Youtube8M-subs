that<00:00:00.179> to<00:00:00.450> this<00:00:00.599> point<00:00:01.100> so<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.550> is<00:00:02.610> like<00:00:03.120> I

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
that to this point so this is like I

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.630 
that to this point so this is like I
said<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.840> open<00:00:04.230> chamber<00:00:04.710> for<00:00:05.069> for<00:00:05.370> one

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
said the open chamber for for one

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.919 
said the open chamber for for one
casting<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.509> do<00:00:07.200> unshriven<00:00:08.480> here<00:00:09.480> all<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.840> way

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
casting I do unshriven here all the way

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.220 
casting I do unshriven here all the way
around<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> top<00:00:10.830> for<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.190> 202<00:00:11.670> valve<00:00:12.269> over

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
around to the top for the 202 valve over

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.340 
around to the top for the 202 valve over
here<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.740> don't<00:00:14.340> really<00:00:14.549> do<00:00:14.820> anything<00:00:15.139> this<00:00:16.139> is

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
here I don't really do anything this is

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.939 
here I don't really do anything this is
a<00:00:16.379> 1/6<00:00:17.010> over<00:00:17.220> valve<00:00:17.930> it<00:00:18.930> would<00:00:19.140> be<00:00:19.289> nice<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.800> go

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
a 1/6 over valve it would be nice to go

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.400 
a 1/6 over valve it would be nice to go
in<00:00:20.130> there<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.490> enshroud<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.420> I'm<00:00:22.020> going<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
in there to enshroud it but I'm going to

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.410 
in there to enshroud it but I'm going to
lose<00:00:22.650> more<00:00:23.010> than<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.250> gain<00:00:23.580> because<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.119> has

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
lose more than I gain because this has

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.830 
lose more than I gain because this has
probably<00:00:24.810> seventy<00:00:25.619> four<00:00:26.029> cc's<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.269> start<00:00:27.630> this

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
probably seventy four cc's to start this

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.750 
probably seventy four cc's to start this
right<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.289> probably<00:00:28.470> took<00:00:28.830> one<00:00:29.130> or<00:00:29.310> two<00:00:29.340> out

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
right here probably took one or two out

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.389 
right here probably took one or two out
so<00:00:30.720> I'm<00:00:30.779> probably<00:00:30.990> at<00:00:31.320> seventy<00:00:31.769> six<00:00:32.070> or<00:00:32.279> hell

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
so I'm probably at seventy six or hell

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.979 
so I'm probably at seventy six or hell
maybe<00:00:32.430> even<00:00:32.940> 77<00:00:33.750> cc's<00:00:35.000> it'd<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.270> nice<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.570> I

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
maybe even 77 cc's it'd be nice if I

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.250 
maybe even 77 cc's it'd be nice if I
could<00:00:37.020> mill<00:00:37.820> fifteen<00:00:38.820> thousands<00:00:39.540> off<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
could mill fifteen thousands off of the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.840 
could mill fifteen thousands off of the
head<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:42.320> if<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.440> could<00:00:43.620> mill<00:00:43.800> fifteen<00:00:44.340> off<00:00:44.579> of

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
head and if I could mill fifteen off of

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.630 
head and if I could mill fifteen off of
it<00:00:45.030> put<00:00:45.270> back<00:00:45.539> what<00:00:45.840> was<00:00:46.020> taken<00:00:46.050> out<00:00:46.680> he<00:00:47.370> did

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it put back what was taken out he did

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.880 
it put back what was taken out he did
get<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> two<00:00:48.210> by<00:00:48.420> four<00:00:48.450> leaf<00:00:48.870> piston<00:00:49.469> which<00:00:49.680> I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
get a two by four leaf piston which I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.760 
get a two by four leaf piston which I
picked<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.489> him<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:51.600> anyway<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.469> want<00:00:52.680> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
picked for him but anyway I just want to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.619 
picked for him but anyway I just want to
show<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.039> some<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.640> clip<00:00:53.879> parts<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.510> it

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
show you some of the clip parts of it

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.959 
show you some of the clip parts of it
also<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.320> intake<00:00:55.800> manifold<00:00:56.460> was<00:00:56.670> fully

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
also the intake manifold was fully

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.900 
also the intake manifold was fully
ported<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.750> went<00:00:58.590> over<00:00:58.980> two<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> half<00:00:59.730> to

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
ported I went over two and a half to

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.779 
ported I went over two and a half to
three<00:01:00.210> inches<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.840> inside<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.500> runners<00:01:01.859> so

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
three inches up inside the runners so

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.759 
three inches up inside the runners so
let<00:01:03.090> me<00:01:03.210> go<00:01:03.359> ahead<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.899> finish<00:01:04.080> where<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> was

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
let me go ahead and finish where I was

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.310 
let me go ahead and finish where I was

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
202 valve deal on the intake side I'd

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.920 
202 valve deal on the intake side I'd
like<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.580> see<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> hundred<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.450> seventy-five

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
like to see a hundred and seventy-five

like to see a hundred and seventy-five
CCS<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.250> runner<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.290> remember<00:01:22.290> by<00:01:22.650> going

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
CCS on the runner and remember by going

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.280 
CCS on the runner and remember by going
in<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.060> area<00:01:24.420> let's<00:01:25.049> get<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
in here on this area let's get a

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.140 
in here on this area let's get a
close-up<00:01:25.619> look<00:01:29.720> by<00:01:30.720> going<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.470> here<00:01:32.000> see<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
close-up look by going in here see it

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.359 
close-up look by going in here see it
was<00:01:33.390> almost<00:01:33.900> closed<00:01:34.290> when<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.950> stock

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
was almost closed when I do a stock

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.450 
was almost closed when I do a stock
comparison<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.930> meat<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.710> guy<00:01:37.950> almost

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
comparison the meat of this guy almost

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.760 
comparison the meat of this guy almost
touches<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.970> wall<00:01:39.180> by<00:01:39.420> opening<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.140> up<00:01:40.439> it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
touches the wall by opening this up it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.940 
touches the wall by opening this up it
is<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> release<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.540> lot<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.079> air<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
is going to release a lot of air for the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.399 
is going to release a lot of air for the
202<00:01:44.340> which<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.060> diameter<00:01:45.299> really<00:01:46.020> makes<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
202 which is a diameter really makes a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.109 
202 which is a diameter really makes a
difference<00:01:46.670> from<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.850> put

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
difference from here to here so to put

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.510 
difference from here to here so to put
that<00:01:51.329> big<00:01:51.570> valve<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.229> yields<00:01:52.710> benefits<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.430> if

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
that big valve in yields benefits but if

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.280 
that big valve in yields benefits but if
you<00:01:53.610> don't<00:01:53.820> go<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.509> chop<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:55.049> this

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
you don't go in here and chop all this

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.770 
you don't go in here and chop all this
stuff<00:01:55.619> out<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.369> area<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.030> open<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.479> up<00:01:57.570> to

breathe putting a 202 valve in he's
going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> help<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.170> because<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> 202<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.969> you
