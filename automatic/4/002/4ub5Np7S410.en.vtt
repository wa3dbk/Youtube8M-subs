00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 good day friends I've always wondered 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:11.490
 if the sun glasses have that 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.620
 protection v who claim to have the lenses 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.450
 they can be pirates they can only be 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.600
 originals but they claim to have a 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.760
 protection and how to find out if that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.230
 protection is real if our entities 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.289
 they have that web protection 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.340
 a very simple way is getting 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.809
 us some photochromic lenses of the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.879
 that darken with sunlight 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:43.470
 getting these lenses we are going to put 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.370
 one over the other the sun lens and 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:52.250
 above the lens chromatic photo 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.530
 to check if they have that protection 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.760
 v 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.760
 thus 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.630
 Now we are going towards the sun and we see that 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.390
 quickly these photochromic glasses 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.810
 begin to get dark and we will wait to see 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.200
 what happens with the part that has been left 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.170
 covered by the layers for the sun like 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.090
 we do not have a lens or meter this is a 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:27.700
 very easy way to check if they have 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.840
 that protection or see 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.930
 and here we have him 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.900
 the part that has been covered 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.620
 is clearer than the one that has 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.380
 been exposed directly to the sun 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.740
 being already peace if they have certain 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.450
 cloud protection I'm not too sure if 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.620
 be one hundred percent to have a 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.530
 greater certainty if it is necessary to apply 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.160
 a patch or meter that will give us a 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.800
 more accurate reading but this is a 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.430
 simple experiment very easy to 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.119
 perform with photochromic lenses and 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.080
 flames that stay 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.790
 monitor if they have that protection v 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.569
 I hope you liked him either of 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.000
 utility 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.000
 give him like and thank you for visiting
