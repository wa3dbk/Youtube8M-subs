plastic<00:01:43.860> brother<00:01:44.100> now<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> can't<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
plastic brother now I can't get this to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.770 
plastic brother now I can't get this to
line<00:01:46.350> up<00:01:46.560> perfectly<00:01:46.829> yet<00:01:47.430> because<00:01:47.790> anyhow

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
line up perfectly yet because anyhow

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.810 
line up perfectly yet because anyhow
we're<00:01:49.079> moving<00:01:49.350> forward<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.310> terminals

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
we're moving forward so the terminals

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.840 
we're moving forward so the terminals
here<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.119> these<00:01:51.270> little<00:01:51.360> round-headed<00:01:51.810> ones

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
here have these little round-headed ones

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.090 
here have these little round-headed ones
that's<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.329> all<00:01:54.540> right<00:01:54.659> all<00:01:55.649> these<00:01:55.890> is

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that's going in all right all these is

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.770 
that's going in all right all these is
obviously<00:01:56.670> snap<00:01:56.939> together<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.420> goes<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
obviously snap together this goes on the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.459 
obviously snap together this goes on the
little<00:01:57.899> metal<00:01:58.140> tank<00:01:58.530> back<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.229> won't

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
little metal tank back here so it won't

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.560 
little metal tank back here so it won't
start<00:02:01.860> because<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.579> new<00:02:02.850> battery<00:02:03.329> is

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
start because that new battery is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.569 
start because that new battery is
probably<00:02:04.259> dead<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.950> I'm<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.159> take<00:02:05.369> this

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
probably dead so I'm going to take this

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.150 
probably dead so I'm going to take this
downtown<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> dealership<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.009> that

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
downtown to a dealership and have that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.390 
downtown to a dealership and have that
high<00:02:08.340> voltage<00:02:08.819> battery<00:02:09.060> charged<00:02:10.310> that'll<00:02:11.310> be

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
high voltage battery charged that'll be

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.230 
high voltage battery charged that'll be
a<00:02:11.430> separate

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240
