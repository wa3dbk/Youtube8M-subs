00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
ahead and skip it and go to the computer

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.280

so I'm gonna place down the computer

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.260 
so I'm gonna place down the computer
also<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.310> haven't<00:03:49.550> figured<00:03:49.940> out<00:03:50.030> how<00:03:50.209> the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
also I haven't figured out how the

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.540 
also I haven't figured out how the
computer<00:03:50.720> works<00:03:50.750> as<00:03:51.260> well<00:03:51.560> because<00:03:51.950> I'm<00:03:52.430> not

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
computer works as well because I'm not

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.610 
computer works as well because I'm not
sure<00:03:52.850> which<00:03:53.000> is<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.180> front<00:03:53.510> slide<00:03:53.720> I'm<00:03:54.470> gonna

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
sure which is a front slide I'm gonna

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.990 
sure which is a front slide I'm gonna
take<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:54.890> gas<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:55.220> say<00:03:55.400> this<00:03:55.580> is<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.730> front

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
take the gas and say this is a front

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.180 
take the gas and say this is a front
side<00:03:56.260> nothing<00:03:57.260> happens<00:03:57.560> when<00:03:57.680> you<00:03:57.770> tap<00:03:57.950> on<00:03:58.070> it

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
side nothing happens when you tap on it

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.430 
side nothing happens when you tap on it
so<00:03:58.489> it's<00:03:58.640> it's<00:03:58.760> not<00:03:58.820> really<00:03:59.180> working<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.780> fully

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
so it's it's not really working a fully

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.780 
so it's it's not really working a fully
working<00:04:00.830> computer<00:04:01.190> if<00:04:01.280> you<00:04:01.370> know<00:04:01.459> what<00:04:01.580> I<00:04:01.640> mean

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
working computer if you know what I mean

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.180 
working computer if you know what I mean
