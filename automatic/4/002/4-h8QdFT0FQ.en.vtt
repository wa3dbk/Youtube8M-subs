00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:08.830 

old<00:00:07.309> shark<00:00:07.609> cages<00:00:07.970> should<00:00:08.149> move<00:00:08.330> why<00:00:08.599> sit

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
old shark cages should move why sit

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.449 
old shark cages should move why sit
around<00:00:09.049> and<00:00:09.260> what<00:00:09.379> sharks<00:00:09.679> as<00:00:09.889> they<00:00:10.010> swing<00:00:10.280> by

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:10.459 
around and what sharks as they swing by

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.100 
around and what sharks as they swing by
I<00:00:10.730> want<00:00:10.879> to<00:00:10.969> follow<00:00:11.150> them<00:00:11.330> around<00:00:11.450> interact

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
I want to follow them around interact

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.349 
I want to follow them around interact
and<00:00:12.349> this<00:00:12.650> being<00:00:12.860> shark<00:00:13.190> week<00:00:13.430> what<00:00:14.150> better

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:14.359 
and this being shark week what better

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:15.670 
and this being shark week what better
way<00:00:14.570> to<00:00:14.600> do<00:00:14.869> it<00:00:14.959> that's<00:00:15.109> put<00:00:15.320> a<00:00:15.350> beetle

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
way to do it that's put a beetle

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.590 
way to do it that's put a beetle
underwater<00:00:16.219> interact<00:00:16.910> with<00:00:17.119> sharks<00:00:17.449> and

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
underwater interact with sharks and

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.759 
underwater interact with sharks and
maybe<00:00:17.869> do<00:00:18.019> something<00:00:18.230> a<00:00:18.380> little<00:00:18.410> bit

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:18.769 
maybe do something a little bit

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.830 
maybe do something a little bit
different<00:00:19.220> as<00:00:19.310> well<00:00:19.490> like<00:00:19.789> an<00:00:20.150> inbuilt<00:00:20.600> our

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
different as well like an inbuilt our

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.179 
different as well like an inbuilt our
system<00:00:21.260> and<00:00:21.320> actually<00:00:21.619> being<00:00:21.740> out<00:00:21.890> to<00:00:21.980> drive

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
system and actually being out to drive

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.400 
system and actually being out to drive
it<00:00:22.340> around<00:00:22.400> like<00:00:22.730> a<00:00:22.789> driver<00:00:23.180> underwater<00:00:26.410> one

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
it around like a driver underwater one

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.480 
it around like a driver underwater one
of<00:00:27.500> the<00:00:27.560> interesting<00:00:27.650> things<00:00:28.130> about<00:00:28.220> the

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
of the interesting things about the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.160 
of the interesting things about the
affiliation<00:00:29.119> is<00:00:29.300> that<00:00:29.510> we<00:00:29.900> have<00:00:29.990> a<00:00:30.050> very

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
affiliation is that we have a very

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.420 
affiliation is that we have a very
iconic<00:00:30.320> shape<00:00:30.800> with<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.010> shape<00:00:31.279> of<00:00:31.400> the

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
iconic shape with the shape of the

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.099 
iconic shape with the shape of the
beetle<00:00:31.789> and<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:31.970> Sharks<00:00:32.599> in<00:00:32.719> is<00:00:32.840> a<00:00:32.870> very

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:33.109 
beetle and the Sharks in is a very

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.990 
beetle and the Sharks in is a very
iconic<00:00:33.230> shape<00:00:33.739> and<00:00:33.949> so<00:00:34.100> in<00:00:34.340> this<00:00:34.520> integration

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
iconic shape and so in this integration

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.729 
iconic shape and so in this integration
we<00:00:35.539> have<00:00:35.629> the<00:00:35.719> opportunity<00:00:36.289> for<00:00:36.440> both<00:00:36.559> of

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
we have the opportunity for both of

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.860 
we have the opportunity for both of
those<00:00:36.829> images<00:00:37.129> together<00:00:37.510> we<00:00:38.510> took<00:00:38.690> the

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
those images together we took the

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.200 
those images together we took the
Volkswagen<00:00:39.440> Beetle<00:00:39.769> turned<00:00:40.429> it<00:00:40.579> into<00:00:40.729> a<00:00:40.879> shark

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
Volkswagen Beetle turned it into a shark

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.029 
Volkswagen Beetle turned it into a shark
cage<00:00:41.359> but<00:00:41.569> it's<00:00:41.719> got<00:00:41.870> thrusters<00:00:42.589> and<00:00:42.829> wheels

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
cage but it's got thrusters and wheels

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:44.889 
cage but it's got thrusters and wheels
and<00:00:43.339> it<00:00:43.399> rolls<00:00:43.579> along<00:00:43.789> and<00:00:44.239> can<00:00:44.600> actually

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
and it rolls along and can actually

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.209 
and it rolls along and can actually
interact<00:00:45.109> with<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.440> sharks<00:00:45.769> so<00:00:45.949> I<00:00:46.010> really

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
interact with the sharks so I really

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.279 
interact with the sharks so I really
wanted<00:00:46.429> to<00:00:46.489> create<00:00:46.909> a<00:00:47.179> really<00:00:47.629> iconic<00:00:47.749> piece

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
wanted to create a really iconic piece

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.259 
wanted to create a really iconic piece
of<00:00:48.469> represented<00:00:48.979> Volkswagen<00:00:49.670> as<00:00:49.850> well<00:00:50.120> as

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
of represented Volkswagen as well as

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.180 
of represented Volkswagen as well as
shark<00:00:50.539> we<00:00:50.719> our<00:00:50.899> designers<00:00:51.319> were<00:00:51.559> involved<00:00:52.069> and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
shark we our designers were involved and

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.009 
shark we our designers were involved and
helped<00:00:52.399> advise<00:00:52.729> in<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.210> construction<00:00:53.659> of<00:00:53.899> the

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
helped advise in the construction of the

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.049 
helped advise in the construction of the
vehicle<00:00:54.469> so<00:00:54.949> that<00:00:54.979> it<00:00:55.159> was<00:00:55.249> really<00:00:55.519> true<00:00:55.850> to

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
vehicle so that it was really true to

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.000 
vehicle so that it was really true to
the<00:00:56.179> actual<00:00:56.510> production<00:00:56.719> vehicle<00:00:57.319> itself<00:00:57.649> we

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
the actual production vehicle itself we

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.649 
the actual production vehicle itself we
built<00:00:58.249> it<00:00:58.339> from<00:00:58.399> the<00:00:58.489> ground<00:00:58.549> up<00:00:58.879> we<00:00:59.269> had<00:00:59.449> the

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
built it from the ground up we had the

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.139 
built it from the ground up we had the
volkswagen<00:01:00.199> beetle<00:01:00.440> turbo<00:01:00.679> to<00:01:01.579> model<00:01:01.879> offers

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
volkswagen beetle turbo to model offers

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.149 
volkswagen beetle turbo to model offers
and<00:01:02.329> that<00:01:03.170> was<00:01:03.289> about<00:01:03.379> it<00:01:03.499> so<00:01:03.829> we<00:01:03.920> SAT<00:01:04.129> there

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
and that was about it so we SAT there

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.370 
and that was about it so we SAT there
literally<00:01:04.670> with<00:01:04.940> tape<00:01:05.150> measures<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.840> paper

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
literally with tape measures and paper

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.830 
literally with tape measures and paper
diagrams<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.220> just<00:01:07.940> bent<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.360> whole<00:01:08.570> thing

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
diagrams and just bent the whole thing

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.750 
diagrams and just bent the whole thing
around<00:01:08.930> in<00:01:09.260> there<00:01:09.440> and<00:01:09.830> this<00:01:10.340> is<00:01:10.400> what<00:01:10.520> you<00:01:10.610> see

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
around in there and this is what you see

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.040 
around in there and this is what you see
I<00:01:10.790> think<00:01:11.000> it's<00:01:11.180> about<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.330> quarter<00:01:11.720> inch<00:01:11.750> off

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
I think it's about a quarter inch off

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.100 
I think it's about a quarter inch off
but<00:01:12.410> otherwise<00:01:12.590> it's<00:01:12.860> perfect

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
but otherwise it's perfect

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.930 
but otherwise it's perfect
you

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
you

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.600 
you
the<00:01:17.300> beetle<00:01:17.720> shark<00:01:18.110> cage<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:19.160> it<00:01:19.250> brings<00:01:19.460> the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
the beetle shark cage and it brings the

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.520 
the beetle shark cage and it brings the
real<00:01:19.940> winner<00:01:20.300> in<00:01:20.480> this<00:01:20.600> whole<00:01:20.810> situation<00:01:21.380> is

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
real winner in this whole situation is

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.650 
real winner in this whole situation is
the<00:01:21.800> viewer<00:01:22.040> because<00:01:22.580> they<00:01:23.240> get<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.510> go<00:01:23.630> on

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
the viewer because they get to go on

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.110 
the viewer because they get to go on
that<00:01:23.780> ride<00:01:24.140> in<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.920> beetle<00:01:25.250> on<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.820> ocean

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
that ride in the beetle on the ocean

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.940 
that ride in the beetle on the ocean
floor<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:26.660> get<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.840> check<00:01:27.140> out<00:01:27.320> there's<00:01:27.770> the

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
floor and get to check out there's the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.950 
floor and get to check out there's the
Sharks<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.460> ride<00:01:28.640> shotgun<00:01:28.940> with<00:01:29.150> us<00:01:29.420> I<00:01:29.630> think

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
Sharks and ride shotgun with us I think

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
Sharks and ride shotgun with us I think
we<00:01:30.020> have<00:01:30.050> a<00:01:30.140> great<00:01:30.260> relationship<00:01:30.440> and

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
we have a great relationship and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.500 
we have a great relationship and
discovery<00:01:31.400> channel<00:01:31.760> and<00:01:31.940> we're<00:01:32.150> very<00:01:32.180> proud

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
discovery channel and we're very proud

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.420 
discovery channel and we're very proud
to<00:01:32.570> be<00:01:32.690> associated<00:01:33.200> with<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.040> certainly

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
to be associated with it and certainly

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.670 
to be associated with it and certainly
the<00:01:34.700> fit<00:01:34.910> with<00:01:35.030> beetle<00:01:35.330> is<00:01:35.450> incredibly<00:01:35.990> strong

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.770 

you<00:01:39.130> know<00:01:39.220> shark<00:01:39.550> cages<00:01:39.940> they<00:01:40.360> aren't<00:01:40.660> all

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
you know shark cages they aren't all
