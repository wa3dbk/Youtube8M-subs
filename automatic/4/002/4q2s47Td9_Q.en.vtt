worse<00:00:57.230> well<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.949> didn't<00:00:59.250> expect<00:00:59.640> this

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
worse well I really didn't expect this

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.340 
worse well I really didn't expect this
but<00:01:00.300> about<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> year<00:01:01.320> into<00:01:02.449> well<00:01:03.449> less<00:01:04.080> than<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
but about a year into well less than a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.690 
but about a year into well less than a
year<00:01:04.530> into<00:01:04.680> my<00:01:04.890> vegan<00:01:05.159> diet

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
year into my vegan diet

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.880 
year into my vegan diet
I<00:01:05.850> suddenly<00:01:06.479> realized<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.260> don't<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.590> lower

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
I suddenly realized I don't have lower

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.460 
I suddenly realized I don't have lower
back<00:01:08.159> pain<00:01:08.430> anymore<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.570> had<00:01:09.720> been<00:01:09.869> sort<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
back pain anymore it had been sort of a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.050 
back pain anymore it had been sort of a
gradual<00:01:10.979> thing<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.549> guess<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
gradual thing and I guess in the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.440 
gradual thing and I guess in the
beginning<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.540> thought<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.869> was<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> fluke<00:01:13.409> but

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
beginning I thought it was a fluke but

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.350 
beginning I thought it was a fluke but
now<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.380> absolutely<00:01:16.590> no<00:01:17.220> lower<00:01:17.790> back<00:01:18.060> pain

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
now I have absolutely no lower back pain

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.780 
now I have absolutely no lower back pain
and<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:19.140> was<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> point<00:01:20.009> where<00:01:20.250> when<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> get

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.399 
and I was to the point where when I get
up<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> mornings<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.689> did<00:01:21.900> us<00:01:22.080> definitely

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400 
the basic cause of degenerative disc
disease<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:09.000> lack<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.479> blood<00:02:09.869> flow<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.289> that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
disease is lack of blood flow in that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.020 
disease is lack of blood flow in that
area<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.739> as<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.009> get<00:02:11.160> older<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.910> our

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
area and as we get older and our

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.809 
area and as we get older and our
arteries<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:14.069> guess<00:02:15.069> our<00:02:15.190> arteries<00:02:15.670> are

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
arteries and I guess our arteries are

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.390 
arteries and I guess our arteries are
more<00:02:16.030> restricted<00:02:16.660> we'd<00:02:16.900> get<00:02:17.200> less<00:02:17.440> blood<00:02:18.130> to

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
more restricted we'd get less blood to

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.390 
more restricted we'd get less blood to
that<00:02:18.550> area<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.680> now<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.890> I've<00:02:21.010> been<00:02:21.040> on<00:02:21.250> a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
that area and now that I've been on a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.430 
that area and now that I've been on a
vegan<00:02:21.580> diet<00:02:21.940> for<00:02:22.060> thirteen<00:02:22.630> months<00:02:22.660> I've<00:02:23.230> had

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
vegan diet for thirteen months I've had

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.100 
vegan diet for thirteen months I've had
some<00:02:23.740> pretty<00:02:24.459> amazing<00:02:24.760> results<00:02:25.690> with<00:02:25.840> my

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
some pretty amazing results with my

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.580 
some pretty amazing results with my
other<00:02:26.980> other<00:02:27.490> aspects<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.209> my<00:02:28.360> health<00:02:28.630> maybe

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
other other aspects of my health maybe

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.610 
other other aspects of my health maybe
it<00:02:29.770> carried<00:02:30.100> over<00:02:30.250> into<00:02:30.520> this<00:02:30.730> too<00:02:31.350> whether<00:02:32.350> it

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
it carried over into this too whether it

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.150 
it carried over into this too whether it
was<00:02:32.890> losing<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.000> weight<00:02:34.300> or<00:02:35.110> better<00:02:35.920> blood

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
was losing the weight or better blood

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.090 
was losing the weight or better blood
flow<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:37.420> thing<00:02:37.600> I<00:02:37.690> do<00:02:37.750> know<00:02:37.989> for<00:02:38.200> sure<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.890> was

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
flow one thing I do know for sure it was

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.630 
flow one thing I do know for sure it was
my<00:02:39.280> vegan<00:02:39.459> diet<00:02:39.880> because<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.569> would<00:02:41.080> not<00:02:41.640> have

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
my vegan diet because I would not have

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.190 
my vegan diet because I would not have
lost<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.180> weight<00:02:43.360> ordinary<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.050> better

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
lost the weight ordinary the better

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.280 
lost the weight ordinary the better
blood<00:02:44.440> flow<00:02:44.610> without<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:46.720> do<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:46.930> think<00:02:47.019> a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
blood flow without it so do I think a

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.960 
blood flow without it so do I think a
vegan<00:02:47.500> diet<00:02:47.830> will<00:02:48.100> cure<00:02:48.340> everything<00:02:50.970> I'm

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
vegan diet will cure everything I'm

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.170 
vegan diet will cure everything I'm
beginning<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.600> wonder<00:02:52.810> about<00:02:53.050> that

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
beginning to wonder about that

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.420 
beginning to wonder about that
so<00:02:55.180> until<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.600> next<00:02:55.660> time<00:02:55.930> thanks<00:02:56.430> for

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430
