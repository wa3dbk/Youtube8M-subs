00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
know that you're most probably going to

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.090 
know that you're most probably going to
need<00:00:43.059> an<00:00:43.269> attachment<00:00:43.629> so<00:00:44.170> it's<00:00:44.829> those<00:00:45.070> things

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
need an attachment so it's those things

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.619 
need an attachment so it's those things
that<00:00:45.460> when<00:00:45.730> they<00:00:45.850> come<00:00:46.030> back<00:00:46.059> and<00:00:46.329> ask<00:00:46.420> for

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
that when they come back and ask for

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:47.819 
that when they come back and ask for
more<00:00:46.719> information<00:00:46.780> it<00:00:47.320> lengthens<00:00:47.739> the

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
more information it lengthens the

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.649 
more information it lengthens the
revenue<00:00:48.309> cycle<00:00:48.550> so<00:00:49.030> make<00:00:49.360> sure<00:00:49.390> you're

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
revenue cycle so make sure you're

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.000 
revenue cycle so make sure you're
sending<00:00:49.989> out<00:00:50.110> all<00:00:50.229> that<00:00:50.379> information<00:00:50.620> ahead

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
sending out all that information ahead

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.399 
sending out all that information ahead
of<00:00:51.190> time<00:00:51.309> now<00:00:52.089> the<00:00:52.149> second<00:00:52.659> thing<00:00:52.690> that<00:00:52.839> idea

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
of time now the second thing that idea

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:54.990 
of time now the second thing that idea
is<00:00:53.649> that<00:00:53.680> they're<00:00:54.190> getting<00:00:54.339> they're<00:00:54.670> asking

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
is that they're getting they're asking

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.819 
is that they're getting they're asking
for<00:00:55.180> more<00:00:55.300> information<00:00:55.870> back<00:00:56.079> from<00:00:56.470> the

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
for more information back from the

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.850 
for more information back from the
obvious<00:00:57.010> because<00:00:57.339> data<00:00:57.729> fields<00:00:58.120> are<00:00:58.269> missing

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
obvious because data fields are missing

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.340 
obvious because data fields are missing
so<00:00:58.950> it<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.540> starts<00:01:00.930> from<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.170> beginning

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
so it really starts from the beginning

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.080 
so it really starts from the beginning
when<00:01:01.740> the<00:01:01.830> patient<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.280> checked<00:01:02.580> in<00:01:02.730> make<00:01:03.060> sure

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
when the patient is checked in make sure

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.880 
when the patient is checked in make sure
that<00:01:03.360> you<00:01:03.480> fill<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.990> date<00:01:04.230> of<00:01:04.260> birth<00:01:04.530> make

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that you fill in that date of birth make

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.140 
that you fill in that date of birth make
