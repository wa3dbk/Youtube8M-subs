00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
reaction to this clan shop was kind of

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.550 
reaction to this clan shop was kind of
negative<00:00:27.180> i<00:00:27.390> thought<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.660> was<00:00:27.750> kind<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.349> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
negative i thought it was kind of like a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.620 
negative i thought it was kind of like a
filler<00:00:29.070> clan<00:00:29.369> shop<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.210> then<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.359> thought<00:00:30.420> hey

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
filler clan shop but then I thought hey

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.799 
filler clan shop but then I thought hey
maybe<00:00:30.869> say<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:31.949> attached<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.460> ground<00:00:32.910> imprint

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
maybe say we attached a ground imprint

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.410 
maybe say we attached a ground imprint
to<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> guard<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.520> gets<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> ground<00:00:35.940> by<00:00:36.120> type

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
to a guard so it gets the ground by type

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.610 
to a guard so it gets the ground by type
maybe<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.840> can<00:00:36.989> teach<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.380> ground

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
maybe we can teach it to ground

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.010 
maybe we can teach it to ground
