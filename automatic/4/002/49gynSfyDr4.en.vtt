00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
stick it in the slot like this I can get

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.560 
stick it in the slot like this I can get
it<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:25.920> there<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.700> doesn't<00:02:27.030> come<00:02:27.210> back<00:02:27.240> out

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
it in there it doesn't come back out

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.560 
it in there it doesn't come back out
because<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.020> top<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.560> shoe<00:02:28.910> clings<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.120> so

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
because the top of the shoe clings it so

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.820 
because the top of the shoe clings it so
it<00:02:30.660> doesn't<00:02:30.900> come<00:02:31.050> out<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.350> that's<00:02:31.410> on<00:02:31.650> both
