00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:10.440
 what's really only not only 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.730
 Roche scored chewing gum his colleagues 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.730
 are here with maintenance 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:21.179
 In any case , here are the ones 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:26.189
 list by , for example, here at most 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:29.099
 Pieces of the kings have 950 calories 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.769
 that would be a long time so jump 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.489
 just eaten ethically artist 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.399
 but then I come to my kolorit 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.899
 very quickly one day need to I can 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.489
 later quite well I think about it like 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.510
 dear arms volume blouses 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.969
 oatmeal or English things the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.559
 so really has a two fill 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.620
 We do not make cheeseburgers 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.480
 town after an hour again hunger yes 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.190
 and that's finally going to start 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.609
 The people always opening will not 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.829
 Fed up 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.220
 so for example here the matter only for 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.610
 has over 800 calories with max vinegar 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.700
 many people you know 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.500
 make your mathematics superscheld 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.900
 calculate what must come in synonymous 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.430
 of course, yes, and if you go too 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.960
 a lot of sleep then it does not just burn 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.690
 here but including twice 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.570
 I plan to tell this weight 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.910
 you went around a few things 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.290
 found out 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.230
 a thing I recommend you ill 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.410
 was well on the way or festival 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.860
 People wanted to eat here, for example 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:41.550
 and now the thing again 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:50.400
 send classic he only has three grams 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:51.930
 fat and protein carbohydrates and only 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.210
 300 calories approx 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.950
 therefore an optimal solution if you 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.710
 So here you are when I meet here 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.400
 then I say it's wise with two 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.710
 then also full of the dingers order 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.600
 and you are happy to know as well 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.840
 let people know about you through wild 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.840
 then
