the<00:01:10.659> work<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.070> actually<00:01:12.070> place<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.340> work<00:01:12.700> in

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
the work and actually place the work in

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.180 
the work and actually place the work in
the<00:01:13.390> whole<00:01:13.570> artist<00:01:13.960> of<00:01:14.140> where<00:01:14.860> did<00:01:15.070> that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
the whole artist of where did that

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.730 
the whole artist of where did that
painting<00:01:15.490> come<00:01:15.880> from<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:16.360> when<00:01:17.050> we<00:01:17.230> have<00:01:17.260> a

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
painting come from and when we have a

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.940 
painting come from and when we have a
lot<00:01:18.070> of<00:01:18.100> these<00:01:18.360> micro<00:01:19.530> analytical<00:01:20.530> techniques

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
lot of these micro analytical techniques

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.480 
lot of these micro analytical techniques
compiled<00:01:21.430> on<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.960> artist<00:01:23.350> we<00:01:23.860> can<00:01:24.040> actually

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
compiled on one artist we can actually

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.220 
compiled on one artist we can actually
create<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:24.760> compendium<00:01:25.360> of<00:01:25.600> all<00:01:25.960> their

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
create a compendium of all their

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.980 
create a compendium of all their
materials<00:01:27.160> techniques<00:01:27.790> as<00:01:28.060> well<00:01:28.390> as<00:01:28.690> their

materials techniques as well as their

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.780 
materials techniques as well as their
the<00:01:29.290> paint's<00:01:29.650> that<00:01:29.800> they<00:01:29.920> use<00:01:30.220> from<00:01:30.760> the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
the paint's that they use from the

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.330 
the paint's that they use from the
palettes<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.570> we<00:01:31.960> can<00:01:32.080> place<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.500> exactly<00:01:33.040> in

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
palettes and we can place it exactly in

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.480 
palettes and we can place it exactly in
that<00:01:33.400> in<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.390> specific<00:01:35.020> time<00:01:35.260> frame<00:01:35.620> in<00:01:36.400> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the red that he used was dry process

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.100 
the red that he used was dry process
cinnabar<00:01:50.350> also<00:01:50.680> known<00:01:50.830> as<00:01:50.950> four<00:01:51.159> million<00:01:51.520> and

cinnabar also known as four million and
that<00:01:53.110> was<00:01:53.260> wonderful<00:01:53.830> news<00:01:54.190> we<00:01:54.460> knew<00:01:54.610> then<00:01:54.820> it

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
that was wonderful news we knew then it

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.910 
that was wonderful news we knew then it
wasn't<00:01:55.180> cadmium<00:01:55.930> red<00:01:56.050> because<00:01:56.560> if<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.800> was

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
wasn't cadmium red because if it was

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.980 
wasn't cadmium red because if it was
Academy<00:01:57.400> in<00:01:57.460> red<00:01:57.670> we'd<00:01:58.360> be<00:01:58.480> in<00:01:58.570> trouble<00:01:58.600> with

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
Academy in red we'd be in trouble with
