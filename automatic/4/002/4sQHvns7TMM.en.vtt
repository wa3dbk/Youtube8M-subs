 product of this new product al numan 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:16.190
 it's the model 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:20.330
 from usb this model is the most power of 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:24.410
 of neumarkt as we see that it started 15 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.050
 kilos easy has nothing to envy 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.349
 to 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.410
 his technical successor in 200 we already have 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.769
 here that is old and old 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.710
 because this really 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:42.540
 this paints the product much better 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.570
 comes with a with a flat arm 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:51.030
 and bring as accessories already line 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.370
 while the one where it is here 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.100
 here with we have 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.620
 second good we have usb cable 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.690
 with software and tasting manual for 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.690
 be able to connect to the computer 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.369
 directly clean and control the 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.369
 computer trays warranty 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.930
 audio cable 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.490
 and the power cable that is connected 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.010
 of very good quality very good quality 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.409
 It brings a porta a capsule door 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.100
 numbers 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.100
 the adapter 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.580
 the emerging object that connects 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.740
 directly here on it 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.540
 as a tab you want the truth that they are 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.490
 very practical and others and here we have the 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.560
 counterweight that goes that goes here I'm not going to 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.320
 take out because because the brief 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.980
 only for the demonstration is a 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.980
 new product 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.870
 on the inside side when demonstrating the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.270
 curved arm that I know was used in 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.209
 training a 200 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.390
 the accessories with these seniors and everything 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.410
 the weight says additional but also 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.840
 poison 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.510
 really here we have a product 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.280
 excellent quality 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:27.209
 It's a tray I'm going to pay for it 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.130
 of direct transmission home with the 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.380
 dish that comes in fact separated 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.070
 and the dish the good that brings a 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.580
 centering of plate that does not bring it 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.819
 technique 200 has a switch of 33 45 and 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:48.450
 can 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:52.530
 you can get the audio for usb by rsa and 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.880
 in rca you can take it out 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.880
 directly by 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:07.650
 that's why I leave the camera I have only two 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.650
 hands in rsa you can leave it for audio or 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.659
 let's not say line and bottom is now that 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.299
 practiced and that the cable is connected like this 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.480
 you have the tray alone, that's great 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:24.670
 really there is the region of 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:27.230
 genome power button here we have a 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.050
 to deposit the lightly the 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.840
 hood of the capsule ends the 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.360
 counterweight that I previously showed in 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.980
 the flat arm 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.850
 the dish is really impressive the 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.250
 hardness construction this is 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.930
 direct transmission all this is the 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:53.439
 material as of 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.200
 it is an iron that is tremendous and 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:04:00.210
 down comes like an injected rubber 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:04.130
 and I'm going to lift the big tray 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.130
 so that you can see below 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.080
 this is why this is down there has a 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.269
 connection light really that's 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.360
 very interesting and there the control of 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.600
 gain the bcb and the rsa 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.920
 and all the legs without rubber is 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.190
 legislation that you have is tremendous as 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.160
 so that it does not copy as copy noise 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.940
 we have a torque adjustment 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.840
 to give more and less torque to the plate 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.770
 from two sides we have it and the play 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.130
 from both sides which is the state and pause 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.730
 and here we have a button to invert the 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.730
 direction of rotation 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.960
 in this display 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.310
 it shows us 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.230
 how 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:08.720
 how it rotates and the pitch 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:12.770
 we are giving and removing percentage 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:17.210
 then we have a pizza button here what 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:20.210
 which we play and does not help 20 or 50% the 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.800
 which we can leave the plate with a 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.849
 super super slow motion 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.849
 let's give more power 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.810
 let's make the chest 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.750
 here we have the button that we calculated 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.180
 of pm 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.729
 in quads directly 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.280
 and the pit locke and this is really 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.400
 beautiful 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.699
 with these two hold let's say the torque 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:53.229
 here we have the button of 33 of 45 and if 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:56.380
 we touch the two you go to 78 45 is in 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:06:00.240
 78 and I used to handle that for the 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.240
 old pasta discs 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.449
 with the excellent quality of this this is 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:10.919
 tremendous all this part of the tray 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:14.430
 it's like an injected rubber but of a 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:17.479
 tremendous duration and this this metal this 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.479
 it is tremendous 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:26.780
 I take off I take off I take out the flag and 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.360
 and I begin to recognize that today 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:34.350
 good knowing not what techniques 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:36.180
 disappeared I really appreciate the 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.860
 Good wave of know mark to create this 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.320
 product this is an excellent product 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.950
 that has everything we did not have in and 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.800
 techniques and this screen seems not to 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.870
 but to say of the new generation what 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.500
 helps a lot and I do not want to imagine the 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:54.810
 people who are with the topic of escrache 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.970
 good as far as they can go entering 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.180
 is feeding these trays to our 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.479
 country 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:04.650
 and hopefully that lasts thanks 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:04.650
 I am alex a greeting
