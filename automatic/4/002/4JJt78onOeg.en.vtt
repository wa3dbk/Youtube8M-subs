00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:04.700
 in today's issue of 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.580
 according to experience Ural 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.090
 In the wild, people adapt their behavior to the respective one 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.119
 Locations 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.730
 These deceptive message sculptures make an excellent background for 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.029
 the spanking demonstration of the sexual instincts of which we now witness 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.949
 become 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.150
 this is the human standing far 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.289
 and this the male 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.409
 now in August a counter that is good 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.080
 Haugs time the female has groomed the skin around small matted field parts 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.090
 to remove 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.170
 while the male now has a special make-up 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.650
 most people are born with uncoordinated eyes 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.920
 This is where natural eyes have developed 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.810
 but this female has no interest 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.890
 or maybe 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.000
 it is well recognizable as he controls his heights his heights 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.480
 Human ancestors are now still a distant memories of his 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.390
 the 1 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.260
 see these markings 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
 she indicates that the female is already taken 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.409
 but in the wild that mark sometimes completely 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.630
 meaningless 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.100
 1 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.270
 unless it is impossible to ignore 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.880
 Someone defends his partner successful years 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.210
 not against everyone 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.210
 a torn half of heaven's will lurks in the background 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.660
 now like the decades 12 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.070
 some scientists think that the difference between the male 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.850
 this includes commission 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.350
 in the female guests conversation during the reason for the curious 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.350
 Games is 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.549
 many people 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.549
 "If you're a certain female 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.649
 but this male has kept his slogans to possibilities 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.169
 that's not right with him 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.459
 if they are questions 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.359
 and then with increasing security 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.329
 the analysts would have 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.329
 the artful partner is all conceivable 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:31.319
 the elite race people has watched everything and now sees his chance 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.710
 on 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.089
 on 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:39.329
 but in the end it can only dream of the times as his 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:45.219
 Protagonists stronger way even when the participants change 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:49.290
 the play of colors between male and female is just time 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:50.689
