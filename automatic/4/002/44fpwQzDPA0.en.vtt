that occurs that makes two streams of 10
crows<00:05:27.570> go<00:05:27.780> through<00:05:27.990> where<00:05:28.170> there<00:05:28.290> should<00:05:28.470> just

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
crows go through where there should just

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.220 
crows go through where there should just
be<00:05:28.740> one<00:05:28.860> and<00:05:29.490> that<00:05:30.210> can<00:05:30.420> be<00:05:30.540> a<00:05:30.570> bit<00:05:30.780> problematic

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
be one and that can be a bit problematic

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.590 
be one and that can be a bit problematic
if<00:05:31.500> you<00:05:31.560> don't<00:05:31.740> fire<00:05:31.980> fast<00:05:32.250> enough<00:05:32.610> I<00:05:32.910> mean

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
if you don't fire fast enough I mean

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.090 
if you don't fire fast enough I mean
sure<00:05:33.780> if<00:05:33.870> you<00:05:33.960> charge<00:05:34.200> shots<00:05:34.500> it's<00:05:34.710> no<00:05:34.860> problem

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
sure if you charge shots it's no problem

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.040 
sure if you charge shots it's no problem
whatsoever<00:05:35.580> but<00:05:35.940> just<00:05:36.150> using<00:05:36.510> normal<00:05:36.660> shots

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
whatsoever but just using normal shots

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.320 
whatsoever but just using normal shots
that<00:05:37.830> can<00:05:37.950> be<00:05:38.130> a<00:05:38.160> bit<00:05:38.370> annoying<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:38.970> I<00:05:39.030> really

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
that can be a bit annoying and I really

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.630 
that can be a bit annoying and I really
don't<00:05:39.450> know<00:05:39.660> what<00:05:39.840> triggers<00:05:40.200> left<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:41.430> stage

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
don't know what triggers left the stage

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.240 
don't know what triggers left the stage
itself<00:05:42.350> most<00:05:43.350> of<00:05:43.530> it<00:05:43.650> really<00:05:43.830> is<00:05:44.010> just

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
itself most of it really is just

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.920 
itself most of it really is just
memorization<00:05:44.550> as<00:05:45.030> to<00:05:45.150> where<00:05:45.300> everything<00:05:45.720> is

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
memorization as to where everything is

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.050 
memorization as to where everything is
and<00:05:46.140> just<00:05:46.830> being<00:05:47.010> cautious<00:05:47.250> about<00:05:47.610> firing

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
and just being cautious about firing

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.780 
and just being cautious about firing
quickly<00:05:48.600> the<00:05:49.440> shooter<00:05:49.770> segment<00:05:50.250> actually<00:05:50.700> is

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
quickly the shooter segment actually is

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.510 
quickly the shooter segment actually is
very<00:05:51.120> simple<00:05:51.630> once<00:05:51.870> you<00:05:51.990> get<00:05:52.140> used<00:05:52.350> to<00:05:52.590> it<00:05:52.710> the

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
very simple once you get used to it the

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.370 
very simple once you get used to it the
second<00:05:53.880> parts<00:05:54.210> a<00:05:54.330> little<00:05:54.690> trickier<00:05:55.140> but

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
second parts a little trickier but

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.560 
second parts a little trickier but
really<00:05:55.680> not<00:05:55.830> that<00:05:56.010> bad<00:05:56.280> and<00:05:56.550> despite<00:05:57.210> having<00:05:57.360> a

attacks plenty of chances to
counter-attack<00:06:23.250> him<00:06:23.670> during<00:06:23.880> them<00:06:24.150> I<00:06:24.330> mean

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.170 
counter-attack him during them I mean

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.330 
counter-attack him during them I mean
the<00:06:25.320> only<00:06:25.440> one<00:06:25.650> that's<00:06:25.830> even<00:06:25.950> remotely

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
the only one that's even remotely

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.370 
the only one that's even remotely
annoying<00:06:26.700> is<00:06:27.000> the<00:06:27.150> tornado<00:06:27.540> hold<00:06:27.900> and<00:06:28.110> the

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
annoying is the tornado hold and the

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.200 
annoying is the tornado hold and the
only<00:06:28.500> reason<00:06:28.770> there<00:06:29.070> is<00:06:29.400> because<00:06:29.880> you<00:06:29.970> can't

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
only reason there is because you can't
