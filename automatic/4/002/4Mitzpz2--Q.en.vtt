00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
zipper and I'm not confident enough in

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.409

my<00:05:25.319> own<00:05:25.440> sewing<00:05:25.650> skills<00:05:25.979> that<00:05:26.219> I<00:05:26.310> would<00:05:26.759> dare

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
my own sewing skills that I would dare

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.200 
my own sewing skills that I would dare
to<00:05:27.659> replace<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.139> zipper<00:05:28.469> so<00:05:28.800> but<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:29.759> next<00:05:30.120> day

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
to replace a zipper so but the next day

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.999 
to replace a zipper so but the next day
I<00:05:30.240> went<00:05:30.479> back<00:05:30.750> just<00:05:31.110> to<00:05:31.500> have<00:05:31.620> one<00:05:31.770> more<00:05:31.860> look

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
I went back just to have one more look

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.279 
I went back just to have one more look
at<00:05:32.159> it<00:05:32.190> and<00:05:32.669> I<00:05:32.759> saw<00:05:32.940> this<00:05:33.089> one<00:05:33.240> it<00:05:33.569> is<00:05:33.659> missing<00:05:34.139> a

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
at it and I saw this one it is missing a

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.200 
at it and I saw this one it is missing a
few<00:05:34.469> beads<00:05:34.680> so<00:05:35.219> I<00:05:35.250> go<00:05:35.430> to<00:05:35.490> this<00:05:35.639> crowd<00:05:35.879> of<00:05:36.060> it

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
few beads so I go to this crowd of it

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.450 
few beads so I go to this crowd of it
but<00:05:36.900> I<00:05:36.930> think<00:05:37.409> the<00:05:37.529> zipper<00:05:37.800> works<00:05:38.009> so<00:05:38.219> I<00:05:38.279> can

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
but I think the zipper works so I can

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.909 
but I think the zipper works so I can
just<00:05:38.610> fix<00:05:38.909> the<00:05:39.060> beads<00:05:39.240> and<00:05:39.479> I<00:05:39.830> ended<00:05:40.830> up

just fix the beads and I ended up

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.939 
just fix the beads and I ended up
