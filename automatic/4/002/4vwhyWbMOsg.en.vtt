 draw is whoever has already written will not have 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.390
 complication 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.090
 just re-write the message that goes 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.730
 being in the description in the description will have 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.430
 all the rules you have that are 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.290
 doing to participate in the draw're 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.180
 We had a Christmas draw now. 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.959
 of five successful games 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.790
 always when the partner provides 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.680
 games for me, I hardly get the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.810
 I play a game for me, right? 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.459
 So I ended up raffling all the games to 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.540
 You always accompany the channel 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.900
 help us, our work then 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.340
 We'll be bringing this lottery more 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.440
 the rules are very simple I think 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.109
 It does not have much difficulty of lic 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.410
 favorite in this unwritten video of the 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:38.079
 channel is obvious not to rewrite the message as 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.810
 that will be in the description is going to 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:44.109
 rule to the room all right in the 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.130
 description of the video and enjoy the 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.480
 facebook of the roger channel 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.840
 facebook.com rose channel bar also 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.970
 will be the link in the description of this video 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.380
 I think it's pretty simple, right, people are 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.930
 personal does not do all the 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.730
 steps but I'm very strict right because 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.569
 I always want to be benefiting my 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.090
 written and who really strives there 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.859
 watch I missed a few minutes of your 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.930
 week to watch our video 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.359
 accompany our work to make a 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.829
 critical make a compliment ask questions 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.690
 This is very important. 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.639
 every investment I make in channel a 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.280
 The only thing I ask in return is this. 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.680
 This response from you is not 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.360
 that affection that the enrollee has for us 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.229
 producers of independent content in the 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.229
 youtube 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.750
 so I think it's pretty quiet is not a 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.510
 little game here for you to think a draw 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.460
 which does not have too much difficulty are 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.400
 Pretty basic things to do you will not 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.930
 spend no penny on then if I 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.310
 I was asking for money in return. 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.570
 I think it would be 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.340
 there is a bad thing and it is 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.260
 providing grandson would be that tatÃ¡ and 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.390
 asking a lot in return, huh? 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.150
 but it's a simple thing people think 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.350
 that does not disturb anyone, there are already many 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.580
 people who are written that will 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.260
 Watch this video then it will only 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.060
 replicate the message is participating 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.290
 the channel has been successfully 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.490
 tendency to close more partnerships 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.020
 It's not to bring more certainty to you. 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.450
 we are with the partnership and 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.120
 also interesting with a blog game 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.550
 experience is not who is the producer of 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.470
 content also gives a little something there 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.760
 talk to felipe who knows if the video does not 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:27.160

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.070
 Game's world 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.200
 I assure you that you will not 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.150
 regret suddenly you close a 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.460
 partnership there felipe also starts to 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.440

 you see that this is the mp you already had 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.960
 captured a little while ago, calculating 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.230
 goals seek to rescue the guys I think 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.060
 judge in maximum five matches in the car 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.970
 of the type of this modality 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:14.140
 It was never my forte, it's always TDM game. 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:16.380
 that confirm now in the pocket 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.750
 people encouraged me a lot to play 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.730

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.030
 accustomed not 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.190
 It's with these guys so you have to 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.590
 keep pace with staff and 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.810
 discover new modalities only so the 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.860
