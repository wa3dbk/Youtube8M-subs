00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:03.870
 In practice trying to use it in practice 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.670
 let's do it 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.670
 google map mark 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.319
 I am taking brightness 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.949
 Drag the gold and move t fine comes out first 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.369
 It says that she is acting as a sister 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.400
 Moving is no different from the obvious 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.850
 Separating needs when you click a committee member 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 I think this is easier to see and useful 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.840
 The icon is a sign for the earthquake information president to obtain and save annually 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.790
 Consecutive street magic 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.030
 It is a person's icon that it was moderately new, but 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.540
 This is 3 times 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.140
 National 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.140
 There are as many as 90 when pop up 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.320
 It is a screen about this 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.280
 It is only a video 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.860
 Let's go ahead 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.060
 Also change the seat by making the same English word as the production 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.230
 Table table 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.870
 It is said that the clipped screen can not be extended freely 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.320
 It's probably opengl where the surgery ends with acceleration 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.659
 It is understood that next space recognition is used using 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.710
 I will 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.680
 Also 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.490
 The size of the letters and the size of the way letters are quite large 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.680
 Well it is very easy to see that the arrow is big 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.140
 interview 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.240
 We use such a thing to have got map information into pc van 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.190
 I found that 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.190
 Both top and bottom are attached 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.540
 It's the lower right navigation but it's also an art- 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.850
 Okura 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.120
 You can see 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.470
 I think Kitakami was left 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.470
 South from the station 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.480
 It is a very easy-to-see course because it moves smoothly 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.630
 The burger on top disappears in situations where you don't touch the screen 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.300
 Comes out when touching 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.690
 I finish when I press the Finish button, but one more 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.840
 It will end even if you tap the button in this lower right area 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.840
 can do 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:13.899
 Nasty 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.579
 Breakthrough from here
