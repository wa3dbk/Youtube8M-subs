for<00:00:15.150> suggesting<00:00:15.719> today's<00:00:16.049> topic<00:00:16.980> today's

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
for suggesting today's topic today's

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.540 
for suggesting today's topic today's
topic<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.240> comparing<00:00:19.140> fractions<00:00:19.289> using<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
topic is comparing fractions using the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.509 
topic is comparing fractions using the
benchmark<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.210> 1/2<00:00:21.619> so<00:00:22.619> let's<00:00:22.859> take<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> look<00:00:23.340> at

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
benchmark of 1/2 so let's take a look at

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.640 
benchmark of 1/2 so let's take a look at
these<00:00:23.760> two<00:00:24.150> fractions<00:00:24.539> let's<00:00:25.019> say<00:00:25.230> we<00:00:25.380> wanted

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
these two fractions let's say we wanted

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.970 
these two fractions let's say we wanted
to<00:00:25.740> know<00:00:25.980> which<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.490> greater<00:00:26.760> 3/4<00:00:27.689> or<00:00:27.869> 2:8<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
to know which is greater 3/4 or 2:8 a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.519 
to know which is greater 3/4 or 2:8 a
really<00:00:29.730> quick<00:00:29.970> way<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.050> by

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
really quick way to do this is by

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.430 
really quick way to do this is by
thinking<00:00:31.949> about<00:00:32.070> 1/2<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.870> we'll<00:00:34.020> look<00:00:34.110> at<00:00:34.260> this

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
thinking about 1/2 so we'll look at this

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.200 
thinking about 1/2 so we'll look at this
one<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.040> try<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.340> keep<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.760> mind<00:00:35.969> all

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
one we have to try to keep in mind all

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.440 
one we have to try to keep in mind all
right

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
right

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.360 
right
is<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.870> greater<00:00:37.140> than<00:00:37.350> 1/2<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.800> less<00:00:38.010> than<00:00:38.219> that

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
is it greater than 1/2 or less than that

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.340 
is it greater than 1/2 or less than that
so<00:00:38.610> we'll<00:00:38.730> take<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> look<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.239> our<00:00:39.390> denominator

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
so we'll take a look at our denominator

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.530 
so we'll take a look at our denominator
which<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.070> 4<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.610> then<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.270> look<00:00:42.390> at<00:00:42.480> your

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
which is 4 and then you look at your

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.720 
which is 4 and then you look at your
numr<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.170> say<00:00:43.379> all<00:00:43.559> right<00:00:43.590> half<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.399> 4<00:00:44.700> is

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
numr and you say all right half of 4 is

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.950 
numr and you say all right half of 4 is
2<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.600> 3<00:00:46.230> greater<00:00:46.320> or<00:00:46.920> less<00:00:47.219> than<00:00:47.460> 2<00:00:48.300> well<00:00:48.809> it's

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
2 is 3 greater or less than 2 well it's

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.810 
2 is 3 greater or less than 2 well it's
greater<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.460> greater

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
greater then so it's going to be greater

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.900 
greater then so it's going to be greater
than<00:00:51.120> 1/2<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:52.800> look<00:00:52.949> at<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> two<00:00:53.370> eights

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
than 1/2 we look at the two eights

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.369 
than 1/2 we look at the two eights
1/2<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.780> 8<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.320> 4<00:00:55.370> is<00:00:56.370> 2<00:00:56.670> greater<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.180> less<00:00:57.329> than

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
1/2 of 8 is 4 is 2 greater or less than

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.590 
1/2 of 8 is 4 is 2 greater or less than
before<00:00:58.379> will<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.770> less<00:00:58.980> down<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:00.270> right<00:01:00.449> away

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
before will it's less down so right away

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
before will it's less down so right away
we<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:01.020> tell<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.770> by<00:01:01.859> using<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.609> venture

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
we can tell just by using this venture

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.859 
we can tell just by using this venture
north<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.239> 1/2<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:04.489> 3/4<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.760> greater<00:01:06.299> than<00:01:06.630> 2

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
north of 1/2 that 3/4 is greater than 2

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.950 
north of 1/2 that 3/4 is greater than 2
eggs<00:01:07.340> let<00:01:08.340> me<00:01:08.369> show<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.090> more<00:01:09.119> time

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
eggs let me show you that one more time

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.920 
eggs let me show you that one more time
let's<00:01:10.500> say<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:10.860> wanted<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.190> compare<00:01:11.550> 512<00:01:12.540> or

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
let's say we wanted to compare 512 or

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.660 
let's say we wanted to compare 512 or
6/10<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.380> find<00:01:16.590> out<00:01:16.740> which<00:01:16.920> one<00:01:17.160> was<00:01:17.340> greater

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
6/10 to find out which one was greater

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.940 
6/10 to find out which one was greater
so<00:01:18.390> why<00:01:18.540> right<00:01:18.870> away<00:01:19.080> we'll<00:01:19.320> say<00:01:19.470> well<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.770> I

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
so why right away we'll say well if I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.550 
so why right away we'll say well if I
have<00:01:19.980> 12<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:20.700> denominator<00:01:21.050> half<00:01:22.050> of<00:01:22.230> 12<00:01:22.410> is

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
have 12 in my denominator half of 12 is

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.610 
have 12 in my denominator half of 12 is
6<00:01:22.620> it's<00:01:23.370> 5<00:01:23.550> greater<00:01:23.880> or<00:01:24.090> less<00:01:24.270> than<00:01:24.300> 6<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.140> is

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
6 it's 5 greater or less than 6 it is

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.920 
6 it's 5 greater or less than 6 it is
less<00:01:25.890> than<00:01:26.160> 6<00:01:26.550> and<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.270> take<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> look<00:01:27.630> at<00:01:27.780> this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
less than 6 and we take a look at this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.070 
less than 6 and we take a look at this
one<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.350> say<00:01:28.500> well<00:01:28.680> half<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.160> 10<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.670> 5<00:01:29.940> and<00:01:30.479> 6<00:01:30.930> is

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
one we say well half of 10 is 5 and 6 is

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.350 
one we say well half of 10 is 5 and 6 is
greater<00:01:31.320> than<00:01:31.530> 5<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.880> know<00:01:33.030> right<00:01:33.300> away

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
greater than 5 so we know right away

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.740 
greater than 5 so we know right away
that<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.010> greater<00:01:35.280> fraction<00:01:36.090> so

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
that this is the greater fraction so

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.469 
that this is the greater fraction so
