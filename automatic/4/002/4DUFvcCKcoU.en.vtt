00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.949
 In a few days 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.370
 technology reporters did not speak by phone 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.420
 in the attack the team that faces the power 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.750
 with this summary summary of the first day of the Brazilian part 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.150
 when I arrived at 7 at night then there was a lot I saw queues to do 

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:22.659
 box of 70 hall 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.249
 1 had lots of things would have sant and had the ones this evening started the official opening 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.249
 in 2005 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.829
 the guy came with a person there is paulo and with speech speaking that 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.960
 The world is interested in this train. 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.110
 but what does this have many other things to un 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.290
 if the law of internet is not 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.620
 then they are multiple of the bar 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.150
 maybe the only thing I found interesting being the first day I 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.420
 will shut up every day 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.850
 it's 3d tv 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.010
 that the telephone presents in the stadium of the plata had everything with the philips 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.110
 It's a very interesting thing and it's got a lot of attention that you do not need 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.680
 from others to see 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.650
 and you have notion 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.280
 We are interested in a notion of depth of image 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.030
 or you stopped in front you look you can get deep if you 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.400
 see things walking that you can identify faith is behind 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.860
 It's impressive this year. 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.320
 just to name a thing you never see 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.890
 without 3d glasses 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.609
 it is through technology that they have today without a new screen you see 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:20.330
 3ds 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.140
 call me and I left 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.090
 the woman showed how it works more or less what is that to him 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.660
 the program can 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.170
 prominent is in front is behind after 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.060
 next to everything 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.479
 what I found cool kibuchi does not have to be an animation made for it he 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.120
 can 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.160
 to pick up a football game for example was the American they 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.860
 anyone who does anything can 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.360
 interpret and can assemble a 3d image through there 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.960
 the legal team unfortunately in the video or in the photo you will be able to see it there 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.040
 only if you have in the camp part 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.090
 on the evil side entrance at the on site closed by the site www pestana 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.100
 phone 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.149
 have a look there 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.500
 It is the detail they are expected to expect from philips 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.850
 it's worth looking at 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.799
 it's impressive 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.060
 then you say it was devastated 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.970
 It's okay tomorrow, let's see if I can see more talks that is one 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.119
 This equation will also force 7 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.469
 in the night then I'll try to see here that I can get it there 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.659
 It's right up there in the countryside. 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.180
 with a gain
