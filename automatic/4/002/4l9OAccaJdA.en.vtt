hey<00:00:00.510> everyone<00:00:01.050> I<00:00:01.079> finally<00:00:01.920> got<00:00:02.129> my<00:00:02.190> cookie

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hey everyone I finally got my cookie

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.610 
hey everyone I finally got my cookie
machine<00:00:03.030> dispensing<00:00:03.780> ingredients<00:00:04.440> so<00:00:04.589> I

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
machine dispensing ingredients so I

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.869 
machine dispensing ingredients so I
thought<00:00:04.859> I'd<00:00:04.950> make<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.100> short<00:00:05.400> video<00:00:05.549> and<00:00:05.700> just

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
thought I'd make a short video and just

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.849 
thought I'd make a short video and just
show<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.120> what's<00:00:06.330> going<00:00:06.390> on<00:00:06.720> right<00:00:07.620> now<00:00:07.740> I'm

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.009 
show you what's going on right now I'm
just<00:00:08.010> controlling<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.610> code<00:00:08.790> manually<00:00:09.240> and

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
just controlling the code manually and

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.450 
just controlling the code manually and
after<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.320> get<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.559> little<00:00:10.800> bit<00:00:10.889> more<00:00:11.040> work<00:00:11.250> done

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
after I get a little bit more work done

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.820 
after I get a little bit more work done
on<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.700> UI<00:00:11.880> I'll<00:00:12.240> be<00:00:12.450> able<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.809> hop<00:00:13.650> like<00:00:13.769> a

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
on the UI I'll be able to hop like a

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.310 
on the UI I'll be able to hop like a
test<00:00:14.130> page<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.700> UI<00:00:14.849> really<00:00:15.780> let<00:00:16.109> me<00:00:16.199> show

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
test page in the UI really let me show

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.140 
test page in the UI really let me show
you<00:00:16.410> how<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.650> works<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.640> I'm<00:00:17.760> going<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.000> enter

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
you how this works so I'm going to enter

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.990 
you how this works so I'm going to enter
in<00:00:20.630> 1500<00:00:21.630> grams<00:00:21.930> or<00:00:22.590> sorry<00:00:22.949> 1500<00:00:23.550> milligrams

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
in 1500 grams or sorry 1500 milligrams

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.750 
in 1500 grams or sorry 1500 milligrams
of<00:00:24.300> egg<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:25.529> I'll<00:00:25.680> just<00:00:25.859> run<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> code<00:00:26.730> now

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
of egg and I'll just run the code now

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.820 
of egg and I'll just run the code now
it's<00:00:27.150> already<00:00:27.480> at<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.810> right<00:00:27.990> station<00:00:28.380> so

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
it's already at the right station so

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.589 
it's already at the right station so
it'll<00:00:29.039> happen<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.429> it'll<00:00:29.609> rotate<00:00:29.820> back<00:00:30.240> to

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
it'll happen is it'll rotate back to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.410 
it'll happen is it'll rotate back to
that<00:00:31.260> spot<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.859> then<00:00:32.430> dispense<00:00:32.790> out<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.329> then

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
that spot and then dispense out and then

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.660 
that spot and then dispense out and then
it<00:00:33.540> will<00:00:33.660> taper<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.380> dispensing<00:00:35.070> rate<00:00:35.370> down

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
it will taper the dispensing rate down

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.660 
it will taper the dispensing rate down
and<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.230> an<00:00:37.380> offset<00:00:37.739> parameter<00:00:38.010> someone

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
and I have an offset parameter someone

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.100 
and I have an offset parameter someone
suggested<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> comments<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.899> last

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
suggested in the comments of the last

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.229 
suggested in the comments of the last
video<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.649> could<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:41.010> like<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> an<00:00:42.000> own

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
video that I could have like a an own

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.930 
video that I could have like a an own
offset<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> amount<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.530> mass<00:00:43.829> that's<00:00:44.160> kind

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
offset so the amount of mass that's kind

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.660 
offset so the amount of mass that's kind
of<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.180> air<00:00:45.420> right<00:00:45.719> now<00:00:46.039> is<00:00:47.039> known<00:00:47.399> by<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
of in air right now is known by the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.569 
of in air right now is known by the
program<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.260> when<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> scale<00:00:50.129> reaches

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
program so that when the scale reaches

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.180 
program so that when the scale reaches
you<00:00:50.789> know<00:00:50.910> X<00:00:51.539> minus<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.230> offset<00:00:52.710> value<00:00:53.070> it

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
you know X minus this offset value it

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.069 
you know X minus this offset value it
will<00:00:53.309> stop<00:00:53.550> dispensing<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> amount

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
will stop dispensing and then the amount

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.720 
will stop dispensing and then the amount
of<00:00:55.230> material<00:00:55.649> that's<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.949> midair<00:00:56.280> will<00:00:56.520> fall

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
of material that's in midair will fall

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.099 
of material that's in midair will fall
down<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.030> you'll<00:00:57.510> end<00:00:57.660> up<00:00:57.750> with<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> right

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
down and you'll end up with the right

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.400 
down and you'll end up with the right
value<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:59.699> I<00:01:00.420> forgot<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> tear<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> scale

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
value and I forgot to tear the scale

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.319 
value and I forgot to tear the scale
normally<00:01:02.250> when<00:01:02.370> making<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.699> cookie<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.030> don't

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
normally when making a cookie you don't

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.700 
normally when making a cookie you don't
really<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.870> tear<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.229> scale<00:01:04.470> between

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
really have to tear the scale between

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.380 
really have to tear the scale between
ingredients<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.790> was<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> whole<00:01:06.180> point

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
ingredients and that was the whole point

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.600 
ingredients and that was the whole point
of<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.869> getting<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> scale<00:01:07.920> data<00:01:08.130> out<00:01:08.340> from

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
of of getting the scale data out from

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.070 
of of getting the scale data out from
here<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.240> keep<00:01:09.390> pressing<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.900> tare

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
here so I can keep pressing the tare

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.960 
here so I can keep pressing the tare
button<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> make<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.250> easy<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.790> me<00:01:11.880> to

button just to make it easy for me to
figure<00:01:12.150> out<00:01:12.270> what's<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.080> meanwhile

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
figure out what's going on and meanwhile

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.100 
figure out what's going on and meanwhile
the<00:01:13.500> program<00:01:13.920> has<00:01:14.130> its<00:01:14.430> own<00:01:14.610> its<00:01:15.600> own<00:01:15.750> zero

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the program has its own its own zero

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.230 
the program has its own its own zero
point<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> scale<00:01:16.979> let<00:01:17.729> me<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:17.970> run<00:01:18.090> that

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
point on the scale let me just run that

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.680 
point on the scale let me just run that
again

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.430 

and<00:01:27.320> we<00:01:27.860> came<00:01:28.070> up<00:01:28.100> with<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.790> point<00:01:29.600> two<00:01:30.110> one

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
and we came up with the point two one

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.180 
and we came up with the point two one
zero<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:31.040> 210<00:01:31.640> milligrams<00:01:32.090> for<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.650> desired<00:01:33.650> 200

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
zero so 210 milligrams for a desired 200

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.320 
zero so 210 milligrams for a desired 200
milligram<00:01:34.520> dose<00:01:34.820> let's<00:01:35.420> try<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.630> different<00:01:35.690> one

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
milligram dose let's try a different one

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:55.660 
milligram dose let's try a different one
about<00:01:38.330> 50<00:01:38.750> milligrams<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.470> salt

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:06.100 

about<00:01:56.270> two<00:01:56.510> grams<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:57.080> white<00:01:57.440> sugar<00:02:04.870> okay<00:02:05.870> that

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
about two grams of white sugar okay that

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.660 
about two grams of white sugar okay that
didn't<00:02:06.440> work<00:02:06.560> there's<00:02:06.800> still<00:02:06.980> a<00:02:07.010> bug<00:02:07.280> with<00:02:07.490> the

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
didn't work there's still a bug with the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.669 
didn't work there's still a bug with the
rotor<00:02:08.090> position<00:02:08.179> which<00:02:08.840> tends<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.500> make

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
rotor position which tends to make

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.070 
rotor position which tends to make
really<00:02:10.490> spectacular<00:02:11.150> messes<00:02:11.510> here<00:02:11.720> luckily

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
really spectacular messes here luckily

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.600 
really spectacular messes here luckily
it's<00:02:12.200> only<00:02:12.320> mixing<00:02:12.710> one<00:02:12.890> cookie<00:02:13.220> at<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.400> time

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
it's only mixing one cookie at a time

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.950 
it's only mixing one cookie at a time
instead<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.120> whole<00:02:14.270> batch<00:02:14.450> at<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.750> time

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
instead of a whole batch at the time

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.020 
instead of a whole batch at the time
okay<00:02:15.290> really<00:02:16.010> have<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.250> problem<00:02:16.520> here<00:02:16.850> let's

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
okay really have a problem here let's

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:41.840 
okay really have a problem here let's
try<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.330> again<00:02:19.960> that's<00:02:20.960> more<00:02:21.260> like<00:02:21.410> it

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.400 

lastly<00:02:42.850> how<00:02:43.060> about<00:02:43.210> four<00:02:43.480> grams<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.990> flowers

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
lastly how about four grams of flowers

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.120 
lastly how about four grams of flowers
this<00:02:44.620> time<00:02:44.800> I'll<00:02:44.920> tear<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.280> scale<00:02:45.520> first<00:02:45.820> and

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
this time I'll tear the scale first and

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.380 
this time I'll tear the scale first and
run<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.250> program<00:02:48.670> now<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.760> reason<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.180> takes

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
run the program now the reason it takes

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.180 
run the program now the reason it takes
the<00:02:52.540> long<00:02:52.720> way<00:02:52.930> around<00:02:52.960> instead<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:53.650> so<00:02:53.920> flower

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
the long way around instead of so flower

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.230 
the long way around instead of so flower
was<00:02:54.460> here<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.820> should<00:02:55.030> have<00:02:55.150> gone

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
was here it should have gone

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.630 
was here it should have gone
counterclockwise<00:02:55.810> for<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.470> short<00:02:56.740> way<00:02:56.860> but

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
counterclockwise for the short way but

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.310 
counterclockwise for the short way but
it<00:02:57.880> takes<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.300> long<00:02:58.450> way<00:02:58.630> around<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.990> prevent

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
it takes the long way around to prevent

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.110 
it takes the long way around to prevent
the<00:02:59.440> cables<00:02:59.800> wrapping<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.490> it<00:03:00.610> knows<00:03:00.790> where

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
the cables wrapping so it knows where

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.540 
the cables wrapping so it knows where
there's<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.720> point<00:03:02.710> that<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:02.950> can<00:03:03.130> never<00:03:03.280> pass

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
there's a point that it can never pass

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.280 
there's a point that it can never pass
on<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:03.940> carousel<00:03:04.450> so<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.750> always<00:03:04.900> goes<00:03:05.260> back

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
on the carousel so it always goes back

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.680 
on the carousel so it always goes back
to<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.830> station<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:08.550> we<00:03:09.550> have<00:03:09.760> four<00:03:10.420> point

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
to the station and we have four point

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.290 
to the station and we have four point
zero<00:03:10.960> zero<00:03:11.050> six<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:12.070> only<00:03:12.640> six<00:03:12.970> milligrams

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
zero zero six so only six milligrams

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.540 
zero zero six so only six milligrams
over<00:03:13.690> on<00:03:13.960> a<00:03:13.990> desired<00:03:14.740> four<00:03:15.160> thousand

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
over on a desired four thousand

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.520 
over on a desired four thousand
milligram<00:03:15.880> dose<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:17.110> reason<00:03:17.320> that<00:03:17.410> the

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
milligram dose the reason that the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.920 
milligram dose the reason that the
funnel<00:03:17.830> is<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.160> long<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:19.150> because<00:03:19.210> the<00:03:19.690> flower

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
funnel is so long is because the flower

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:20.580 
funnel is so long is because the flower
sticks

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
sticks

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.560 
sticks
incredibly<00:03:21.430> well<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.850> lots<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.209> different

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
incredibly well to lots of different

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.210 
incredibly well to lots of different
surfaces<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:23.050> so<00:03:23.380> originally<00:03:23.800> I<00:03:23.830> had<00:03:23.920> this

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
surfaces and so originally I had this

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.400 
surfaces and so originally I had this
funnel<00:03:24.520> on<00:03:24.700> here<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.180> even<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.930> slope<00:03:26.230> of

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
funnel on here and even the slope of

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.290 
funnel on here and even the slope of
this<00:03:26.590> funnel<00:03:26.890> was<00:03:27.130> enough<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.580> catch<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:28.090> lot<00:03:28.270> of

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
this funnel was enough to catch a lot of

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.810 
this funnel was enough to catch a lot of
flower<00:03:28.720> on<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.230> inside<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:30.070> then<00:03:30.580> what<00:03:30.730> would

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
flower on the inside and then what would

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.430 
flower on the inside and then what would
happen<00:03:31.120> is<00:03:31.240> the<00:03:31.270> thing<00:03:31.540> would<00:03:31.660> you<00:03:31.959> know<00:03:32.320> the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
happen is the thing would you know the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.350 
happen is the thing would you know the
carousel<00:03:32.890> would<00:03:33.010> go<00:03:33.160> into<00:03:33.310> position<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.120> all

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
carousel would go into position and all

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.000 
carousel would go into position and all
the<00:03:34.510> flower<00:03:34.720> would<00:03:34.990> fall<00:03:35.230> out<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.530> bottom<00:03:35.560> and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
the flower would fall out the bottom and

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.560 
the flower would fall out the bottom and
it<00:03:36.100> was<00:03:36.220> totally<00:03:36.670> uncontrolled<00:03:37.240> and<00:03:37.420> not

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
it was totally uncontrolled and not

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.980 
it was totally uncontrolled and not
metered<00:03:37.959> so<00:03:38.890> this<00:03:39.160> funnel<00:03:39.640> so<00:03:40.390> far<00:03:40.660> at<00:03:40.810> least

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
metered so this funnel so far at least

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.830 
metered so this funnel so far at least
has<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.230> slope<00:03:41.620> that's<00:03:41.650> high<00:03:42.070> enough<00:03:42.280> for<00:03:42.520> the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
has a slope that's high enough for the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.570 
has a slope that's high enough for the
flower<00:03:43.840> just<00:03:44.140> won't<00:03:44.290> stick<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.740> it<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.459> all

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
flower just won't stick to it and it all

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.390 
flower just won't stick to it and it all
comes<00:03:45.850> out<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:47.709> there's<00:03:47.920> still<00:03:48.100> a<00:03:48.130> few<00:03:48.370> things

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
comes out so there's still a few things

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.729 
comes out so there's still a few things
left<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:48.910> do<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.540> chocolate<00:03:49.750> chips<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.530> brown

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
left to do the chocolate chips the brown

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.009 
left to do the chocolate chips the brown
sugar<00:03:51.100> or<00:03:51.400> I<00:03:51.430> may<00:03:51.640> decide<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.300> dispense

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
sugar or I may decide to dispense

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.750 
sugar or I may decide to dispense
molasses<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.860> then<00:03:53.980> add<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.610> white

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
molasses and then add it to the white

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.370 
molasses and then add it to the white
sugar<00:03:55.000> as<00:03:55.239> someone<00:03:55.510> suggested<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:56.350> the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
sugar as someone suggested and the

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.880 
sugar as someone suggested and the
baking<00:03:57.310> soda<00:03:57.519> and<00:03:57.910> then<00:03:58.350> that's<00:03:59.350> pretty<00:03:59.709> much

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
baking soda and then that's pretty much

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.400 
baking soda and then that's pretty much
it<00:04:00.160> as<00:04:00.340> far<00:04:00.370> as<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.480> mechanicals<00:04:02.050> go<00:04:02.230> on

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
it as far as the the mechanicals go on

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.720 
it as far as the the mechanicals go on
this<00:04:02.530> thing<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:04.260> it's<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.980> measuring

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
this thing and it's the measuring

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.400 
this thing and it's the measuring
accuracy<00:04:07.239> is<00:04:07.360> actually<00:04:07.660> working<00:04:07.959> much<00:04:08.140> better

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
accuracy is actually working much better

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.180 
accuracy is actually working much better
than<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.739> thought

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
than I thought

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.160 
than I thought
handling<00:04:10.030> some<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.269> these<00:04:10.450> materials<00:04:11.019> has

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
handling some of these materials has

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.540 
handling some of these materials has
proven<00:04:11.410> to<00:04:11.560> be<00:04:11.590> more<00:04:11.800> difficult<00:04:12.070> than<00:04:12.459> I

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
proven to be more difficult than I

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.490 
proven to be more difficult than I
estimated<00:04:13.209> but<00:04:13.390> I'm<00:04:13.660> pretty<00:04:14.050> pleased<00:04:14.350> with

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
estimated but I'm pretty pleased with

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.259 
estimated but I'm pretty pleased with
the<00:04:14.680> amount<00:04:14.860> of<00:04:14.950> accuracy<00:04:15.370> I've<00:04:15.670> gotten<00:04:16.060> I

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
the amount of accuracy I've gotten I

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.870 
the amount of accuracy I've gotten I
also<00:04:17.109> finished<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.739> butter<00:04:17.919> dispenser<00:04:18.220> today

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
also finished the butter dispenser today

electronics and finished up the slide

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.530 
electronics and finished up the slide
but<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:24.220> haven't<00:04:24.430> tested<00:04:24.820> this<00:04:25.180> with<00:04:25.390> the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
but I haven't tested this with the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.150 
but I haven't tested this with the
mechanism<00:04:26.020> yet<00:04:26.169> so<00:04:26.380> I'm<00:04:26.440> not<00:04:26.470> quite<00:04:26.770> sure<00:04:26.800> how

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
mechanism yet so I'm not quite sure how

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.250 
mechanism yet so I'm not quite sure how
easy<00:04:27.430> it's<00:04:27.640> going<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.820> be<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:28.030> meter<00:04:28.240> out<00:04:28.450> like

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
easy it's going to be to meter out like

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.130 
easy it's going to be to meter out like
a<00:04:29.290> pasty<00:04:29.800> sort<00:04:30.040> of<00:04:30.130> thing<00:04:30.310> like<00:04:30.340> butter<00:04:30.760> but

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
a pasty sort of thing like butter but

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.710 
a pasty sort of thing like butter but
I'm<00:04:32.140> sure<00:04:32.350> we'll<00:04:32.500> figure<00:04:32.650> something<00:04:33.130> out<00:04:33.220> okay

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
I'm sure we'll figure something out okay

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.830 
I'm sure we'll figure something out okay
see<00:04:34.720> you<00:04:34.810> next<00:04:34.870> time<00:04:35.169> bye
