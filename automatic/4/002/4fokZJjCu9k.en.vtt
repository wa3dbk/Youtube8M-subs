00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.430
 m 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.580
 Yes 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.410
 hi sega 94 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.840
 we find ourselves for a small video 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.820
 tutorial on the website stickers de ouf 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.390
 so we see we can have six 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.980
 basic classes for iphone ipad etc 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.290
 but there is also a section create his 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.040
 clean what does it so that's it 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.030
 which is interesting on this site 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.300
 so here we come to the page of 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:57.299
 customization so for iphone ipad and 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:01.280
 the xbox and ps3 controllers so I have 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:05.159
 clicked ps3 so here we have we have the 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.130
 opportunity to put a background to put 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.009
 a preloaded image on the on the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.409
 software or upload his own image 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.200
 so either directly on the internet with 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.880
 the url beyond the image or be like me 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.100
 there on my hard drive 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.119
 so here I select the image by 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.469
 to be careful of 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.240
 learn it in very good quality but 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.420
 which I took I scored in 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.310
 google in full hd coop is really going to 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.460
 mine of the minimum 2 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.070
 of grains of pixels in fact that is enough 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.360
 that we enlarge the image on the on the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.229
 layer so here we are superimposing the image 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:57.000
 on the layer the second one wants one can the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:58.310
 grow it rotate it and there 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.670
 we can enter text 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.390
 so there are several fonts available 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.830
 some do not work 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.799
 numbers on the other hand to be careful 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.750
 so the color we want to put so 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:16.860
 there really is a slab is huge of 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.260
 nuances of nuances me I take blue 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.790
 for sizewell really good for the screen 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.400
 we adjust the font size 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:38.840
 and here we enter his capital text 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:41.250
 walk there I salute you up and we valid 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.609
 so the same principle we can 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.609
 finds 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.890
 his gamertag I think that judicious these 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.770
 two houses gaymard tag so there so 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.610
 the age of the mii you actually see my 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.770
 writing there I selected the after 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.390
 cuts in fact to see them 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.010
 skin cutting features because 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.210
 the skin itself is in four 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.460
 parts so you have to cut that for 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.620
 properly position the writing we do 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.550
 not find with writing between two 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.900
 parts of the skins 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.270
 So here so once you have 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.930
 really well stall your your image and 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.810
 your gamertag and more than save 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:31.270
 you can even preview your 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.950
 your skins and there's more than just ordering 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.900
