00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.080
 but this observatory has the most 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.230
 important feature that we are 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.630
 located practically under the center of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.880
 the milky way and we guarantee 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.240
 geographically and meteorologically a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.130
 important percentage of days not 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.460
 cloudy then fit for 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.460
 observation 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.370
 here at the summit we have the 4 meters the 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.710
 1.5 the point 92 one-meter telescopes 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.930
 and the telescopes that you here 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.330
 can appreciate they have been built in 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.590
 different times therefore each one 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.100
 of these telescopes has different 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.840
 ages 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.430
 the difference between each one these 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.559
 telescopes the diameter of the mirror 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.170
 primary and what has been much integrated 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.659
 in this observatory are the projects 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.680
 of telescopes completely 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.720
 automated 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.800
 the dome opens automatically in the 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.900
 night that through him through the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.650
 computer that controls the observation 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.410
 there is an observation plan and the 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.780
 telescope is repositioned observe and the 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.210
 operators are abroad 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.400
 the aura organization is a grouping 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.619
 from several universities therefore 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.280
 we receive here astronomers from 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.460
 all the latitudes of the planet there 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.110
 groups that are dedicated to observe 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.450
 supernova others who specialize in 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.840
 galaxies others who specialize today 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.820
 day that the most important topic today 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.600
 like that of dark energy then 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.700
 each project has a type of associated 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.750
 specific instrumentation 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.869
 the most important issue today has a 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.890
 relationship with the expansion of the universe and 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.670
 in that context concepts arise 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.950
 new as is dark energy 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.290
 it's like saying simply what 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.959
 represents the expansion of the universe that 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.050
 it is not yet possible to determine the origin 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.400
 of this expansion or what causes it is what 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.650
 what we call dark energy 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.510
 it's like unknown energy 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.340
 then instruments like for example 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.590
 which today we have here in 4 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.299
 metro that is called that camps its 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.689
 The main objective is to take a tour 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.790
 a mapping of the sky to be able to do 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.379
 studies tending to investigate more 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.590
 this concept of the expansion of the 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.590
 universe
