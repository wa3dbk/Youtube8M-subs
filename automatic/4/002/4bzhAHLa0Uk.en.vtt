marinade or mixture over top of these

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.770 
marinade or mixture over top of these
there's<00:02:02.520> two<00:02:02.759> ways<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.420> if

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
there's two ways you can do this if

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.270 
there's two ways you can do this if
you're<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.110> rush<00:02:04.350> or<00:02:04.799> if<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.130> want<00:02:05.250> to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
you're in a rush or if you just want to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.950 
you're in a rush or if you just want to
eat<00:02:05.430> right<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.450> place<00:02:06.810> this

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
eat right now you can just place this

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.869 
eat right now you can just place this
mixture<00:02:07.140> over<00:02:07.710> top<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.920> them<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.429> bake<00:02:08.640> them

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
mixture over top of them and bake them

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.869 
mixture over top of them and bake them
as<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> bit<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.039> time<00:02:11.310> you

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
as is or if you have a bit of time you

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.140 
as is or if you have a bit of time you
can

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
can

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.670 
can
marinate<00:02:12.629> these<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.170> could<00:02:13.379> put<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
marinate these so you could put the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.619 
marinate these so you could put the
Salmons<00:02:14.099> into<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.489> tight<00:02:14.790> sealed<00:02:15.120> container

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
Salmons into a tight sealed container

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.809 
Salmons into a tight sealed container
and<00:02:15.930> then<00:02:16.260> pour<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.650> mixture<00:02:16.860> over<00:02:17.220> top<00:02:17.640> of

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
and then pour this mixture over top of

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.160 
and then pour this mixture over top of
them<00:02:17.939> and<00:02:18.120> marinate<00:02:18.540> them<00:02:18.689> for<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> few<00:02:19.140> hours

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
them and marinate them for a few hours

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.649 
them and marinate them for a few hours
or<00:02:19.620> overnight<00:02:19.980> whatever<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.939> wish<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.599> I

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
or overnight whatever you wish so I

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.270 
or overnight whatever you wish so I
guess<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:21.930> does<00:02:22.110> act<00:02:22.379> as<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.620> marinade<00:02:23.040> as

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
guess this does act as a marinade as

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.970 
guess this does act as a marinade as
well<00:02:23.579> as<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:24.120> rub<00:02:24.390> or<00:02:24.629> a<00:02:24.659> glaze<00:02:25.049> and<00:02:25.379> then<00:02:25.799> you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
well as a rub or a glaze and then you

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.399 
well as a rub or a glaze and then you
want<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.310> bake<00:02:27.090> these<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.750> also<00:02:28.019> added<00:02:28.319> some

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
want to bake these I also added some

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.199 
want to bake these I also added some
butter<00:02:28.769> just<00:02:29.069> overtop<00:02:29.549> of<00:02:29.579> them<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.819> little<00:02:30.030> bit

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
butter just overtop of them a little bit

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.210 
butter just overtop of them a little bit
just<00:02:30.329> to<00:02:30.689> give<00:02:30.840> them<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.140> creamy<00:02:31.560> tender

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
just to give them a creamy tender

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.250 
just to give them a creamy tender
consistency<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.299> then<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.870> want<00:02:34.049> to<00:02:34.140> go

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
consistency and then you want to go

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.229 
consistency and then you want to go
ahead<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.739> bake<00:02:34.950> these<00:02:35.189> I<00:02:35.459> bake<00:02:35.879> it<00:02:35.909> for

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
ahead and bake these I bake it for

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.099 
ahead and bake these I bake it for
around<00:02:36.329> 400<00:02:37.109> degrees<00:02:37.470> for<00:02:38.010> about<00:02:38.280> 10<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.629> 20

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
around 400 degrees for about 10 to 20

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.420 
around 400 degrees for about 10 to 20
minutes<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.680> say<00:02:40.859> that<00:02:41.040> because<00:02:41.220> it

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
minutes and I say that because it

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.130 
minutes and I say that because it
depends<00:02:41.760> on<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.939> size<00:02:42.120> if<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:42.750> have<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.900> small

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
depends on the size if you have a small

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.569 
depends on the size if you have a small
piece<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.319> salmon<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.890> could<00:02:44.099> only<00:02:44.220> take<00:02:44.519> like

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
piece of salmon it could only take like

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.759 
piece of salmon it could only take like
8<00:02:44.909> minutes<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.389> cook<00:02:45.690> I've<00:02:45.900> had<00:02:46.200> some<00:02:46.409> Salmons

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
8 minutes to cook I've had some Salmons

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.920 
8 minutes to cook I've had some Salmons
take<00:02:46.980> 20<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:47.639> depends<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.269> size<00:02:48.540> the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
take 20 just depends the size the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.020 
take 20 just depends the size the
thickness<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:49.950> on<00:02:50.129> you<00:02:50.340> guys<00:02:50.489> know<00:02:50.790> how<00:02:51.000> it
