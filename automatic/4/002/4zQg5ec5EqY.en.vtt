00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.859
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:09.990
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:10.800
 1090 the first task the student decided 12 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.000
 of equations 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.199
 in 40 minutes how many minutes on average is he 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.470
 solved every equation this is the first question 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.930
 and 2 + how many seconds did he spend on 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.710
 solving each equation let's 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.009
 first in minutes we count everything 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.130
 I decided 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.170
 12 equations in 40 minutes and all the time 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:44.809
 which he according to tatyana equation is 40 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.809
 minutes forty minutes he solved 12 equations 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.969
 to find out how much time he spent 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.840
 for each equation 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:59.730
 you need to divide all the time by quantity 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.100
 equations well here for the whole not divide 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:09.350
 we can only share with 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:16.430
 the remaining 40 is divided by 12, so take 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:19.320
 33 to 12 to 36 and we get here 4 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:24.840
 partial partial remainder of division 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.950
 divider this is the whole part this is three this 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.229
 numerator 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.079
 and this is the denominator so the whole part of us 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:40.430
 it turned out 3 therefore we write 3 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:43.950
 Then the fractional part is further 4 12 minutes 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.090
 mean for every equation he spent three 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.970
 whole minutes and another 412 them for each 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.790
 equation he spent three point four 12 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.950
 minutes well to intact are not divided so 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.149
 it turned out another fractional part it was 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.969
 first decision answer to the first question 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.729
 how much on average did he spend his minutes 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.429
 sent it in minutes and now the second 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.010
 question how many seconds did he spend on 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.629
 solving each equation let's 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.670
 we will answer the second question in 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:20.140
 several actions first action 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.840
 answer the second question well, or if 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.739
 wish it was the first action 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.870
 when is the second answer to the second 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:34.030
 question 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:38.470
 first 40 minutes translate into seconds as 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:45.549
 we have 40 minutes translate into seconds is 40 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:47.680
 multiply by 60 i.e 40 minutes to us 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.109
 need to translate in seconds in each 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.739
 a minute of 60 seconds so we are 40 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:59.889
 multiply by 60 we get seconds as 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:02.230
 itâ€™s convenient here to count 4 by 6 this is 24 here 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:06.489
 this zero is added and this zero 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.569
 we add and so it turns out that 40 minutes 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:15.060
 it's 240 seconds and now we all have these 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:19.120
 seconds oh 240 said 2400 seconds 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:23.739
 blab out 2400 seconds it 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.989
 seconds total and equation he solved 12 all 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.540
 time divided by the number of equations 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.260
 to find out how many seconds he spent on 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:39.549
 every equation we can what are you 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:43.590
 cost state 2400 divide by 12 first 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:47.500
 take on 22 by 12-24 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.629
 it turns out 0 if it already turned out 0 then 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:55.780
 these remaining 0 and append here 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:58.480
 it turns out 200 that is if we are 12 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:04.199
 divide by 24 it turns out 2 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:08.620
 and here these two zeros append 200 seconds 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:14.049
 strange but fact 3 point four 12 of them 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:18.250
 minutes and 200 seconds is the same 200 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:22.440
 seconds and three point four 12 minutes and this 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.440
 the same thing is simply written differently 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.050
 do not forget to write in the comments 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.930
 as far as you understand the decision given 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.910
 tasks if you like my video tutorials 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.160
 advise their friends classmate 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.500
 My name is Andreev Andrew Andreevich 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.500
 all learn well all bye
