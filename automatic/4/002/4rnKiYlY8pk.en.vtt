00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
in a speed video the good thing with

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.220 
in a speed video the good thing with
both<00:00:10.830> these<00:00:11.040> devices<00:00:11.250> as<00:00:11.880> we<00:00:12.509> can<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:12.870> here

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
both these devices as we can have here

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.970 
both these devices as we can have here
or<00:00:13.469> as<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:13.950> can<00:00:14.130> see<00:00:14.429> it's<00:00:15.000> both<00:00:15.330> or<00:00:15.599> durable<00:00:16.529> do

off<00:00:31.410> you're<00:00:31.679> under<00:00:31.830> 30<00:00:32.009> through<00:00:32.279> 10<00:00:32.489> but

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
off you're under 30 through 10 but

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.910 
off you're under 30 through 10 but
remember<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.690> like<00:00:33.809> 15<00:00:34.350> years<00:00:34.680> old

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
remember this one is like 15 years old

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.010 
remember this one is like 15 years old
or<00:00:35.420> 14<00:00:36.420> or<00:00:36.540> something

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
or 14 or something

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
devices or some phones like that you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.170 
devices or some phones like that you
know<00:00:46.440> they<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.680> take<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:47.219> house<00:00:47.399> let's

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
know they can take up your house let's

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.610 
know they can take up your house let's
see<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.629> speed<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> dual

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
see here you can speed but have a dual

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.240 
see here you can speed but have a dual
processor<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.980> not<00:00:52.980> sure<00:00:53.160> how

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
processor in this one and not sure how

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.709 
processor in this one and not sure how
many<00:00:53.370> cores<00:00:53.730> would<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
many cores would have in this one but I

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.569 
many cores would have in this one but I
don't<00:00:54.930> thinking<00:00:55.320> they<00:00:55.530> had<00:00:55.680> invented<00:00:56.280> that

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
don't thinking they had invented that

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.910 
don't thinking they had invented that
with<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> 33<00:00:57.510> 10<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.930> let's<00:00:58.559> start<00:00:58.739> them<00:00:58.859> up

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
with the 33 10 but let's start them up

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.330 
with the 33 10 but let's start them up
here

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
here

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:11.990 
here
let's<00:01:00.050> go<00:01:08.990> side<00:01:09.990> by<00:01:10.020> side<00:01:10.409> Samsung<00:01:11.130> vs.<00:01:11.549> Nokia

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
let's go side by side Samsung vs. Nokia

it's<00:02:07.119> a<00:02:07.210> quick<00:02:07.359> little<00:02:07.600> speed<00:02:07.810> test<00:02:08.080> here

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
it's a quick little speed test here

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.410 
it's a quick little speed test here
hopefully<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.220> did<00:02:09.640> enjoy<00:02:09.849> you<00:02:09.910> can<00:02:10.060> also<00:02:10.209> see

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
hopefully you did enjoy you can also see

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.839 
hopefully you did enjoy you can also see
here<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:10.810> here<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.680> can<00:02:11.890> only<00:02:12.010> see<00:02:12.250> one<00:02:12.459> menu

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
here that here I can only see one menu

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.770 
here that here I can only see one menu
at<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.030> time<00:02:13.830> versus<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.069> one<00:02:15.099> hey<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:15.849> can<00:02:16.209> 1<00:02:16.569> 2

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
at a time versus this one hey I can 1 2
