00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280

and I'll jump out the bag there and
what's<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.930> best<00:00:49.140> way<00:00:49.320> let<00:00:49.770> me<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:49.890> break<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
what's the best way let me just break a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.250 
what's the best way let me just break a
little<00:00:50.610> bit<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.879> off<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.690> just

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
little bit of this off here and just

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.950 
little bit of this off here and just
spread<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> table<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.360> feel<00:00:54.750> it

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
spread it on the table so I can feel it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.240 
spread it on the table so I can feel it
now<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:58.250> completely

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
now and this one here is completely

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.099 
now and this one here is completely
different<00:00:59.399> now<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.239> doesn't<00:01:00.600> break<00:01:00.750> apart

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
different now this doesn't break apart

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.979 
different now this doesn't break apart
see<00:01:01.550> it's<00:01:02.550> easily<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.870> can

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
see it's easily as this so you can

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.010 
see it's easily as this so you can
already<00:01:04.170> tell<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.939> almost<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
already tell that this is almost a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.859 
already tell that this is almost a
little<00:01:07.170> foamy<00:01:07.979> here<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.460> has<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> foamy

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
little foamy here it has like a foamy

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.679 
little foamy here it has like a foamy
consistency<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.060> let<00:01:12.060> me<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.510> those

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
consistency to it let me just get those

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.140 
consistency to it let me just get those
calls<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.610> yourself<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
calls up so you can see for yourself and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.420 
calls up so you can see for yourself and
make<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.479> own<00:01:15.509> determination<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:17.250> least

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
make your own determination but at least

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.179 
make your own determination but at least
Oh<00:01:17.700> too<00:01:18.299> fast<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.990> mean<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.799> away<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.040> can

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
Oh too fast I mean right away you can

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.820 
Oh too fast I mean right away you can
see<00:01:20.250> how<00:01:20.850> greeny<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.540> how<00:01:22.020> easily<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.530> falls

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
see how greeny and how easily this falls

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.120 
see how greeny and how easily this falls
apart<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:24.030> here<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.860> mean<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.950> guess<00:01:26.100> you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
apart and this here I mean I guess you

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.920 
apart and this here I mean I guess you
could<00:01:26.460> get<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.850> fall<00:01:27.060> apart<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.450> see<00:01:27.810> how

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
could get it to fall apart but see how

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.620 
could get it to fall apart but see how
it<00:01:28.049> sticks<00:01:28.290> together<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.950> has<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.479> I

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
it sticks together and has that like I

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.350 
it sticks together and has that like I
said<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> foamy<00:01:31.590> consistency<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.640> that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
said like a foamy consistency so that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.450 
said like a foamy consistency so that
right<00:01:33.659> there<00:01:33.930> shows<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.530> off<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.310> bat

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
right there shows you off the bat

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.710 
right there shows you off the bat
they're<00:01:36.119> both<00:01:36.320> different<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.939> let's<00:01:39.119> do<00:01:39.509> some

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
they're both different so let's do some

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.960 
they're both different so let's do some
shaping<00:01:40.049> now<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.650> let<00:01:40.799> me<00:01:40.829> move<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:41.850> out

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
shaping now so let me move this one out

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.050 
shaping now so let me move this one out
of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> way<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.299> get<00:01:42.540> some<00:01:42.829> blue<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.220> now

much better this one see that this one

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.119 
much better this one see that this one
not<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.530> same<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:28.500> are<00:02:28.650> they<00:02:28.799> completely

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
not the same so are they completely

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.000 
not the same so are they completely
different<00:02:29.670> I'm<00:02:29.819> gonna<00:02:30.000> say<00:02:31.010> absolutely

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
different I'm gonna say absolutely

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.610 
different I'm gonna say absolutely
completely<00:02:32.849> different<00:02:36.170> I'm<00:02:37.170> just<00:02:37.379> kind<00:02:37.530> of

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
completely different I'm just kind of

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.559 
completely different I'm just kind of
playing<00:02:38.280> with<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.640> now<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.970> seeing<00:02:39.329> how<00:02:39.450> it

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
playing with it now and seeing how it

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.869 
playing with it now and seeing how it
stretches<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.889> this<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.220> doesn't<00:02:41.489> stretch

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
stretches so this really doesn't stretch

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.920 
stretches so this really doesn't stretch
this<00:02:42.480> doesn't<00:02:42.930> hold<00:02:43.530> together<00:02:43.680> all<00:02:44.099> like<00:02:44.310> that

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
this doesn't hold together all like that

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.970 
this doesn't hold together all like that
all<00:02:45.930> right<00:02:46.109> so<00:02:46.260> let's<00:02:46.470> just<00:02:46.620> make<00:02:46.739> another

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
all right so let's just make another
