might be able to see that snow biome
over<00:02:19.200> there<00:02:19.349> that's<00:02:19.650> why<00:02:19.830> they<00:02:20.190> were

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
over there that's why they were

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.610 
over there that's why they were
naturally<00:02:20.790> spawn<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.390> they<00:02:22.200> were<00:02:22.260> kind<00:02:22.470> of

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
naturally spawn and they were kind of

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.870 
naturally spawn and they were kind of
meant<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.890> blend<00:02:23.160> into<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.489> trees<00:02:23.730> and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
meant to blend into the trees and

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.400 
meant to blend into the trees and
whatnot<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.330> scary<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.930> stuff<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.349> that

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
whatnot and scary and stuff like that

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.410 
whatnot and scary and stuff like that
and<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.890> think<00:02:26.250> they<00:02:26.550> were<00:02:26.610> pretty<00:02:26.910> fun<00:02:27.180> and

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
and I think they were pretty fun and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
and I think they were pretty fun and
they're<00:02:27.540> definitely<00:02:27.750> something<00:02:28.200> cool<00:02:28.410> that

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
they're definitely something cool that

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.259 
they're definitely something cool that

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
could be added into Minecraft but those

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.420 
could be added into Minecraft but those
aren't<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.690> only<00:02:30.870> things<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.769> are<00:02:31.890> added<00:02:32.220> in
