00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
wig but when I put that behind my ear

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.140 
wig but when I put that behind my ear
because<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.920> doesn't<00:02:38.160> have<00:02:38.310> any<00:02:38.340> combs<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:39.030> it

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
because it doesn't have any combs in it

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.720 
because it doesn't have any combs in it
and<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.780> think<00:02:39.840> they<00:02:40.290> come<00:02:40.560> with<00:02:40.709> cones<00:02:40.980> now<00:02:41.340> I

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
and I think they come with cones now I

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.220 
and I think they come with cones now I
think<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.240> got<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.570> on<00:02:42.920> me<00:02:43.920> me<00:02:44.070> back<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.610> day

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
think I got in on me me back in the day

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.230 
think I got in on me me back in the day
I<00:02:46.230> don't<00:02:46.890> put<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> cones<00:02:47.400> in<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:48.000> think<00:02:48.150> it

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
I don't put the cones in it I think it

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.270 
I don't put the cones in it I think it
doesn't<00:02:48.480> have<00:02:48.660> any<00:02:48.870> combs<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.890> put

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
doesn't have any combs in it so I put

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.550 
doesn't have any combs in it so I put
that<00:02:50.640> behind<00:02:50.970> my<00:02:51.300> ear<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.840> kind<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.110> adds<00:02:52.290> a

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
that behind my ear and it kind of adds a

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.550 
that behind my ear and it kind of adds a
little<00:02:53.810> kind<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.840> helps<00:02:55.050> just<00:02:55.170> stay<00:02:55.320> on<00:02:55.350> a

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
little kind of helps just stay on a

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.280 
little kind of helps just stay on a
little<00:02:55.770> bit<00:02:56.270> just<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.480> little<00:02:57.510> bit<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.140> y'all

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290
