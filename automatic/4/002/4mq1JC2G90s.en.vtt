00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
outside of battle I think I'm build up

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.969 
outside of battle I think I'm build up
during<00:01:38.000> your<00:01:38.150> turn<00:01:39.550> you<00:01:40.550> know<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:41.560> this<00:01:42.560> is

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
during your turn you know so this is

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.040 
during your turn you know so this is
just<00:01:43.100> an<00:01:43.310> inherent<00:01:43.790> nig<00:01:43.910> wine<00:01:44.150> I<00:01:44.450> wouldn't

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
just an inherent nig wine I wouldn't

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.859 
just an inherent nig wine I wouldn't
strip<00:01:45.320> about<00:01:45.440> not<00:01:45.950> getting<00:01:46.070> them<00:01:46.750> I've<00:01:47.750> had

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
strip about not getting them I've had

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.300 
strip about not getting them I've had
these<00:01:48.050> in<00:01:48.260> my<00:01:48.380> collection<00:01:48.619> since<00:01:49.310> forever<00:01:50.030> I

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
these in my collection since forever I

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.940 
these in my collection since forever I
just<00:01:52.310> saw<00:01:52.400> it<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.670> was<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.880> cool<00:01:53.119> card<00:01:53.740> but<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:54.800> knew

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
just saw it I was a cool card but I knew

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.940 
just saw it I was a cool card but I knew
it<00:01:55.070> wasn't<00:01:55.220> exactly<00:01:55.460> worth<00:01:55.880> playing<00:01:56.180> because

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
it wasn't exactly worth playing because

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.580 
it wasn't exactly worth playing because
its<00:01:57.950> infant<00:01:58.759> parent<00:01:58.970> nig<00:01:59.270> one<00:01:59.509> especially<00:02:00.350> in

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
its infant parent nig one especially in

its infant parent nig one especially in

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
this format where you can't afford to

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.620 
this format where you can't afford to
take<00:02:04.250> nig<00:02:04.520> ones<00:02:04.789> because<00:02:05.090> every<00:02:05.270> other<00:02:05.360> deck

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
take nig ones because every other deck

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.010 
take nig ones because every other deck
can<00:02:06.440> go<00:02:06.560> plus<00:02:06.830> one<00:02:07.070> on<00:02:07.190> every<00:02:07.310> turn<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:08.020> you

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
can go plus one on every turn and you
