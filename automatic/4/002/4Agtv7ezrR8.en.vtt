star<00:01:19.020> Seraph<00:01:19.290> builds<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.400> thing<00:01:20.580> i<00:01:20.820> saw<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
star Seraph builds and the thing i saw a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.950 
star Seraph builds and the thing i saw a
pure<00:01:22.110> built<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.390> like<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.570> shows<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
pure built so like it just shows that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.469 
pure built so like it just shows that
now<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.439> pure<00:01:25.740> builds<00:01:26.130> are<00:01:26.310> showing<00:01:27.299> more

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
now the pure builds are showing more

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.510 
now the pure builds are showing more
consistency<00:01:28.020> people<00:01:28.770> understanding<00:01:29.369> more

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
consistency people understanding more

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.219 
consistency people understanding more
than<00:01:29.670> those<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.150> decade<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.840> built<00:01:31.049> is

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
than those that decade that built is

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.200 
than those that decade that built is
better<00:01:31.500> than<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.340> star<00:01:32.549> Seraph<00:01:32.759> code<00:01:33.060> is

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
better than the star Seraph code is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.429 
better than the star Seraph code is
little<00:01:33.420> more<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.659> little<00:01:33.689> inconsistent<00:01:34.049> with

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
little more a little inconsistent with

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.260 
little more a little inconsistent with
the<00:01:34.530> stars'<00:01:34.710> arabs<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.820> i<00:01:35.850> don't<00:01:36.090> think

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
the stars' arabs in it so i don't think

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.700 
the stars' arabs in it so i don't think
that'll<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.479> played<00:01:36.780> too<00:01:36.960> much<00:01:37.140> at<00:01:37.259> nationals

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
that'll be played too much at nationals

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.170 
that'll be played too much at nationals
i<00:01:37.799> think<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.070> gonna<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> lot<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.549> pure<00:01:38.820> builds

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
i think is gonna be a lot of pure builds

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.480 
i think is gonna be a lot of pure builds

play out from there so with that being
said<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.869> think<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.290> lot<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.470> time<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.280> decks

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
said I think a lot of time like decks

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.730 
said I think a lot of time like decks
are<00:01:47.670> gonna<00:01:47.759> are<00:01:47.850> gonna<00:01:48.119> really<00:01:48.360> show<00:01:48.810> on

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
are gonna are gonna really show on

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.319 
are gonna are gonna really show on
improving<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.670> show<00:01:50.850> will<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> big

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
improving that show will have a big

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.380 
improving that show will have a big
showing<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> Nationals<00:01:52.970> shadows<00:01:53.970> maybe

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
showing in the Nationals shadows maybe

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.100 
showing in the Nationals shadows maybe
make<00:01:54.630> top<00:01:54.810> 64<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:56.070> uh<00:01:56.299> judging<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.479> think<00:01:57.810> they

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
make top 64 but uh judging I think they

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.560 
make top 64 but uh judging I think they
do<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.409> exactly<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:59.130> as<00:02:00.000> opposed<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.540> know

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
do it exactly I as opposed to you know

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.679 
do it exactly I as opposed to you know
not<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> top<00:02:01.439> 16<00:02:01.920> cut<00:02:02.159> we're<00:02:02.790> weird<00:02:03.240> strife

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
not have a top 16 cut we're weird strife

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.450 
not have a top 16 cut we're weird strife
and<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.079> no<00:02:04.229> draft<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.740> stuff<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.040> do<00:02:05.159> believe

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
and have no draft and stuff I do believe

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.540 
and have no draft and stuff I do believe
that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
that

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.960 
that
you<00:02:06.700> know<00:02:06.820> shadows<00:02:07.350> won't<00:02:08.350> really<00:02:08.970> will

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
you know shadows won't really will

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.370 
you know shadows won't really will
really<00:02:10.180> make<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.540> cut<00:02:10.750> like<00:02:10.900> this<00:02:10.930> holster

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
really make the cut like this holster

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.040 
really make the cut like this holster
that<00:02:11.470> probably<00:02:12.070> make<00:02:12.250> copper<00:02:12.490> into<00:02:12.910> at<00:02:13.420> most

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
that probably make copper into at most

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.900 
that probably make copper into at most
maybe<00:02:14.350> top<00:02:14.650> 16<00:02:15.130> but<00:02:15.310> then<00:02:15.430> they're<00:02:15.550> gonna<00:02:15.610> fall

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
maybe top 16 but then they're gonna fall

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.220 
maybe top 16 but then they're gonna fall
flat<00:02:16.090> they're<00:02:16.360> not<00:02:16.450> gonna<00:02:16.540> make<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.840> past<00:02:17.020> that

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
flat they're not gonna make it past that

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.780 
flat they're not gonna make it past that
clip<00:02:17.710> first<00:02:17.860> on<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.130> other<00:02:18.280> hand<00:02:18.460> I<00:02:18.580> think

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
clip first on the other hand I think

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.130 
clip first on the other hand I think
they're<00:02:18.880> gonna<00:02:18.940> have<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.240> really<00:02:19.480> big<00:02:19.750> showing

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
they're gonna have a really big showing

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.980 
they're gonna have a really big showing
so<00:02:20.710> now<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.180> blue<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.300> turn<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.600> being<00:02:22.780> ruled

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
so now that blue the turn is being ruled

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.810 
so now that blue the turn is being ruled

wear<00:04:39.390> thing<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:39.690> girls<00:04:39.870> are<00:04:39.900> going<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.080> be

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
wear thing that girls are going to be

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.130 
wear thing that girls are going to be
the<00:04:40.290> deck<00:04:40.500> that<00:04:40.680> wins<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:41.070> tournament<00:04:41.250> but

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
the deck that wins the tournament but

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.600 
the deck that wins the tournament but
that's<00:04:43.140> neither<00:04:43.410> here<00:04:43.530> nor<00:04:43.830> there<00:04:44.070> and<00:04:44.520> I

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
that's neither here nor there and I

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
that's neither here nor there and I
think<00:04:44.910> that's<00:04:45.060> how<00:04:45.120> it's<00:04:45.240> going<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:45.420> be<00:04:45.510> though

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
think that's how it's going to be though

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.670 
think that's how it's going to be though
um<00:04:47.150> so<00:04:48.150> yeah<00:04:48.270> that's<00:04:48.870> pretty<00:04:49.050> much<00:04:49.350> like<00:04:49.560> my

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
um so yeah that's pretty much like my

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.130 
um so yeah that's pretty much like my
predictions<00:04:50.190> for<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.610> tournament<00:04:51.060> you<00:04:52.020> know

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
predictions for the tournament you know

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.080 
predictions for the tournament you know
judging<00:04:52.890> by<00:04:52.920> the<00:04:53.040> top<00:04:53.280> five<00:04:53.520> decks<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:54.000> know

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
judging by the top five decks I know

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.270 
judging by the top five decks I know
road<00:04:54.450> next<00:04:54.660> we'll<00:04:54.870> make<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:55.140> I<00:04:55.350> know<00:04:55.410> ritual

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
road next we'll make it I know ritual

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.340 
road next we'll make it I know ritual
bees<00:04:56.520> actually<00:04:56.730> no<00:04:57.030> ritual<00:04:57.480> boobies<00:04:57.720> can<00:04:58.200> be

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
bees actually no ritual boobies can be

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.380 
bees actually no ritual boobies can be
contending<00:04:58.860> tournament<00:04:59.250> I'll<00:04:59.580> can<00:04:59.940> see<00:05:00.210> like

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
contending tournament I'll can see like

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.850 
contending tournament I'll can see like
one<00:05:00.630> or<00:05:00.750> two<00:05:00.780> because<00:05:01.080> they've<00:05:01.260> topped<00:05:01.500> every

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
one or two because they've topped every

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.280 
one or two because they've topped every
time<00:05:02.040> every<00:05:02.190> major<00:05:02.640> events<00:05:03.090> this<00:05:03.210> release<00:05:03.510> so

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
time every major events this release so

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.180 
time every major events this release so
you<00:05:04.380> know<00:05:04.500> which<00:05:04.620> is<00:05:04.710> like<00:05:04.800> three<00:05:05.010> of<00:05:05.070> them

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
you know which is like three of them

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.540 
you know which is like three of them
three<00:05:05.490> four<00:05:05.700> so<00:05:06.270> I<00:05:06.570> think<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.740> can<00:05:08.070> make<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.250> real

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
three four so I think it can make a real

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.880 
three four so I think it can make a real
real<00:05:08.940> impact<00:05:09.450> in<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.900> in<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.350> meta<00:05:10.560> because

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
real impact in the in the meta because

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.280 
real impact in the in the meta because
everybody's<00:05:11.250> going<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:12.090> focused<00:05:12.570> on<00:05:12.720> now

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
everybody's going to so focused on now

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.590 
everybody's going to so focused on now
Cliff<00:05:13.800> words<00:05:14.100> again<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.550> they're<00:05:15.270> gonna<00:05:15.330> stop

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
worrying about the other decks and then

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.740 
worrying about the other decks and then
these<00:05:16.950> acts<00:05:17.160> are<00:05:17.250> gonna<00:05:17.340> make<00:05:17.640> a<00:05:17.700> make<00:05:18.480> a<00:05:18.510> push

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750

cliff works then burning abyss is like
right<00:05:49.350> there<00:05:49.560> and<00:05:49.830> then<00:05:49.890> shadows<00:05:50.190> is<00:05:50.490> right

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
right there and then shadows is right

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.460 
right there and then shadows is right
right<00:05:50.910> after<00:05:51.030> you<00:05:51.300> know<00:05:51.390> it's<00:05:51.540> not<00:05:51.630> the<00:05:51.900> next

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
right after you know it's not the next

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.930 
right after you know it's not the next
people<00:05:52.620> want<00:05:52.830> to<00:05:52.890> play<00:05:52.980> and<00:05:53.310> play<00:05:53.460> really<00:05:53.700> well
