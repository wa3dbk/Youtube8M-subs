00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.690
 It becomes world of tanks video part 157 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.820
 This time in the Sorentia 6 tank destroyer su 100 participation in the tier 6 and 122 mm 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.100
 Large caliber cannon 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.020
 The loading speed is about 10 seconds, so there is a 100 mm gun as well as the vehicle name. 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.500
 It is also possible to get on and have a petti petite fight 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:29.490
 Well, it is a feeling that you like your side 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.490
 This fight is matching of tier 7 condition this time is the bottom 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:40.809
 It has a method that is also suitable for battle start up, but it is forbidden 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.040
 Map is Marinovka but it is good from behind to support from behind and use long range sniper here 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.140
 It is a place 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.120
 I guess it's a mistake 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:53.510
 Something or see about this bee sniper position likely to see the enemy atmosphere in South 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:58.039
 Alone chrome will spot you 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.810
 It is moving to the arrangement of 1 s that I saw and baking bread respectively 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:05.590
 Soi Ya there is no hand to miss this chance 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.409
 At first I was thinking of going to the north side for a while 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.980
 There's also a sniper here for a while 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.110
 I can't beat that hellcat 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:18.600
 This car rice 3 too 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.870
 A boom I can't beat here 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.120
 Ah 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.990
 You're in love 2 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.190
 Follow 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:33.230
 OK I'm waiting for you here and it was the correct answer 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.230
 Kabe 85 Is it late? 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.460
 Here 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:44.330
 Whether it was played today I think I'm in good condition 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:48.390
 Even if it was a fool's ambieces of Sorda's feces, it is a shame 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:54.180
 If you put it out seriously, this kind of monday 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.750
 After all I think I'm shaving now I think that it is the problem of the accuracy of this method 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.930
 Hey 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.930
 Reduce guy of health is whole ton from Iro look noisy now 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:11.670
 It is likely to be able to repeat the same honor and write whether there was any honor in the first place 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.670
 I'll still tell you that he's dead as a show 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:24.160
 Let's go on after a long time, it's been a long time, I guess I'm just fine . 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.150
 Where's your next game? 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.440
 Yappa N'that Mumumie was not visible 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.950
 Mother- American Eighth Issue 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.950
 Here Well then 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:41.189
 I will not remove it anymore You guys are lucky to bring the enemy within my sight range 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.189
 Wonder if feces potato 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:53.940
 Hmm I'm from the second body I will not come out anymore 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.940
 I think that it is the target of 67 lines if it moves out of the visible range 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.980
 I can see the hellcat classic spot positive I 'm back 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:11.680
 It seems that a nice nice view was also aimed firmly 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.550
 I have hoped that there are still undiscovered enemies and I hope to see them going, but I still have more to go 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.530
 The scar 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:23.440
 Especially toward the map east side of the support because it was likely to spare even stay here 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:26.120
 I think I do not think it anymore, but watch out for the Hell Cat of 6 lines and the enemy of the previous roundabout a little 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.750
 Like moving from side to side while moving 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.750
 It is crap 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:40.520
 One or the Mumu a 43 while ago hellcat there were 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:43.570
 It looks like it went down behind the pot positive I don't hit it from the other side and I prefer to move 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.570
 You are hitting me 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.220
 Above either the hot or the like is quite dominant image 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.340
 There is no need to go too hard 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.000
 Try to enter the 78 line river with less strength 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:02.220
 There is so much mobility and what kind of postal administration mood 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.670
 Since the time it as possible up to buy is there may be crap start I pushed teammate 77 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.099
 The view of the line 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.099
 Are you waiting for a machine here ? 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.069
 Yayabe this is also found or avoided 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.280
 After all it was caught by the friend of the day before and passed along the sweet route 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:27.820
 Let's erase the spot once 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:30.780
 Should it be seen in that chrome or that a 43? 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.780
 Let's go to peep 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:42.570
 I wonder was gel Utsuwaka But sorry Mumuano a 43 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.570
 I'm different'll This means that you are already dead gang of today 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:50.789
 I 'm relieved, it's Alamo 's return. 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:56.249
 No wait, now it 's a shot after the spot is broken 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:56.699
 In other words, it doesn't scoop up a lot, but maybe it might be dead without you. 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:03.499
 I guess 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:03.499
 Get outta Do not do not dare Zogununu longer allowed to have Pimpin look 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.830
 Well, nothing's calm and it's not the case that it's just a return to the usual Alamo 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.460
 Or 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.729
 Since when 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:20.009
 And some clouds are getting suspicious 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.009
 It is slightly inferior to me 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.550
 It is found or Germany 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.980
 That chrome or か ー あ ー 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:34.420
 The lane is broken 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:40.750
 And that position doesn't seem like a skill that can be hit from the south perspective 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:42.940
 Though it seemed inferiority, the game was beaten down and the enemy was in a state of antagonism . 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.690
 Is this better? 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:50.860
 However, the number of enemies still remains, so be cautious 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:54.409
 I 'm moving to make a crossfire with allies in the southwest 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.700
 It looks like I've found an enemy 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:59.190
 Hmm 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:01.580
 Sitara Emir This coin is a shame 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.580
 Please 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:12.770
 The rest of the enemy seems to accumulate in the hollow of the zero line and the bushes behind it 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.770
 Or Chimau went to that rock 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.260
 I strike Oh 1 s why here I 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.639
 Hate 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:27.020
 Soya eh Well 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:30.800
 Stop and yes I 'm going to be cross- dressed 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:33.270
 I can only use the dead body of this hell as a shield 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.780
 At least you alone 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.780
 Follow 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:48.200
 Through the sweet root and thought it would be another one near Was will beaten by in So 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.310
 I wonder was gone 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:55.330
 I always go through the sweet route, but the game is here to win 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.330
 I wish I could win I would win 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:07.240
 End of battle This is the victory m get the badge 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:10.510
 At the end of the game, assists were also made at a stretch and it was a traumatic battlefield 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.040
 What was the beginning of the past and the past 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:16.600
 About 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:22.920
 By the way, the expansion parts are glasses for Lamar cooling 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.920
 So thank you for watching this video ended here
