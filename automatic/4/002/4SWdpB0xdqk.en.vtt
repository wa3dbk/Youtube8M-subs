 competence solely the Cabinet 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.180
 the rest of the laws will develop them 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.279
 also the government take the stick figure 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.900
 Kinesh according to his economy minister 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.420
 part of the work the Cabinet will complete in 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.730
 shortest time bills to court 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.380
 people's choices will go package 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.150
 if the servants of the people do not turn 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.099
 government initiatives in subject 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.320
 bidding and will not start artificially 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.059
 it will be possible to slow down the process of Kyrgyzstan 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.210
 meet deadlines in 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.050
 Parliament has an understanding because two 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.860
 committee 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.470
 fiscal international they supported 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.440
 project roadmaps also 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:54.230
 factions have already begun to consider this 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.610
 question and we hope that parliament 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.690
 will consider 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.370
 This is a question of an accelerated version. 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.170
 besides the country as the future 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.930
 a full member of a serious 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.250
 economic union need to enter 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.260
 technical innovations so for example 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.480
 customs should be automated 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.550
 checkpoints reinforced external 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.450
 borders will also appear laboratories 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.860
 veterinary and phytosanitary 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.410
 security of the necessary adaptation 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.970
 377 million dollars 200 agreed 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.380
 highlight the Russian Federation on 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.360
 gratuitous 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.180
 on the provision of missing funds 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.040
 We are currently negotiating with Kazakhstan is 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.650
 the event we had we owe 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.080
 do whatever we enter 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.630
 then I can advise you not to enter here 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.520
 today there is such a situation that 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.340
 we manufactured products we can not 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.700
 sold outside of robusta this 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.130
 It concerns exactly what they do not 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.380
 meet the requirements that 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.360
 are presented for goods or for 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.340
 food products that are produced 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.650
 here rely on the support of Russia 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.900
 maybe not quite ready for integration 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.430
 Kyrgyzstan's economy 500 million 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.830
 dollars the allies will allocate to 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.840
 free of charge still the same 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.810
 Russia will provide as a preferential 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.310
 loan rate not more than one percent 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.370
 credit holidays at least seven 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.140
 years maturity of 20 years as much 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.850
 means of kyrgyzstan on incarnation 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.280
 economic projects are not yet 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.380
 laid 1 billion dollars for 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.720
 comparison this is the loan portfolio of all 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.090
 the country's banks combined they will 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.620
 direct to the development of agro-industrial 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.930
 sewing complex processing 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.190
 metallurgical industry 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.880
 transport trade and housing 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.130
 building 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.709
 then so that the allocated funds are not settled 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.959
 in the pockets will watch members ts and 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.430
 first of all russia domestic 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.430
 corrupt officials hold back if not 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.049
 conscience something international obligations 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.510
 Russian Federation is also on it 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.890
 draws I teach a lot of attention because 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.560
 they had a very bitter experience 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.200
 remember the two thousand and ninth year when they 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.410
 allocated money and this money was 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.150
 ineffective being used in 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.980
 to please 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.410
 specific people what to expect from 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.209
 integration of simple Kyrgyzstanis more often 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.470
 just discussed the issue of prices 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.940
 imported cars 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.519
 despite concerns about tariffs 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.319
 customs clearance in winter cars still remain 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.360
 formerly that is, buy a car for 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.430
 for internal use 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.470
 old price and here are three exports to countries 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.810
 TC will be set at rates 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.110
 unification and so mutual interest have 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.420
 of our neighbors Kazakhstan trang before 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.459
 of all and our country because it is very 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.670
 many cars were bought and already 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.079
 quietly exported to Kazakhstan and 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.670
 Kazakhstani enterprising people were waiting 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.860
 when here we are five minutes to become 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.900
 members of the same union and go car 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.780
 I did not have to be hampered by time alas 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.430
 the tactics they used she 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.110
 fiasco 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.720
 near future at the Crimean customs 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.430
 economic operators will start working 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.870
 companies will provide 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.849
 domestic entrepreneurs 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.370
 customs clearance services legal entity 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.590
 pledges a million to the customs union 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.299
 200 thousand euros and gets the right 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.560
 pass goods across borders at more 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.420
 low rates 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.340
 if such structures in kyrgyzstan are 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.950
 created then imported from third countries 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.549
 things go up no more than 10 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.600
 percent instead of 3 4 euro per kilogram 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.810
 stipulated by the union contract 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.729
 entrepreneur will pay 1 euro 75 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.410
 cents to compare the current rate 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.590
 is 35 cents 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.810
 the difference between 35 cents and 175 110 most 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.500
 that is, the shirt can imitate at 22 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.600

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.550

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.610
 profitable because it will be removed and

 cheaper sugar butter flour from Russia and 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.580
 Kazakhstan and Belarus will be
