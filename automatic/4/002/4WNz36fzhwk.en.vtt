00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.509
 this stadium has lived nights 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:08.040
 exceptional football 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:11.900
 it is the continent's strongest asset 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.000
 although he thinks fernando to the saints of pelé 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.380
 al real de alfredo di stéfano and al 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.380
 argentina when with maradona 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.690
 says that exact saints stronger than the 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.060
 continent 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.160
 now I am fernando niembro I am 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.240
 mariano closs and we are the voices of pes 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.240
 2014 for Argentina 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.129
 for me it means a passion and a 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.230
 profession would give the feeling that the 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.260
 second part 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.020
 I would notice more cold further away 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.730
 made professional by a distance 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.579
 there is definitely a rivalry 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.040
 fierce between the two that distance me 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.670
 It seems that it is an obligation to be 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.019
 accurate to have precision for 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.019
 understand more what is played 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.860
 soccer is part of me 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.360
 very important my life did well in 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.920
 long period but that no more than 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.390
 I would have liked to have been playing 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.600
 so with them with the truly 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.510
 professionals and I think that just 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.030
 so unlink in the part where where 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.950
 I really dedicated myself to this final 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.020
 of regulation time with a draw in 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.119
 the score so the game was going to 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.729
 deciding at the end that allowed them 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.310
 be on many occasions in the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.500
 final of the champions 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.630
 what it means to broadcast a match of 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.840
 virtual football an experience 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.360
 unforgettable was something so so equal so 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.369
 identical they had a golden age in the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.229
 1990s that culminated and quite the 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.460
 hand with what we usually do in 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.409
 I live in the different courts in the 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.420
 different places that was born and left 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.770
 naturally as soon as I got into that 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.770
 world I realized that it is 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.440
 just like the football that was played all 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.380
 the days 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.210
 when there is no football, there is a truth 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.340
 empty a feeling that something is missing 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.770
 and that's why I think it's already so 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.210
 impregnated that ultimately goes from the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.670
 hand consciousness 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.670
 the heat of football always reminded me 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:23.920
 and end a greeting for the fans 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.920
 of pes in Argentina the country of soccer
