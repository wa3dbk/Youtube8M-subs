00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 I'm just this post to this bow to that 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:12.360
 minecraft there are zombies unless you're 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.219
 in enjoyment now two weeks ago I did 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.780
 a video about passives and how it was 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.400
 wait now I'm going to make a video of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.869
 the more hostile than that is a mucus 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.689
 style are damn apellers 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.640
 ally of premiums to mobiles 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.830
 we can know in three ways one 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.779
 when they kill you two when they kill you and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.340
 three when they take your life I do not know are 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.900
 very different and difficult to remember 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.669
 but you'll get used to it, we have several 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.739
 hostile types of mou such as for example 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.809
 those who hate you who love you 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.610
 kill and I want to ride those that are made 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.170
 I lived it, I'm peeing now and the worst 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.790
 all that then that is the last one not 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.920
 they know how to contain themselves among the most hostile 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.989
 we have the zombies the skeletons the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.300
 spiders the plays the link of the dragon the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.070
 winners the links not here the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.660
 clippers the witches the gas and 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.160
 probably the most dangerous of all 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.780
 the epic marc I already know that in the video 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.190
 last I said that the piss him more were not worth 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.989
 for nothing but after seeing this 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.820
 I understood how dangerous they were here 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.140
 I'll leave it in case you want to see it on 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.910
 today we will only talk about hostile mods 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.619
 most dangerous starting with those of 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.420
 skeletons actually decide to put them 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.750
 here not much because they are so dangerous 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.430
 if not 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.110
 because they are extremely annoying or they 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.620
 burst to dates does not let neither that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.620
 I approached them 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.100
 and worse with enchanted boats 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.970
 a little higher on the trolley level 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.530
 or in the ways we have the place that 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.270
 I think they are the most cocky wizards 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.230
 what's for cocky I mean this 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.510
 place hate do not touch me silly mein your 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.160
 feet if they are also a little way 2 and 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.290
 apart from that when they touch with one of 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.940
 your balls let you burn t 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.650
 and I mean your fireballs 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.320
 sick a little higher on the level 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.240
 of danger and danger we have to 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.040
 the wilder but the wilder skeleton 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.660
 but to the wheeler bosses those who 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.610
 they get together three heads of the 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.690
 skeletons to these of this equal everything already 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.349
 that not only attack you 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.349
 [Music] 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.329
 definitely do not know how to make team 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.549
 like me that for ccoo meeting or better 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.229
 said meeting a position higher than 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.360
 these we have the ones in the dragon or 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.890
 rather to the under dragons all 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.660
 we know what makes a dangerous 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.640
 dragon apart that this one regenerates that 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.530
 fly that destroys blocks and that has 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.330
 bodyguards took advantage of the fact that 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.910
 is female to develop a new 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.750
 be able to seduce if you saw the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:33.710
 seduction 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:35.870
 [Music] 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.020
 thank goodness that is horrendous but yes that 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.520
 it would be a problem 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.130
 [Music] 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.320
 and finally the most dangerous of all the 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.090
 the voice of voice is the boss of 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.090
 bosses the gentleman steps on you 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.909
 a very good sign the prism 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.909
 I would like to ask you some questions 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.750
 great tell me ma'am the same 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.750
 consider yourself a serial murderer 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.590
 and I understand what it feels like to be terror 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.590
 of all my necropsy feels good 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.819
 and as he supposed one last thing could 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.530
 give you some words for everything 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.010
 our audience today 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:24.980
 without causing those whose motor as 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:26.450
 I understand tower asks what is the mode 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.340
 hostile that has killed you the most so far 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.959
 to me I think there are creepers is that you've 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.000
 tried so many times that I already lost the 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:47.430
 mind if you think not but lie 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:47.430
 [Music] 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.230

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.700
 click to button I like here below every 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.140

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.500
 reduce although for this we do not need 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.900
 help since we are render 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.490
