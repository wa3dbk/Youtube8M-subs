discuss what kind of color we see I

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.080 
discuss what kind of color we see I
don't<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:41.010> there<00:00:41.250> being<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.550> way<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:41.969> us<00:00:42.000> to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
don't see there being a way for us to

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.319 
don't see there being a way for us to
see<00:00:42.300> two<00:00:42.450> different<00:00:42.780> colors<00:00:43.050> because<00:00:43.770> we're

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
see two different colors because we're

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.000 
see two different colors because we're
good<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.480> each<00:00:45.539> other<00:00:45.719> right<00:00:45.930> yep<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.860> see

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
good for each other right yep if we see

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.110 
good for each other right yep if we see
different<00:00:47.309> colors<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.760> guess<00:00:47.969> our

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
different colors and I guess our

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.880 
different colors and I guess our
relationship<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.690> wasn't<00:00:49.260> meant<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
relationship just wasn't meant to be and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.080 
relationship just wasn't meant to be and
I<00:00:49.950> guess<00:00:50.129> we'll<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.579> break<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:50.969> at

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
I guess we'll just have to break up at

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.310 
I guess we'll just have to break up at
the<00:00:51.180> end<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.449> video<00:00:53.840> back<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> point
