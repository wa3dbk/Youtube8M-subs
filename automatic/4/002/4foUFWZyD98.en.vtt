00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
monstercat while I explore the galaxy

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.610 
monstercat while I explore the galaxy
after<00:03:15.459> some<00:03:15.609> time<00:03:15.849> has<00:03:16.090> gone<00:03:16.239> by<00:03:16.299> I'm<00:03:17.109> finally

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
after some time has gone by I'm finally

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.530 
after some time has gone by I'm finally
back<00:03:17.769> in<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:18.069> kitchen<00:03:18.189> but<00:03:18.700> I<00:03:18.939> didn't<00:03:19.359> decide

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
back in the kitchen but I didn't decide

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.089 
back in the kitchen but I didn't decide
to<00:03:19.599> put<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.900> camera<00:03:20.200> on<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.379> tripod<00:03:20.530> I

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
to put the camera on the tripod I

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.379 
to put the camera on the tripod I
thought<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.459> had<00:03:21.549> every<00:03:21.909> ingredient<00:03:22.090> that

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
thought that I had every ingredient that

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.539 
thought that I had every ingredient that
I<00:03:22.480> would<00:03:22.689> need<00:03:22.870> for<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:23.169> stir<00:03:23.409> fry<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:23.950> instead
