00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.259

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.299
 in us different sensations the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.939

 Respectful minute of silence for all

 those who have left us like alfredo 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.150
 di stéfano is the memory to those with 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.880
 those who share also the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.250
 emotions for our club they no longer 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.710
 They are with us but they always have 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.670
 a very special place in our heart 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.670

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.450
 twenty-one 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.370
 dear partners, we said that we were going to 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.610
 give everything for a new champions and 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.310
 here is the one here is your cup 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.680
 of europe and I want you to know that the 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.710
 We raised together in Lisbon on 24 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.420
 May this tenth European Cup is 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.090
 all of you and of all 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.510
 Real Madrid because the unit is without 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.010
 doubtless our greatest strength 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.600
 I sincerely believe that sometimes we are not 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.760
 fully aware of the 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.070
 transcendence that implies our unity 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.260
 it is true that some try 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.660
 take any issue to generate 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.510
 division for the purpose of making us more 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.030
 weak but the partners of the real madrid- 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.160
 they know their history perfectly and 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.840
 they know about the strategic importance of 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.849
 stability and unity 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.120
 everything we have achieved with this 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.940
 t-shirt throughout his 112 years of 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.640
 history has been based on the strength of the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.370
 union of all of us and of course 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.000
 in that unwavering faith to get 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.610
 challenges that might seem impossible 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.160
 dream and fight until the end united and 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.500
 without surrendering we can never allow 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.140
 that nobody breaks that internal cohesion 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.600
 because it is the essential basis of our 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.360
 successes 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.790
 this tenth and it was for all 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.980
 madridistas an obsession and we have 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.980
 worked constantly and with
