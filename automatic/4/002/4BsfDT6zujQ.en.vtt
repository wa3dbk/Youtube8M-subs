00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.959
 Visit from Japan also at 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.850
 Final training before the HSV game 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.810
 Dozens of ladies , of course, were waiting 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.570
 everything on him 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.759
 atsuto uchida good news too for 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.309
 male Schalke she has the comeback 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.560
 in Frankfurt well and is fit 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.779
 for hamburg if the players like that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.400
 Hunt like in those days then there is 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.680
 instead of the usual press conference 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.390
 media discussion at the training place and 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.519
 huub stevens betrayed surprising 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.720
 his design of the free sunday 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.590
 afternoon I have looked 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.899
 and then I do not have the formula 1 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.570
 looked race so no ball was 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.239
 no, but that's fun too, because of me 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.590
 For example, how does one work? 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.410
 in his team 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.570
 And it's not just the driver of the car 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.090
 important is a whole team and one 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.039
 it is already on top and that 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.230
 I am always fascinated like the people 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.940
 deal with each other and then how 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.489
 also a vote with each other 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:06.750
 and hops knows hat trick vettel 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:10.439
 a red bull time personally a kind 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.140
 and wise of life and that has 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.330
 says something yes our superstars 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.979
 omen for tuesday is the hunter klaas 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.259
 Jan in the last season at 2 2 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.630
 only with a double pack who remembers 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.780
 not the ingenious hacking trick 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.850
 At the winning goal for hyp it is a journey 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.100
 in the past even if the number 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.150
 has removed the known are 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.590
 quite a few have to say the players 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.780
 but already some people yes I have 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.310
 something already belongs to them 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.140
 want to meet me and then even then 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.220
 that 's fun but not more 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.770
 than that was 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.500
 I'm leaving the coach of 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.409
 swing and then you are one 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.360
 competitor hsv worse 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.369
 start between sprint last but 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.409
 setback in dÃ¼sseldorf and at home 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.030
 either hopp or topp keyword 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.310
 constant 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.440
 there is a lot to do there are only 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.409
 few can do that over one 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.119
 all season but they have then 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.240
 then you can invest a bit more 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.069
 for example , see how that did 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.800
 looks at ibrahim affeley 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.330
 the colleagues who are allowed to join soon 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.340
 critical views of reha coach ruwen 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.880
 faller works already tuesday or first 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.430
 Saturday 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.000
 That's a good question I know that 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.400
 not even the wii is running 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.050
 gone that I know it goes up 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.570
 is much better with it but if it is 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.380
 is enough for tomorrow or saturday that must 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.440
 to wait 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.600
 one can be sure a risk is likely 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.480
 be small and controllable 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.900
 the chance in Hamburg to get something 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.330
 definitely bigger 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.190
 about as high as that for visitors 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.190
 from japan for atsuto uchida
