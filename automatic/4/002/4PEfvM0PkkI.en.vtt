 faster green yes let me cure him 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.130
 next year for the greens but why 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.550
 such problems when you can easily 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.680

 this year houses 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.690
 wanting the throne so why did you rate 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.910
 peppers in a separate greenhouse you 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.060
 they used to grow with tomatoes before 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.140
 grown all in one greenhouse 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:46.050

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.769
 there is nothing I bury magazines from 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.980
 I sit reading and reading a woman writes that you 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.360
 think what she came to the conclusion that 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:01.069
 Persians need to separate those they can not stand 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.989
 no neighbors and I think my everything is me 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.860
 on yields somehow up on 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.440
 yield 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.080
 they are tied up very late at the end 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.830
 August, no longer has time to mature 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.230
 They are Aegina Rivermen they need separately and 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.630
 what the experiment showed showed 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.150
 a friend arrived in autumn 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.830
 I brought my own peppers to visit us. 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.230

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.900

 I took all the seeds and planted it 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.470
 asked my husband to say please do 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.079
 I have a hot house that's such a greenhouse, he does not 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.810
 I did so I landed yesterday I have one 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.030
 pepper forces I struck up a yes and 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.609
 already such decent isn't it very 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.540
 Much but looking for notes probably all gardeners 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:54.209
 know that you need to clean everything on the leg 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.150
 you need everything before the fork removes you see 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.180
 developed the point went something gondor to fork 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.910
 there must be a bare leg here you see yes 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.150
 developed points here went a fork over here 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.150
 went twig here twig here in general 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.519
 he began to set off in different directions and to 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.650
 it is necessary to remove everything on the leg 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.280
 completely to bare leg was 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.519
 and all the leaves and bunches are all 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.300
 need to pull out so that the leg was naked 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.580
 because the main harvest all goes here 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.880
 on these extras you see all 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.479
 all in buds and it will clean you 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.849
 force 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.580
 you are not on 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.459
 yes that's all you need to clean up that is 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.619
 theory was confirmed Olga Petrovna 

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:42.080
 confirmed that they go platbands one 

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:44.029
 riverman they do not stand any neighbors 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.249
 leave will not shoot green you 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:49.249
 will leave me orange and 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:52.459
 red and yellow so i want them 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:54.770
 What I brought I want to achieve such 

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:58.099
 to peak everything is planted by science all 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.529

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.210
 what is your very etazhku some 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.509

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.370
 I really like this call 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:40.569
 weapons of us and logically yes I understood him 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:43.330
 itself is very very very boric 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:45.849
 acid i spoon on the bucket but but only 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.879
 this spoon needs to be dissolved in hot 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:51.430
 water because if you put right in 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.699
 bucket of water nodding room temperature 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.280
 then it will not dissolve will be on top 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:59.889
 such swim with lumps they are and 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.400
 fall on a piece of paper then they will eat this one 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:06.009
 spoon in hot water dissolve 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.830
 pour a bucket of 10 liters of water pour out 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:11.889
 it means soluble already violently sour 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.419
 here not then take pollinator pour and 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.340
 child of the field and kia 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.529
 sprinkle tomatoes necessarily 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.020
 process twice to selective 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.750
 no buying ovary tomatoes 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.710
 then there is little else needed 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:29.979
 remains the same trace elements boric 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.589
 Soda manganese tea need 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:36.210
 necessarily at least once in meta 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:39.490
 water the plant with these moments 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:43.210
 teahouse is desperately court for watering for 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.639
 the bucket glasses are bred and 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:49.419
 water the tomatoes so the tomatoes blush 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:51.300
 on the bush and declared green then tomatoes

 I do not want to shoot I want to at least 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.699
 pink and green they are not yet 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.610

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:02.860
 no longer yes everything is no no such 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:07.360
 aroma need to her 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:10.810

 it scorched and my pears grew I was 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.380
 but they were pretty people in general all 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:26.640
 treat all currant bushes 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:29.590
 raspberries are not lazy everyone handles 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.820
 directs high capacity right and walks a 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.820
 handle weigh
