game most of the time that it's just
really<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:04.140> worth<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.619> my<00:02:04.649> opinion

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
really not worth it in my opinion

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.560 
really not worth it in my opinion
especially<00:02:05.549> didn't<00:02:05.970> even<00:02:06.149> run<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> higher

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
especially didn't even run the higher

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.779 
especially didn't even run the higher
streaks<00:02:07.049> if<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.770> run<00:02:08.099> streaks<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.519> usually

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
streaks if I do run streaks I usually

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.820 
streaks if I do run streaks I usually
run<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.060> lower<00:02:09.239> ones<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:09.989> try<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.679> get

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
run the lower ones and just try to get

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.210

through<00:02:10.890> them<00:02:11.190> as<00:02:11.310> many<00:02:11.489> times<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:11.849> possible

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
through them as many times as possible

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.460 
through them as many times as possible

but here you see me I've been working

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.620 
but here you see me I've been working
this<00:02:16.590> area<00:02:16.800> out<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:18.120> starting<00:02:18.269> to<00:02:18.480> get<00:02:18.569> a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
this area out and it's starting to get a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.509 
this area out and it's starting to get a
little<00:02:18.720> hot<00:02:19.019> here<00:02:19.380> as<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.650> get<00:02:19.800> lucky<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.340> turn

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
little hot here as I get lucky to turn

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.030

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.949 
this area and because trust me if you
stay<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.610> these<00:02:51.060> two<00:02:51.269> areas<00:02:51.299> in<00:02:51.870> a

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
stay in these two areas in a

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.370 
stay in these two areas in a
free-for-all<00:02:52.500> game<00:02:52.860> then<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:54.780> usually<00:02:55.140> a

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
free-for-all game then it's usually a

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.470 
free-for-all game then it's usually a
lot<00:02:55.709> quieter<00:02:56.010> obviously<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.000> domination

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
lot quieter obviously the domination

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.569 
lot quieter obviously the domination
another<00:02:57.900> game<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:58.530> if<00:02:58.829> you<00:02:59.010> can<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.190> stay<00:02:59.549> in

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
another game so if you can just stay in

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.670 
another game so if you can just stay in
these<00:02:59.820> two<00:02:59.970> areas<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.480> can<00:03:00.600> just<00:03:00.810> easily<00:03:01.109> hold

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
these two areas you can just easily hold

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.729 
these two areas you can just easily hold
down<00:03:02.010> your<00:03:02.450> opponents<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.510> pretty<00:03:04.380> much<00:03:04.440> go

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
down your opponents and pretty much go

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.650 
down your opponents and pretty much go
to<00:03:04.799> town<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:05.130> them<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.880> makes<00:03:05.910> for<00:03:06.480> some

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
to town on them and it makes for some

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.300 
to town on them and it makes for some
pretty<00:03:06.690> easy<00:03:07.109> wins<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> pretty<00:03:07.890> good

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
pretty easy wins and a pretty good

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.960 
pretty easy wins and a pretty good

little<00:03:17.730> bit<00:03:18.030> confused<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.780> probably<00:03:19.709> should

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
little bit confused and probably should

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.460 
little bit confused and probably should
die<00:03:20.190> but<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.239> get<00:03:21.450> pretty<00:03:21.660> lucky<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:22.200> have<00:03:22.290> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
die but I get pretty lucky to have the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.370 
die but I get pretty lucky to have the
overpowered<00:03:23.100> fmg9<00:03:23.430> s<00:03:24.060> in<00:03:24.150> my<00:03:24.269> hand<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:25.019> I'm

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
overpowered fmg9 s in my hand and I'm

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.830 
overpowered fmg9 s in my hand and I'm
able<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.769> spray<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.130> guy<00:03:26.250> down<00:03:26.519> is<00:03:27.209> he<00:03:27.420> he

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
able to spray the guy down is he he

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.599 
able to spray the guy down is he he
definitely<00:03:28.049> surprises<00:03:28.890> me<00:03:29.069> I<00:03:29.100> thought<00:03:29.340> he<00:03:29.489> was

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
definitely surprises me I thought he was

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.069 
definitely surprises me I thought he was
coming<00:03:29.970> up<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.329> steps<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.660> don't<00:03:30.810> know<00:03:30.870> if<00:03:30.959> it's

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
coming up the steps I don't know if it's

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.289 
coming up the steps I don't know if it's
right<00:03:31.230> here<00:03:31.530> or<00:03:31.709> four<00:03:32.459> chariots<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.970> think<00:03:33.209> it's

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
right here or four chariots I think it's

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.420
