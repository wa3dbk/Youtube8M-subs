00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.030
 we go to the house of the god now I'm all 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.430
 hello broadcast parody of scientific 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.240
 noobs and I lead her time as you 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.369
 might notice 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.500
 Sana no no course of sex is not Max 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.660
 brother and this means that I am today 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.449
 release I will lead one today 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.630
 release you are waiting for two experiences first experience 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.030
 we will fry the egg on the bulbs and the second 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.520
 experience we will make a smoke bomb 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.969
 from the improvised ingredients for the first 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.260
 experience we need an egg 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:49.480
 a knife to break the archer cup 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.969
 plastic and a light bulb is also a source 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.280
 nutrition but also doses. 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:00.850
 let's start the experiment 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:05.430
 break egg all 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:11.640
 egg we broke further 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:15.570
 we turn on the light bulb we turn on 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:20.240
 the light bulb is burning and putting in 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.240
 light bulb actually in the egg 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.950
 because the cup is very 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.970
 which are unstable install it was not 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:39.040
 very easy but in the end I 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:41.670
 still could put it exactly and here 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.670
 what came of it 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.140
 waiting for our submission 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:00.880
 that's so sorry 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.750
 the show sounds the same 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.220
 signaled to me that yes this 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.210
 the thing works and it really works 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.830
 it was sounds 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.830
 fried eggs 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.680
 cup tide caps think better 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.950
 I canâ€™t cook like that 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:52.650
 disable the light bulb try to pull out 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:55.740
 egg surface about download 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.100
 I didn't even think what was going to be washed 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:02.580
 really fry I was quite 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.420
 surprised when I saw that the bulbs 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:12.150
 really fried the egg and still quite 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:14.700
 fit for food I even 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.310
 I do not think it will turn out 60 watt light bulb 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:23.790
 works 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:30.840
 try it to taste and smell like an egg 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:33.170
 and yet juice extraction of some new 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.070
 tastes give me back 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.200
 Is that salt forgot since even 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.580
 I did not think what would happen but in the very 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.980
 not bad get down to the second 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.620
 experiment 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:58.730
 what do we do we take a pill 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:04:01.640
 analgin not one but several players 56 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.830
 I think six will be enough and we 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.930
 take gidroperit gidroperita take a 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:12.610
 later now we do with analgin 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:17.840
 about the following we take and kroshevo 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:24.699
 analgin we painted almost all of this 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.699
 the night we gather it in a handful 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:39.650
 so everything mannerheim we have is ready with 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:44.660
 hydroperit pass we carry out all the same 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.080
 the operation itself will wrap up the whole thing here 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.080
 so here 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.210
 so here 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:05:08.090
 so here and now here 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:14.360
 break handing out turned out a lot 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:16.360
 this jump is by no means 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.780
 mix these two jumps 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.810
 until you want them 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.990
 interacted 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.850
 why show you later 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.699
 I will explain a little bit what I'm doing then I 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.530
 I fall asleep in one hydro 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.850
 analgin from another box to not 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.580
 move randomly 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.120
 since at temperatures above 25 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.710
 degrees 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.710
 they will interact all 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:51.820
 experience is basically ready left now 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:55.750
 go out and experience the whole thing 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.750
 we fall asleep in this jar hydrogel 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:11.539
 since the reaction is possible only at 25 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:13.520
 degrees celsius but further unfortunately 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.610
 I will be a strong wind and I could not 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.030
 recognize what i recorded on camera 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:23.750
 so I will explain briefly what I did I 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:26.960
 little arson this mixture to 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:29.870
 increase the reaction temperature because 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.840
 the reaction of hydroperitol with analginum can 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:36.229
 only be at temperatures above 25 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.629
 degrees even manganese i 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:43.310
 poured almost half the banks 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:45.800
 the floor of a jar of a jar did not help her 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.159
 the reaction did not start give potassium permanganate 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.039
 a little bit waking by but it's nothing 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:54.469
 no big deal but grandma 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.629
 started and she quite well smoked 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:07:00.650
 if you had more ingredients she would 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:03.349
 smoked longer basically as a result in her 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.659
 it turned out the substance that should 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:09.710
 it turned out to be such 

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:14.199
 caramel flock liquid and that's what 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.199
 left in a jar after the reaction 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:37.940
 as supertooth 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:39.950
 we take this whole thing this one 

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.930
 gone to the end of the scientific but you have to go 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.640
 say goodbye subscribe to the channel 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:48.110
 subscribe to the channel or stb 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:53.470
 Thank you all for watching everything under 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:53.470
 package throwing garbage as it should be 

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.370
 there is not anyone
