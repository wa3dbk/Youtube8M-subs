00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.660 
can actually do some damage then I
follow<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:53.100> about<00:01:53.759> half<00:01:54.090> my<00:01:54.119> archers<00:01:54.689> I

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
follow up with about half my archers I

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.940 
follow up with about half my archers I
usually<00:01:56.670> wait<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.210> mortars<00:01:57.770> done<00:01:58.770> its

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
usually wait to the mortars done its

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.889 
usually wait to the mortars done its
first<00:01:59.219> couple<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.670> shots<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.299> then<00:02:00.570> I'll<00:02:00.659> drop

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
first couple of shots and then I'll drop

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.749 
first couple of shots and then I'll drop
my<00:02:00.960> wall<00:02:01.290> breakers<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.920> break<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> wall<00:02:02.399> make

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
my wall breakers to break the wall make

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.499 
my wall breakers to break the wall make
sure<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> mortar<00:02:03.329> doesn't<00:02:03.600> take<00:02:03.719> them<00:02:03.840> out

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
sure the mortar doesn't take them out

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.940 
sure the mortar doesn't take them out
once<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.659> break<00:02:06.719> through<00:02:07.229> i'll<00:02:07.380> usually<00:02:07.560> drop

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
once I break through i'll usually drop

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.710 
once I break through i'll usually drop
my<00:02:08.129> troops<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.700> rest<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.970> my<00:02:09.030> troops<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.479> that

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
my troops the rest of my troops in that

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.309 
my troops the rest of my troops in that
area<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.289> pretty<00:02:11.280> much<00:02:11.420> overwhelm<00:02:12.420> one<00:02:13.110> or

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
area and pretty much overwhelm one or

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.760 
area and pretty much overwhelm one or
two

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
two

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.830 
two
sides<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.220> base<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.700> never<00:02:15.060> go<00:02:15.270> around<00:02:15.660> all

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
sides of the base I never go around all

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.740 
sides of the base I never go around all
four<00:02:16.140> just<00:02:16.740> because<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.280> do<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:18.000> usually

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
four just because if I do that I usually

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.260 
four just because if I do that I usually
would<00:02:19.380> be<00:02:19.830> losing<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.400> lot<00:02:20.520> of<00:02:20.580> troops<00:02:20.850> down<00:02:21.060> on

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
would be losing a lot of troops down on

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.970 
would be losing a lot of troops down on
the<00:02:21.450> bottom<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.020> archer<00:02:22.530> tower<00:02:22.710> the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
the bottom to the archer tower the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.820 
the bottom to the archer tower the
cannons<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.670> now<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.690> troops<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:25.650> go

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
cannons and now the troops can just go

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.390 
cannons and now the troops can just go
in<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.070> overwhelm<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.970> base<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.950> barbs<00:02:29.250> that

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
in and overwhelm the base the barbs that

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.400 
in and overwhelm the base the barbs that
went<00:02:29.580> in<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:30.000> got<00:02:30.270> took<00:02:30.870> up<00:02:31.050> some<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.350> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
went in just got took up some of the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.310 
went in just got took up some of the
splash<00:02:31.650> damage<00:02:31.920> from<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.280> mortar<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.320> my

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
splash damage from the mortar and my

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.140 
splash damage from the mortar and my
archers<00:02:34.710> are<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:35.040> owning<00:02:35.370> right<00:02:35.940> now<00:02:36.090> you

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
archers are just owning right now you

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.660 
archers are just owning right now you
can<00:02:36.420> see<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.990> just<00:02:37.230> demolish<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.400> rest<00:02:38.580> of

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
can see you just demolish the rest of

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.570 
can see you just demolish the rest of
the<00:02:38.730> base<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:40.140> barbarians<00:02:40.740> pretty<00:02:41.100> much<00:02:41.250> did

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
the base the barbarians pretty much did

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.490 
the base the barbarians pretty much did
what<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.790> wanted<00:02:42.090> them<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.360> do<00:02:42.510> which<00:02:42.990> is<00:02:43.020> eat<00:02:43.380> up

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
what I wanted them to do which is eat up

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.230 
what I wanted them to do which is eat up
the<00:02:43.590> splash<00:02:43.860> damage<00:02:44.190> from<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.610> wizard<00:02:44.790> towers

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
the splash damage from the wizard towers

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.360 
the splash damage from the wizard towers
and<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.570> mortars<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.710> archers<00:02:47.130> can

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
and the mortars so that the archers can

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.800 
and the mortars so that the archers can
go<00:02:47.520> in<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.790> do<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.030> rest<00:02:48.210> of<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> damage

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
go in and do the rest of the damage

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.720 
go in and do the rest of the damage
that's<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.710> main<00:02:49.890> thing<00:02:49.920> that's<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.520> name<00:02:50.700> of

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
that's the main thing that's the name of

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.420 
that's the main thing that's the name of
the<00:02:50.910> game<00:02:51.060> in<00:02:51.300> this<00:02:51.660> strategy<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.230> just
