on the ipad now i know there have been
quite<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.940> few<00:00:12.030> rumors<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.809> new<00:00:12.960> ipad<00:00:13.349> 2<00:00:13.590> but

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
quite a few rumors on the new ipad 2 but

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.070 
quite a few rumors on the new ipad 2 but
i<00:00:14.099> decided<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.610> make<00:00:14.759> my<00:00:14.790> own<00:00:14.940> video<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.839> what<00:00:16.049> i

i decided to make my own video of what i

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.140 
i decided to make my own video of what i
think<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.529> likely<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.160> unlikely<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.970> happen

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
think is likely and unlikely to happen

display which although the same size

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.869

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
experience more RAM memory and obviously

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.220 
experience more RAM memory and obviously
a<00:00:49.620> better<00:00:49.980> processor<00:00:50.579> most<00:00:51.420> likely<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.899> Apple

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
a better processor most likely the Apple

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.939 
a better processor most likely the Apple
a5<00:00:52.489> which<00:00:53.489> will<00:00:54.449> permit<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:56.570> better<00:00:57.570> gaming

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
might happen and now with the verizon

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.620 
might happen and now with the verizon
change<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:07.040> I'm<00:01:08.040> inclined<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:09.180> will

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
change I I'm inclined to think it will

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.160 
change I I'm inclined to think it will
happen<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:11.360> having<00:01:12.360> three<00:01:12.570> versions<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
happen is having three versions of the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.969 
happen is having three versions of the
iPad<00:01:13.500> namely<00:01:14.490> Wi-Fi<00:01:15.299> Wi-Fi<00:01:15.900> plus<00:01:16.320> 3G<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
Wi-Fi + cdma or as we all know Apple

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.530 
Wi-Fi + cdma or as we all know Apple
they<00:01:22.080> might<00:01:22.350> include<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.759> three<00:01:24.770> chips<00:01:25.770> into

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
they might include all three chips into

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.350 
they might include all three chips into
just<00:01:27.540> one<00:01:27.720> version<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.439> wish<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.360> would

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
just one version what I wish and would

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.469 
just one version what I wish and would
like<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.720> iPad<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.970> is<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.150> better

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
like the iPad to have is a better

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.050 
like the iPad to have is a better
oleophobic<00:01:34.049> screen<00:01:34.710> such<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
oleophobic screen such as the one on the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.310 
oleophobic screen such as the one on the
iphone<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:38.360> those<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:40.020> used

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
iphone for those of you that have used

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.380 
iphone for those of you that have used
the<00:01:40.470> iphone<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:41.070> my<00:01:41.490> know<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:43.020> can

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
the iphone for my know that you can

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.719 
the iphone for my know that you can
swipe<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.799> for<00:01:46.799> quite<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.009> while<00:01:47.189> before<00:01:47.250> it

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
swipe it for quite a while before it

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.380 
swipe it for quite a while before it
gets<00:01:47.939> smudging<00:01:48.390> off<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.579> ipod<00:01:50.970> could

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
gets smudging off so the ipod could

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.260 
gets smudging off so the ipod could
definitely<00:01:51.630> use<00:01:52.490> finish<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:56.210> thing<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
definitely use finish and the thing that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.230 
definitely use finish and the thing that
people<00:01:57.990> are<00:01:58.170> expecting<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.040> i<00:01:59.070> don't<00:01:59.490> see<00:01:59.670> me

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
people are expecting but i don't see me

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.830 
people are expecting but i don't see me
using<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.640> it's<00:02:02.640> also<00:02:02.820> not<00:02:03.180> very<00:02:03.240> likely<00:02:03.659> that

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
using and it's also not very likely that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.290 
using and it's also not very likely that
it'll<00:02:04.110> happen<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> rear<00:02:05.189> facing<00:02:05.219> camera<00:02:07.280> but

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
it'll happen is a rear facing camera but

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.059 
it'll happen is a rear facing camera but
do<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.390> actually<00:02:09.420> see<00:02:09.989> yourself<00:02:10.410> taking<00:02:10.800> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
do you actually see yourself taking a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.970 
do you actually see yourself taking a
picture<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.730> street<00:02:12.090> with<00:02:12.420> a

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
picture on the street with a

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.210 
picture on the street with a
an<00:02:13.040> inch<00:02:13.280> device<00:02:13.519> I<00:02:14.620> mean<00:02:15.620> it's<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.950> smallest

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
an inch device I mean it's the smallest

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.960 
an inch device I mean it's the smallest
camera<00:02:16.580> in<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.760> world<00:02:16.909> isn't<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:19.220> now<00:02:19.760> that

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
camera in the world isn't it so now that

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.910 
camera in the world isn't it so now that
I<00:02:20.030> talked<00:02:20.299> about<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.720> features<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.110> will

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
I talked about the features that will

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.059 
I talked about the features that will
most<00:02:22.159> likely<00:02:22.400> happen<00:02:23.200> let<00:02:24.200> me<00:02:24.319> let<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.560> in<00:02:24.709> on

the<00:02:25.459> dough's<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.940> think<00:02:26.360> are<00:02:26.650> unlikely<00:02:27.650> to

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
the dough's I think are unlikely to

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.900 
the dough's I think are unlikely to
happen<00:02:29.709> everyone's<00:02:30.709> talking<00:02:31.190> about<00:02:31.280> an<00:02:31.549> SD

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
happen everyone's talking about an SD

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.289 
happen everyone's talking about an SD
card<00:02:31.940> slot<00:02:32.569> but<00:02:32.959> knowing<00:02:33.319> apple<00:02:34.209> where<00:02:35.209> are

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
card slot but knowing apple where are

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.140 
card slot but knowing apple where are
they<00:02:35.420> gonna<00:02:35.599> fit<00:02:35.870> like<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:37.340> don't<00:02:37.549> have<00:02:37.790> much

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
they gonna fit like you don't have much

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.890 
they gonna fit like you don't have much
room<00:02:38.390> on<00:02:38.599> the<00:02:38.750> side<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.970> they<00:02:40.970> will<00:02:41.209> not<00:02:41.360> make

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
room on the side and they will not make

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.289 
room on the side and they will not make
it<00:02:42.110> thicker<00:02:42.470> just<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.040> fit<00:02:43.190> an<00:02:43.310> SD<00:02:43.670> card<00:02:43.700> slot

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
it thicker just to fit an SD card slot

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.860 
it thicker just to fit an SD card slot
they<00:02:45.110> have<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.500> adapter<00:02:46.430> for<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.879> another

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
they have the adapter for that another

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.130 
they have the adapter for that another
thing<00:02:48.140> would<00:02:48.349> be<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.829> Thunderbolt<00:02:49.370> port<00:02:50.140> it

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
thing would be the Thunderbolt port it

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.890 
thing would be the Thunderbolt port it
just<00:02:51.680> came<00:02:52.010> out<00:02:52.190> when<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.000> new<00:02:53.209> macbook<00:02:53.420> pros

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
just came out when the new macbook pros

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.610 
just came out when the new macbook pros
and<00:02:54.910> they<00:02:55.910> might<00:02:56.239> get<00:02:56.569> market<00:02:57.049> share<00:02:57.260> for<00:02:57.470> it

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
and they might get market share for it

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.949 
and they might get market share for it
by<00:02:58.099> putting<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.549> on<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.849> ipad<00:02:59.180> but<00:02:59.420> again<00:02:59.690> is

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
by putting it on the ipad but again is

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.069 
by putting it on the ipad but again is
there<00:03:00.319> room<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.890> i<00:03:01.599> guess<00:03:02.599> we'll<00:03:02.750> have<00:03:02.870> to

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
there room for it i guess we'll have to

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.759 
there room for it i guess we'll have to
see<00:03:04.000> ipad<00:03:05.000> in<00:03:05.180> two<00:03:05.359> colors<00:03:05.840> that's

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
see ipad in two colors that's

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.220

interesting<00:03:07.400> um<00:03:07.819> I<00:03:08.810> know<00:03:09.650> what<00:03:10.640> did<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:10.879> say

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
interesting um I know what did you say

interesting um I know what did you say
would<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.349> like<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.920> white<00:03:13.160> iPad<00:03:13.940> another

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
would you like the white iPad another

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.890 
would you like the white iPad another
thing<00:03:15.019> would<00:03:15.200> be<00:03:15.349> more<00:03:15.890> flash<00:03:16.160> storage

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
thing would be more flash storage

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.909 
thing would be more flash storage
considering<00:03:17.900> they<00:03:18.019> have<00:03:18.549> 64<00:03:19.549> 128<00:03:20.299> and<00:03:20.660> 256<00:03:21.139> on

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
considering they have 64 128 and 256 on

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.140 
considering they have 64 128 and 256 on
the<00:03:22.160> macbook<00:03:22.340> air<00:03:24.340> could<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.459> be<00:03:25.489> that<00:03:25.669> they

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
the macbook air could it be that they

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.449 
the macbook air could it be that they
put<00:03:26.500> iron<00:03:28.120> 128<00:03:29.120> as<00:03:29.389> well<00:03:29.599> in<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.079> iPad<00:03:30.709> it

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
put iron 128 as well in the iPad it

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.830 
put iron 128 as well in the iPad it
might<00:03:32.150> happen<00:03:32.359> uh<00:03:33.940> but<00:03:34.940> we'll<00:03:35.510> have<00:03:35.599> to<00:03:35.660> wait

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
might happen uh but we'll have to wait

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.289 
might happen uh but we'll have to wait
and<00:03:35.959> see<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:38.410> certainly<00:03:39.410> most<00:03:40.030> unlikely<00:03:41.030> to

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
and see and certainly most unlikely to

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.229 
and see and certainly most unlikely to
happen<00:03:41.510> is<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.620> fact<00:03:42.829> that<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.220> ipad<00:03:43.340> will<00:03:44.030> be

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
happen is the fact that the ipad will be

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.509 
happen is the fact that the ipad will be
split<00:03:44.569> into<00:03:44.780> three<00:03:45.169> or<00:03:45.410> at<00:03:46.040> least<00:03:46.280> more<00:03:46.459> than

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
split into three or at least more than

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.009 
split into three or at least more than
one<00:03:46.849> screen<00:03:47.510> size<00:03:48.250> but<00:03:49.630> Apple<00:03:50.630> is<00:03:50.690> not<00:03:50.840> going

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
one screen size but Apple is not going

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.580 
one screen size but Apple is not going
to<00:03:51.079> do<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.230> I<00:03:51.680> mean<00:03:52.040> they<00:03:52.160> made<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.459> ipad<00:03:52.880> 2

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
to do that I mean they made the ipad 2

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.339 
to do that I mean they made the ipad 2
separate<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:54.709> from<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:55.959> iphone<00:03:56.959> and<00:03:57.319> the

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
separate it from the iphone and the

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.979 
separate it from the iphone and the
macbooks<00:03:58.010> if<00:03:58.340> they<00:03:58.970> make<00:03:59.209> more<00:03:59.480> screen<00:03:59.750> sizes

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
macbooks if they make more screen sizes

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.460 
macbooks if they make more screen sizes
then<00:04:00.980> what's<00:04:01.790> everyone<00:04:02.120> going<00:04:02.299> to<00:04:02.389> buy<00:04:02.569> leave
