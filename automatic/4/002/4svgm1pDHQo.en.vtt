00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720

cleaned

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.560 
cleaned
uh<00:00:34.070> first<00:00:35.070> off<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.790> start<00:00:36.030> by<00:00:36.210> putting

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
uh first off I just start by putting

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.170 
uh first off I just start by putting
down<00:00:36.720> a<00:00:38.390> towel<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:39.989> try<00:00:40.380> to<00:00:40.700> minimize<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.410 
down a towel so you try to minimize the
scratches<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:44.329> don't<00:00:45.410> see<00:00:46.410> too<00:00:46.590> many<00:00:46.710> scratches

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
scratches I don't see too many scratches

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.510 
scratches I don't see too many scratches
when<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> do<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:49.190> well<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.399> have

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
when I do this well if you have

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.590 
when I do this well if you have
absolutely<00:00:51.090> mint<00:00:51.300> helmet<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:54.090> may<00:00:54.239> want<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
absolutely mint helmet you may want to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.920 
absolutely mint helmet you may want to
do<00:00:55.200> this<00:00:55.350> outside<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:56.129> your<00:00:56.280> hose<00:00:56.430> or

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.000 

someplace<00:01:00.930> where<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.410> not<00:01:01.500> getting<00:01:01.710> banged

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
someplace where it's not getting banged

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.810 
someplace where it's not getting banged
around<00:01:02.160> as<00:01:02.460> much<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.329> would<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:03.989> sink

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
around as much as you would in the sink

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.630 
around as much as you would in the sink
so<00:01:06.619> you<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:08.420> soak<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.600> helmet<00:01:10.369> with<00:01:11.369> water

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
so you just soak your helmet with water

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.249 
so you just soak your helmet with water
absolutely<00:01:12.479> dread<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:14.330> then<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:16.020> use

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
absolutely dread and then just use

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.450 
absolutely dread and then just use
regular<00:01:17.300> shampoo

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.929 

so<00:01:21.970> this<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.540> blackberry

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.830 

so<00:01:26.509> you<00:01:26.600> put<00:01:27.259> your<00:01:27.289> shampoo<00:01:27.859> on<00:01:28.689> and<00:01:29.689> you<00:01:29.810> just

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
so you put your shampoo on and you just

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.399 
so you put your shampoo on and you just
work<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.409> in<00:01:30.530> with<00:01:30.710> your<00:01:30.829> fingers<00:01:32.229> that's<00:01:33.229> how

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
work it in with your fingers that's how

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.059 
work it in with your fingers that's how
I<00:01:33.439> do<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:33.770> I<00:01:34.509> think<00:01:35.509> a<00:01:35.689> bristle<00:01:36.590> brush<00:01:36.619> would

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
I do it I think a bristle brush would

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.429 
I do it I think a bristle brush would
probably<00:01:37.490> abrade<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.299> material<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.259> break

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
probably abrade the material and break

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.429 
probably abrade the material and break
it<00:01:39.619> down<00:01:39.649> so<00:01:41.979> you're<00:01:42.979> you<00:01:43.759> soak<00:01:44.030> it<00:01:44.289> put<00:01:45.289> your

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
it down so you're you soak it put your

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.770 
it down so you're you soak it put your
shampoo<00:01:45.829> in<00:01:46.039> you<00:01:46.880> probably<00:01:47.149> have<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.359> restock

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
shampoo in you probably have to restock

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.959 
shampoo in you probably have to restock
it<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:48.469> want<00:01:48.649> to<00:01:48.770> keep<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.490> material

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
it you want to keep the material

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.230 
it you want to keep the material
absolutely<00:01:50.689> drenched<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:52.880> work<00:01:53.030> your

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
absolutely drenched and you work your

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.309 
absolutely drenched and you work your
way<00:01:53.270> through<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.929> whole<00:01:54.109> helmet<00:01:56.319> catching

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
way through the whole helmet catching

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.369 
way through the whole helmet catching
every<00:01:57.560> little<00:01:57.799> part<00:01:58.689> and<00:01:59.689> then<00:01:59.840> you<00:01:59.959> rinse<00:02:00.140> it

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:00.379 
every little part and then you rinse it

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:03.429 
every little part and then you rinse it
