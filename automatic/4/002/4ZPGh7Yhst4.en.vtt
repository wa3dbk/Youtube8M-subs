incredible<00:02:47.490> is<00:02:47.970> probably<00:02:48.390> one<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.900> best

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
sounding cars in the game in my opinion

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.300 
sounding cars in the game in my opinion
and<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:51.959> having<00:02:52.260> no<00:02:52.500> she's<00:02:52.740> putting<00:02:53.100> power

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
and it's having no she's putting power

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.340 
and it's having no she's putting power
down<00:02:53.490> third<00:02:54.000> gear<00:02:54.240> I<00:02:54.420> don't<00:02:54.780> really<00:02:54.959> need<00:02:55.200> to

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
down third gear I don't really need to

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.990 
down third gear I don't really need to
use<00:02:55.500> fourth<00:02:55.800> gear<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.100> my<00:02:56.190> opinion<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.850> can

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
use fourth gear in my opinion you can

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.090 
use fourth gear in my opinion you can
probably<00:02:57.450> get<00:02:57.570> 4th<00:02:57.870> gear<00:02:58.020> power<00:02:58.320> down<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:59.010> it

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
probably get 4th gear power down but it

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.250 
probably get 4th gear power down but it
won't<00:02:59.280> allow<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.510> do<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.660> burnout<00:03:01.080> in<00:03:01.200> a

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
won't allow you to do a burnout in a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.449 
won't allow you to do a burnout in a
straight<00:03:01.500> line<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:01.890> really<00:03:02.190> have<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.370> be

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
straight line so you really have to be

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.640 
straight line so you really have to be
drifting<00:03:02.940> if<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.209> want<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.510> be<00:03:03.600> going<00:03:03.780> in

traction<00:03:09.330> pretty<00:03:09.870> well<00:03:10.230> but<00:03:10.920> sometimes<00:03:11.430> it

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
traction pretty well but sometimes it

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.810 
traction pretty well but sometimes it
does<00:03:12.060> struggle<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.840> get<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.500> power<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.580> spin

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
does struggle to get that power to spin

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.870 
does struggle to get that power to spin

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
not that thick skin i'll probably get

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.450 
not that thick skin i'll probably get
hypothermia<00:04:30.090> if<00:04:30.599> i<00:04:30.720> try<00:04:30.990> any<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.380> that<00:04:31.470> which

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
hypothermia if i try any of that which

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.090 
hypothermia if i try any of that which
is<00:04:32.490> why<00:04:32.760> i<00:04:32.789> will<00:04:33.240> not<00:04:33.479> try<00:04:33.870> any<00:04:34.169> of<00:04:34.289> it<00:04:34.530> and

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
is why i will not try any of it and

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.590 
is why i will not try any of it and
I will<00:04:35.280> just<00:04:35.490> attempt<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:35.910> drift<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.300> car<00:04:36.480> and

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600

you may notice I'm a little bit all over
the<00:04:38.400> place<00:04:38.460> when<00:04:38.790> drifting<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.210> f12<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.660> that

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
the place when drifting the f12 and that

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.830 
the place when drifting the f12 and that
is<00:04:40.410> simple<00:04:40.920> um<00:04:41.130> it's<00:04:41.670> a<00:04:41.940> lot<00:04:42.120> different<00:04:42.330> okay

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
is simple um it's a lot different okay

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.260 
is simple um it's a lot different okay
here's<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.170> thing<00:04:43.370> um<00:04:44.370> death<00:04:44.910> toll<00:04:45.120> is<00:04:45.210> a

here's the thing um death toll is a
really<00:04:45.600> really<00:04:45.630> good<00:04:46.020> drift<00:04:46.260> car<00:04:46.470> in<00:04:46.560> my

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
really really good drift car in my

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.230 
really really good drift car in my
opinion<00:04:46.950> but<00:04:47.220> it<00:04:47.490> is<00:04:47.640> one<00:04:47.850> of<00:04:47.880> those<00:04:48.030> drift

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
opinion but it is one of those drift

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.610 
opinion but it is one of those drift
cars<00:04:48.450> that<00:04:48.600> takes<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:48.930> bit<00:04:49.080> of<00:04:49.110> getting<00:04:49.200> used<00:04:49.380> to

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
cars that takes a bit of getting used to

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.040 
cars that takes a bit of getting used to
certain<00:04:49.920> a<00:04:50.280> lot<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.240> drift<00:04:51.540> cars<00:04:51.750> have

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
certain a lot of drift cars have

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.510 
certain a lot of drift cars have
different<00:04:52.410> drifting<00:04:52.740> styles<00:04:53.070> sons<00:04:53.310> have

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
different drifting styles sons have

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.040 
different drifting styles sons have
similar<00:04:54.000> this<00:04:54.210> is<00:04:54.390> one<00:04:54.540> of<00:04:54.570> those<00:04:54.690> cars<00:04:54.930> that

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
similar this is one of those cars that

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.380 
similar this is one of those cars that
once<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.620> get<00:04:55.830> there<00:04:56.010> drifting<00:04:56.460> style<00:04:56.730> down

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
once you get there drifting style down

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.390 
once you get there drifting style down
it<00:04:57.780> really<00:04:58.140> goes<00:04:58.470> about<00:04:58.770> well<00:04:58.950> and<00:04:59.130> it<00:04:59.220> looks

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
it really goes about well and it looks

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.580 
it really goes about well and it looks
really<00:04:59.730> great<00:05:00.000> in<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.210> corners<00:05:00.540> but<00:05:01.140> if<00:05:01.410> you

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
really great in the corners but if you

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.770 
really great in the corners but if you
don't<00:05:01.830> understand<00:05:02.550> that<00:05:02.820> drifting<00:05:03.240> style<00:05:03.510> or

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
don't understand that drifting style or
