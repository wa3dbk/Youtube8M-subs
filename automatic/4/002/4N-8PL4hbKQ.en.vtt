00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.840 
would be overcrowded but let's see how
the<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:57.380> companion<00:01:57.799> planting<00:01:58.100> works<00:01:58.340> again<00:01:58.670> I

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
the the companion planting works again I

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.550 
the the companion planting works again I
saw<00:01:59.119> this<00:01:59.299> in<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.509> book<00:01:59.659> and<00:01:59.869> I<00:02:00.289> thought<00:02:00.439> it

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
saw this in a book and I thought it

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.139 
saw this in a book and I thought it
would<00:02:00.649> be<00:02:00.710> really<00:02:00.859> interesting<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.609> because

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
would be really interesting and because

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.959 
would be really interesting and because
I'm<00:02:02.329> growing<00:02:02.600> at<00:02:02.719> such<00:02:02.749> a<00:02:03.049> small<00:02:03.469> space<00:02:03.969> I

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
I'm growing at such a small space I

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.359 
I'm growing at such a small space I
thought<00:02:05.719> it'd<00:02:05.840> be<00:02:05.869> fun<00:02:06.109> to<00:02:06.200> try<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.740> maximize

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
thought it'd be fun to try and maximize

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.230 
thought it'd be fun to try and maximize
my<00:02:07.609> yield<00:02:07.969> so<00:02:08.660> in<00:02:09.410> these<00:02:09.649> Gardens<00:02:10.070> here<00:02:10.429> this
