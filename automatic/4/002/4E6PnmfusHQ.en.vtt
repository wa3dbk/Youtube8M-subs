00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.060
 but it 's too damn hard I could not leave 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.399
 to pass is expensive because this was a game 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.260
 that marked for me was one of the games that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.149
 I played the most until today I only brought 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.050

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.640
 the game developer is ee black box 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.610
 and was published by electronic art is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.020

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.299
 for playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.700
 skate 3 is set in the fictional town of 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.240
 porte carton I think it's so 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.460
 pronounces is that he accepts the skaters is 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.530
 a biased city like this 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.990
 sports that not many people have a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.900
 small mentality and think warm 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.920
 the choice of junkies then this 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.610
 city accepts the sport is skate game 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.509
 It has new modes, and it 's got an easy way. 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.340
 and hardcore the easy mode allows the 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.619
 player to perform more maneuvers 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.640
 facility provided greater control 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.759
 of the character 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.740
 already hardcore punk hardcore hand mode 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.780
 it tries to provide more gameplay 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.090

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.329
 ie the player needs to perform 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.210

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.409
 tony hawk who presented these options and 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.230
 here on skate 3 we also have this 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:08.430

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.159

 in shifts to exceed the score 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.040
 the other in a given time and 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.500
 domination times compete to win 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.500
 more points in specific places of 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.590
 an area with the time limit and the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.510
 shoulder lot the teams compete to try 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.560

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.540
 specific maneuvers in a particular area 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.629

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:52.109
 videos tam that way or were all I 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.959
 I do not know that our institute is very expensive. 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.060
 topman because you have to destroy your 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.579
 character is connected the more bones 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.220

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.900
 then stuff loser sinister old 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.959
 Now let's talk a little about the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.090
 graphics are not the graphics really good 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.280
 being a very old generation game 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.379
 past is not that graphic that 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.599
 You look at us, what the hell? 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.470
 square does not fall is a very graphic 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.090
 good 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.400
 a clear acceptable graphic that is not 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.710
 that business has all the details 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.790
 of the guy's body is on 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.680
 even because the old generation was 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.420
 half of the older generation plus or 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.520
 less that launched this game I do not remember 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.310
 I forgot to set the date when it was 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.940
 released this game if I remember correctly 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:42.480
 in 2009 but if I was not corrected the 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.360
 Comments Beauty aa gameplay 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.880
