00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 further 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:10.129
 Everyone 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.929
 We handle facilities for patients with various diseases every day 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.990
 I think it is 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.499
 The amount also increases 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.989
 The environment surrounding you is not abusive 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.859
 Is not it 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.279
 In that way 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.820
 Anesthesiologists who manage 1.2 patients during surgery 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.960
 The role of 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.170
 I think it's getting complicated 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.680
 Even if I move my eyes within the surgery day 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.140
 Even in the intensive care unit and the pain clinic 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.569
 The cause of death for which an anesthesiologist is sought is 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:46.569
 It may not be the current situation that is increasing more 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.010
 The need for anesthesiologists is growing 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.770
 Is there enough number of anesthesiologists in response 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.350
 If you are ready to serve raw water vapor with a full-time anesthesiologist alone 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.450
 Question: Do you think anesthesiologists need to be the lowest? 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.450
 Against 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.829
 In the General Senate 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:08.850
 Average 3 sky 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.289
 In university hospital 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.289
 The answer of 10 No. 7 people was obtained 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.460
 In medical institutions that conducted a questionnaire 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.380
 The current average anesthesiologist is 2.62 in a general hospital 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.780
 Because it is 10.1 people in university hospital 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.310
 Many medical institutions are currently scheduled to have questions and answers 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.390
 That only about two thirds are satisfied 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.720
 Will be 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.240
 Becoming an important part of patient management 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.450
 Anesthesiologist Aizu 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.300
 The burden on both sides is 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.670
 Not only anesthesiologists 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.499
 Even for people involved in hospital management 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:49.910
 It may not be a big trouble 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.720
 Explain before surgery 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.560
 For patients and families 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.850
 Even if you want to be explained more than enough 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.469
 With the increase in the number of surgery 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.580
 Also in time 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.580
 I think physically tough conditions 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.060
 The explanation is not enough 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.089
 By leaving it to the expert teacher to want to explain 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:11.110
 Patient 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.790
 Sign a written consent without understanding the content and risks of winning 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.780
 And may not feel that sufficient explanation has been received 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.509
 Not 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:21.879
 as a result 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.599
 Patients and families 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.730
 No satisfaction or confidence in the hospital 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.239
 It is also a concern that it will be a problem for the entire hospital 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.059
 For such a situation 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:38.629
 Improvement requests such as the increase in capacity of anesthesiologists and the introduction of ground principles 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.389
 It is being considered 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.069
 Anesthesiologist training 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.599
 Such as treatment improvement 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.780
 To decide on a specific policy 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.780
 I think it will take some time now 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.619
 It can be seen that it is expensive 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:55.519
 It may not be easy to judge the introduction 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.209
 think 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.369
 there 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:59.429
 we 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.259
 Anesthesiologist's explanation with reduced load 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:03.340
 Patient's 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.469
 Improving understanding through appropriate information disclosure 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.919
 I think it can be realized by video 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:13.109
 That is the treatment 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.089
è¶™

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:16.120
 Had 3d animation 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.949
 However, it is expressed by an easy-to-see image 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.649
 With reduction of explanation load among doctors 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:23.329
 Patient satisfaction 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.869
 It is a new video tool of processing description for the purpose of improving satisfaction 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:32.659
 Explaining the content and risks of winning 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.150
 The standard part is 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.220
 Look at Sochiya and explain the patient's individual contents 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.709
 In the way of use 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.469
 The patient understood the path that will take place from now on 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.649
 We support having you receive invitation in peace in 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:48.579
 I will 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:49.679
 Anesthesiologist burst 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:53.879
 We have extensive experience with anesthesia for the content- 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.159
 Under supervision of Chief Executive Officer of Kurashiki Central Hospital 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.299
 General anesthesia 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.999
 Spinal anesthesia 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.759
 Epidural anesthesia 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:07.689
 We offer four of whole body + epidural anesthesia 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.469
 The contents of the picture 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.939
 Explanation of anesthesia method 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.019
 Before surgery 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.319
 What you would like to cooperate with 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.520
 Procedure of anesthesia in operating room 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.680
 About after surgery 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.370
 About complications 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.110
 It is the constitution that 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
 Let's look at a part of the picture 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.499
 It is divided into two of local anesthesia 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:43.860
 General anesthesia 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.279
 In thing having you go into deep sleep during April 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:48.970
 No awareness or pain 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.129
 I can not move by myself 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:54.539
 Conversely, if the needle enters correctly 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.539
 Cerebrospinal fluid begins to reverse use 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.729
 Conversely speaking, if you can confirm 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.729
 Infuse the local anesthetic role 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.039
 When putting a needle in your back 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.219
 Shioya nerve root injury 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:12.520
 Expensive first day 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.520
 There is inflammation by bacterial infection 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:17.220
 very rarely 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.220
 Some patients have a shock 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.900
 It will disappear early 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.979
 In fact, please do your best and try to put out the degree 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:29.730
 In the garden arteries 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.110
 Called a catheter 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.400
 By inserting a thin tube 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.400
 A blood clot is formed 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.470
 Near the clavicle called a catheter 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.650
 How was the insertion of a thin tube 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.770
 Sotoya is 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.710
 With individual item sale for every notice studio 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.770
 Even if the width with the initial value set is tripled 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.770
 By all means, reducing the load on the ship etc. helps improve the patient's Hokkaido improvement 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:57.289
 To do 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.569
 By the way, the Europe Middle East peace plan
