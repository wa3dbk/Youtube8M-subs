00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 beats gong 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.770
 Hello everyone, Timur doctor and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.080
 today we will be shooting letplay 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.599
 chess such have not seen 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.920
 ad blitz three minutes need to act 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.100
 as quickly and aggressively as possible 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.800
 about all three minutes the one who 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:33.780
 ends up losing but either 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:37.110
 need to mate go to him about our 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.180
 horse fell on a schoolboy fell in battle but it 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.040
 this is my plan this was my plan part 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:49.410
 my cunning plan was so intended 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:51.030
 probably dude but people that you are three tables 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.510
 minutes you need to act as much as possible 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.510
 fast not 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:08.490
 adventure for the boy volume of a horse 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.909
 well that's all dude the only thing you 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:19.590
 it remains to make it give up to 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.590
 somehow get away from shame then 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.299
 now did 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:40.890
 but this is the end this is the end there is nothing to catch 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.890
 black simply because they are black 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.140
 white area 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.570
 Interestingly among schoolchildren there is who not 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.100
 knows how to play chess 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:07.910
 check vigilance because blitz 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.480
 blitz she trip cool yes last 3 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.040
 minutes people sometimes just see 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.120
 elementary things here are black now not 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.270
 they killed him the queen who stood simply 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.950
 opposite 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.350
 getting out just doesn't suggest that 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.910
 rival can do so dumb 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:38.360
 move and I sometimes do you 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:42.370
 especially of course the king take away again 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:46.330
 horse clean the camera dude why then 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.330
 you need to take a horse 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.670
 you do not want 20 do not want to remove the horse 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.730
 so you hope for time 5 in time 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:03.290
 losing the wrong horse 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:09.739
 will have to shave and I did not want to 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:15.819
 it's time to do this in general 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:21.970

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:30.140
