00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.490 
kind of thing it's quite it's quite
interesting<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:19.989> think<00:03:20.020> that's<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.410> only

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
interesting and I think that's the only

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.810 
interesting and I think that's the only
reason<00:03:20.680> why<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:20.980> guessed<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.430> because<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.790> was

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
reason why I guessed it because it was

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.850 
reason why I guessed it because it was
quite<00:03:22.030> going<00:03:22.420> on<00:03:22.570> with<00:03:22.780> same<00:03:23.020> similar<00:03:23.440> kind<00:03:23.770> of

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
quite going on with same similar kind of

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.130 
quite going on with same similar kind of
lines<00:03:24.160> as<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.820> characters<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.690> thought<00:03:25.900> Zoe

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
lines as the characters I thought Zoe

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.190 
lines as the characters I thought Zoe
and<00:03:26.470> Cara<00:03:27.100> both<00:03:27.520> kind<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.090> built<00:03:28.690> up<00:03:28.900> quite

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
and Cara both kind of built up quite

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.380 
and Cara both kind of built up quite
well<00:03:29.320> it<00:03:30.190> got<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.610> point<00:03:30.700> where<00:03:31.150> I

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
well it got to the point where I

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.260 
well it got to the point where I
couldn't<00:03:31.900> tell<00:03:32.200> them<00:03:33.130> apart<00:03:33.280> almost<00:03:33.760> when<00:03:34.180> I

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
couldn't tell them apart almost when I

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.940 
couldn't tell them apart almost when I
was<00:03:34.390> reading<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:34.870> was<00:03:34.989> getting<00:03:35.230> confused<00:03:35.410> as<00:03:35.920> to

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
was reading I was getting confused as to

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.520 
was reading I was getting confused as to
who<00:03:36.190> was<00:03:36.370> speaking<00:03:36.610> so<00:03:37.239> I<00:03:37.420> think<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:37.930> really

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
who was speaking so I think that really

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.710 
who was speaking so I think that really
layered<00:03:39.100> on<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.610> kind<00:03:39.850> of<00:03:39.940> clues<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.510> hints

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
layered on the kind of clues and hints

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.810 
layered on the kind of clues and hints
as<00:03:41.050> to<00:03:41.080> what<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.530> ending<00:03:41.890> was<00:03:42.040> going<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.459> be<00:03:42.610> I

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
as to what the ending was going to be I

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.729 
as to what the ending was going to be I
thought<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.450> was<00:03:43.510> fantastically<00:03:44.080> written<00:03:44.500> by

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
thought it was fantastically written by

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.430 
thought it was fantastically written by
Elizabeth<00:03:45.400> words<00:03:45.700> like<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.300> even<00:03:47.200> though<00:03:47.290> the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
Elizabeth words like the even though the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.440 
Elizabeth words like the even though the
books<00:03:47.680> only<00:03:47.920> 230<00:03:48.580> pages<00:03:48.790> long<00:03:49.090> there<00:03:49.300> was<00:03:49.420> a

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
books only 230 pages long there was a

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.150 
books only 230 pages long there was a
lot<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:49.660> information<00:03:50.290> given<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.620> lot<00:03:50.830> of<00:03:50.920> hints

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
lot of information given a lot of hints

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.790 
lot of information given a lot of hints
and<00:03:51.430> clues<00:03:51.540> towards<00:03:52.540> what<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.900> big<00:03:53.320> twist<00:03:53.620> at

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
and clues towards what the big twist at

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.440 
and clues towards what the big twist at
the<00:03:53.830> end<00:03:53.920> was<00:03:54.190> going<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.519> be<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.209> really

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
the end was going to be and it really

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.810 
the end was going to be and it really
builds<00:03:55.870> up<00:03:56.050> so<00:03:56.350> when<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:57.100> eventually<00:03:57.340> got<00:03:57.790> to

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
builds up so when you eventually got to

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.120 
builds up so when you eventually got to
the<00:03:57.940> big<00:03:58.150> twist<00:03:58.390> it<00:03:58.510> was<00:03:58.600> like<00:03:58.720> oh<00:03:59.010> that<00:04:00.010> was

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
the big twist it was like oh that was

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.070 
the big twist it was like oh that was
well<00:04:00.310> done<00:04:00.340> you<00:04:00.820> you<00:04:01.120> nearly<00:04:01.390> had<00:04:01.690> me<00:04:01.870> there

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
well done you you nearly had me there

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.930 
well done you you nearly had me there
kind<00:04:02.350> of<00:04:02.410> thing<00:04:02.650> seeing<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.310> lot<00:04:03.459> of<00:04:03.489> people

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
kind of thing seeing a lot of people

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.720 
kind of thing seeing a lot of people
would<00:04:04.560> go<00:04:05.560> along<00:04:05.680> until<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.160> end<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.489> not

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
would go along until the end and not

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.160 
would go along until the end and not
have<00:04:06.880> a<00:04:06.910> clue<00:04:07.180> because<00:04:07.420> I<00:04:07.600> definitely<00:04:07.870> would

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
have a clue because I definitely would

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.110 
have a clue because I definitely would
if<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.560> was<00:04:08.739> younger<00:04:08.769> if<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:09.610> hadn't<00:04:09.910> seen<00:04:10.060> that

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
if I was younger if I hadn't seen that

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.540 
if I was younger if I hadn't seen that
film<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:10.750> definitely<00:04:11.110> wouldn't<00:04:11.560> had<00:04:11.769> a<00:04:11.800> clue<00:04:12.040> so

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
film I definitely wouldn't had a clue so

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.000 
film I definitely wouldn't had a clue so
I<00:04:12.910> think<00:04:13.630> it<00:04:13.900> would<00:04:14.019> be<00:04:14.050> a<00:04:14.200> shock<00:04:14.560> for<00:04:14.590> quite<00:04:14.980> a

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
I think it would be a shock for quite a

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.220 
I think it would be a shock for quite a
few<00:04:15.220> people<00:04:15.580> and<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:16.180> really<00:04:16.570> kind<00:04:16.870> of<00:04:16.959> good

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
few people and a really kind of good

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.199 
few people and a really kind of good
shock<00:04:17.530> because<00:04:17.799> quite<00:04:18.250> clever<00:04:18.519> in<00:04:18.730> a<00:04:18.820> way<00:04:19.000> I

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
shock because quite clever in a way I

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.090 
shock because quite clever in a way I
always<00:04:19.539> feel<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:19.930> because<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.500> knew<00:04:20.830> what<00:04:20.979> the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
always feel that because I knew what the

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.800 
always feel that because I knew what the
ending<00:04:21.400> was<00:04:21.549> going<00:04:21.700> to<00:04:21.789> be<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.450> I<00:04:22.539> had<00:04:22.660> already

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
ending was going to be and I had already

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.260 
ending was going to be and I had already
guessed<00:04:23.140> it<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.710> was<00:04:24.160> more<00:04:24.700> anxious

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
guessed it I was more anxious

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.580 
guessed it I was more anxious
well<00:04:25.449> it's<00:04:25.599> really<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:26.020> because<00:04:26.169> I<00:04:26.379> was<00:04:26.500> just

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
well it's really it because I was just

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.740 
well it's really it because I was just
waiting<00:04:26.860> for<00:04:27.099> this<00:04:27.340> big<00:04:27.610> thing<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:28.120> happen<00:04:28.270> and

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
waiting for this big thing to happen and

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.990 
waiting for this big thing to happen and
suddenly<00:04:29.440> when<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:29.800> did<00:04:29.979> it<00:04:30.009> was<00:04:30.160> like<00:04:30.220> oh<00:04:30.430> that

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
suddenly when it did it was like oh that

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.939 
suddenly when it did it was like oh that
was<00:04:31.150> cleverly<00:04:31.599> down<00:04:31.930> well<00:04:32.199> done<00:04:32.470> Elizabeth

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
was cleverly down well done Elizabeth

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.129 
was cleverly down well done Elizabeth
woods<00:04:33.220> as<00:04:33.550> for<00:04:33.849> well<00:04:34.060> building<00:04:34.599> it<00:04:34.870> was<00:04:34.990> all

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
woods as for well building it was all

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.920 
woods as for well building it was all
based<00:04:35.319> in<00:04:35.710> kind<00:04:36.159> of<00:04:36.250> our<00:04:36.520> time<00:04:36.819> no<00:04:37.780> other

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
based in kind of our time no other

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.950 
based in kind of our time no other
worlds<00:04:38.470> or<00:04:38.680> any<00:04:39.220> other<00:04:39.460> kind<00:04:39.759> of<00:04:39.849> fantasy<00:04:40.690> type

worlds or any other kind of fantasy type

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.189 
worlds or any other kind of fantasy type
thing<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.259> it<00:04:42.039> was<00:04:42.220> all<00:04:42.400> very<00:04:42.669> well<00:04:43.330> done<00:04:43.659> for

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
thing so it was all very well done for

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.320 
thing so it was all very well done for
that<00:04:44.349> part<00:04:44.650> of<00:04:44.800> it<00:04:44.919> one<00:04:45.280> thing<00:04:45.490> I<00:04:45.610> would<00:04:45.819> say<00:04:45.849> is

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
that part of it one thing I would say is

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.320 
that part of it one thing I would say is
that<00:04:46.659> the<00:04:46.930> inside<00:04:47.740> flap<00:04:48.190> of<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.610> book<00:04:49.000> with

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
that the inside flap of the book with

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.899 
that the inside flap of the book with
the<00:04:49.360> synopsis<00:04:50.229> there<00:04:50.530> didn't<00:04:51.009> really<00:04:51.400> kind<00:04:51.759> of

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
the synopsis there didn't really kind of

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.760 
the synopsis there didn't really kind of
explain<00:04:52.479> the<00:04:52.690> story<00:04:52.930> very<00:04:53.139> well<00:04:53.379> I<00:04:53.710> know

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
explain the story very well I know

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.140 
explain the story very well I know
obviously<00:04:54.009> they're<00:04:54.460> not<00:04:54.550> supposed<00:04:54.699> to<00:04:54.940> go

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
obviously they're not supposed to go

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.689 
obviously they're not supposed to go
away<00:04:55.330> what<00:04:55.479> the<00:04:55.569> story<00:04:55.870> is<00:04:55.930> but<00:04:56.530> from<00:04:57.490> what<00:04:57.550> i

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
away what the story is but from what i

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.730 
away what the story is but from what i
read<00:04:58.000> there<00:04:58.330> it<00:04:58.720> didn't<00:04:59.020> really<00:04:59.110> correspond

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
read there it didn't really correspond

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.800 
read there it didn't really correspond
with<00:04:59.889> what<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.430> got<00:05:00.490> from<00:05:00.940> a<00:05:01.030> book<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.479> kind<00:05:01.780> of

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
with what I got from a book I kind of

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.649 
with what I got from a book I kind of
expected<00:05:02.289> it<00:05:02.409> to<00:05:02.560> be<00:05:02.590> some<00:05:02.860> sort<00:05:03.009> of<00:05:03.159> murder

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
expected it to be some sort of murder

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.230 
expected it to be some sort of murder
mystery<00:05:04.659> tight<00:05:05.319> thriller<00:05:05.860> almost<00:05:06.430> maybe<00:05:06.729> but

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
mystery tight thriller almost maybe but

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.360 
mystery tight thriller almost maybe but
I<00:05:07.449> guess<00:05:07.750> this<00:05:07.930> was<00:05:08.169> a<00:05:08.199> thriller<00:05:08.590> like<00:05:08.949> you<00:05:09.099> did

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
I guess this was a thriller like you did

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.700 
I guess this was a thriller like you did
have<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.669> scary<00:05:10.060> kind<00:05:10.300> of<00:05:10.449> horror<00:05:10.690> moment<00:05:11.229> but

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
have it scary kind of horror moment but

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.860 
have it scary kind of horror moment but
it<00:05:11.889> wasn't<00:05:12.250> really<00:05:12.759> what<00:05:12.940> I<00:05:13.000> expected<00:05:13.030> at<00:05:13.659> all

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
it wasn't really what I expected at all

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.170 
it wasn't really what I expected at all
so<00:05:14.199> I<00:05:14.229> I<00:05:14.770> enjoyed<00:05:15.370> that<00:05:15.580> I<00:05:15.610> like<00:05:15.880> being

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
so I I enjoyed that I like being

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.670 
so I I enjoyed that I like being
surprised<00:05:16.569> by<00:05:16.719> book<00:05:17.080> it<00:05:17.319> was<00:05:17.440> a<00:05:17.469> really

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
surprised by book it was a really

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.649 
surprised by book it was a really
fast-paced<00:05:18.190> novel<00:05:18.490> everything<00:05:19.389> kind<00:05:19.599> of

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
fast-paced novel everything kind of

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.600 
fast-paced novel everything kind of
happened<00:05:20.169> and<00:05:20.440> you<00:05:20.740> were<00:05:20.830> rolling<00:05:21.069> along<00:05:21.430> with

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
happened and you were rolling along with

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.399 
happened and you were rolling along with
the<00:05:21.699> story<00:05:22.000> I<00:05:22.060> read<00:05:22.389> it<00:05:22.539> in<00:05:22.599> one<00:05:22.659> night<00:05:22.870> so

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409 
the story I read it in one night so

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:25.499 
the story I read it in one night so
that's<00:05:23.650> how<00:05:23.830> kind<00:05:24.340> of<00:05:24.400> fast<00:05:24.639> paced<00:05:24.940> it<00:05:25.090> was<00:05:25.240> and

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
that's how kind of fast paced it was and

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.149 
that's how kind of fast paced it was and
how<00:05:25.629> easily<00:05:25.870> I<00:05:26.050> got<00:05:26.259> through<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.620> story<00:05:26.860> as

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
how easily I got through the story as

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.339 
how easily I got through the story as
for<00:05:27.639> the<00:05:27.669> design<00:05:28.240> of<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.539> actual<00:05:28.930> book<00:05:29.139> I

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
for the design of the actual book I

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.700 
for the design of the actual book I
rather<00:05:29.949> like<00:05:30.340> it<00:05:30.370> I<00:05:30.819> think<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.659> design<00:05:32.169> on<00:05:32.590> the

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
rather like it I think the design on the

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.770 
rather like it I think the design on the
front<00:05:32.740> I'm<00:05:33.219> not<00:05:33.370> sure<00:05:33.520> if<00:05:33.639> you<00:05:33.729> can<00:05:33.819> see<00:05:33.940> but

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
front I'm not sure if you can see but

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.879 
front I'm not sure if you can see but
there's<00:05:35.199> lots<00:05:35.440> of<00:05:35.650> branches<00:05:36.250> Ines<00:05:36.940> and

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
there's lots of branches Ines and

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.249 
there's lots of branches Ines and
chokers<00:05:38.889> written<00:05:39.460> there<00:05:39.729> it's<00:05:40.449> very<00:05:40.659> good<00:05:40.900> and

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
chokers written there it's very good and

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:42.839 
chokers written there it's very good and
at<00:05:41.409> the<00:05:41.500> beginning<00:05:41.830> of<00:05:41.860> each<00:05:41.979> chapter<00:05:42.009> there's

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
at the beginning of each chapter there's

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:45.510 
at the beginning of each chapter there's
a<00:05:42.909> little<00:05:43.120> branch<00:05:43.569> design<00:05:44.110> over<00:05:44.770> the<00:05:44.979> chapter

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
a little branch design over the chapter

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.300 
a little branch design over the chapter
heading<00:05:46.300> which<00:05:47.020> is<00:05:47.199> very<00:05:47.409> nice<00:05:47.650> that's

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
heading which is very nice that's

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.620 
heading which is very nice that's
probably<00:05:48.520> why<00:05:48.699> I<00:05:48.819> picked<00:05:49.029> it<00:05:49.180> up<00:05:49.240> in<00:05:49.389> the<00:05:49.449> first

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
probably why I picked it up in the first

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.420 
probably why I picked it up in the first
place<00:05:49.810> because<00:05:50.050> I<00:05:50.319> quite<00:05:50.650> like<00:05:50.889> branch

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
place because I quite like branch

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.760 
place because I quite like branch
