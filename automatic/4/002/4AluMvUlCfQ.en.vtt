to be using a 451 this is basically the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.100 
to be using a 451 this is basically the
4231<00:00:47.640> formation<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.539> technically<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
4231 formation but it's technically a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.810 
4231 formation but it's technically a

451 if you want to take it that way

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.819 
451 if you want to take it that way
we're<00:00:51.360> gonna<00:00:51.420> put<00:00:51.660> hammers<00:00:51.989> Rodriguez<00:00:52.620> either

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
where he's supposed to be on the right I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.250

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
of my play style I'd still just don't

of my play style I'd still just don't
like<00:02:00.360> him<00:02:00.479> Eve<00:02:00.659> reminds<00:02:01.320> me<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.500> Chevy<00:02:01.710> Alonso

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
like him Eve reminds me of Chevy Alonso

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.830 
like him Eve reminds me of Chevy Alonso
last<00:02:02.399> year<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.640> mean<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.850> didn't<00:02:03.210> play<00:02:03.329> much<00:02:03.360> and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
last year I mean I didn't play much and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.569 
last year I mean I didn't play much and
that's<00:02:03.899> kind<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.259> reason<00:02:04.560> why<00:02:04.740> he's<00:02:05.340> quite

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
that's kind of the reason why he's quite

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.370 
that's kind of the reason why he's quite
slow<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.479> doesn't<00:02:06.689> get<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.049> know<00:02:07.140> doesn't

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
slow and it doesn't get you know doesn't

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.930 
slow and it doesn't get you know doesn't
recover<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.979> well<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.580> more<00:02:08.789> or<00:02:08.910> less

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
recover that well so it's more or less

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.160 
recover that well so it's more or less
you<00:02:09.149> know<00:02:09.270> getting<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.660> there<00:02:09.780> making<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
you know getting up there making the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.420 
you know getting up there making the
attacking<00:02:10.470> passes<00:02:10.950> he's<00:02:11.069> kind<00:02:11.280> of

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
attacking passes he's kind of

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.309 
attacking passes he's kind of
steven<00:02:11.849> gerrard<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.329> know<00:02:12.450> he<00:02:12.870> gets<00:02:12.900> up<00:02:13.290> that

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
steven gerrard you know he gets up that

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.039 
steven gerrard you know he gets up that

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
you can create deadly balls especially

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.000 
you can create deadly balls especially
in<00:02:18.180> fevers<00:02:18.480> well<00:02:18.689> you<00:02:18.780> know<00:02:18.930> but<00:02:19.590> with<00:02:19.709> Tony

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
Cruz I feel it doesn't recover enough

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.000 
Cruz I feel it doesn't recover enough
and<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:22.049> counter-attacks<00:02:22.590> against<00:02:22.829> Real

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
and on counter-attacks against Real

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.410 
and on counter-attacks against Real
Madrid<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:23.519> something<00:02:23.969> that<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.180> need<00:02:24.390> to

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
Madrid it's something that you need to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.660 
Madrid it's something that you need to
really<00:02:24.930> be<00:02:25.049> watching<00:02:25.409> out<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:25.890> as<00:02:26.519> you

that kind of like put a to nail up them

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.119

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
because that penalty is really really

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.530 
because that penalty is really really
easy<00:02:32.219> to<00:02:32.549> school<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:32.909> I<00:02:33.000> know<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.239> like<00:02:33.420> kind

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
of a trick to score penalties and I

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.170 
of a trick to score penalties and I
think<00:02:35.040> everyone<00:02:35.370> does<00:02:35.549> as<00:02:35.730> well<00:02:35.879> it's<00:02:36.090> a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
think everyone does as well it's a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.940 
think everyone does as well it's a
simple<00:02:36.480> go<00:02:36.659> straight<00:02:36.959> down<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.230> middle<00:02:37.260> top

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
simple go straight down the middle top

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.740 
simple go straight down the middle top
you<00:02:38.250> know<00:02:38.609> the<00:02:38.760> top<00:02:38.909> netting<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.389> basically

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
you know the top netting and basically

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.270 
you know the top netting and basically
they<00:02:39.959> have<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.260> flick<00:02:40.439> the<00:02:40.469> right<00:02:40.709> stick<00:02:40.950> up<00:02:41.129> in

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
they have to flick the right stick up in

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.800 
they have to flick the right stick up in

order to save it and not many people

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.649 
order to save it and not many people
have<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.280> wouldn't<00:02:44.579> say<00:02:44.639> the<00:02:44.849> guts<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:45.450> and

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
have it I wouldn't say the guts but and

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.890 
have it I wouldn't say the guts but and
have<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:47.239> there's<00:02:48.239> not<00:02:48.329> even<00:02:48.389> knowledge

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
have the there's not even knowledge

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.379 
have the there's not even knowledge
either<00:02:49.079> it's<00:02:49.349> just<00:02:49.560> have<00:02:49.859> the<00:02:50.069> kind<00:02:50.250> of

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
either it's just have the kind of

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.360 
either it's just have the kind of
mentality<00:02:51.389> i<00:02:51.720> guess<00:02:51.930> i<00:02:52.019> should<00:02:52.200> say<00:02:52.379> to<00:02:53.129> go<00:02:53.250> up

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
mentality i guess i should say to go up

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.679 
mentality i guess i should say to go up
there<00:02:53.609> because<00:02:53.819> they<00:02:53.939> think<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.389> know<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:54.599> i

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
there because they think you know if i

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.390 
there because they think you know if i
go<00:02:54.840> up<00:02:54.870> there<00:02:55.139> and<00:02:55.260> he's<00:02:55.739> obviously<00:02:55.980> hit<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
go up there and he's obviously hit the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.709 
go up there and he's obviously hit the
other<00:02:56.519> way<00:02:56.669> i'm<00:02:56.819> gonna<00:02:56.939> look<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.329> fool<00:02:57.540> you

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:57.719 
other way i'm gonna look like a fool you

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.959 
other way i'm gonna look like a fool you
know<00:02:57.840> didn't<00:02:58.079> even<00:02:58.260> move<00:02:58.439> but<00:02:58.849> basically<00:02:59.849> he

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
know didn't even move but basically he

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.909 
know didn't even move but basically he
dives<00:03:00.209> he<00:03:00.389> kind<00:03:00.599> of<00:03:00.659> does<00:03:00.840> dive<00:03:01.109> in<00:03:01.439> a<00:03:01.530> sort<00:03:01.799> of

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
dives he kind of does dive in a sort of

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.170 
dives he kind of does dive in a sort of
similar<00:03:02.129> way<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.459> where<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.819> balls<00:03:03.030> going

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
similar way to where the balls going

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.970 
similar way to where the balls going
mean<00:03:03.629> in<00:03:03.810> real<00:03:04.049> life<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.530> wouldn't<00:03:04.889> have

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
mean in real life that wouldn't have

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.649 
mean in real life that wouldn't have
been<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.159> you<00:03:05.370> know<00:03:05.489> only<00:03:05.849> been<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.239> bad<00:03:06.480> effort

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
been a you know only been a bad effort

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.119 
been a you know only been a bad effort
to<00:03:06.959> be<00:03:07.049> honest<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.349> mean<00:03:07.469> he<00:03:07.680> had<00:03:07.829> his<00:03:07.980> arm

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
to be honest I mean he had his arm

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.289 
to be honest I mean he had his arm
stretched<00:03:08.489> out<00:03:08.669> so<00:03:08.819> he<00:03:08.879> may<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.060> actually

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
stretched out so he may have actually

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.449 
stretched out so he may have actually
got<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.900> but<00:03:10.590> Benzema<00:03:10.889> there<00:03:11.129> he<00:03:11.280> puts

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
got to that but Benzema there he puts

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.819 
got to that but Benzema there he puts
his<00:03:11.579> up<00:03:11.700> 320<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:12.989> felt<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.409> after<00:03:13.530> that

my opponent just wasn't having his best
game<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.329> knew<00:03:48.599> he<00:03:49.049> was<00:03:49.109> a<00:03:49.169> good<00:03:49.349> player<00:03:49.439> as

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
challenges but when he was in the attack

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.189 
challenges but when he was in the attack
he<00:03:57.060> made<00:03:57.209> some<00:03:57.359> very<00:03:57.569> very<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:58.139> know

attacking mid and having benzema on the
right<00:04:46.590> I'd<00:04:46.800> rather<00:04:47.039> switch<00:04:47.460> that<00:04:47.610> around<00:04:47.789> so

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:48.029 
right I'd rather switch that around so

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.239 
right I'd rather switch that around so

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:51.719 
center attacking mid and then it will be

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:53.330 
center attacking mid and then it will be
