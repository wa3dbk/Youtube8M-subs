00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.960 
would be like okay um and I was sweeping
every<00:04:50.500> time<00:04:50.680> I'm<00:04:51.100> not<00:04:51.220> listening<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.729> beat

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
every time I'm not listening to beat

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.480 
every time I'm not listening to beat
that<00:04:52.240> you<00:04:52.870> should<00:04:53.139> jump<00:04:53.470> back<00:04:53.710> fireball<00:04:54.250> and

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
that you should jump back fireball and

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.640 
that you should jump back fireball and
then<00:04:54.550> e<00:04:54.849> x<00:04:55.150> because<00:04:55.690> x<00:04:55.870> keeps<00:04:56.259> you<00:04:56.349> in<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.500> air

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
then e x because x keeps you in the air

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.650 
then e x because x keeps you in the air
longer<00:04:56.949> and<00:04:57.280> then<00:04:57.759> if<00:04:57.880> I<00:04:57.970> sweep<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.509> get

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
longer and then if I sweep I get

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.330 
longer and then if I sweep I get
punished<00:04:59.080> and<00:04:59.229> you<00:04:59.380> get<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.710> tooth<00:04:59.889> fall<00:05:00.190> and

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
punished and you get the tooth fall and

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.800 
punished and you get the tooth fall and
you<00:05:00.400> get<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.639> two<00:05:00.789> fireballs<00:05:01.210> and<00:05:01.449> you<00:05:01.660> get<00:05:01.780> a

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
you get the two fireballs and you get a

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.779 
you get the two fireballs and you get a
sweep<00:05:02.050> so<00:05:02.560> stuff<00:05:03.009> like<00:05:03.099> that<00:05:03.220> load<00:05:03.550> of<00:05:03.639> stuff

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
sweep so stuff like that load of stuff

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.219 
sweep so stuff like that load of stuff
that<00:05:03.910> I<00:05:04.000> catch<00:05:04.180> on<00:05:04.389> while<00:05:04.780> we're<00:05:04.960> playing<00:05:05.050> the

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
that I catch on while we're playing the

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.140 
that I catch on while we're playing the
matches<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.680> everything<00:05:06.009> and<00:05:06.220> I<00:05:06.669> try<00:05:06.849> to<00:05:06.910> like

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
matches and everything and I try to like

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.520 
matches and everything and I try to like
remember<00:05:07.360> everything<00:05:07.960> that<00:05:08.110> they're<00:05:08.380> doing

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.990 
wrong sorry like don't love lead them
down<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.080> wrong<00:05:11.229> path<00:05:11.440> so<00:05:11.800> now<00:05:12.340> of<00:05:12.639> those<00:05:12.789> like

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
down the wrong path so now of those like

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.659 
down the wrong path so now of those like
that<00:05:13.210> maybe<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:13.900> matches<00:05:14.259> take<00:05:14.440> up<00:05:14.560> to<00:05:14.800> 35<00:05:15.340> 40

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
that maybe the matches take up to 35 40

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.550 
that maybe the matches take up to 35 40
minutes<00:05:16.000> maybe<00:05:16.509> we<00:05:16.690> will<00:05:16.870> spend<00:05:17.289> like<00:05:17.530> the

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
minutes maybe we will spend like the

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.770 
minutes maybe we will spend like the
rest<00:05:17.949> of<00:05:18.039> the<00:05:18.160> time<00:05:18.340> explaining<00:05:18.880> things<00:05:19.150> some

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
rest of the time explaining things some

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.779 
rest of the time explaining things some
people<00:05:19.810> they<00:05:20.199> do<00:05:20.259> it<00:05:20.470> like<00:05:20.560> 25<00:05:21.190> minutes<00:05:21.550> and

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
people they do it like 25 minutes and

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.820 
people they do it like 25 minutes and
then<00:05:21.940> we<00:05:22.060> spend<00:05:22.300> like<00:05:22.500> 15-20<00:05:23.500> minutes<00:05:23.740> an

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
then we spend like 15-20 minutes an

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.500 
then we spend like 15-20 minutes an
online<00:05:24.099> training<00:05:24.280> mode<00:05:24.550> it<00:05:25.000> really<00:05:25.180> depends

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
online training mode it really depends

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.659 
online training mode it really depends
on<00:05:25.690> the<00:05:25.900> person<00:05:26.349> if<00:05:26.710> I<00:05:26.919> have<00:05:27.099> to<00:05:27.220> go<00:05:27.340> online

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
on the person if I have to go online

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.279 
on the person if I have to go online
training<00:05:28.090> with<00:05:28.389> them<00:05:28.510> to<00:05:28.690> talk<00:05:28.840> about<00:05:28.960> stuff

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
training with them to talk about stuff

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:30.839 
training with them to talk about stuff
but<00:05:29.800> if<00:05:29.889> they<00:05:30.010> know<00:05:30.190> they're<00:05:30.370> punishing<00:05:30.669> the

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
but if they know they're punishing the

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.070 
but if they know they're punishing the
frame<00:05:31.030> did<00:05:31.210> is<00:05:31.360> it<00:05:31.510> there's<00:05:31.750> two<00:05:31.930> guys

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
frame did is it there's two guys

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.659 
frame did is it there's two guys
actually<00:05:32.349> knew<00:05:32.650> that<00:05:32.830> punishes<00:05:33.220> a<00:05:33.250> frame<00:05:33.490> data

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
actually knew that punishes a frame data

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.490 
actually knew that punishes a frame data
so<00:05:33.940> i<00:05:34.150> didn't<00:05:34.510> have<00:05:34.570> to<00:05:34.659> go<00:05:34.840> online<00:05:35.110> training

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
so i didn't have to go online training

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.779 
so i didn't have to go online training
mode<00:05:35.590> at<00:05:35.710> all<00:05:35.830> with<00:05:36.010> them<00:05:36.130> it<00:05:36.280> was<00:05:36.370> mostly<00:05:36.610> just

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
mode at all with them it was mostly just

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.370 
mode at all with them it was mostly just
matches<00:05:37.240> and<00:05:37.510> telling<00:05:37.840> them<00:05:37.960> like<00:05:38.110> what<00:05:38.260> you

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
matches and telling them like what you

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.110 
matches and telling them like what you
should<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:38.620> shouldn't<00:05:39.039> be<00:05:39.099> doing<00:05:39.340> Thanks

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
should and shouldn't be doing Thanks

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.540 
should and shouldn't be doing Thanks
yeah<00:05:41.880> so<00:05:42.880> I<00:05:43.590> guess<00:05:44.590> that<00:05:44.800> pretty<00:05:45.159> much<00:05:45.340> wraps

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
yeah so I guess that pretty much wraps

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.710 
yeah so I guess that pretty much wraps
it<00:05:45.820> up<00:05:45.880> I<00:05:46.120> mean<00:05:47.310> no<00:05:48.310> I<00:05:48.580> was<00:05:48.820> gonna<00:05:48.880> ask<00:05:49.030> what<00:05:49.360> do

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
it up I mean no I was gonna ask what do

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.020 
it up I mean no I was gonna ask what do
you<00:05:49.810> think<00:05:49.960> about<00:05:50.020> how<00:05:50.889> often<00:05:51.370> somebody<00:05:51.639> needs

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
you think about how often somebody needs

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.100 
you think about how often somebody needs
to<00:05:52.650> like<00:05:53.650> in<00:05:53.800> order<00:05:53.979> to<00:05:54.340> really<00:05:54.630> progress<00:05:55.630> as<00:05:56.080> a

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
to like in order to really progress as a

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.890 
to like in order to really progress as a
player<00:05:56.470> you<00:05:56.830> know<00:05:57.280> like<00:05:57.639> how<00:05:58.330> often<00:05:58.750> do<00:05:58.840> you

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
player you know like how often do you

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.110 
player you know like how often do you
think<00:05:59.110> that<00:05:59.259> you<00:05:59.560> would<00:05:59.740> need<00:05:59.919> to<00:06:00.250> play<00:06:00.940> them

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
think that you would need to play them

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.719 
think that you would need to play them
in<00:06:01.150> order<00:06:01.389> to<00:06:01.539> get<00:06:01.690> like<00:06:01.870> Max<00:06:02.259> or<00:06:02.680> not<00:06:03.460> do<00:06:03.639> you

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
in order to get like Max or not do you

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:04.980 
in order to get like Max or not do you
know<00:06:03.820> to<00:06:03.880> train<00:06:04.150> and<00:06:04.300> coach<00:06:04.389> them<00:06:04.449> in<00:06:04.690> order

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
know to train and coach them in order

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.409 
know to train and coach them in order
for<00:06:05.169> them<00:06:05.229> to<00:06:05.320> get<00:06:05.440> like<00:06:05.590> Max<00:06:05.889> like<00:06:06.430> a<00:06:06.639> value

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
for them to get like Max like a value

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.460 
for them to get like Max like a value
out<00:06:07.570> of<00:06:07.599> it<00:06:07.810> um<00:06:08.080> I<00:06:09.090> feel<00:06:10.090> like<00:06:10.240> it<00:06:10.570> should<00:06:10.900> be<00:06:11.080> a

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
out of it um I feel like it should be a

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.020 
out of it um I feel like it should be a
space<00:06:12.009> style<00:06:12.220> I<00:06:12.400> don't<00:06:12.550> know<00:06:12.610> how<00:06:12.729> many<00:06:12.759> times

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
space style I don't know how many times

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.909 
space style I don't know how many times
exactly<00:06:13.330> but<00:06:14.199> it<00:06:14.259> should<00:06:14.380> always<00:06:14.500> be<00:06:14.620> spaced

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
exactly but it should always be spaced

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.529 
exactly but it should always be spaced
out<00:06:15.070> because<00:06:15.340> I<00:06:15.400> have<00:06:15.520> people<00:06:15.880> coming<00:06:16.360> in
