show the method of solving this puzzle
in<00:01:51.500> this<00:01:51.590> video<00:01:51.950> but<00:01:52.160> if<00:01:52.280> you<00:01:52.370> notice<00:01:52.550> between

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
in this video but if you notice between

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.640 
in this video but if you notice between
the<00:01:53.090> pictures<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.420> says<00:01:53.870> that<00:01:54.050> six<00:01:54.290> equals

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
the pictures that says that six equals

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.380 
the pictures that says that six equals
one<00:01:54.860> so<00:01:55.250> that<00:01:55.520> in<00:01:55.670> mind<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:56.090> would<00:01:56.180> arrange

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
one so that in mind you would arrange

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.790 
one so that in mind you would arrange
your<00:01:56.630> number<00:01:56.870> wheel<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.260> that<00:01:57.290> six<00:01:57.590> would

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
your number wheel so that six would

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.920 
your number wheel so that six would
equal<00:01:58.040> one<00:01:58.220> and<00:01:58.490> you'd<00:01:59.000> see<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.510> that<00:01:59.810> would

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
equal one and you'd see that that would

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
equal one and you'd see that that would
make<00:02:00.080> eight<00:02:00.410> equal<00:02:00.710> three<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.190> seventy<00:02:01.550> 14
