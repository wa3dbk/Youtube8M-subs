I<00:00:16.699> like<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.760> start<00:00:18.180> with<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.689> loop<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.860> can

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
I like to start with a loop so I can

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.890 
I like to start with a loop so I can
make<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.190> slipknot<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.510> I'm<00:00:21.570> going<00:00:21.690> to<00:00:21.720> take

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
make a slipknot so I'm going to take

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.080 
make a slipknot so I'm going to take
this<00:00:22.170> strand<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.369> double<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.820> up<00:00:24.590> then<00:00:25.590> do<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
this strand and double it up then do a

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.980 
this strand and double it up then do a
circle<00:00:27.440> with<00:00:28.440> my<00:00:28.710> yarn<00:00:29.039> say<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.000> circle<00:00:30.390> and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
circle with my yarn say that circle and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.529 
circle with my yarn say that circle and
we'll<00:00:31.140> put<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.410> loop<00:00:31.680> that's<00:00:31.980> left<00:00:32.250> over

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539 
we'll put that loop that's left over

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:38.750 
we'll put that loop that's left over
through<00:00:33.649> the<00:00:34.649> yarn<00:00:36.260> pull<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.409> tight<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:38.370> form<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
through the yarn pull it tight to form a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.259 
through the yarn pull it tight to form a
loop<00:00:38.909> now<00:00:39.780> after<00:00:40.229> I've<00:00:40.350> formed<00:00:40.679> the<00:00:40.800> loop

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
loop now after I've formed the loop

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.319 
loop now after I've formed the loop
we're<00:00:42.269> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.449> take<00:00:42.629> our<00:00:42.839> yarn<00:00:43.789> pull<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
we're going to take our yarn pull the

we're going to take our yarn pull the
string<00:00:45.719> through<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.199> loop<00:00:47.239> okay<00:00:48.319> fit<00:00:49.319> it<00:00:49.469> on

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
string through the loop okay fit it on

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.209 
string through the loop okay fit it on
to<00:00:49.859> our<00:00:49.889> bowl<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:51.030> our<00:00:51.239> knitting<00:00:52.039> loop<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
to our bowl for our knitting loop it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.349 
to our bowl for our knitting loop it
around<00:00:53.780> now<00:00:54.780> pull<00:00:55.139> it<00:00:55.170> tight<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.940> knot<00:00:57.179> gets

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
around now pull it tight the knot gets

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.779 
around now pull it tight the knot gets
in<00:00:57.569> the<00:00:57.659> way<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.109> help<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.409> along<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:59.670> don't
