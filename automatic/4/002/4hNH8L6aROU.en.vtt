00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
when I see nakai mpg 3232 comes up the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.920 
when I see nakai mpg 3232 comes up the
standards<00:00:45.989> what's<00:00:46.230> gonna

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
standards what's gonna

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.110 
standards what's gonna
and<00:00:47.410> now<00:00:47.590> when<00:00:47.770> I<00:00:47.800> go<00:00:48.040> back<00:00:48.070> to<00:00:48.310> say<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:48.820> or

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
and now when I go back to say the or

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.299 
and now when I go back to say the or
pecs<00:00:49.360> to<00:00:49.720> sin

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:01.670 

and<00:00:54.670> I<00:00:54.789> see<00:00:56.820> nicely<00:00:57.820> routed<00:00:58.480> through

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.090 

if<00:01:01.860> you<00:01:02.010> go<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.219> another<00:01:02.430> credit<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:04.320> befell

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
if you go to another credit the befell

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.100 
if you go to another credit the befell
Alden<00:01:06.110> screen<00:01:07.110> view

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.370 

so<00:01:11.110> before<00:01:11.560> Rovin<00:01:12.010> again<00:01:12.520> we<00:01:13.180> put<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.600> control

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
so before Rovin again we put the control

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.399 
so before Rovin again we put the control
pad<00:01:14.619> roots<00:01:14.890> if<00:01:15.100> we've<00:01:15.280> also<00:01:15.430> got<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:16.409> control

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
pad roots if we've also got the control

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.800 
pad roots if we've also got the control
sliders<00:01:18.009> mats

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.740 

so<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> ability<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.159> connect<00:01:23.790> any<00:01:24.180> external

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
so the ability to connect any external

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.789 
so the ability to connect any external
MIDI<00:01:25.470> device<00:01:26.899> controllers<00:01:27.899> through<00:01:28.170> pads

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
MIDI device controllers through pads

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.760 
MIDI device controllers through pads
through<00:01:29.240> is<00:01:30.240> completely<00:01:30.840> down<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.560> user

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
through is completely down so the user

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.520 
through is completely down so the user
as<00:01:32.070> an<00:01:32.220> open<00:01:32.549> system<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.539> configured<00:01:33.930> through

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
a simple text file you need no special

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.529 
a simple text file you need no special
tools<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.280> define<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.850> your<00:01:38.880> text<00:01:39.360> file

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
tools you just define in your text file

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.080 
tools you just define in your text file
how<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.840> want<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.200> mappings<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:41.159> work<00:01:41.369> with

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
how you want the mappings to work with

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.240 
how you want the mappings to work with
many<00:01:42.330> of<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.600> plugins<00:01:43.080> there's<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.710> MIDI<00:01:43.979> learn

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
many of the plugins there's a MIDI learn

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.639 
many of the plugins there's a MIDI learn
function<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.090> wagging<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> control<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.560> it

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
function just wagging the control and it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.539 
function just wagging the control and it
learns<00:01:46.890> what<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.220> does

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.190 

so<00:01:50.939> we're<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> show<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.719> working

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so we're going to show you that working

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.160 
so we're going to show you that working
on<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:52.590> x2<00:01:53.219> Pro<00:01:53.609> what<00:01:54.420> I'll<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.020> make

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
on the x2 Pro what I'll do to make

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.499 
on the x2 Pro what I'll do to make
something<00:01:55.439> simple<00:01:55.829> it's<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.729> show<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:56.969> volume

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
something simple it's to show the volume

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.490 
something simple it's to show the volume
control<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:59.280> first<00:01:59.520> controller<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:01.049> MPD

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.149 
control to the first controller the MPD
32<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.969> what<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.810> go<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.140> dizzy<00:02:04.799> learn

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
32 so what I do I go to dizzy learn

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.520 
32 so what I do I go to dizzy learn
click<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.329> MIDI<00:02:06.539> learn

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
click on MIDI learn

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.870 
click on MIDI learn
back<00:02:07.770> we'll<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.039> control<00:02:08.310> with<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> mouse

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
back we'll have control with the mouse

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.260 
back we'll have control with the mouse
then<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.330> waggle<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.810> with<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.110> slider<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:11.100> now

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
then I waggle it with the slider and now

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:19.040 
then I waggle it with the slider and now
with<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.420> control<00:02:12.810> over<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.110> volume

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.530 

so<00:02:19.680> that's<00:02:19.830> assigned<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.520> slider<00:02:20.850> and

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
so that's assigned to that slider and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.010 
so that's assigned to that slider and
now<00:02:21.600> let's<00:02:22.020> define<00:02:22.800> filter<00:02:23.400> cutoff<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.750> again

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
now let's define filter cutoff so again

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.960 
now let's define filter cutoff so again

wag<00:02:27.510> all<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.870> fields<00:02:28.170> are<00:02:28.290> cut<00:02:28.470> off<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:29.190> we'll

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
wag all the fields are cut off and we'll

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.590
