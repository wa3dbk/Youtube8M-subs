00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
finger because I thought that if I put

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.350 
finger because I thought that if I put
it<00:01:39.860> all<00:01:40.070> over<00:01:40.340> my<00:01:40.840> nails<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:42.110> will<00:01:42.260> be<00:01:42.380> too<00:01:42.500> much
