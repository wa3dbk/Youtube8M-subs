00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:08.930
 a great desire for all those guys 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:10.760
 gestures would call come in this video 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.010
 of daylight in which I will show you how 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.500
 getting the excalibur sword really is 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.509
 powerful and to get it you have to 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.910
 go to a particular place indeed 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.589
 I show you the map a little bit and how 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.779
 you see I am here at the bottom right 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.849
 in fact this is our world of 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.159
 game in which we can move and you 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.989
 you have to go here right down the 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.759
 sword lies on a small cluster of 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.440
 rocks you see there at the point of 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.239
 reference and that is in that 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.250
 area over there I turn around a little bit 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.930
 around so you can understand a little bit about that 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.640
 I am in the area there are palm trees and 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.530
 I think it's a beach 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.910
 so guys let's jump into the water and 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.399
 let's do a spin down there 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.929
 and here we are at our destination 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.329
 so guys look a little what's there 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.579
 here as you see it is a true e 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.820
 own body within which it is 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.679
 positioned our sword ie 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.329
 excalibur is a very real name 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.460
 detail obviously a clear 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.719
 reference to the excalibur sword 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.729
 pulling the sword wo n't be easy 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.439
 in fact you have to hold for about 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.850
 a minute and a half the key for 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.530
 recover the team itself 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.329
 I believe the key is pressed by hand 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.979
 the indicator will go up more and more and you 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.020
 you will understand that you are about to extract 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.610
 the sword the body will go up in flames for 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.380
 a few minutes but once that 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.720
 the latter will have thinned out and 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.939
 a project will in fact appear 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.070
 this is the former calibur project through 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.470
 which you can learn to create 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.540
 sword the sword is this here as you can 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.460
 notice really very cool and it is possible 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.829
 rent zombies in a way 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.299
 somewhat nice opening the inventory 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.070
 you can see that the sword really is 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.350
 very strong indeed the damages are 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.049
 even at 326 and I will point you out 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.549
 also the value that exceeds 14 thousand 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.469
 so the sword is really dollars 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.270
 unfortunately very strong to one 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.100
 very low durability therefore vi 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.899
 I suggest to double the with a method 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.500
 which you will soon see here plays with a 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.270
 new video 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.829
