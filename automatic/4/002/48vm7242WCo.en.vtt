00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:40.010 
crystal on the front has glass this one
is<00:05:34.350> a<00:05:34.560> 40<00:05:35.840> 1.5<00:05:36.840> millimeter<00:05:37.910> case<00:05:38.910> so<00:05:39.660> it's<00:05:39.870> a

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
is a 40 1.5 millimeter case so it's a

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.170 
is a 40 1.5 millimeter case so it's a
little<00:05:40.110> bit<00:05:40.350> smaller<00:05:40.770> but<00:05:41.250> it<00:05:41.430> is<00:05:41.580> traditional

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
little bit smaller but it is traditional

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.710 
little bit smaller but it is traditional
again<00:05:42.720> very<00:05:43.080> understated<00:05:43.650> this<00:05:44.190> one<00:05:44.400> has<00:05:44.720> one

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
again very understated this one has one

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.510 
again very understated this one has one
two<00:05:45.750> three<00:05:45.990> four<00:05:46.200> four<00:05:47.010> different

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
two three four four different

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.820 
two three four four different
complications<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.750> this<00:05:48.930> one<00:05:49.110> sleeve<00:05:49.320> it<00:05:49.500> is<00:05:49.740> a

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
complications to this one sleeve it is a

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.450 
complications to this one sleeve it is a
chronographic<00:05:50.460> feature<00:05:51.020> and<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.979> fourth

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
chronographic feature and the fourth

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.920 
chronographic feature and the fourth
actual<00:05:54.470> subbed<00:05:55.470> out<00:05:55.650> is<00:05:55.950> the<00:05:56.610> moon<00:05:56.880> phase<00:05:57.600> on

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
actual subbed out is the moon phase on

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.570 
actual subbed out is the moon phase on
it<00:05:58.110> so<00:05:58.289> this<00:05:58.470> is<00:05:58.680> actually<00:05:59.039> calling<00:05:59.490> a

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
it so this is actually calling a

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.420 
it so this is actually calling a
perpetual<00:06:00.150> calendar<00:06:00.390> of<00:06:01.220> quadratic<00:06:02.220> time

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
perpetual calendar of quadratic time

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.300 
perpetual calendar of quadratic time
piece

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.550 

but<00:06:08.310> again<00:06:08.480> this<00:06:09.480> one<00:06:09.660> is<00:06:09.750> made<00:06:09.870> by<00:06:10.110> trice<00:06:10.380> is

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
but again this one is made by trice is

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.230 
but again this one is made by trice is
an<00:06:10.710> automatic<00:06:11.690> it's<00:06:12.690> not<00:06:12.840> a<00:06:12.900> swiss<00:06:13.320> made<00:06:14.240> but

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
an automatic it's not a swiss made but

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.260 
an automatic it's not a swiss made but
it<00:06:15.510> is<00:06:15.690> has<00:06:16.290> a<00:06:16.320> miata<00:06:17.160> movement<00:06:17.670> in<00:06:17.760> it<00:06:17.880> which

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
it is has a miata movement in it which

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.990 
it is has a miata movement in it which
is<00:06:18.450> a<00:06:18.480> very<00:06:18.690> very<00:06:18.960> good<00:06:19.550> automatic<00:06:20.550> watch<00:06:20.760> and

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
is a very very good automatic watch and

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.210 
is a very very good automatic watch and
we<00:06:21.090> all<00:06:21.210> know<00:06:21.450> Amiata<00:06:21.840> me<00:06:22.080> movements<00:06:23.040> for

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
we all know Amiata me movements for

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.830 
we all know Amiata me movements for
invicta<00:06:23.940> and<00:06:24.360> also<00:06:24.720> the<00:06:24.900> system<00:06:25.380> watch<00:06:25.560> brand
