first but so what you do is you get the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.010 
first but so what you do is you get the
sponge<00:01:10.280> cut<00:01:11.060> out<00:01:11.210> a<00:01:11.240> little<00:01:11.390> portion<00:01:11.780> of<00:01:11.900> it

sponge cut out a little portion of it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.710 
sponge cut out a little portion of it
using<00:01:12.290> scissors<00:01:12.500> or<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:12.890> knife<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.910> then<00:01:14.330> you

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
using scissors or a knife and then you

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.550 
using scissors or a knife and then you
cut<00:01:15.260> out<00:01:15.290> this<00:01:16.010> it's<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:16.730> you<00:01:17.330> know<00:01:17.560> relatively

is a really nice sketch sketching

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.860 
is a really nice sketch sketching
program<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.950> it's<00:02:36.950> really<00:02:37.130> easy<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:38.390> fun<00:02:38.810> to

use basically you could click on one of
the<00:02:42.530> preset<00:02:42.950> brushes<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.550> draw<00:02:43.760> there's<00:02:44.360> like

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
the preset brushes and draw there's like

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.229 
the preset brushes and draw there's like
that<00:02:45.290> pencil<00:02:45.860> tool<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.370> airbrush<00:02:46.850> tool

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
create once you create it a little icon

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.199 
create once you create it a little icon
pops<00:03:17.690> up<00:03:17.840> right<00:03:17.870> here<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:19.670> then<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.090> can

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
pops up right here and then you can

click on this double click on this and
basically<00:03:22.489> set<00:03:23.090> more<00:03:23.630> options<00:03:24.140> if<00:03:24.320> you<00:03:24.440> wanted

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
basically set more options if you wanted

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.940 
basically set more options if you wanted
to<00:03:26.079> in<00:03:27.079> this<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:28.130> this<00:03:28.640> is<00:03:29.470> one<00:03:30.470> of<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.620> brushes

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
to in this so this is one of the brushes

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.600 
to in this so this is one of the brushes
that<00:03:30.980> we<00:03:31.190> created<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:31.790> so<00:03:32.269> you<00:03:32.360> can<00:03:32.570> see<00:03:32.630> that

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
that we created and so you can see that

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.000 
that we created and so you can see that
you<00:03:34.610> know<00:03:34.989> really<00:03:35.989> neat<00:03:36.290> thing<00:03:36.500> about<00:03:36.590> this

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
you know really neat thing about this

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.800 
you know really neat thing about this
program<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:37.610> because<00:03:38.360> this<00:03:38.540> is<00:03:38.660> not<00:03:38.750> a

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
program is because this is not a

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.229 
program is because this is not a
pressure-sensitive<00:03:39.200> stylus<00:03:40.120> just<00:03:41.120> by

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
pressure-sensitive stylus just by

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.670 
pressure-sensitive stylus just by
tweaking<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.750> settings<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:42.260> can<00:03:42.320> make<00:03:42.530> it

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
tweaking the settings you can make it

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.410 
tweaking the settings you can make it
look<00:03:42.890> like<00:03:43.190> it<00:03:43.400> does<00:03:43.610> have<00:03:43.910> precious<00:03:44.120> and

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
look like it does have precious and

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.289 
look like it does have precious and
sensitivity<00:03:45.230> but<00:03:45.859> in<00:03:46.100> fact<00:03:46.400> it<00:03:46.609> actually<00:03:46.760> does

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
sensitivity but in fact it actually does

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.810 
sensitivity but in fact it actually does
it<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.799> analytical<00:03:48.799> thing<00:03:48.980> is<00:03:49.070> to<00:03:49.310> emulate

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
it and analytical thing is to emulate

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.640 
it and analytical thing is to emulate
purchases<00:03:50.239> his<00:03:50.420> feet<00:03:50.630> pressure<00:03:51.170> sensitivity

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
purchases his feet pressure sensitivity

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.590 
purchases his feet pressure sensitivity
all<00:03:52.010> you<00:03:52.430> have<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.609> do<00:03:52.700> is<00:03:52.790> crawl<00:03:53.060> really<00:03:53.299> fast

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
all you have to do is crawl really fast

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.770 
all you have to do is crawl really fast
so<00:03:54.200> when<00:03:54.470> you're<00:03:54.590> drawing<00:03:54.769> slow<00:03:55.359> you're<00:03:56.359> gonna

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
so when you're drawing slow you're gonna

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.520 
so when you're drawing slow you're gonna
get<00:03:57.049> these

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
get these

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.430 
get these
really<00:03:59.530> round<00:03:59.740> like<00:04:00.130> marks<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:01.420> know<00:04:01.540> it's

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
really round like marks you know it's

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.080 
really round like marks you know it's
obviously<00:04:03.160> there's<00:04:03.370> no<00:04:03.460> pressure<00:04:03.640> sensitive

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
obviously there's no pressure sensitive

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.210 
obviously there's no pressure sensitive
pressure<00:04:04.660> sensitivity<00:04:05.140> but<00:04:05.830> if<00:04:05.950> you<00:04:06.040> draw

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
pressure sensitivity but if you draw

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.930 
pressure sensitivity but if you draw
really<00:04:06.520> fast<00:04:06.760> really<00:04:06.970> fast<00:04:07.180> stroke<00:04:08.940> you're

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
really fast really fast stroke you're
