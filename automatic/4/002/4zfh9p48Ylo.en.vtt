holly to grow on its own accord it can
grow<00:00:10.780> as<00:00:10.930> tall<00:00:11.200> as<00:00:11.410> some<00:00:11.590> of<00:00:11.680> our<00:00:11.799> native<00:00:12.010> trees

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
grow as tall as some of our native trees

and turn into quite a substantial thing
it's<00:00:15.430> considered<00:00:15.910> to<00:00:15.969> be<00:00:16.090> very<00:00:16.270> bad<00:00:16.570> luck<00:00:16.810> to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
it's considered to be very bad luck to

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.660 
it's considered to be very bad luck to

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
gardens and actually in a lot of places

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.230 
gardens and actually in a lot of places
for<00:00:23.440> example<00:00:23.920> where<00:00:24.040> I<00:00:24.070> come<00:00:24.280> from<00:00:24.310> it's

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
for example where I come from it's

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.270 
for example where I come from it's
considered<00:00:25.690> unlucky<00:00:25.960> to<00:00:26.260> cut<00:00:26.530> them<00:00:26.680> in<00:00:26.800> hedges

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 
considered unlucky to cut them in hedges

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.520 
considered unlucky to cut them in hedges
it<00:00:28.000> was<00:00:28.120> thought<00:00:28.330> that<00:00:28.360> witches<00:00:28.990> when<00:00:29.410> they

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530 
it was thought that witches when they

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.930 
it was thought that witches when they
moved<00:00:29.740> to<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:30.010> countryside<00:00:30.340> would<00:00:30.700> walk

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 
moved to the countryside would walk

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.970 
moved to the countryside would walk
along<00:00:31.240> the<00:00:31.360> tops<00:00:31.570> of<00:00:31.720> hedges<00:00:32.079> and<00:00:32.320> so<00:00:32.710> tall

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
along the tops of hedges and so tall

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.470 
along the tops of hedges and so tall
Hollies<00:00:33.399> would<00:00:33.579> be<00:00:33.700> left<00:00:33.879> in<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.180> middle<00:00:34.390> of

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
Hollies would be left in the middle of

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.270 
Hollies would be left in the middle of
the<00:00:34.570> hedge<00:00:34.749> to<00:00:35.230> stop<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.559> witches<00:00:35.739> from<00:00:35.890> going

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
the hedge to stop the witches from going

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.739 
the hedge to stop the witches from going
any<00:00:36.399> further<00:00:36.640> so<00:00:36.969> they<00:00:37.059> thought<00:00:37.210> to<00:00:37.390> repel

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:37.749 
any further so they thought to repel

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:40.079 
any further so they thought to repel
witches<00:00:38.260> that<00:00:38.949> might<00:00:39.190> be<00:00:39.339> because<00:00:39.640> they're

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
witches that might be because they're

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.410 
witches that might be because they're
thought<00:00:40.269> to<00:00:40.300> be<00:00:40.569> spiny<00:00:41.699> but<00:00:42.699> actually<00:00:43.059> Hollies

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
thought to be spiny but actually Hollies

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.689 
thought to be spiny but actually Hollies
aren't<00:00:43.749> spiny<00:00:44.199> all<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.649> way<00:00:44.769> over<00:00:45.190> what<00:00:45.609> you

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
aren't spiny all the way over what you

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.549 
aren't spiny all the way over what you
tend<00:00:45.999> to<00:00:46.089> see<00:00:46.300> is<00:00:46.449> down<00:00:46.690> near<00:00:46.929> the<00:00:46.960> bottom<00:00:47.260> of

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
tend to see is down near the bottom of

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.130 
tend to see is down near the bottom of
the<00:00:47.620> tree<00:00:47.920> around<00:00:48.489> ground<00:00:48.969> level<00:00:49.420> you<00:00:49.929> find

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
the tree around ground level you find

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.989 
the tree around ground level you find
that<00:00:50.289> the<00:00:50.409> leaves<00:00:50.620> are<00:00:50.800> very<00:00:50.859> spiny<00:00:51.460> and

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
that the leaves are very spiny and

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:54.029 
that the leaves are very spiny and
that's<00:00:52.390> because<00:00:52.719> that's<00:00:52.929> the<00:00:53.199> part<00:00:53.769> of<00:00:53.949> it

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
that's because that's the part of it

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.309 
that's because that's the part of it
that's<00:00:54.100> going<00:00:54.339> to<00:00:54.609> be<00:00:54.789> bitten<00:00:55.059> by<00:00:55.329> herbivores

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.319 
that's going to be bitten by herbivores

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:57.989 
that's going to be bitten by herbivores
and<00:00:56.530> going<00:00:56.710> to<00:00:56.800> be<00:00:56.889> eaten<00:00:57.159> but<00:00:57.609> then<00:00:57.760> when<00:00:57.909> you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:57.999 
and going to be eaten but then when you

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.139 
and going to be eaten but then when you
look<00:00:58.179> a<00:00:58.269> little<00:00:58.389> higher<00:00:58.690> up<00:00:59.399> what<00:01:00.399> you<00:01:00.519> find<00:01:00.850> is

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
look a little higher up what you find is

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.239 
look a little higher up what you find is
that<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.690> leaves<00:01:01.899> tend<00:01:02.199> to<00:01:02.289> have<00:01:02.409> much<00:01:02.679> fewer

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.249 
that the leaves tend to have much fewer

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:05.580 
that the leaves tend to have much fewer
spikes<00:01:03.670> on<00:01:03.940> them<00:01:04.120> because<00:01:04.809> they're<00:01:05.110> free<00:01:05.379> from

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
spikes on them because they're free from

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.290 
spikes on them because they're free from
the<00:01:05.770> herbivores<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:06.610> they<00:01:06.730> don't<00:01:06.910> need<00:01:07.120> to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
the herbivores and so they don't need to

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.110 
the herbivores and so they don't need to
protect<00:01:07.630> themselves<00:01:07.780> quite<00:01:08.320> so<00:01:08.500> much<00:01:09.120> and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
protect themselves quite so much and

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.490 
protect themselves quite so much and
that<00:01:10.240> also<00:01:11.280> gives<00:01:12.280> rise<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.610> one<00:01:12.970> of<00:01:13.090> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that also gives rise to one of the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.230 
that also gives rise to one of the
useful<00:01:14.500> features<00:01:14.890> of<00:01:15.190> Holly<00:01:15.370> is<00:01:15.640> that<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.120> was

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
useful features of Holly is that it was

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.640 
useful features of Holly is that it was
one<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.510> the<00:01:16.570> common<00:01:16.930> fodder<00:01:17.200> plants

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
one of the common fodder plants

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.710 
one of the common fodder plants
throughout<00:01:18.370> the<00:01:18.580> Middle<00:01:18.820> Ages<00:01:18.910> that<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.540> used

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
throughout the Middle Ages that you used

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.390 
throughout the Middle Ages that you used
to<00:01:19.810> feed<00:01:20.080> your<00:01:20.260> sheep<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.770> your<00:01:20.890> cattle<00:01:21.250> with

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
to feed your sheep and your cattle with

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.400 
to feed your sheep and your cattle with
you<00:01:21.970> often<00:01:22.300> see<00:01:22.450> Holly<00:01:22.690> growing<00:01:23.020> around<00:01:23.260> the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
you often see Holly growing around the

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.290 
you often see Holly growing around the
edges<00:01:23.830> of<00:01:23.860> ancient<00:01:24.340> woodlands<00:01:24.790> and<00:01:25.150> that's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
edges of ancient woodlands and that's

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.330 
edges of ancient woodlands and that's
not<00:01:25.540> just<00:01:25.870> as<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.050> barrier<00:01:26.440> to<00:01:26.560> people<00:01:26.710> going<00:01:27.190> in

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
not just as a barrier to people going in

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.550 
not just as a barrier to people going in
that's<00:01:27.880> also<00:01:28.240> because<00:01:28.510> in<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.750> winter<00:01:29.170> when

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
that's also because in the winter when

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.650 
that's also because in the winter when
there<00:01:29.710> wasn't<00:01:30.010> very<00:01:30.040> much<00:01:30.430> other<00:01:31.360> food

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
there wasn't very much other food

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.510 
there wasn't very much other food
available<00:01:32.170> for<00:01:32.230> your<00:01:32.470> cattle<00:01:32.860> they<00:01:33.220> used<00:01:33.400> to

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
available for your cattle they used to

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.790 
available for your cattle they used to
lock<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:33.940> holly<00:01:34.120> branches<00:01:34.690> mulch<00:01:35.350> down<00:01:35.620> the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
lock the holly branches mulch down the

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.080 
lock the holly branches mulch down the
leaves<00:01:35.980> and<00:01:36.250> then<00:01:36.310> feed<00:01:36.610> them<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:36.970> their

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
leaves and then feed them to their

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.240 
leaves and then feed them to their
cattle<00:01:37.480> and<00:01:37.630> it's<00:01:37.930> a<00:01:37.990> very<00:01:38.170> nutritious<00:01:38.920> food
