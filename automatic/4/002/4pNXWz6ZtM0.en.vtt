to be a button to go to camera and you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.539 
to be a button to go to camera and you
just<00:01:11.549> tapped<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.330> well<00:01:12.929> now<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.560> slide<00:01:14.340> it

that's kind of cool and if you just tap

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.999 
that's kind of cool and if you just tap
on<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.860> doesn't<00:01:26.340> do<00:01:26.429> anything<00:01:27.380> just<00:01:28.380> kind<00:01:28.950> of

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
people that is probably some of the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.139 
people that is probably some of the
biggest<00:01:57.209> stuff<00:01:57.629> oh<00:01:57.899> my<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:59.220> is<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.729> me<00:01:59.970> but

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
biggest stuff oh my this is just me but

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.270 
biggest stuff oh my this is just me but
I<00:02:00.209> thought<00:02:00.690> they<00:02:00.929> said<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.319> the<00:02:01.500> camera<00:02:02.009> app

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
I thought they said that the camera app

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.029 
I thought they said that the camera app
is<00:02:02.640> supposed<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.269> different<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:06.830> don't<00:02:07.830> know

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
is supposed to be different I don't know

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.889 
is supposed to be different I don't know
about<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.849> thought<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.450> heard<00:02:09.569> that

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
about that but I thought I heard that

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.930 
about that but I thought I heard that
and<00:02:10.610> yeah<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.640> think<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.150> pretty<00:02:12.569> good

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
and yeah I think this is pretty good

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.360 
and yeah I think this is pretty good
should<00:02:14.940> probably<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.450> wrap<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.720> up<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.370> not

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
should probably just wrap it up and not

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.540 
should probably just wrap it up and not
much<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:18.239> say<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.750> update<00:02:19.140> was<00:02:19.319> very<00:02:19.650> fast<00:02:20.040> and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
much to say the update was very fast and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.110 
much to say the update was very fast and
uh<00:02:21.110> yeah
