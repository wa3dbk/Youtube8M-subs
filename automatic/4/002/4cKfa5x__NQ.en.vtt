00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:10.470
 with a curved gouge 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.470
 we proceed to do 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.210
 the simple movement 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.250
 trying not to be key 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.250
 Inside the scientific wood 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.810
 it is always convenient to fix the wood 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.810
 First 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.370
 it seems like it was softer 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.370
 doing it like that 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.610
 and looking for the sale of the wood since 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.610
 we do it in the opposite direction the same 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.980
 the strip comes out when we see that it comes out 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.090
 as it facilitates we have to stop 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.730
 we turn the wood 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.860
 and if we do the other side not me 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.660
 chat 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.670
 to avoid these I do not know if they are going to 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.930
 appreciate these these cuts 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.930
 what is done in the wood 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.080
 the sharp rain 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.590
 use not very hard woods 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.490
 and with knots preferably 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.299
 overwhelmed the edge with a 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.000
 with a sharpening affiliation pebble 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:35.039
 I put oil on it and I do this 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.039
 movement because actually 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.740
 approaching the edge of this side not the 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.740
 inside 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.210
 which later as they were and a 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.049
 little polishing paste 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.220
 or fats the seats of a switchboard 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.220
 graphic blonde 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.070
 shows again the part of 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.070
 application and then if there is oil or not 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.380
 once of oil 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.550
 do the same on flat surfaces well 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.590
 settled no longer trying to copy the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.590
 angle that you have on this side 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.780
 to how to sharpen and the other side 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.780
 once it is fixed we clean it 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.790
 we present well the same 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.420
 movement 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.340
 in the sane 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.640
 to finish and take out a possible 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.240
 small burr we carry 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.240
 6 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.930
 and always convenient to leave the 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.989
 wood 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.599
 it seems that especially in some woods 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.980
 like the pine treated as it is made 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.859
 a bit softer training more 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.140
 workers to be able to continue like this 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.599
 to be able to take care of that what 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.280
 we have to try to avoid when it comes out 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.469
 this seed 2 we turn the wood 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.880
 by it means that we are on the side of 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.290
 the wrong streak 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.020
 if not then you have to fix 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.020
 internally each of the 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:26.600
 of the holes of that court he quoted 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.880
 when that occurs with 30 we stretch and 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.890
 on this side we pair it to avoid 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.750
 the tips those tracks that are a tone 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.390
 unpleasant once you grab 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.000
 practice is easy that I repeat I do not know if 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.610
 is the most correct way to do that 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.730
 I do it, it's quite practical for me 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.780
 As you can see, it's a pretty fast job 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.780
 it's not to do an industrial quantity 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.980
 of wood 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.980
 but yes to do 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:06.269
 the rain work that I'm with 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.540
 many of those hands with a little bit of 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.629
 sandpaper or something sir this one I hope that they 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.629
 serve
