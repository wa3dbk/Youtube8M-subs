 to make some things in a circle 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.090
 Now we take ours today with the

 Tip up here and do it 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.739
 broke out window here you can see completely 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.620

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.540
 he captures this moment to blink 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.100
 here connects by point measures the 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.420
 temperature in bremen and heats the top 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.320
 perfect for making you beautiful 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.829
 can roast 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.180
 that takes a second long 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.009
 I also want to show my interest 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.240
 what 's next, yes I have 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.590
 it all comes prepared a 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.300
 little bit more for the bacon 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.259
 a slice of onion few exclusive 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.399
 I want a higher one 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.030
 decide 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:24.840
 too much potatoes cut into cubes 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.399
 bit of vegetable broth scheel peas that 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.020
 very important because we have the normal apps 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.369
 take the shell up here, swim that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.819
 does not look so good in the channel 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.530
 Peas and water are best warm 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.530
 water then it does not take so long 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.840
 so the red bar is now the rat 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.290
 window i take the audio therme 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.670
 down hacker attack and switch 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.670
 back here on level six 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.290
 the two slices 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:18.930
 with onions with others the half 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.930
 of it the 17 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.130
 that brings so Brittig already where we 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.690
 I do not mean the whole heart 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.900
 pack one but can still 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.900
 indoors 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.950
 potatoes with a 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:59.970
 which one with one always says one man 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:03.810
 I want to know how nice that looks 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.810
 doubt vegetable broth 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.260
 Where 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.240
 and what you can do boiling water 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:28.170
 that or warm or hot water then 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:28.170
 How fast is it to the lid 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.910
 Please do not fill up with the water 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.170
 as if you're allowed to do that, that 's the way it is 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.910
 one should not make a basic rule 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.110
 so if we do that now with the normal one 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.730
 then would do that 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.470
 court about one to two hours 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.700
 last because the first samples very long 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.620
 until you are done and the piece 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.690
 It takes a very long time , too 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.940
 not to accept other beautiful illusion 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.730
 this normal blanket but in ours 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.650
 six softline the overdrive then you 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.480
 you all in your assortment does not matter 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.930
 is like going it fits on the Sun 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.490
 or one way or another that's always right yes 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.050
 and here we have a cog that one 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.700
 It can also turn children alone 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.460
 we just spend too and then it is 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.580
 the whole pot to have up here 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.710
 the two stages are soft and soft for it 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.630
 pasta rice potatoes vegetables 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.970
 You can say everything that is already so 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.200
 Cope quickly and turbos for everything 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.430
 which takes a long time if you want fat 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.960
 For example, pieces are in there 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.850
 or just meat a hunk 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.340
 has or hard legumes like that 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.140
 today have preparation again 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.150
 easy as a child instead of one and a half to two 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.620
 He served the soup only 25 minutes 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.960
 cook and he does that completely 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.330
 automatically your ami genoni goes too 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.290
 is here on stage six switches 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.360
 once again on stage automatic again 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.090
 take your audio therm and press 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.770
 It does not matter where we go 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.090
 that turns a wheel here when 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.950
 again it pushes you did it here 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.700
 Ten minutes are here, you give more 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.800
 minutes 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.210
 I spend less minutes here 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:58.180
 ask the only now in 25 minutes 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.370
 bake this case up on the turbo 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.960
 window because that takes a long time to 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.680
 finished and turn it once and that 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.960
 second time 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.090
 Now I do exist here 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.500
 starts flashing and from this moment on 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.880
 can you do what you want again 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.919
 he does it all by himself 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.020
 Finished off when the sun goes down 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.759
 is dangerous and holds at least one 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.020
 hour from 60 degrees in the cell phone after 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.560
 Home always come warm it is still 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.919
 differences 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:28.120
 and so easy 60 degrees 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.740
 that is, if you are on straight way 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.910
 yes , no problem is the hero at all 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.169
 360 degrees 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.440
 and we always come to the outside 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.849
 Hot food here the lid is now 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.169
 to that the child insurance gets the 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:42.250
 not now if I do that again 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.599
 audio terbeck so i could do it too 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.680
 There are now three ways to do it 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.270
 can make the lid on 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.680
 The first option is simply one 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.210
 let stand a little then yes is synonymous 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.099
 by itself on the second possibility 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.509
 the fastest way is easy 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.889
 a bit of cold water in vasbeck 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.599
 make and the floor in cold water 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.460
 It then takes two minutes to dive 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.960
 also bypasses third possibility is yes 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.039
 please do not press the button here 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.820
 scare and not in the pressure cooker 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.490
 imitate 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.380
 then comes from this steam is just warm 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.699
 and not hot they have a spiral 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.310
 it cools down and then comes the 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.780
 steaming out the pressure omit quasi 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.099
 I do that today with the sink 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.509
 way that looks a bit cold 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:15.990
 to make the water pure you look us right away 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:15.990
 Super 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.310
 the soup is ready now we get 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.870
 take a nice decision with you 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.580
 fried bacon here you can 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.900
 The premiere will be the last fight and 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:37.850
 You hear the heart risen for a long time 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:41.450
 we watch a really nice I hit 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.740
 the color is all through the carrots 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.960
 even the onion remained 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.980
 swim but the peas are overcooked 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.310
 as they should be 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.800
 she was all right on the spot and 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.810
 the meat is as far as that goes 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.380
 from the bone I still take one 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.370
 bit of herbs wants 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.390
 oh so a little thinner with pure 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.390
 mix this once 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:07.889
 you have a finished pea soup with 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:11.059
 hard peas and reminds a slice 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:11.059
 finished in 25 minutes 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:16.989
 this is our first
