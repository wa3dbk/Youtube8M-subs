00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
bit of time for that tight section now

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.170 
bit of time for that tight section now

but I'm actually nail that right hander
a<00:01:36.210> fair<00:01:36.450> bit<00:01:36.570> better<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> give<00:01:37.860> me

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
a fair bit better just going to give me

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.740 
a fair bit better just going to give me
a<00:01:38.010> fairly<00:01:38.550> good<00:01:38.700> opportunity<00:01:39.270> coming<00:01:39.570> down

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
a fairly good opportunity coming down

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
pretty much the same move but also was

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.710 
pretty much the same move but also was
having<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.619> look<00:02:10.709> about<00:02:11.100> my<00:02:11.370> outside<00:02:11.850> in<00:02:12.090> that

tight right-hander so

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.050

we've<00:02:14.950> managed<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.220> slip<00:02:15.400> up<00:02:15.580> at<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.790> first

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
we've managed to slip up at the first

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.240 
we've managed to slip up at the first
about<00:02:16.450> audi<00:02:16.630> r8<00:02:17.110> losing<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.920> couple<00:02:18.100> of

musicians in the space of a few corners

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.530 
musicians in the space of a few corners
so<00:02:20.980> now<00:02:21.190> my<00:02:21.550> focus<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:22.000> on<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.240> road<00:02:22.420> ahead

opposite<00:02:43.300> lock<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:45.310> wasn't<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.640> good

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
opposite lock and that wasn't a good

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.490 
opposite lock and that wasn't a good
corner<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.390> locked<00:02:46.600> up<00:02:46.780> ever<00:02:47.050> so<00:02:47.230> slightly

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
make sure it doesn't get a good look now

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.130 
make sure it doesn't get a good look now
it's<00:03:09.970> just<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.150> case<00:03:10.300> of<00:03:10.360> powering<00:03:10.660> out<00:03:10.960> in<00:03:11.080> the

the final corner of this short version
of<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.300> circuit<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:37.930> he<00:03:38.560> is<00:03:38.680> actually<00:03:38.800> very

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
of the circuit so he is actually very

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.170 
of the circuit so he is actually very
close<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.490> know<00:03:39.610> he's<00:03:39.700> going<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.850> be<00:03:39.970> able<00:03:40.060> to

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
close I know he's going to be able to

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.240 
close I know he's going to be able to
get<00:03:40.300> fairly<00:03:40.750> good<00:03:41.050> run<00:03:41.230> down<00:03:41.440> here<00:03:41.710> he's<00:03:42.070> now

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
get fairly good run down here he's now

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.680 
get fairly good run down here he's now
thought<00:03:42.490> to<00:03:42.520> my<00:03:42.730> insights<00:03:43.120> on<00:03:43.270> the<00:03:43.420> given

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
thought to my insights on the given

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.120 
thought to my insights on the given
plenty<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:44.050> room<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.320> basically<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.770> just<00:03:44.980> got

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
plenty of room and basically I just got

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.260 
plenty of room and basically I just got
to<00:03:45.190> try<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.460> hang<00:03:45.580> it<00:03:45.700> around<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.970> outside

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
to try and hang it around the outside

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.060 
to try and hang it around the outside
come<00:03:46.420> into<00:03:46.630> this<00:03:46.720> corner<00:03:46.990> so<00:03:47.590> is<00:03:47.680> there<00:03:47.830> on<00:03:47.950> the

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
come into this corner so is there on the

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.070 
come into this corner so is there on the
inside<00:03:48.400> got<00:03:48.730> a<00:03:48.760> little<00:03:49.240> bit<00:03:49.330> too<00:03:49.450> deep<00:03:49.660> more<00:03:49.870> so

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
inside got a little bit too deep more so

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.960 
inside got a little bit too deep more so
than<00:03:50.230> I<00:03:50.290> actually<00:03:50.470> wanted<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:50.950> just<00:03:51.730> allowed

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970

that<00:04:29.350> opportunity<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:30.010> try<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.310> step<00:04:30.520> up<00:04:30.550> the

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
that opportunity to try and step up the

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.700 
that opportunity to try and step up the
inside<00:04:31.120> through<00:04:31.810> this<00:04:31.930> right<00:04:32.170> hand<00:04:32.410> but<00:04:32.500> have

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
inside through this right hand but have

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.040 
inside through this right hand but have
been<00:04:32.890> and<00:04:33.130> that's<00:04:33.280> exactly<00:04:33.490> what<00:04:33.940> that<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.480> was

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
been and that's exactly what that I was

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.510 
been and that's exactly what that I was
actually<00:04:35.290> pretty<00:04:35.470> quite<00:04:35.770> surprised<00:04:36.130> by<00:04:36.340> that

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
actually pretty quite surprised by that

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.600 
actually pretty quite surprised by that
as<00:04:36.730> too<00:04:37.240> I<00:04:37.620> guess<00:04:38.620> he<00:04:38.770> probably<00:04:39.010> ran<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.340> little

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
as too I guess he probably ran a little

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.270 
as too I guess he probably ran a little
bit<00:04:39.850> too<00:04:39.970> deep<00:04:40.210> into<00:04:40.420> the<00:04:40.630> corner<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.169> he<00:04:42.070> just

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
bit too deep into the corner and he just

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.520 
bit too deep into the corner and he just
left<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.550> door<00:04:42.760> wide<00:04:42.790> open<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.510> obviously<00:04:44.110> as

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
left the door wide open and obviously as

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.250 
left the door wide open and obviously as
you<00:04:44.590> saw<00:04:44.919> seize<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.850> opportunity<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.660> retake

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260

puff<00:05:41.440> of<00:05:41.560> smoke<00:05:41.680> in<00:05:42.070> the<00:05:42.340> rearview<00:05:43.030> mirror<00:05:43.390> as

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
puff of smoke in the rearview mirror as

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.140 
puff of smoke in the rearview mirror as
the<00:05:45.230> wheel<00:05:45.440> spin<00:05:45.800> up<00:05:45.919> so<00:05:46.130> again<00:05:46.520> he's<00:05:46.669> gone<00:05:46.880> a

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
the wheel spin up so again he's gone a

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.900 
the wheel spin up so again he's gone a
little<00:05:47.870> bit<00:05:48.290> to<00:05:48.620> my<00:05:48.800> outsider<00:05:49.250> she<00:05:49.580> squeezed

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
little bit to my outsider she squeezed

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.430 
little bit to my outsider she squeezed
him<00:05:50.090> out<00:05:50.240> there<00:05:50.510> I<00:05:50.720> also<00:05:50.870> think<00:05:51.110> he<00:05:51.230> ran<00:05:51.410> a

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
him out there I also think he ran a

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.620 
him out there I also think he ran a
little<00:05:51.740> bit<00:05:51.980> deep<00:05:52.190> as<00:05:52.400> well<00:05:52.580> so<00:05:53.389> I<00:05:53.419> didn't

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
little bit deep as well so I didn't

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.659 
little bit deep as well so I didn't
actually<00:05:53.720> squeeze<00:05:54.080> him<00:05:54.260> out<00:05:54.380> too<00:05:54.950> much<00:05:55.190> before

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
actually squeeze him out too much before

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:56.980 
actually squeeze him out too much before
he<00:05:56.030> would<00:05:56.150> have<00:05:56.270> tried<00:05:56.389> ducking<00:05:56.750> underneath

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
he would have tried ducking underneath

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.670 
he would have tried ducking underneath
me<00:05:57.320> if<00:05:57.500> he'd<00:05:58.490> seen<00:05:58.760> that<00:05:58.940> coming<00:05:59.470> but<00:06:00.470> that's

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
it kind of played into the central as a

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.430 
it kind of played into the central as a
vantage<00:06:59.360> a<00:06:59.630> little<00:06:59.840> bit<00:06:59.960> with<00:07:00.110> the<00:07:00.200> tighter

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
vantage a little bit with the tighter
