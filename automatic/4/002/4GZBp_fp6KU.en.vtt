 a mister me here of course a viking 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:44.929
 but how do you do this, it's very easy 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.999
 with the hunger that you think you are 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:50.749
 a very easy crafter if you are seeing it 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:53.480
 well of course for 172 you already know and 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:56.899
 we need two chests two blocks of 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.880
 height as if it were the statue I am a 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.070
 donkey 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.350
 ready like this 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.990
 we click on it and here it will appear 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.700
 this we will be able to move your 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.610
 arms but we like to put more 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.500
 random so let's put schema to 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.820
 it stays very still and here you can 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.470
 put a man in if you want another 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.110
 character like right now I'm 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.410
 using and if to see we put 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.720
 this and saw this and I change my 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.720
 character so it looks better 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.680
 what a lot and what can we do after 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.320
 well, we give it that way with 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.590
 anything we give you with any 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.750
 thing and we can put a gun for 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.090
 Of course we can put a gun in 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.790
 any hand also armor and with 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.610
 this we can manipulate his back where 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.060
 can go the gun of course it's not very 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.510
 favorable, I always leave it there and 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.750
 it is but what else is there is the 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.150
 pipeline that is made with a wooden and 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.550
 These colors are very easy to 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.780
 get the truth I sometimes do not speak 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.730
 I do not get them if this is one to put 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.010
 the normal armor 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.670
 the trophies comes right for your sword 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.670
 Of course 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.360
 and here we also have sculptures but 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.280
 you will say but because only of 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.190
 these minerals is being made of 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.989
 I do not want night at night because 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.000
 only these minerals and because one 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.650
 you do not see them in the face, it's very easy 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.440
 because they are different from willis and they 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.349

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:42.000
