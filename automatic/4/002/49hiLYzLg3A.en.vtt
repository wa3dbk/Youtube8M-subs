personal first of all given can on the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.830 
personal first of all given can on the
begin<00:02:24.579> of<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.819> game<00:02:24.970> it's<00:02:25.480> got<00:02:25.659> to<00:02:25.780> be

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
begin of the game it's got to be

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.559 
begin of the game it's got to be
difficult<00:02:26.489> because<00:02:27.489> I<00:02:27.849> think<00:02:28.299> there's<00:02:28.450> kind

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
difficult because I think there's kind

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.350 
difficult because I think there's kind
much<00:02:28.810> some<00:02:29.290> quick<00:02:29.980> transitions<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:31.060> make

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
much some quick transitions and make

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.170 
much some quick transitions and make
some<00:02:31.569> dangerous<00:02:31.930> but<00:02:32.709> I'm<00:02:33.280> leaning<00:02:33.819> towards

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
some dangerous but I'm leaning towards

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.800 
some dangerous but I'm leaning towards
towards<00:02:34.480> NASCAR<00:02:35.049> at<00:02:35.319> least<00:02:35.590> balls<00:02:36.010> here<00:02:36.810> those

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
towards NASCAR at least balls here those

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.979 
towards NASCAR at least balls here those
three<00:02:37.989> balls<00:02:38.230> so<00:02:38.769> I<00:02:39.190> believe<00:02:40.090> line<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.690> very

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
three balls so I believe line is very

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.289 
three balls so I believe line is very
great<00:02:41.319> so<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.950> prefer<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.670> not<00:02:42.700> play<00:02:43.030> neither

yeah<00:02:49.120> yeah<00:02:49.450> exactly<00:02:49.629> it<00:02:50.079> could<00:02:50.139> be<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.590> nail<00:02:50.769> it

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
yeah yeah exactly it could be to nail it

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.559 
yeah yeah exactly it could be to nail it
could<00:02:51.129> be<00:02:51.250> three<00:02:51.489> no<00:02:51.639> but<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.180> question<00:02:52.269> is

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
could be three no but the question is

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.509 
could be three no but the question is
though<00:02:52.720> will<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:52.930> be<00:02:53.109> nil<00:02:53.530> agonist<00:02:54.190> Anil<00:02:54.489> is

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
though will it be nil agonist Anil is

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.849 
though will it be nil agonist Anil is
two<00:02:54.940> point<00:02:55.239> three<00:02:55.599> is<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.319> a<00:02:56.349> bet<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:56.650> you

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
two point three is that a bet that you

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
the enterprise I believe that it's not

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.430 
the enterprise I believe that it's not
such<00:03:05.139> a<00:03:05.170> big<00:03:05.440> Bell<00:03:05.819> considering<00:03:06.819> that<00:03:07.060> yes

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
such a big Bell considering that yes

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.550 
such a big Bell considering that yes
another<00:03:08.440> best<00:03:08.739> to<00:03:08.950> play<00:03:09.159> here<00:03:09.989> we<00:03:10.989> can<00:03:11.409> play

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
another best to play here we can play

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.250 
another best to play here we can play
Arsenal<00:03:12.250> half<00:03:12.489> time<00:03:13.060> full<00:03:13.299> time<00:03:13.329> around<00:03:13.900> true

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
Arsenal half time full time around true

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.400 
Arsenal half time full time around true
that<00:03:14.680> it's<00:03:15.370> preferable<00:03:15.849> because<00:03:16.139> we'll<00:03:17.139> need

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
that it's preferable because we'll need

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.069 
that it's preferable because we'll need
to<00:03:17.650> gain<00:03:17.859> with<00:03:18.579> very<00:03:19.150> strong<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:19.690> this<00:03:19.840> game

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
to gain with very strong in this game

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.470 
to gain with very strong in this game
and<00:03:20.290> start<00:03:21.010> winning<00:03:21.220> almost<00:03:21.639> size<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.419> start

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
and start winning almost size to start

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.189 
and start winning almost size to start
of<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:22.989> game<00:03:23.169> to<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.910> get<00:03:25.090> more<00:03:26.069> density<00:03:28.199> that

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
of the game to to get more density that

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.860 
of the game to to get more density that
they<00:03:29.440> will<00:03:29.650> have<00:03:29.889> to<00:03:29.919> on<00:03:30.699> this<00:03:30.910> match<00:03:31.150> away

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
they will have to on this match away

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.860 
they will have to on this match away
throw<00:03:32.349> it<00:03:32.470> away<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:33.280> so<00:03:33.819> I<00:03:33.879> believe<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.419> it's

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
throw it away and so I believe that it's

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.930 
throw it away and so I believe that it's
preferable<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.349> play<00:03:35.680> arsenal<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.459> thankful

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
preferable to play arsenal of thankful

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.939 
preferable to play arsenal of thankful
time<00:03:37.150> then<00:03:37.419> a<00:03:37.690> wing<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:38.109> kneel<00:03:38.260> here<00:03:38.560> because

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
time then a wing to kneel here because

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.879 
time then a wing to kneel here because
basic<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.690> like<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.840> said<00:03:41.079> before<00:03:41.230> they<00:03:41.769> have

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
basic this like I said before they have

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.220 
basic this like I said before they have
big<00:03:42.160> transitions<00:03:42.730> they<00:03:42.910> have<00:03:43.030> also<00:03:43.510> the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
big transitions they have also the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.740 
big transitions they have also the
striker<00:03:44.769> that<00:03:44.919> used<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.400> be<00:03:45.639> to<00:03:46.419> play<00:03:46.629> on

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
striker that used to be to play on

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.050 
striker that used to be to play on
Premier<00:03:47.139> League<00:03:47.260> so<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:48.010> would<00:03:48.669> prefer<00:03:49.030> to

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
Premier League so I would prefer to

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.110 
Premier League so I would prefer to
avoid<00:03:49.989> that<00:03:50.440> one<00:03:50.709> all<00:03:51.280> right<00:03:51.340> can<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.030> see

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
avoid that one all right can you see

avoid that one all right can you see
passionate<00:03:52.660> are<00:03:52.810> scoring<00:03:53.349> both<00:03:53.949> teams<00:03:54.280> to

passionate are scoring both teams to

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.240 
passionate are scoring both teams to
schools<00:03:54.669> priced<00:03:54.909> at<00:03:55.090> two<00:03:55.209> point<00:03:55.419> one<00:03:56.250> yeah

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
schools priced at two point one yeah

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.300

like<00:03:57.669> I<00:03:57.819> said<00:03:57.849> before<00:03:58.239> I<00:03:58.840> think<00:03:59.079> that<00:03:59.470> it's

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
like I said before I think that it's

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.930 
like I said before I think that it's
unpredictable<00:04:01.030> here<00:04:02.099> I<00:04:03.099> think<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.489> test<00:04:03.760> the

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
unpredictable here I think this test the

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.199 
unpredictable here I think this test the
chances<00:04:04.419> of<00:04:04.540> make<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.169> balls<00:04:05.349> so<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:06.159> won't<00:04:06.940> play

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
chances of make it balls so I won't play

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.059 
chances of make it balls so I won't play
the<00:04:07.269> most<00:04:08.229> useless<00:04:08.560> car

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
the most useless car

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.030 
the most useless car
neither<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.810> domain<00:04:10.810> janila<00:04:11.169> Arsenal<00:04:11.709> all

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
neither the domain janila Arsenal all

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.469
