00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.660
 building a house using heat blocks 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.760
 consists of several main stages 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.540
 it all starts like on any construction site with 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.610
 foundation 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.650
 since the walls are built of heat 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.570
 the blocks are pretty easy then 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.359
 enough to build a house of 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.900
 simple little buried foundation 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.730
 first row of blocks 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.859
 according to the project fits on 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.019
 cement and inferred ideal level 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.330
 correcting possible minor irregularities 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.919
 the foundation is still the rest of the series 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.140
 laid out on a special glue 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.120
 which is very easy to prepare right on 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:41.710
 construction site from a dry mix 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:44.800
 water years bucket pour some water 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:50.020
 spike 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.020
 take the mixer not therefore 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.650
 beaten up the house is going as a constructor 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.100
 that is, each block has its own 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.910
 appointment corner to the young lady district 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.370
 Breaking a window that is not needed before you 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.560
 ready to take and lay the corner block 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.410
 put on the corner to him goes to the young lady 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.880
 group total thickness of foam in a circle 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.250
 should be 200 millimeters because of this 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.630
 that is, if you take a private you will see 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.390
 how would the back of the concrete and 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.850
 to the young lady goes to him 5 centimeters 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.920
 polystyrene gets lift block 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.830
 the side is made of concrete to 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.160
 fasten the door people this galya 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:34.030
 Steal the solution of the cut block 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.220
 facing tiles and the back of the block 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.649
 also on erase the main not 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.910
 essential to the face 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:45.490
 put the corner block check the level 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.940
 horizon gum him the next block 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.490
 laid before the young lady comes with foam 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.360
 Steal mortar comb spatula one 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.930
 pebble checked also by level you 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.479
 We check plumb line find 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.540
 all checked the joints between the blocks where 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.509
 pins once filled with foam 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.399
 fiddle around with everything he fills it 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.200
 space 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.040
 aware of you clearing of the solution except 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.370
 which laid out 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.739
 and subsequently rubbed with a mixture 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.540
 grout for tile ceresit that is 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.519
 the pigment is matched to the color of the blocks 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.100
 style the price of the movie looks like it flies 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.959
 wore and that's the way the unit for 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.269
 block row by row and walls are built 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.840
 residential warehouse or production 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.299
 building 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.100
 rather large data nomenclature 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.560
 blocks allows you to build houses from the most 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.600
 diverse architectural forms in 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.610
 in each case according to the project 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.590
 clear calculation of each species is carried out 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.420
 blocks because the customer does not have to 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.850
 spend extra money on surplus 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.500
 materials from which practically 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.150
 impossible to do when building from 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.799
 brick or monolithic 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.409
 especially also a huge advantage 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.659
 This technology is saving on 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.510
 construction time and weight of one unit 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.370
 on average about 25 kilograms any 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.680
 an adult can effortlessly 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.950
 do the packing of these blocks when 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.269
 no special knowledge is required 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.909
 for example one mason 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.620
 and two assistants will need only 4 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.500
 day to put the box 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.709
 one-storey house measuring 8 by 12 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.709
 meters
