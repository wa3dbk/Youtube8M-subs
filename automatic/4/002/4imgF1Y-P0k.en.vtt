a<00:02:59.580> text<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.210> was<00:03:00.560> very<00:03:01.560> much<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:03.000> text<00:03:03.330> view

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
a text that was very much the text view

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.470 
a text that was very much the text view
defined<00:03:03.810> enough<00:03:04.250> in<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.850> product<00:03:06.150> catalog

defined enough in the product catalog
and<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:06.960> I<00:03:07.050> believe<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.590> actually<00:03:07.920> the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670

and and I believe this is actually the
text<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.180> very<00:03:09.870> much<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.110> kind<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.940> little<00:03:11.940> bit

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
text is very much a kind of a little bit

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.710 
text is very much a kind of a little bit
of<00:03:12.180> artistic<00:03:12.990> working<00:03:13.680> with<00:03:14.630> with<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
of artistic working with with the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.350 
of artistic working with with the
original<00:03:16.170> product<00:03:17.040> text<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.150> was

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
original product text and so it was

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.150 
original product text and so it was
product<00:03:18.930> design<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.680> was<00:03:19.830> obviously

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
photography and it was typography and it

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.030 
photography and it was typography and it
was<00:03:22.740> in<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:23.010> way<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.400> kind<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.930> graphic<00:03:25.040> the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
was in a way the kind of graphic the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.490 
was in a way the kind of graphic the
graphic<00:03:26.460> work<00:03:26.730> this<00:03:27.210> use<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.480> foil<00:03:28.020> here<00:03:28.440> I

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
graphic work this use of foil here I

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.020 
graphic work this use of foil here I
mean<00:03:28.740> this<00:03:28.890> day<00:03:29.160> when<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.430> saw<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.850> in<00:03:29.940> $2,000<00:03:30.930> I

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
mean this day when I saw it in $2,000 I

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.700 
mean this day when I saw it in $2,000 I
was<00:03:33.030> shocked<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.570> was<00:03:33.600> shocked<00:03:33.990> for<00:03:34.080> myself<00:03:34.560> I

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
was shocked I was shocked for myself I

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.240 
was shocked I was shocked for myself I
mean<00:03:34.860> it's<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.280> much<00:03:35.750> like<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.990> use<00:03:37.200> of

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
mean it's so much like the use of

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.170 
mean it's so much like the use of
materials<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.580> that<00:03:40.400> that<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.430> attempted<00:03:42.060> at

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
materials that that that I attempted at

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.930 
materials that that that I attempted at
factory<00:03:42.960> records<00:03:43.170> is<00:03:44.010> exactly<00:03:44.460> the<00:03:44.640> kind<00:03:44.820> of

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
factory records is exactly the kind of

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.970 
factory records is exactly the kind of
thing<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.300> I<00:03:45.510> would<00:03:45.990> have<00:03:46.080> attempted<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.560> do<00:03:46.800> on

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
thing I I would have attempted to do on

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.790 
thing I I would have attempted to do on
a<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.340> poster<00:03:47.880> for<00:03:48.030> factory<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.800> the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
a on a poster for factory and that the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.880 
a on a poster for factory and that the
whole<00:03:50.310> kind<00:03:50.610> of<00:03:50.730> sensibility<00:03:51.270> of<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.960> I<00:03:52.140> was

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
whole kind of sensibility of it I was

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.030 
whole kind of sensibility of it I was
shocked<00:03:53.190> when<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:53.430> saw<00:03:53.550> it<00:03:53.880> in<00:03:54.000> 2000<00:03:55.040> because

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
shocked when I saw it in 2000 because

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.470 
shocked when I saw it in 2000 because
I'd<00:03:57.890> it's<00:03:58.890> kind<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.190> like<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.430> blueprint<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.330> my

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
I'd it's kind of like a blueprint to my

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:08.700 
I'd it's kind of like a blueprint to my
own<00:04:00.660> work
