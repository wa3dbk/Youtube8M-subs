00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
crashes you're gonna crash and depending

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.509 
crashes you're gonna crash and depending
on<00:00:09.480> whether<00:00:09.929> you've<00:00:10.110> got<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.349> indoor<00:00:10.980> or<00:00:11.219> the

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
dog huddle as this one is you of course

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.820 
dog huddle as this one is you of course
could<00:00:15.240> crash<00:00:15.599> into<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.960> tree<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.529> could<00:00:16.650> just

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
could crash into a tree you could just

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.260 
could crash into a tree you could just
flip<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.130> upside<00:00:17.430> down<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.970> falls<00:00:18.180> down

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
flip it upside down and it falls down

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.830 
flip it upside down and it falls down
onto<00:00:18.869> grass<00:00:19.650> or<00:00:20.010> concrete<00:00:20.580> or<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.420> might<00:00:21.600> hit

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
onto grass or concrete or you might hit

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.810 
onto grass or concrete or you might hit
something<00:00:22.050> quite<00:00:22.380> solid<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.859> damage<00:00:23.640> all<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
something quite solid and damage all the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.420 
something quite solid and damage all the
blades<00:00:24.350> sometimes<00:00:25.350> other<00:00:25.769> damage<00:00:26.070> isn't<00:00:26.220> so

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
blades sometimes other damage isn't so

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.130 
blades sometimes other damage isn't so
obvious<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.269> need<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.539> inspect<00:00:27.869> things

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
obvious and you need to inspect things

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.839 
obvious and you need to inspect things
so<00:00:28.320> typically<00:00:28.680> when<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.890> brush<00:00:29.160> I'll<00:00:29.429> make<00:00:29.670> sure

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
so typically when I brush I'll make sure

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.359 
so typically when I brush I'll make sure
I<00:00:29.880> write<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.300> unit<00:00:30.570> I'll<00:00:30.869> spin<00:00:31.560> each<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
I write the unit I'll spin each of the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.580 
I write the unit I'll spin each of the
blades<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.329> feeling<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.140> I'm<00:00:34.380> listening

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
blades and I'm feeling and I'm listening

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.310 
blades and I'm feeling and I'm listening
for<00:00:35.010> any<00:00:36.559> sounds<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.739> are<00:00:38.730> untoward<00:00:39.320> now

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
for any sounds that are untoward now

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.110 
for any sounds that are untoward now
I've<00:00:40.500> crashed<00:00:40.800> into<00:00:40.980> trees<00:00:41.280> before<00:00:41.640> where

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
I've crashed into trees before where

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.180 
I've crashed into trees before where
I'll<00:00:42.239> actually<00:00:42.329> had<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> leaf<00:00:42.989> get<00:00:43.590> chewed<00:00:43.890> into

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
I'll actually had a leaf get chewed into

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.250 
I'll actually had a leaf get chewed into
the<00:00:44.280> gear<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.329> had<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.750> pull<00:00:46.079> out

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the gear and have to I had to pull out

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.680 
the gear and have to I had to pull out
all<00:00:46.440> kinds<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.800> debris<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.640> foliage<00:00:48.059> from<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
all kinds of debris and foliage from the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.389 
all kinds of debris and foliage from the
gears<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.230> that's<00:00:49.500> important<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.219> make<00:00:50.370> sure

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
gears and that's important to make sure

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.400 
gears and that's important to make sure
you<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:50.850> grinding<00:00:51.750> unnecessarily

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
you not then grinding unnecessarily

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.950 
you not then grinding unnecessarily
these<00:00:52.590> are<00:00:52.739> plastic<00:00:53.219> nylon<00:00:53.399> gears<00:00:53.840> but<00:00:54.840> I've

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
these are plastic nylon gears but I've

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.930 
these are plastic nylon gears but I've
also<00:00:55.140> hit<00:00:55.379> things<00:00:55.649> quite<00:00:56.010> hard<00:00:56.340> this

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
also hit things quite hard this

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.479 
also hit things quite hard this
particular<00:00:57.629> blade<00:00:58.140> didn't<00:00:59.010> break<00:00:59.190> anything

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
particular blade didn't break anything

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.549 
particular blade didn't break anything
but<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.210> hoping<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> show<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.840> as<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.170> spin

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
but I'm hoping to show this as I spin

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.979 
but I'm hoping to show this as I spin
this<00:01:01.710> unit<00:01:02.480> there's<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.539> little<00:01:03.809> bit<00:01:03.899> of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
this unit there's a little bit of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.130 
this unit there's a little bit of
movement<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.650> down<00:01:06.290> just<00:01:08.180> maybe<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.420> but

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
movement up and down just maybe not but

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.750 
movement up and down just maybe not but
you<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.220> believe<00:01:11.310> me

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
you have to believe me

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.000 
you have to believe me
so<00:01:12.330> basically<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.960> cog<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.619> no<00:01:13.799> longer

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
so basically this cog is no longer

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.800 
so basically this cog is no longer
horizontal<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> unit<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.390> now<00:01:15.600> at<00:01:15.780> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
horizontal to the unit it's now at a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.840 
horizontal to the unit it's now at a
kilter<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.560> when<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.830> rotating<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.640> only

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
kilter so when it's rotating is only

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.280 
kilter so when it's rotating is only
just<00:01:18.390> connecting<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.710> actual<00:01:20.600> engine<00:01:21.600> cog

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
just connecting to the actual engine cog

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.890 
just connecting to the actual engine cog
here<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:25.110> I've<00:01:25.320> got<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.530> real<00:01:25.950> up-and-down

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
here and I've got a real up-and-down

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.719 
here and I've got a real up-and-down
come<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> slightly<00:01:28.320> skewed<00:01:28.710> oscillation<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.520> at

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
come a slightly skewed oscillation so at

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.780 
come a slightly skewed oscillation so at
the<00:01:29.820> very<00:01:29.850> top<00:01:30.060> there<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.340> about<00:01:32.340> there<00:01:32.610> it's

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
the very top there and about there it's

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.090 
the very top there and about there it's
quite<00:01:33.030> at<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> bottom<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.799> basically<00:01:34.799> I'd

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
quite at the bottom and basically I'd

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.490 
quite at the bottom and basically I'd
bend<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.549> pin<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.990> an<00:01:37.200> easy<00:01:37.380> enough

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
bend the pin so it's an easy enough

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.310 
bend the pin so it's an easy enough
prepare<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:39.750> doesn't<00:01:39.900> actually<00:01:40.079> need

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
prepare to do it doesn't actually need

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.109 
prepare to do it doesn't actually need
repairing<00:01:40.710> at<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.920> Raymond<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.850> didn't

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
repairing at this Raymond it's I didn't

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.090 
repairing at this Raymond it's I didn't
actually<00:01:42.240> fly<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.869> second<00:01:43.350> time<00:01:43.500> after<00:01:43.950> doing

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
actually fly a second time after doing

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.410 
actually fly a second time after doing
the<00:01:44.189> damage<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.640> he's<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> need<00:01:45.119> doing

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the damage but he's going to need doing

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.940 
the damage but he's going to need doing
because<00:01:45.570> what<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.869> don't<00:01:45.990> want<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.380> is

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
because what you don't want to do is

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.730 
because what you don't want to do is
damage<00:01:47.939> or<00:01:48.210> where<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.840> motor<00:01:49.049> necessarily

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
damage or where the motor necessarily

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.859 
damage or where the motor necessarily
because<00:01:49.890> there's<00:01:50.040> more<00:01:50.189> expensive<00:01:50.670> repair<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
because there's more expensive repair to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.350 
because there's more expensive repair to
do<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.140> pin<00:01:52.409> repair<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.220> need<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.520> buy<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
do this pin repair you need to buy the
