because the stone was here soapstone is

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.410 
because the stone was here soapstone is
fairly<00:01:12.770> unique<00:01:13.160> in<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:13.550> it<00:01:13.820> holds<00:01:14.090> and

I<00:01:27.250> will<00:01:28.250> have<00:01:28.399> to<00:01:28.580> admit<00:01:28.729> that<00:01:29.210> we<00:01:29.360> kind<00:01:29.899> of

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
I will have to admit that we kind of

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
laughed at him a little bit we went out

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.830 
laughed at him a little bit we went out
to<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.740> scrap<00:01:34.039> pile<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.580> we<00:01:34.759> cut<00:01:35.390> him<00:01:35.539> up<00:01:35.660> a

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
to the scrap pile and we cut him up a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.830 
to the scrap pile and we cut him up a
few<00:01:36.140> pieces<00:01:36.759> we<00:01:37.759> shipped<00:01:38.060> him<00:01:38.240> down<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.690> him

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
few pieces we shipped him down to him

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.190 
few pieces we shipped him down to him
and<00:01:39.140> we<00:01:39.619> are<00:01:39.649> three<00:01:40.460> four<00:01:40.729> years<00:01:41.000> later<00:01:41.300> and<00:01:41.750> I

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
and we are three four years later and I

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.109 
and we are three four years later and I
think<00:01:42.710> at<00:01:42.800> this<00:01:42.920> point<00:01:42.979> we've<00:01:43.430> made<00:01:43.460> him<00:01:43.820> about

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
think at this point we've made him about

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.719 
think at this point we've made him about
three<00:01:44.479> million<00:01:44.750> pieces<00:01:45.399> it's<00:01:46.399> a<00:01:46.520> lot<00:01:46.700> of

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
three million pieces it's a lot of

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.380 
three million pieces it's a lot of
pieces<00:01:47.410> it's<00:01:48.410> a<00:01:48.530> really<00:01:48.830> a<00:01:48.860> lot<00:01:49.070> of<00:01:49.220> pieces

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.440 

we<00:01:53.320> produced<00:01:53.590> them<00:01:53.980> first<00:01:54.400> with<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:54.730> sharp<00:01:55.090> cut

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
we produced them first with a sharp cut

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.810 
we produced them first with a sharp cut
edge<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.500> sharpness<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.340> didn't<00:01:57.670> look

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
edge and the sharpness it didn't look

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.660 
edge and the sharpness it didn't look
great<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.390> didn't<00:01:58.690> look<00:01:58.810> like<00:01:58.870> a<00:01:59.110> nice<00:01:59.380> skew

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.490 

what<00:02:03.670> we<00:02:03.790> figured<00:02:04.150> out<00:02:04.360> finally<00:02:04.810> was<00:02:05.170> we

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
what we figured out finally was we

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.969 
what we figured out finally was we
rented<00:02:06.010> a<00:02:06.130> cement<00:02:06.490> mixer<00:02:07.410> dumped<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.470> bucket<00:02:08.679> of

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
rented a cement mixer dumped a bucket of

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.820 
rented a cement mixer dumped a bucket of
them<00:02:09.100> in<00:02:09.310> there<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.810> they<00:02:10.960> tumble<00:02:11.350> against

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
them in there and they tumble against

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.250 
them in there and they tumble against
each<00:02:12.010> other<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.730> gets<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.210> good<00:02:13.510> finish<00:02:14.110> on

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
each other and it gets a good finish on

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.820 
each other and it gets a good finish on
the<00:02:14.410> edges<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.990> know<00:02:17.050> there<00:02:17.380> are<00:02:17.500> ways<00:02:17.800> to

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
the edges you know there are ways to

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.449 
the edges you know there are ways to
solve<00:02:18.490> almost<00:02:18.760> every<00:02:19.240> problem<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:24.190> know<00:02:24.310> the

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
solve almost every problem you know the

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.460 
solve almost every problem you know the
New<00:02:24.640> England<00:02:24.790> economy<00:02:25.510> which<00:02:25.690> is<00:02:25.840> our<00:02:25.990> market

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
New England economy which is our market

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.350 
New England economy which is our market
and<00:02:26.620> architectural<00:02:27.280> stone<00:02:27.580> has<00:02:27.850> certainly

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
and architectural stone has certainly

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.300 
and architectural stone has certainly
had<00:02:28.600> its<00:02:28.750> issues<00:02:29.140> over<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.500> last<00:02:29.680> five<00:02:30.280> years

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
had its issues over the last five years

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.350 
had its issues over the last five years
or<00:02:30.820> so<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:32.650> whiskey<00:02:33.010> stone<00:02:33.340> says<00:02:33.700> help<00:02:34.120> to

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
or so the whiskey stone says help to

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.640 
or so the whiskey stone says help to
keep<00:02:34.540> us<00:02:34.750> afloat

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
keep us afloat

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.720 
keep us afloat
quite<00:02:36.190> honestly<00:02:36.370> yeah<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:38.610> remember<00:02:39.610> my

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
quite honestly yeah I remember my

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.610 
quite honestly yeah I remember my
grandfather<00:02:40.090> remember<00:02:40.780> he<00:02:40.959> had<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.320> bottle

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
grandfather remember he had that bottle

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.610 
grandfather remember he had that bottle
that<00:02:41.920> he<00:02:42.040> kept<00:02:42.250> up<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.730> top<00:02:42.970> shelf<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.660> it

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
that he kept up on the top shelf and it

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.199 
that he kept up on the top shelf and it
always<00:02:44.830> kind<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.280> broke<00:02:45.489> his<00:02:45.670> heart<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.030> he

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
always kind of broke his heart that he

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.729 
always kind of broke his heart that he
had<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.420> put<00:02:46.630> an<00:02:46.720> ice<00:02:46.870> cube<00:02:47.140> in<00:02:47.320> there<00:02:47.560> because

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
had to put an ice cube in there because

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.949 
had to put an ice cube in there because
it<00:02:48.100> would<00:02:48.489> always<00:02:48.760> melt<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.239> little<00:02:49.510> bit<00:02:49.690> and

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
it would always melt a little bit and

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.350 
it would always melt a little bit and
the<00:02:50.260> stone<00:02:50.590> he<00:02:51.550> would<00:02:51.700> have<00:02:51.820> loved<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.180> idea

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360
