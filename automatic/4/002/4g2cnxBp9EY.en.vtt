roller and it still didn't help but
eventually<00:00:40.540> by<00:00:41.290> putting<00:00:41.740> a<00:00:41.770> piece<00:00:41.950> of<00:00:42.070> card

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
eventually by putting a piece of card

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.120 
eventually by putting a piece of card
stock<00:00:42.370> in<00:00:42.790> a<00:00:43.450> little<00:00:43.900> piece<00:00:44.050> of<00:00:44.230> plastic<00:00:44.710> was

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
stock in a little piece of plastic was

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.340 
stock in a little piece of plastic was
dislodged<00:00:45.610> from<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.910> back<00:00:46.090> that<00:00:46.390> was<00:00:46.540> that
