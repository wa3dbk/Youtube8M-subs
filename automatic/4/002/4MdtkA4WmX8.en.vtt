some of the continued Bush policies I

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.630 
some of the continued Bush policies I
mean<00:03:54.220> some<00:03:55.090> of<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.300> things<00:03:55.330> I<00:03:56.430> was<00:03:57.430> you<00:03:57.580> know

socialism<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.060> that<00:04:04.150> drives<00:04:04.390> me<00:04:04.570> crazy<00:04:04.900> and<00:04:05.340> I

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
socialism and that drives me crazy and I

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.180 
socialism and that drives me crazy and I
