so I've noticed that there's a lot of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.870 
so I've noticed that there's a lot of
people<00:01:06.710> that<00:01:06.830> switch<00:01:07.100> players<00:01:07.460> that<00:01:07.700> switch

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
people that switch players that switch

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.910 
people that switch players that switch
from<00:01:08.060> mid<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.330> support<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:08.780> supports<00:01:09.110> amid<00:01:09.380> do

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
from mid to support and supports amid do

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.170 
from mid to support and supports amid do
you<00:01:10.009> think<00:01:10.190> that's<00:01:10.340> just<00:01:10.520> because<00:01:10.670> like<00:01:11.000> the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
you think that's just because like the

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.910 
you think that's just because like the
roles<00:01:11.420> are<00:01:11.690> similar<00:01:12.140> why<00:01:12.409> do<00:01:12.470> you<00:01:12.590> think<00:01:12.710> it<00:01:12.830> is

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
roles are similar why do you think it is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.590 
roles are similar why do you think it is
that<00:01:12.950> like<00:01:13.729> there's<00:01:13.940> a<00:01:14.030> lot<00:01:14.150> of<00:01:14.210> different

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
that like there's a lot of different

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.120 
that like there's a lot of different
players<00:01:14.810> that<00:01:15.080> go<00:01:15.229> mate<00:01:15.440> or<00:01:15.619> support<00:01:15.950> support

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
players that go mate or support support

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.310 
players that go mate or support support
man<00:01:16.460> yeah<00:01:16.970> i<00:01:17.000> think<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:17.509> roles<00:01:17.840> are<00:01:18.050> pretty

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
man yeah i think the roles are pretty

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.859 
man yeah i think the roles are pretty
similar<00:01:18.619> because<00:01:19.000> it's<00:01:20.000> just<00:01:20.030> about<00:01:20.330> using

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
similar because it's just about using

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.450 
similar because it's just about using
your<00:01:20.899> spell's<00:01:21.290> at<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.710> best<00:01:21.890> moments<00:01:22.310> and

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
your spell's at the best moments and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.770 
your spell's at the best moments and
stuff<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:22.790> it's<00:01:22.940> basically<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.330> same<00:01:23.509> role

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
stuff so it's basically the same role

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.289 
stuff so it's basically the same role
just<00:01:24.080> in<00:01:24.259> our<00:01:24.350> different<00:01:24.740> like<00:01:25.000> that<00:01:26.000> scale

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
just in our different like that scale

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.990 
just in our different like that scale
you<00:01:26.540> know<00:01:26.659> i<00:01:26.869> think<00:01:27.380> that's<00:01:27.680> why<00:01:27.830> i'm<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:28.759> tell

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
no idea i think it'll depend a lot the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.310 
no idea i think it'll depend a lot the
battlegroup<00:03:37.270> we<00:03:37.450> going<00:03:37.690> or<00:03:37.840> what<00:03:37.870> teams<00:03:38.200> are

battlegroup we going or what teams are

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.720 
battlegroup we going or what teams are
in<00:03:38.380> our<00:03:38.530> group<00:03:38.710> where<00:03:39.280> there<00:03:39.430> are<00:03:39.610> you

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
in our group where there are you

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.220 
in our group where there are you
concerned<00:03:40.270> about<00:03:40.360> any<00:03:40.630> region<00:03:41.020> in<00:03:41.080> particular

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
concerned about any region in particular

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.810 
concerned about any region in particular
like<00:03:41.710> korea<00:03:42.070> or<00:03:42.220> do<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.370> think<00:03:42.550> you're<00:03:42.670> as

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
like korea or do you think you're as

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.580 
like korea or do you think you're as
good<00:03:42.940> as<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.180> Korean<00:03:43.450> teams<00:03:43.660> I<00:03:43.960> think<00:03:44.350> the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
good as the Korean teams I think the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.170 
good as the Korean teams I think the
Koreans<00:03:44.920> team<00:03:45.100> will<00:03:45.250> be<00:03:45.340> very<00:03:45.490> dominant<00:03:45.700> I

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
Koreans team will be very dominant I

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.820 
Koreans team will be very dominant I
think<00:03:46.510> all<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.780> other<00:03:46.900> scenes<00:03:47.350> we<00:03:47.530> have<00:03:47.650> like

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
think all the other scenes we have like

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.230 
think all the other scenes we have like
a<00:03:47.860> chance<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.340> beating<00:03:48.490> or<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:48.820> do<00:03:48.910> chance

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
a chance of beating or I do chance

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.150 
a chance of beating or I do chance
beating<00:03:49.540> but<00:03:49.840> Korea<00:03:50.530> will<00:03:50.740> be<00:03:50.860> hard

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
beating but Korea will be hard

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.300 
beating but Korea will be hard
so<00:03:53.120> sort<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.870> kind<00:03:54.800> of<00:03:54.830> did<00:03:54.980> this<00:03:55.040> backwards

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
so sort of kind of did this backwards

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.800 
so sort of kind of did this backwards
but<00:03:55.640> I'd<00:03:55.730> love<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:56.000> talk<00:03:56.180> about<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.630> games

reach<00:04:20.390> our<00:04:20.630> backline<00:04:20.959> even<00:04:21.620> though<00:04:21.739> they<00:04:21.890> had

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
reach our backline even though they had

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.430 
reach our backline even though they had
a<00:04:22.040> full<00:04:22.430> go<00:04:22.550> income<00:04:22.880> so<00:04:23.180> they<00:04:23.960> could<00:04:24.110> not<00:04:24.230> go<00:04:24.410> on

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
a full go income so they could not go on

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.870 
a full go income so they could not go on
or<00:04:24.620> tanks<00:04:24.980> and<00:04:25.160> they<00:04:25.220> could<00:04:25.370> not<00:04:25.490> go<00:04:25.670> on<00:04:25.700> our

back line so we knew that the first game

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.850 
back line so we knew that the first game
was<00:04:27.980> once<00:04:28.550> we<00:04:28.670> go<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:28.910> team<00:04:29.030> fights<00:04:29.710> all<00:04:30.710> right
