00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
 ah 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:09.700
 let's talk about men and women but 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.880
 not vice versa or friendship between men 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.969
 and heterosexual women agree not 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.340
 gays or gays but the typical thing that 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:22.210
 they usually say that men and women 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.570
 Heteros can not be friends, it's good 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.250
 true but it is also false because everything 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.579
 in life it is true in some human being 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.430
 and it's false in another one just because and why 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:36.160
 not good because there are no people that neither 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.710
 she even manages to be friends with herself 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.690
 there are people who come to another with the 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.330
 excuse to eat I want to be your friend 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.630
 I want to be your friend to see if this opens 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.720
 the way to the heart in a way 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.850
 rather sentimental of that person what 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.670
 which is part of a tactic or 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.440
 a strategy well, I usually say 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.110
 that in love and war everything is 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.030
 valid I think that yes it is possible 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.170
 friendship between a man and a woman 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.060
 because not all souls are spoken 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.149
 between 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.820
 from a lit libido can be 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:15.720
 simply that you understand you can 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.700
 imagine a world where the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.369
 relationships between men and women 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.110
 they had to be always 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.850
 erotic-festive because the truth is that 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.299
 then almost we could not 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.289
 relate between us clear usually 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.110
 happen 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.289
 that two when they make friends if they are 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.659
 heterosexuals maybe it 's true that 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.030
 can that friendship lead to another 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.179
 kind of relationship with time but at 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.149
 better is simply an illusion or a 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.700
 hallucination because of emotional hunger 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.270
 because those two people when taking 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.259
 all right 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.569
 and not having a partner end up thinking and 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.179
 Self-congratulating themselves 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:00.539
 why not be a couple also then 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:03.240
 they have a kind of fraternal relationship 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.270
 but obviously as they are not brothers and 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.280
 if they are heterosexual men and women 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.280
 or it will end up convincing itself that it 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.630
 they have fallen in love and maybe they get married or they 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.970
 put to live together 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.970
 and after a while they discover that no 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.190
 that's how they were very good friends and in 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.160
 a friendship context went great 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.380
 but who gave them to complicate it by 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.990
 take the relationship to a field in the 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.880
 which was not I do not know that it was 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.940
 prepared the relationship is that actually 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.770
 there were no ingredients to make another 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.050
 type of relationship 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.660
 women can be friends with each other 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.450
 how can men be and can they be 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.210
 men and women there are times in 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.610
 that one of the two parties is still 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.280
 friend or considering the other as a 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.990
 Real friends as a friend with the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.600
 that you can share and others however 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.700
 the other part does not continue there but 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.000
 it also happens many times that there 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.830
 women who approach men because the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.960
 truth is that innocent and good 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.000
 heart willing to help a 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.000
 damsel in distress 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.300
 by way of let's be friends but 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.220
 then when I've told all my 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.900
 sorry how bad it has gone with the other 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.930
 churri that has left me or that I have 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.390
 left and then I take that the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.980
 pisuerga passes through valladolid is a 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.530
 way to say that he took advantage of the 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.880
 situation and then we become lovers 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.490
 novietes or churres and when I have already 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.150
 past the effect of aspirin then 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.580
 Well, I'm going to another one and I'll leave you because 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.520
 because I was not really in love 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.500
 of you simply and not even 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.500
 I was your friend because I'm taking a step 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.500
 was not your friend either 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.330
 you because he saw you face of good person 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.410
 he saw you were a man who could be 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.660
 trust and instead of paying for a therapist 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.400
 but that also made him a good 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.890
 therapy session and that the structure 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.770
 was and ordered that interior suitcase that 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.510
 It was totally disheveled and 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.330
 unstructured and all sleeve by shoulder 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.900
 because obviously many damsels 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.329
 loose headband 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.449
 that they become friends with a good boy 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.130
 good heart and then use it of churri and 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.979
 when they have used it as a friend 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.750
 confident pseudo therapist and churri 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.960
 they give the passport and the poor one stays 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.940
 saying and here that happened that's because 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.370
 there can be no friendship between 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.370
 men and women not that's because with 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.800
 that person in particular can not be 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.440
 friend because for two people to be 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.080
 friends both have to learn to 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.270
 trust each other and show that 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.720
 they are trustworthy and that really 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:53.130
 Friendship is what it is and not just any 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.130
 another thing that may seem
