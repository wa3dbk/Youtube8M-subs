00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 gentlemen good morning I 'm one with jazz 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.760
 consultant responsible for the rivera 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.830
 canines and not concentrating expert of 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.200
 I want to talk to you today 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.350
 alkaline water and water 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:22.170
 alkaline we look a little in the square 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:26.189
 of the harp are two water bikes 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.779
 perfectly alike but let's see what 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.150
 he understood what happens 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.399
 adding are centered 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.399
 and what happens with water and lemon 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:55.699
 we have about 7.98 as water phd 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.370
 all over Italy 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.789
 let's see with 5 drops of ph balance what 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.789
 It happens 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.440
 the pH of the water rises the factor which 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.390
 descends the water becomes more 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.050
 bioavailable because the factor 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.990
 penetrating more easily enters the 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.759
 ph factor salt the acidification and yes 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.729
 trigger many of those mechanisms that 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:37.229
 go to rebalance weak rains the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:39.330
 base has reached 11 and beyond we do it 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.210
 to stabilize we pass it from the water 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.320
 alkaline back to tap water 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.970
 the chosen ph is restored 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.970
 new to 78 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.310
 let's see what happens by adding del 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.970
 lemon gentlemen and I guarantee you of a 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.970
 many people 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.110
 very many people think of 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.399
 alkalizing after making a person 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.730
 healthy 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:14.370
 after doing an area that knows it was 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.400
 recommended, however, is racism 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.640
 that many people are studies and 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.100
 intestinal buster a little bit of 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.590
 gastritis a little bit of flea as you do 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.510
 at the end he hears to say yesterday lemon is bad 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.980
 because basically the lemon makes 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.060
 the water in the gila 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.060
 let's see what happens 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.540
 add some lemon 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.170
 gentlemen see see it no water has it 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.680
 has fallen below 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.930
 because differences alkaline water of the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.750
 means alkalizing water after 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.010
 to have been absorbed by the system 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.320
 immune 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.970
 unfortunately if we have problems 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.600
 gastrointestinal 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.280
 that ends with the introduction 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.440
 water and lemon then water 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.330
 apacity especially for nocturnal levels 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.600
 bicarbonate and the political cycle together 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.870
 the gastric juice is composed and maybe there 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.900
 it gives problems and we hear but the lemon 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.200
 and it hurts me or in people who maybe 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.930
 they have a little bit of running 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.060
 inflamed that the fiber makes the salad 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.489
 bad attention gentlemen 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.900
 let's see the reasons for the causes why 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.350
 the water remains of water 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.360
 alkalizing for healthy people 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.519
 if we go to attention disorders that 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:02.310
 we cannot tolerate ed only 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:04.459
 only good alkaline water 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.459
 day
