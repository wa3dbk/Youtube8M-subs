the<00:05:43.160> Virgo<00:05:43.640> smoker<00:05:44.210> you<00:05:44.630> know<00:05:44.780> fight<00:05:45.110> so<00:05:45.800> smoke

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
the Virgo smoker you know fight so smoke

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.610 
the Virgo smoker you know fight so smoke
dogs<00:05:46.370> getting<00:05:46.670> ready<00:05:46.820> late<00:05:47.000> to<00:05:47.210> Virgo<00:05:47.630> now<00:05:48.140> I

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
dogs getting ready late to Virgo now I

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.880 
dogs getting ready late to Virgo now I
think<00:05:49.130> smoking<00:05:49.730> can<00:05:50.060> beat<00:05:50.240> Virgo<00:05:50.690> now<00:05:51.350> the

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
think smoking can beat Virgo now the

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.790 
think smoking can beat Virgo now the
reason<00:05:52.160> why<00:05:52.430> I<00:05:52.460> think<00:05:52.850> Long<00:05:53.540> Beach<00:05:53.900> smoker<00:05:54.320> and

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
reason why I think Long Beach smoker and

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.140 
reason why I think Long Beach smoker and
because<00:05:55.100> he's<00:05:55.220> probably<00:05:55.490> they<00:05:55.820> didn't<00:05:56.060> know

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
because he's probably they didn't know

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.510 
because he's probably they didn't know
how<00:05:56.270> to<00:05:56.330> know<00:05:56.690> fighting<00:05:57.200> is<00:05:57.410> about<00:05:57.650> I'm<00:05:58.010> not

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
how to know fighting is about I'm not

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.520 
how to know fighting is about I'm not
saying<00:05:58.790> that<00:05:58.850> I<00:05:58.970> think<00:05:59.000> smokers<00:05:59.720> better<00:06:00.110> is

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
saying that I think smokers better is

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.500 
saying that I think smokers better is
stronger<00:06:01.100> than<00:06:01.160> long<00:06:01.400> I<00:06:01.700> think<00:06:02.180> smoking<00:06:02.330> the

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
stronger than long I think smoking the

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.420 
stronger than long I think smoking the
stronger<00:06:02.840> fighter<00:06:03.050> the<00:06:03.290> law<00:06:03.500> but<00:06:04.190> law

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
stronger fighter the law but law

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.190 
stronger fighter the law but law
combined<00:06:04.820> with<00:06:05.030> his<00:06:05.120> college<00:06:05.510> with<00:06:05.660> just<00:06:05.840> too

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
combined with his college with just too

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.860 
combined with his college with just too
overwhelming<00:06:06.530> for<00:06:06.920> smokers<00:06:07.250> so<00:06:07.880> Obama<00:06:08.180> say

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
overwhelming for smokers so Obama say

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.780 
overwhelming for smokers so Obama say
laws<00:06:09.110> better<00:06:09.470> than<00:06:09.680> smoking<00:06:09.920> but<00:06:10.520> only

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
laws better than smoking but only

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.090 
laws better than smoking but only
because<00:06:10.940> he<00:06:11.150> said<00:06:11.540> he<00:06:11.570> uses<00:06:11.870> powers<00:06:12.260> witty<00:06:12.500> so

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
because he said he uses powers witty so

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.850 
because he said he uses powers witty so
I<00:06:13.580> think<00:06:14.450> he's<00:06:14.780> gonna<00:06:14.960> tear<00:06:15.230> through<00:06:15.470> Virgo
