is<00:00:08.099> getting<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:09.210> programs<00:00:09.690> on<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.200> phone<00:00:10.410> how

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
is getting the programs on the phone how

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.820 
is getting the programs on the phone how
to<00:00:10.860> actually<00:00:11.099> do<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:13.320> know<00:00:13.349> the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
to actually do it and so you know the

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.220 
to actually do it and so you know the
old<00:00:14.000> there's<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.120> whole<00:00:15.330> way<00:00:15.570> different<00:00:16.139> way

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
old there's this whole way different way

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.320 
old there's this whole way different way
that<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.920> air<00:00:17.070> it's<00:00:17.550> it's<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.150> mess

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
that on the air it's it's just a mess

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.230 
that on the air it's it's just a mess
the<00:00:19.260> easiest<00:00:19.529> way<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.710> found<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.820> actually

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the easiest way I found is to actually

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.849 
the easiest way I found is to actually
just<00:00:21.570> use<00:00:21.630> bluetooth<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:24.619> from<00:00:25.619> mobile

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
just use bluetooth so in from mobile

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.439 
just use bluetooth so in from mobile
processing<00:00:26.960> go<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.699> do<00:00:29.699> export

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.050 
you coming to where I put it which is in
here<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:09.170> then<00:02:10.170> run<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.860> which<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.819> tell

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
here and then run it which you can tell

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.970 
here and then run it which you can tell
says<00:02:12.660> Reuben<00:02:12.930> control<00:02:13.340> say<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.400> run<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.730> and

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
says Reuben control say you run it and

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.140 
says Reuben control say you run it and
the<00:02:16.980> way<00:02:17.069> i<00:02:17.100> have<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.340> set<00:02:17.370> up<00:02:17.520> right<00:02:17.730> now<00:02:17.880> is

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
the way i have it set up right now is

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.740 
the way i have it set up right now is
that<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.540> will<00:02:18.630> search<00:02:18.959> for<00:02:19.700> different<00:02:20.750> serial

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
that it will search for different serial

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.400 
that it will search for different serial
for<00:02:22.200> devices<00:02:22.709> on<00:02:22.860> bluetooth<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:24.260> went<00:02:25.260> and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
for devices on bluetooth and went and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.780 
for devices on bluetooth and went and
what's<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.890> fine<00:02:26.040> ones<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.340> will<00:02:26.459> connect

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
what's the fine ones that will connect

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.290 
what's the fine ones that will connect
so<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.750> initiates<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.230> search<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.790> there's

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
so this initiates the search and there's

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.260 
so this initiates the search and there's
the<00:02:30.450> guy<00:02:30.540> right<00:02:30.660> now<00:02:31.100> it's<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:33.060> plugged

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
the guy right now it's a it's plugged

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.460 
the guy right now it's a it's plugged
and<00:02:33.390> turned<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:33.840> should<00:02:33.870> work<00:02:34.170> i'll

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
and turned on and so should work i'll

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.140 
and turned on and so should work i'll
look<00:02:34.620> at<00:02:34.739> found<00:02:34.920> one<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.790> that's<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.000> mac

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
look at found one so that's the mac

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.300 
look at found one so that's the mac
address<00:02:36.470> or<00:02:37.470> whatever<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.040> bluetooth

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
address or whatever the bluetooth

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.400 
address or whatever the bluetooth
equivalent<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.989> should<00:02:40.230> update

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
equivalent of that is it should update

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.220 
equivalent of that is it should update
that<00:02:40.680> with<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> name<00:02:41.720> sometimes<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.840> doesn't<00:02:43.140> as

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
that with a name sometimes it doesn't as

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.970 
that with a name sometimes it doesn't as
it<00:02:43.350> doesn't<00:02:44.060> ok<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.480> didn't<00:02:45.690> ah<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.800> here's

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
it doesn't ok so it didn't ah so here's

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.770 
it doesn't ok so it didn't ah so here's
all<00:02:47.160> different<00:02:47.489> serial<00:02:47.730> ports<00:02:48.060> or<00:02:48.330> bluetooth

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
all different serial ports or bluetooth

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.900 
all different serial ports or bluetooth
serial<00:02:49.019> ports<00:02:49.230> found<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:50.280> case<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.730> found

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
serial ports found in this case it found

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.400

roomba and now you can drive a lot
normal

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.330 

that's<00:03:23.720> how<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.900> get<00:03:24.080> a<00:03:24.350> j2me<00:03:25.150> that<00:03:26.319> j2me

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
that's how to get a j2me that j2me

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.400 
that's how to get a j2me that j2me

application from a mac to a phone and
then<00:03:30.650> actually<00:03:30.920> run<00:03:31.069> it<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.370> do<00:03:31.459> something

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
then actually run it and do something

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
then actually run it and do something
