00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello to all so we find ourselves for 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.080
 their route on your phone 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.719
 so what is that road you 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.109
 have in the description of the video a 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.520
 link on a video where I explain 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.080
 in fact very simply what is it 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.090
 that road and what's the use for 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.560
 those who do not know yet you're going 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.769
 you watch this video and then 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.380
 you go back here so so for the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.240
 others follow and each of the steps to 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.590
 the letter very very precisely does 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.870
 was not going another moment of the video 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.360
 you brawl that would have missed a step 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.920
 essential so follow all the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.950
 video and each step 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.600
 so we will start first 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.690
 you possibly have in your 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.399
 system settings a feature 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.500
 as you see here on the screen so 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.239
 reactivation lock before 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.910
 start you have to check that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.760
 this one is not activated is not 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.460
 ticked so you uncheck this one 6 is 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.120
 currently cochet and then we can 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.909
 so go to the tutorial so it's gone 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.280
 then there are three files to 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.740
 download the number one in the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.760
 description of the video that are the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.040
 samsung drivers so for your 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.650
 computer recognize your phone 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.930
 from the moment you connect it to that 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.299
 so here you download this file 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.979
 number one in the description then 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.340
 number two in the description of the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.220
 video 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.110
 this is the audine software this is the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.259
 software that will allow us to route 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.759
 and the phone is finally the number 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.100
 three in the description 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.890
 then there will be several files 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.720
 you will choose the file that 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.270
 corresponds to your phone 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.920
 so how do you know you 're going about 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.040
 the phone in your system settings 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.380
 and you look at the model number its 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.950
 written so this model number the code 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.110
 if I can say of your mobile and you 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.530
 so look in the description of the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.380
 video 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.270
 the file corresponding to your model 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.079
 and you download it so if there is 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.610
 not your model 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.740
 that is, it is not compatible 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.209
 so download nothing is new 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.929
 and nothing unfortunately you can not 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.060
 performed this tutorial 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.459
 so you have to check that you 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.590
 take the right file is essential 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.670
 otherwise it may create problems 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.790
 on your phone 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.939
 So now it's gone 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.430
 you will first reach your 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.170
 phone so you turn off totally 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.819
 your phone and you let him from 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.780
 side 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.469
 now we find ourselves on 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.510
 computer 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.739
 you have been searching for them all three 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.609
 files that I told you of 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.459
 samsung dredgers 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.930
 the audine software and the file 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.700
 corresponding to your model is 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.319
 possibly not the same name that quotes 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.810
 since you have possible models 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.569
 different for double click so on 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.379
 the samsung drivers we will install them 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.000
 on the computer 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.549
 so as I told you this is going 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.739
 allow your computer to 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.030
 recognize your phone as you 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.879
 plug in there then you go all 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.900
 steps you click install and 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.870
 now you wait 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.639
 once the installation is complete 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.799
 you will restart your computer 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.459
 this is essential you restart your 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.500
 computer 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.329
 once you have restart your 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.159
 computer is well we find ourselves here 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.440
 so I do not do it obviously we get 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.840
 found again on the desk you 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.959
 click on audine you double click and 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.129
 you will actually extract the content 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.329
 the document with any of 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.819
 any extraction software 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.409
 sorry it gives you that I'm I 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.310
 automatically put on the desktop so 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:38.319
 I keep it here to be sure it's 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.790
 easier more organized you do 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.199
 exactly the same with the file 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.259
 corresponding to your phone you 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:46.359
 extract the contents of the folder 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:48.370
 I also read on the desktop here 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.590
 so there you keep and that's all 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.370
 what you need for the installation so 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.290
 the source of this folder here you 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.290
 use only cf highway all the 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.150
 rest we're not going to use it here and 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.549
 now you open audition the 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.970
 audine folder you right click on the 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.139
 software and you put run as 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.239
 that admin now that you 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.739
 launches software that we will use 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.659
 to set up their route 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.030
 so you check that all the boxes 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.070
 cochet that is not itself a 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.500
 more it's essential now that 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.020

 will give you the left screen that 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.690
 you see here and then you go 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.040
 press volume at high volume and that 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.270
 gives you the right screen we are in 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.060
 mode gives the other now you 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.670
 touch nothing you will find yourself 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.250
 on the computer and now you 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.840
 will actually connect your phone to 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.090
 the computer and once it's done 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.610
 you will see a blue card as he

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.010
 to dead 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.300
 it just means that your 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.320
 computer has recognized the phone well 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.210
 so that means you're ready 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.040

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.780
 now that it's done you're going 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.060
 so we will use the file 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.180
 corresponding to your phone you 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.830
 go to pda in the software 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.380
 by clicking on pda you are looking for this 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.450

 doubleclick and that will open the file 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.410
 so on the software 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.930
 it'll show you in this box that 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.690
 everything is good once it's done 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.370
 will be able to move to the facility while 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.110
 simply by clicking start you 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.760
 click on start and you will see the 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.310
 break in the top left that will fill 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.730
 nicely as you see here so 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.280
 in glass and in the end it's going to show a 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.110
 green screen pass like this is it 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.870
 means it's all good now 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.580
 your phone is supposed to restart in 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.520
 mode recovery is installed 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.350
 automatically their road is in celebration 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.130
 then it will start the phone and 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.340
 there you have the road 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.110
 if eventually it does not restart that does not 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.150
 not restart in recovery and that it 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.270
 do not install their route 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.780
 well you redo the whole procedure 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:14.510
 once if the problem persists process 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.460
 follows you want to go 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.840
 ensure that in audine so in the 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.410
 software you redo so the same 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.860
 procedure 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.300
 but here you uncheck the autolib box 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.910
 August 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.940
 so that will disable the reboot 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.340
 automatic and then to you after 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.400
 have clicked on start and so this is the 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.660
 breaks poster goes in glass as I 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.340
 told you just now 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.980
 you remove the battery from your 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.080
 phone then give you the 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.350
 battery in the phone and you 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.300
 restart with the power buttons 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.990
 volume up and the center button the 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.510
 home button 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.700
 the three buttons both support you 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.190
 it's going to throw in festive week-end at the berry and 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.230
 that's going to automatically start 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.980
 installation process as if in 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.690
 did the software had automatically 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.820
 restart in recovery mode and once 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.740
 once that's done it's going to restart the 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.580
 system and you're going to have their route 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.980
 done 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.720
 so to check that once your 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.700
 phone to restart you can 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.170
 download the route shaker app 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.550

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.160
 the video to verify that your 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.410
 phone and well road and that's it 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.430
 all this was very simple I hope 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.560
 that it will work for you 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.060
