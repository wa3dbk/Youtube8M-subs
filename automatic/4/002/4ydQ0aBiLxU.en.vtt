00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
synth line there yeah so that was the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.309 
synth line there yeah so that was the
first<00:02:45.450> thing<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.720> then<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:45.930> was<00:02:46.049> like<00:02:46.140> all

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
first thing and then I was like all

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.949 
first thing and then I was like all
right<00:02:46.349> let's<00:02:46.590> get<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.890> beat<00:02:47.670> poppin<00:02:48.180> at<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
right let's get the beat poppin at the

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.830 
right let's get the beat poppin at the
time<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.170> didn't<00:02:49.620> have<00:02:49.799> access<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:51.000> turntable

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
time I didn't have access to a turntable

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.870 
time I didn't have access to a turntable
but<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.410> had<00:02:52.560> recorded<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:53.220> bunch<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.610> scratch

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
but I had recorded a bunch of scratch

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.960 
but I had recorded a bunch of scratch
noises<00:02:54.390> previously<00:02:55.019> so<00:02:55.349> I<00:02:55.650> basically<00:02:56.220> created

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
noises previously so I basically created

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.640 
noises previously so I basically created
like<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.269> fake<00:02:57.630> turntable<00:02:59.569> this<00:03:00.569> is<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.079> nn-xt

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
like a fake turntable this is the nn-xt

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.789 
like a fake turntable this is the nn-xt
here<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.760> less<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.209> like<00:03:03.269> actual<00:03:04.170> like<00:03:04.769> a

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
here it's less of like actual like a

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.830 
here it's less of like actual like a
virtual<00:03:05.069> turntable<00:03:05.730> it's<00:03:05.819> more<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.180> now<00:03:06.690> I'm

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
virtual turntable it's more like now I'm

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.620 
virtual turntable it's more like now I'm
using<00:03:07.049> scratch<00:03:07.680> sounds<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.280> make<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:09.000> comprise

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
using scratch sounds to make to comprise

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.920 
using scratch sounds to make to comprise
part<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.110> beat<00:03:10.319> you<00:03:10.470> know<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.799> let's<00:03:10.950> see

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.920 

and<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:17.069> basically<00:03:17.280> took<00:03:18.060> took<00:03:18.540> some<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.840> those

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
and I basically took took some of those

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.050 
and I basically took took some of those
scratch<00:03:19.230> sounds<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:20.069> kind<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.760> like<00:03:20.880> made

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
scratch sounds and kind of like made

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.530 
scratch sounds and kind of like made
like<00:03:21.269> a<00:03:21.299> little<00:03:21.540> loop

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.840 

so<00:03:29.540> I'm<00:03:29.630> sending<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:30.260> snare<00:03:30.800> drum<00:03:30.830> through<00:03:31.610> this

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
so I'm sending a snare drum through this

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.210 
so I'm sending a snare drum through this
delay<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:32.720> what<00:03:33.080> I've<00:03:33.230> done<00:03:33.380> this<00:03:33.530> automated

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
delay and what I've done this automated

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.850 
delay and what I've done this automated
the<00:03:34.340> feedback<00:03:34.819> as<00:03:35.120> well<00:03:36.020> as<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.260> delay<00:03:36.590> time

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
the feedback as well as the delay time

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.490 
the feedback as well as the delay time
and<00:03:37.069> basically<00:03:37.970> it's<00:03:38.630> giving<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.140> like<00:03:39.319> this

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
and basically it's giving you like this

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:49.420 
and basically it's giving you like this
crazy<00:03:39.890> feedback<00:03:40.520> II<00:03:40.790> feel<00:03:46.959> in<00:03:47.959> my<00:03:48.290> mind<00:03:48.770> it<00:03:49.340> was

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
crazy feedback II feel in my mind it was

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.000 
crazy feedback II feel in my mind it was
almost<00:03:49.850> using<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.480> delay<00:03:51.260> that's<00:03:51.830> like<00:03:51.980> a

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
almost using the delay that's like a

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.650 
almost using the delay that's like a
filter<00:03:52.489> or<00:03:52.640> something<00:03:57.459> like<00:03:58.459> filters<00:03:59.120> your

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
filter or something like filters your

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.400 
filter or something like filters your
your<00:04:00.680> in<00:04:00.830> a<00:04:00.860> way<00:04:01.100> oh<00:04:01.900> but<00:04:02.900> it's<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.110> delay

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
your in a way oh but it's a delay

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.320 
your in a way oh but it's a delay
you<00:04:03.650> know<00:04:03.769> I<00:04:03.800> mean<00:04:04.040> in<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:04.700> that's<00:04:05.000> when<00:04:05.300> I

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
you know I mean in that that's when I

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.720 
you know I mean in that that's when I
realized<00:04:05.840> that<00:04:05.930> I<00:04:06.019> could<00:04:06.260> automate<00:04:06.730> every

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
realized that I could automate every

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.870 
realized that I could automate every
feature<00:04:08.030> in<00:04:08.300> a<00:04:08.390> delay<00:04:08.720> like<00:04:09.709> I<00:04:09.980> was<00:04:10.430> like<00:04:10.610> whoa

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
feature in a delay like I was like whoa

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.850 
feature in a delay like I was like whoa
man<00:04:11.180> this<00:04:11.390> is<00:04:11.540> gonna<00:04:11.690> be<00:04:11.780> bananas<00:04:12.050> you<00:04:12.620> know<00:04:12.709> we

man this is gonna be bananas you know we
can<00:04:13.010> jump<00:04:13.220> over<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.580> this<00:04:13.700> other<00:04:13.850> beat<00:04:14.180> where<00:04:14.360> I

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
can jump over to this other beat where I

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.240 
can jump over to this other beat where I
have<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.630> bunch<00:04:14.840> of<00:04:14.989> 808s<00:04:15.380> that<00:04:15.590> I've<00:04:15.709> really

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250
