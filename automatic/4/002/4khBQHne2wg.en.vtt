00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
an accord sport with leather so it looks

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.430 
an accord sport with leather so it looks
very<00:00:46.950> very<00:00:47.930> stock<00:00:49.129> looks<00:00:50.129> standard<00:00:51.289> but<00:00:52.289> it's

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
very very stock looks standard but it's

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.000 
very very stock looks standard but it's
actually<00:00:52.890> something<00:00:54.320> we<00:00:55.320> as<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> dealership

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
had done to this vehicle so that's what

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.139 
had done to this vehicle so that's what
it<00:00:58.289> looks<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.620> with<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.949> leather<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.550> really

right there still have the perforated
little<00:01:04.979> leather<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.500> designed

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
little leather and it's really designed

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.520 
little leather and it's really designed
after<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.340> EXL<00:01:08.880> model<00:01:08.990> you<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.350> that

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
after the EXL model you do have that

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.039 
after the EXL model you do have that
double<00:01:11.010> stitched<00:01:11.369> leather<00:01:12.590> going<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.860> and

double stitched leather going on and

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.810 
double stitched leather going on and
matches<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.380> armrest<00:01:16.920> which<00:01:17.189> comes<00:01:17.580> from<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
matches the armrest which comes from the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.789 
matches the armrest which comes from the
factory<00:01:18.680> already<00:01:19.680> leather<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.439> looks<00:01:22.439> very

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
factory already leather so looks very

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.070 
factory already leather so looks very
very<00:01:23.220> similar<00:01:23.610> looks<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.210> definitely

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
very similar looks like it definitely

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.859 
very similar looks like it definitely
flows<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> car<00:01:26.130> itself<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> again<00:01:30.780> this

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
flows with the car itself so again this

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.830 
flows with the car itself so again this
is<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> 2014<00:01:31.710> Honda<00:01:32.250> Accord<00:01:32.490> sport

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
with a leather which is not an option

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.510 
with a leather which is not an option
from<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> factory<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:40.770> definitely<00:01:41.100> looks

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
from the factory but it definitely looks

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.400 
from the factory but it definitely looks
good<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.360> leather

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.510 

often<00:01:48.410> times<00:01:48.590> another<00:01:48.890> question<00:01:49.280> that<00:01:49.400> comes

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
often times another question that comes

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.220 
often times another question that comes
up<00:01:49.760> is<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:50.060> at<00:01:50.300> what<00:01:50.480> point<00:01:50.750> do<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.050> actually

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
up is like at what point do you actually

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.710 
up is like at what point do you actually
just<00:01:51.530> go<00:01:51.680> for<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.920> EXL<00:01:52.400> and<00:01:52.670> then<00:01:52.760> add<00:01:53.090> the

just go for the EXL and then add the
wheels<00:01:53.930> this<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:54.980> definitely<00:01:55.250> still<00:01:55.670> a

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
wheels this is definitely still a

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.860 
wheels this is definitely still a
cost-effective<00:01:56.900> option<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:59.570> only<00:01:59.600> thing

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
cost-effective option the only thing

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.080 
cost-effective option the only thing
that<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.080> won't<00:02:00.260> get<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.830> that<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.340> EXL<00:02:01.820> does

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
that you won't get the that the EXL does

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.710 
that you won't get the that the EXL does
have<00:02:02.360> would<00:02:02.720> be<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.140> heated<00:02:03.590> seats<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:05.420> again

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
have would be the heated seats so again
