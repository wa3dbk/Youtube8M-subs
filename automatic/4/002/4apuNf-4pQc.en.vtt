00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.059
 Hello, everyone was Welcome what secret societies Pandoraio 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:12.289
 I think you We are pleased to introduce trying's hope ask you about the secret that we have raised examined to you 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:17.630
 The secret is to introduce some of the city legends of monster hunters 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:20.130
 Monster Hunter It is a popular climax game for which the latest work is out now 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.359
 I want to introduce it because there is a city legend 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:29.309
 I think a game called monster hunter is a battle between hunters and monsters 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:33.720
 Furthermore, we established a further strong equipment using material can take into its monster 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:37.409
 It is a game that challenges a strong monster To make a strong weapon or armor 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.120
 I'm fighting with monsters to get the material, but this time 

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:44.170
 The probability of getting the material is completely random 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:48.460
 In other words, there are materials that are extremely easy to obtain 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.440
 It is that there is also existence and it is hard to see the material which is hard to come out, and the criminals are also today 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.269
 I'm fighting with monsters 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.470
 However, there is the previous clause that the probability is lowered even though it is hard to be perfect . 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.110
 More than anything 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:04.760
 Object desire sensor Object desire sensor is a home game console or 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:09.440
 In the online game, the player surely detects the opponent who wants this and 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:13.970
 It is a devilish system that lowers the appearance rate of items 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.620
 In other words, players need to be aware that the game is not understood 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.630
 Such of you might 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:25.100
 For example, suppose you want a weapon game side and the pages of the weapon see again and again is 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:31.400
 Oh this guy is on if I want this weapon this material'll keep prepared not out easily 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:33.140
 It is probably the first enemy desire sensor that you may try, but the urban legend that overcomes it 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.610
 Also there are some because 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.240
 The tail is broken when attacking the monster many times 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.720
 It is possible to peel off from there, but this type of radar seven treasures 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:48.390
 There is an urban legend that rare items are easy to come out if you peel it off immediately 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:52.950
 For example, if you cut the tail of Reus, it seems like it is easy to get past 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.350
 In the same way, if you tear it off with the tip of the old tail, rare items such as this song will appear on the outside. 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.640
 There is also a city ​​legend that it is easy 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.720
 Furthermore there is thing called player guild card This guild card is oneself 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.740
 It is said that you can understand how many monsters you have defeated in the survey 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.850
 It is a card 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:14.550
 This card has something to say about yourself. Write your own favorite sentences. 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.340
 Is it possible to write out the material you want at this time ? 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.970
 Explained by the lyrics 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:24.069
 There may be other things like monsters coming and going 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:27.290
 When it rains in the real world, there are many editorials that are easy to eat, even though you can meet them 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:32.140
 The overkill of the game you must be careful 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.140
 I would like to see you again
