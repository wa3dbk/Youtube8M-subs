tender feelings like painful burning

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.660 
tender feelings like painful burning
feelings<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.399> sides<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:21.750> tongue<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.670> I

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
feelings on the sides of my tongue and I

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.080 
feelings on the sides of my tongue and I
think<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.569> might<00:01:24.690> be<00:01:24.750> nerve<00:01:25.140> damage<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:26.090> Peter

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
think it might be nerve damage but Peter

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.150 
think it might be nerve damage but Peter
told<00:01:27.539> me<00:01:27.660> that<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.080> could<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.649> swelling

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
told me that it could be the swelling

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.240 
told me that it could be the swelling
pushing<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:29.910> a<00:01:29.940> nerve<00:01:30.300> and<00:01:30.800> that<00:01:31.800> when<00:01:32.069> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
pushing on a nerve and that when the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.160 
pushing on a nerve and that when the
swelling<00:01:32.489> goes<00:01:32.640> away<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.599> pain<00:01:33.810> will<00:01:33.989> go<00:01:34.020> away

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
swelling goes away the pain will go away

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.850 
swelling goes away the pain will go away
but<00:01:34.910> it<00:01:35.910> seems<00:01:36.300> to<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.539> getting<00:01:36.840> worse<00:01:37.050> as<00:01:37.440> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
but it seems to be getting worse as the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.240 
but it seems to be getting worse as the
days<00:01:38.069> go<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:40.020> I'm<00:01:40.410> probably<00:01:40.739> going<00:01:41.039> to<00:01:41.130> go

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
