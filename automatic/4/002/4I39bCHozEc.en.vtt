00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.690
 the initiatives of the skaters must be 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.910
 always supported when you're 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.700
 give feedback to more skaters and 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.460
 generate something productive for the country 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.380
 because you can not say I would support 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.470
 someone who is going to benefit himself 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.990
 same 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.820
 it is assumed that if it is 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.529
 they are supporting is for something to exist 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.170
 help people who know the needs 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.840
 of a writer that is I think it's the 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.660
 main solution that we have for the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.080
 moment but if we ourselves do not 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.140
 we support those who know about our 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.500
 nobody's going to do it 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.750
 sorry I included myself in that and 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.190
 I feel it is that we say is that to me 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.860
 like to support the brands that I 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.170
 hospicio because like that those marks that we 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.400
 they ask me to support me much more and they give me 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.489
 better things and then I think that 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.790
 we should think a little about what it is and 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.190
 is that I support such a brand maybe such 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.340
 Mark someday you could support me 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.650
 be put in that place that if it is that 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.869
 do something good in supporting these 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.450
 brands that maybe someday they will 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.130
 they reward you who are the ones 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.090
 they do is that they are the ones who love to be the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.729
 skate 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.590
 and who are involved in this if you 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.299
 you go and give the money to someone who swims 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.950
 it has to do with us who knows 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.729
 where the money ends and they will not do 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.100
 absolutely nothing but if you go and spend 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.860
 your money in a place where it really 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.310
 worry about the scene of the equator 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.380
 That is going to be paid in perhaps a 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.420
 good hospice for you and your friend or 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.259
 someone in your city 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.900
 there will be fun funny events every 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.630
 week every month who knows and well no longer 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.880
 we are going to be stuck or stuck and 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.490
 well let's go the scene is going to bloom it's going to 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.979
 grow and the conditions are going to be 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.320
 best for all of us the six 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.989
 brands that do not support just want a 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.500
 money and so skiing is not going to progress 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.500
 never
