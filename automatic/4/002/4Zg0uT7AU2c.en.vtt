follow the link or whatever to get to
and<00:00:13.170> watch<00:00:13.349> but<00:00:13.820> basically<00:00:14.820> we're<00:00:15.089> just

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
and watch but basically we're just

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.540 
and watch but basically we're just
replaced<00:00:15.540> all<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.780> servos<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.250> out<00:00:17.369> here

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
replaced all the servos have it out here

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.730 
replaced all the servos have it out here
again<00:00:17.670> today<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> try<00:00:18.690> flying<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.410> this

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
again today to try flying it and this

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.200 
again today to try flying it and this
time<00:00:19.800> we've<00:00:20.160> got<00:00:20.189> all<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.640> different<00:00:20.789> flight

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
time we've got all the different flight

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.300 
time we've got all the different flight
functionality<00:00:21.930> enabled<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.529> I've<00:00:22.650> got<00:00:28.310> sorry

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
functionality enabled so I've got sorry

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.070 
functionality enabled so I've got sorry
thermal<00:00:29.670> mode<00:00:29.849> with<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.359> mixing<00:00:30.720> between<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
thermal mode with the mixing between the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.740 
thermal mode with the mixing between the
flapper<00:00:31.470> ons<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.489> elevator<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.570> a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
flapper ons and the elevator and just a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.389 
flapper ons and the elevator and just a
regular<00:00:34.079> cruise<00:00:34.380> mode<00:00:34.620> that's<00:00:34.829> basically<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
regular cruise mode that's basically a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.250 
regular cruise mode that's basically a
normal<00:00:35.610> plane<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.329> we're<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.690> try<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
normal plane so we're going to try a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.170 
normal plane so we're going to try a
couple<00:00:37.829> more<00:00:37.950> times<00:00:38.219> couple<00:00:38.820> more<00:00:38.910> flights

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
couple more times couple more flights

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.040 
couple more times couple more flights
today<00:00:40.760> make<00:00:41.760> sure<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.940> replace<00:00:42.300> those<00:00:42.570> servos

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
today make sure you replace those servos

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.750 
today make sure you replace those servos
and<00:00:43.079> don't<00:00:43.410> fly<00:00:43.649> with<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.950> factory<00:00:44.340> ones<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and don't fly with the factory ones I

00:00:44.760 --> 00:01:08.600 
and don't fly with the factory ones I
think<00:00:45.000> you'll<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.239> ok

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.800 

that<00:01:09.610> might<00:01:09.790> have<00:01:09.910> been<00:01:10.000> my<00:01:10.150> programming<00:01:15.810> okay

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
that might have been my programming okay

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
that might have been my programming okay
I<00:01:16.840> think<00:01:17.110> I<00:01:17.140> have<00:01:17.230> something<00:01:17.410> wrong<00:01:17.650> with<00:01:17.770> the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
I think I have something wrong with the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.200 
I think I have something wrong with the
thermal<00:01:18.190> vote<00:01:18.340> programming<00:01:18.970> because<00:01:19.150> it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
thermal vote programming because it

00:01:19.210 --> 00:02:00.039 
thermal vote programming because it
didn't<00:01:19.450> like<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:19.780> okay

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.619
