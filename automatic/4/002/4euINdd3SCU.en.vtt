certain organisms I've recently
discovered<00:01:08.820> its<00:01:09.240> location<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:10.560> labyrinth

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
discovered its location this labyrinth

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.980 
discovered its location this labyrinth
the<00:01:11.729> organism<00:01:12.119> lives<00:01:12.330> somewhere<00:01:12.600> within<00:01:12.780> this

very library if one could destroy it the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.539 
very library if one could destroy it the
sound<00:01:15.540> would<00:01:15.689> cease<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:15.990> function<00:01:16.340> mm-hmm

the booster version 0.8 it's not in
version<00:01:27.719> 2.0<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.340> square<00:01:29.490> an<00:01:29.759> earlier

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
version 2.0 so this is square an earlier

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.359 
version 2.0 so this is square an earlier
development<00:01:30.710> this<00:01:31.710> little<00:01:31.950> machine<00:01:32.069> will

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369

item screen to equip it computer and

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.639 
item screen to equip it computer and
then<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.539> was<00:01:39.659> sent<00:01:39.869> flying<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.259> thought<00:01:40.469> it<00:01:40.560> was

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
then I was sent flying I thought it was

causes him to die video game logic
anyway<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.350> booth<00:02:02.530> for<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.860> booster<00:02:03.220> version

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
anyway the booth for the booster version

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.960 
anyway the booth for the booster version
0.8<00:02:04.570> is<00:02:04.780> clearly<00:02:05.700> yeah

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
0.8 is clearly yeah

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.419 
0.8 is clearly yeah
it's<00:02:07.540> not<00:02:07.750> as<00:02:07.869> complete<00:02:08.080> as<00:02:08.259> 2.0<00:02:08.740> so<00:02:09.039> you<00:02:09.130> can't

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
it's not as complete as 2.0 so you can't

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.770 
it's not as complete as 2.0 so you can't
fly<00:02:09.610> in<00:02:09.670> all<00:02:09.789> directions<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:10.300> can<00:02:10.420> only<00:02:10.539> hover

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
fly in all directions you can only hover

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.960 
fly in all directions you can only hover
a<00:02:10.899> little<00:02:11.110> bit<00:02:11.200> more<00:02:11.380> up<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:12.520> hover<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:12.880> an

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
a little bit more up the hover is an

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.240 
a little bit more up the hover is an
inch<00:02:13.090> isn't<00:02:13.510> as<00:02:13.600> fast<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.380> can't<00:02:14.620> fly<00:02:15.220> for

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
inch isn't as fast and you can't fly for

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.360 
inch isn't as fast and you can't fly for
as<00:02:15.520> long<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.440> clearly<00:02:17.739> it's<00:02:17.950> better<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.250> wait

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
as long so clearly it's better to wait

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.820 
as long so clearly it's better to wait
