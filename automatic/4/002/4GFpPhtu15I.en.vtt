00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.490
 In this carving of jÃ­cara I'm going to 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:09.280
 show what I'm doing this is it 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.730
 knows with the counted name and is 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.040
 cut because if this piece takes five 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.620
 petals on this side should also 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.320
 bring five petals and all must 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:24.040
 have a similarity so you can have 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.140
 a square here I told you 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.360
 always the work of the next to me 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.940
 face is one hundred percent love my 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.670
 tool is a knife and my material 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.670
 I'm going to show you how this is done 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.290
 3 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.040
 4 and 5 here are the five petals of 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:59.640
 what I told them for that is counted 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.890
 because you have to go counting the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.450
 pieces that are going to come out and have to 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.380
 exit this side equal five petals 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.369
 let's finish the clock 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.799
 so they can realize how this 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.659
 is already grasping its shape 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.520
 Y 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.329
 since I was a child 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.329
 and the similarity 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.510
 grab the shapes 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.590
 I'm going to put the 5 petals that I put 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.140
 on this side you have to stay 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:41.640
 from this side 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:45.050
 we have 1 2 3 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.050
 4 and 5 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:59.500
 here we see it almost finished because 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.220
 we need to take what serves us 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 what do we do 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.500
 let's make the most latent figure 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.720
 and we're going to take this thing that does not work 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.160
 and so 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.060
 they will be able to realize 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.060
 in our figure 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.629
 begins to grasp and shape 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.310
 so it has to be staying 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.770
 all 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:48.340
 and here 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.340
 and it is doing in the same way 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.870
 I show this figure with the others and 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:03.489
 all have a similarity are counted 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.910
 because they are 4 1 2 3 and 4 and I do the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.840
 separations 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.840
 the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.180
 the part that does not weekends 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.210
 and we are going to do 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.069
 in our figure 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:25.939
 be more latent 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:28.410
 can appreciate the separation that there is is 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:31.260
 figure in figure 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.240
 of these figures we can do many 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:39.350
 more these magazines are also to points 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.350
 everything is done to him 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:52.830
 we can go marking in this way with 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.830
 pulse so that everything takes 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:12.110
 all this that is being done 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.110
 it's coming out of the imagination 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.199
 is doing doing 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:26.159
 more 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.159
 I hope you liked it
