been asked my livestream yo Tyler what's

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.799 
been asked my livestream yo Tyler what's
your<00:00:11.130> best<00:00:11.309> class<00:00:11.639> setup<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:12.179> prestiging

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
your best class setup for prestiging

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.589 
your best class setup for prestiging
what<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.469> run<00:00:13.650> on<00:00:13.679> your<00:00:13.860> ASM<00:00:14.340> one<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:15.570> I

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
what do you run on your ASM one so I

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.700 
what do you run on your ASM one so I
thought<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.839> would<00:00:15.900> bring<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.170> guys<00:00:16.379> an

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
thought I would bring you guys an

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.790 
thought I would bring you guys an
updated<00:00:17.340> set<00:00:17.789> up<00:00:17.880> video<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.900> lately<00:00:19.470> I'd<00:00:19.680> be

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
updated set up video so lately I'd be

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.160 
updated set up video so lately I'd be
using<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> ASM<00:00:20.699> one<00:00:20.820> rigor<00:00:21.210> as<00:00:21.449> most<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.050> guys

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
using the ASM one rigor as most you guys

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.810 
using the ASM one rigor as most you guys
know<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.350> recommend<00:00:22.769> using<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.010> sol-<00:00:23.400> it's

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
know I recommend using the sol- it's

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.089 
know I recommend using the sol- it's
probably<00:00:24.150> easiest<00:00:24.779> gun<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.230> get<00:00:25.410> only<00:00:25.650> 300

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
probably easiest gun to get only 300

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.230 
probably easiest gun to get only 300
kills<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.340> day<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.580> someone<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.000> get<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
kills a day is someone you get the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.029 
kills a day is someone you get the
magnitude<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.260> basically<00:00:28.560> comes<00:00:28.830> with<00:00:28.980> a

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
magnitude and basically comes with a

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.279 
magnitude and basically comes with a
built<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.429> advance<00:00:29.730> where<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:29.970> fling<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
built in advance where I fling but I

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.620 
built in advance where I fling but I
started<00:00:31.380> using<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.980> rigger<00:00:32.219> which<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.300> gun

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
started using the rigger which is a gun

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.180 
started using the rigger which is a gun
that<00:00:33.660> comes<00:00:33.899> built<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.500> four<00:00:34.800> grip<00:00:35.040> so

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
that comes built in with four grip so

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.830 
that comes built in with four grip so
basically<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.180> my<00:00:36.210> class<00:00:36.510> up<00:00:36.719> you

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
basically what I do in my class up you

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.569 
basically what I do in my class up you
can<00:00:36.989> showing<00:00:37.170> your<00:00:37.350> screen<00:00:37.620> here<00:00:37.829> days<00:00:38.340> when

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
can showing your screen here days when

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.360 
can showing your screen here days when
magnitude<00:00:39.200> comes<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.379> plus<00:00:40.620> two<00:00:40.829> range<00:00:41.100> I

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
magnitude comes with plus two range I

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.580 
magnitude comes with plus two range I
run<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:41.969> grip<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.329> extended<00:00:42.719> mags<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
run for grip and extended mags on the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.160 
run for grip and extended mags on the
rigger<00:00:44.030> comes<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.180> built-in<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.870> grip<00:00:46.050> so

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
rigger comes with a built-in for grip so

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.720 
rigger comes with a built-in for grip so
I've<00:00:46.260> been<00:00:46.379> running<00:00:46.559> an<00:00:46.710> advanced<00:00:47.039> rifling<00:00:47.550> in

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
I've been running an advanced rifling in

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.910 
I've been running an advanced rifling in
X<00:00:47.910> 10<00:00:48.120> max<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.690> basically<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.170> same<00:00:49.260> gun

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
X 10 max so it's basically the same gun

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.100 
X 10 max so it's basically the same gun
statistically<00:00:50.789> speaking<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.899> only

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
statistically speaking the only

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.740 
statistically speaking the only
difference<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.190> rigor<00:00:53.699> has<00:00:53.969> ten<00:00:54.329> percent

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
difference is the rigor has ten percent

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.080 
difference is the rigor has ten percent
worse<00:00:54.899> hipfire<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:56.250> has<00:00:56.399> ten<00:00:56.699> percent

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
worse hipfire and it has ten percent

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
worse hipfire and it has ten percent
increase<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> aes<00:00:57.719> time<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.500> basically

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
increase to aes time so it's basically

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.610 
increase to aes time so it's basically
the<00:00:59.250> same<00:00:59.340> gone<00:00:59.699> almost<00:00:59.850> essentially<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.590> I

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the same gone almost essentially but I

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.650 
the same gone almost essentially but I
like<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.829> rigor<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.219> lot<00:01:02.399> better<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.820> has<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.000> in

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
like the rigor a lot better it has a in

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
like the rigor a lot better it has a in
my<00:01:04.019> opinion<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> kick<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.280> lot

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
my opinion the kick on it it's a lot

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.740 
my opinion the kick on it it's a lot
easier<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.659> control<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.850> too<00:01:08.850> easy<00:01:09.030> guns<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
easier to control so too easy guns to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.170 
easier to control so too easy guns to
get<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.680> very<00:01:10.950> good<00:01:11.130> guns<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.520> use<00:01:11.700> so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
get to very good guns to use so

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.120 
get to very good guns to use so
basically<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.750> starting<00:01:13.110> off<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.260> my

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
basically just starting off here my

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.800 
basically just starting off here my
killstreaks<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:15.000> i<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.360> explain<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
killstreaks what i like to explain to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.179 
killstreaks what i like to explain to
you<00:01:15.869> guys<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.200> how<00:01:16.350> killstreaks<00:01:16.860> work<00:01:17.040> in

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
you guys is how killstreaks work in

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.530 
you guys is how killstreaks work in
advanced<00:01:17.400> warfare<00:01:17.820> excel<00:01:18.060> i<00:01:18.119> think<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> lot<00:01:18.420> of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
advanced warfare excel i think a lot of

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.350 
advanced warfare excel i think a lot of
people<00:01:18.630> are<00:01:18.840> confused<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.880> i<00:01:20.880> end<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.180> running

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
people are confused and i end up running

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.990 
people are confused and i end up running
support<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.020> my<00:01:22.110> UAV<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.770> class<00:01:22.979> up<00:01:23.280> so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
support on my UAV on this class up so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.980 
support on my UAV on this class up so
for<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> lot<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> guys<00:01:24.509> who<00:01:24.750> don't<00:01:24.930> know

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
for a lot of you guys who don't know

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.120 
for a lot of you guys who don't know
what<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.290> means<00:01:25.500> basically<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.040> means

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
what that means basically what it means

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.010 
what that means basically what it means
is<00:01:26.400> even<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.820> i<00:01:26.939> die<00:01:27.000> i<00:01:27.180> still<00:01:27.689> earn<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
is even if i die i still earn the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.200 
is even if i die i still earn the
killstreaks<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.650> what<00:01:28.799> support<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.369> its<00:01:29.640> 300

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
killstreaks so what support is its 300

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.609 
killstreaks so what support is its 300
points<00:01:30.360> more<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:32.729> UAV<00:01:33.150> always<00:01:33.869> always<00:01:34.229> is

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
points more but the UAV always always is

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.249 
points more but the UAV always always is
being<00:01:34.860> earned<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.720> 1,500<00:01:36.720> points<00:01:36.960> for

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
being earned so it's 1,500 points for

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.060 
being earned so it's 1,500 points for
two<00:01:37.470> UAVs<00:01:37.979> or<00:01:38.009> 750<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.380> every<00:01:40.590> 59

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
two UAVs or 750 for one so every 59

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.910 
two UAVs or 750 for one so every 59
points<00:01:41.280> i<00:01:41.490> will<00:01:41.670> earn<00:01:41.820> two<00:01:42.180> UAVs<00:01:42.780> now<00:01:43.680> what<00:01:43.890> I

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
points i will earn two UAVs now what I

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.249 
points i will earn two UAVs now what I
have<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.340> warbird<00:01:44.970> system<00:01:45.570> hacking<00:01:45.899> assault

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
have is warbird system hacking assault

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.789 
have is warbird system hacking assault
drone<00:01:46.610> with<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> warbird<00:01:48.149> its<00:01:48.320> 900<00:01:49.320> points<00:01:49.530> to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
drone with the warbird its 900 points to

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.950 
drone with the warbird its 900 points to
earn<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.700> only<00:01:50.939> way<00:01:51.060> i<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.270> earn<00:01:51.600> another

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
earn the only way i can earn another

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.499 
earn the only way i can earn another
system<00:01:52.439> ack<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.799> after<00:01:53.460> getting<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.030> warbird

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
system ack is after getting that warbird

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.539 
system ack is after getting that warbird
so<00:01:55.020> once<00:01:55.259> again<00:01:55.380> my<00:01:55.560> warbird<00:01:55.979> then<00:01:56.100> i'll<00:01:56.219> start

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
so once again my warbird then i'll start

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.670 
so once again my warbird then i'll start
earning<00:01:56.790> towards<00:01:57.509> my<00:01:57.659> new<00:01:57.840> system<00:01:58.290> act<00:01:58.500> so

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
earning towards my new system act so

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.490 
earning towards my new system act so
that<00:01:59.030> right<00:02:00.030> there<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.270> why<00:02:00.659> run<00:02:00.960> support<00:02:01.350> on

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that right there is why run support on

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.609 
that right there is why run support on
the<00:02:01.590> UAV<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.759> basically<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.990> only<00:02:04.170> way<00:02:04.560> to

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the UAV so basically the only way to

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.530 
the UAV so basically the only way to
start<00:02:05.009> earning<00:02:05.219> towards<00:02:05.790> your<00:02:05.880> new<00:02:06.090> system

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
start earning towards your new system

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.680 
start earning towards your new system
act<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.409> either<00:02:07.560> die<00:02:07.920> or<00:02:08.220> get<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.879> warbird<00:02:09.360> so

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
act is to either die or get a warbird so

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.680 
act is to either die or get a warbird so
you<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.959> get<00:02:10.110> 150<00:02:10.890> more

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
you have to get 150 more

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.320 
you have to get 150 more
winds<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.980> get<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.190> new<00:02:13.430> system<00:02:13.850> ax<00:02:14.060> start

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
winds to get a new system ax start

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.150 
winds to get a new system ax start
earning<00:02:14.480> towards<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:15.260> that's<00:02:15.530> why<00:02:15.710> I<00:02:15.740> only

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
earning towards it so that's why I only

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.550 
earning towards it so that's why I only
run<00:02:16.390> these<00:02:17.390> load<00:02:17.660> killstreak<00:02:18.080> so<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.410> can

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
run these load killstreak so you can

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.440 
run these load killstreak so you can
really<00:02:18.800> omastar<00:02:19.610> they're<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.790> lot<00:02:19.940> easier<00:02:20.000> to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
really omastar they're a lot easier to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.630 
really omastar they're a lot easier to
get<00:02:20.690> just<00:02:21.500> something<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.890> think<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.370> lot<00:02:22.520> of

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
get just something I think that a lot of

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.730 
get just something I think that a lot of
you<00:02:22.760> guys<00:02:22.820> wouldn't<00:02:23.660> understand<00:02:24.260> or<00:02:24.440> didn't

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
you guys wouldn't understand or didn't

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.740 
you guys wouldn't understand or didn't
really<00:02:24.770> know<00:02:25.100> about<00:02:25.220> this<00:02:25.490> game<00:02:25.760> so

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
really know about this game so

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.110 
really know about this game so
supporting<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.770> UAVs<00:02:28.130> apps<00:02:28.490> it<00:02:28.760> absolutely

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
supporting the UAVs apps it absolutely

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.780 
supporting the UAVs apps it absolutely
dominates<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.930> can<00:02:30.050> get<00:02:30.170> ten<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.740> twenty<00:02:31.400> UAVs

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
dominates you can get ten to twenty UAVs

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.880 
dominates you can get ten to twenty UAVs
game<00:02:32.090> with<00:02:32.270> this<00:02:32.450> if<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.720> guys<00:02:32.930> are<00:02:33.140> playing

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
game with this if you guys are playing

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.750 
game with this if you guys are playing
up<00:02:34.130> obj<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:35.270> rushing<00:02:35.600> hard<00:02:35.810> like<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.140> do

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
up obj and just rushing hard like I do

up obj and just rushing hard like I do
so<00:02:37.760> obviously<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.330> system<00:02:38.690> hack<00:02:38.870> all

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
so obviously the system hack all

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.260 
so obviously the system hack all
everyone<00:02:39.380> is<00:02:39.500> assist<00:02:39.980> points<00:02:40.400> why<00:02:40.970> people

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
everyone is assist points why people

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.180 
everyone is assist points why people
like<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.540> run<00:02:41.660> disabled<00:02:42.080> XO<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.650> mean<00:02:42.890> if<00:02:43.040> you

like to run disabled XO I mean if you

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.640 
like to run disabled XO I mean if you
want<00:02:43.430> that's<00:02:43.730> cool<00:02:44.060> but<00:02:44.270> assist<00:02:44.600> points<00:02:45.020> with

to make it to kill and with this this

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.870 
to make it to kill and with this this
points<00:02:51.320> on<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.530> system<00:02:52.010> hack<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.730> get

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
points on the system hack you get

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.190 
points on the system hack you get
assists<00:02:53.210> points<00:02:53.510> off<00:02:53.600> your<00:02:53.630> teammates

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
kills but the system hack is the best

to run counter UAV it basically blinds
their<00:03:05.240> radar<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:06.290> can<00:03:06.500> run<00:03:06.650> around<00:03:06.770> use

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
their radar and you can run around use

the assault on over the bombing run is a

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.100 
the assault on over the bombing run is a
