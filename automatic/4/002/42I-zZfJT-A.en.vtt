hi<00:00:00.359> guys<00:00:00.570> this<00:00:01.500> is<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:02.000> top<00:00:03.000> model<00:00:03.449> from<00:00:03.720> the

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hi guys this is the top model from the

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.330 
hi guys this is the top model from the
score<00:00:04.140> Factory<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:05.130> C<00:00:05.839> 201<00:00:07.010> desktop<00:00:08.010> model

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
score Factory the C 201 desktop model

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.879 
score Factory the C 201 desktop model
and<00:00:08.519> this<00:00:09.450> one<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.870> based<00:00:10.139> on<00:00:10.380> much<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.740> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
and this one is based on much of the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.339 
and this one is based on much of the
design<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.490> already<00:00:11.820> know<00:00:12.030> from<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.330> C<00:00:12.630> 101

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
design you already know from the C 101

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.980 
design you already know from the C 101
which<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.070> rec<00:00:14.429> unit<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.570> form<00:00:15.839> factor

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
which is a rec unit so the form factor

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.900 
which is a rec unit so the form factor
is<00:00:16.199> radically<00:00:16.740> different<00:00:17.220> between<00:00:17.550> those<00:00:17.699> two

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
is radically different between those two

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.240 
is radically different between those two
units<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.449> because<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.380> now<00:00:19.500> desktop<00:00:20.070> unit

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
units and because it's now desktop unit

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.849 
units and because it's now desktop unit
we<00:00:20.460> have<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> much<00:00:20.970> larger<00:00:21.500> surface<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.680> put

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
we have a much larger surface to put

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.740 
we have a much larger surface to put
buttons<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:23.609> can<00:00:23.760> also<00:00:23.910> include<00:00:24.330> some<00:00:24.570> more

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
buttons on we can also include some more

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.920 
buttons on we can also include some more
functionality<00:00:25.590> which<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.640> did<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.779> is

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
functionality which we did and this is

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.650 
functionality which we did and this is
why<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.260> called<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.619> t<00:00:28.920> XS<00:00:29.699> controller

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
why it's called the t XS controller

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.179 
why it's called the t XS controller
because<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> has<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> tee<00:00:31.380> but<00:00:31.619> has<00:00:31.830> extra

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
because it has a tee but has extra

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.750 
because it has a tee but has extra
buttons<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.790> has<00:00:32.940> two<00:00:33.719> Smart<00:00:34.050> Switches

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
buttons and it has two Smart Switches

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.510 
buttons and it has two Smart Switches
okay<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.360> as<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.020> said<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.530> based<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> C

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
okay so as I said it's based on the C

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.760 
okay so as I said it's based on the C
101<00:00:39.059> design<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.690> much<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.170> what<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.739> here

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
101 design so much of what you see here

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.670 
101 design so much of what you see here
is<00:00:41.219> already<00:00:41.850> expected<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.200> program

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
is already expected we have the program

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.190 
is already expected we have the program
pass<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.160> selects<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> program<00:00:45.420> directly<00:00:45.989> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
pass it selects the program directly you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.889 
pass it selects the program directly you
can<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> multi<00:00:47.850> viewer<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.719> have

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
can see here on the multi viewer we have

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.690 
can see here on the multi viewer we have
a<00:00:48.930> preview<00:00:49.379> pass<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.860> select<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.489> goes

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
a preview pass you can select what goes

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.360 
a preview pass you can select what goes
on<00:00:50.879> preview<00:00:51.300> no<00:00:51.899> surprise<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> T<00:00:53.129> by

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
on preview no surprise we have the T by

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.529 
on preview no surprise we have the T by
you<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.640> make<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> nice<00:00:54.030> fade<00:00:54.390> transition

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
you can make a nice fade transition

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.920 
you can make a nice fade transition
between<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.320> two<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.100> seen<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.489> all<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
between the two you have seen it all and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.410 
between the two you have seen it all and
the<00:00:57.930> auto<00:00:58.109> button<00:00:58.379> cut<00:00:59.309> button<00:00:59.699> we<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the auto button cut button we have the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.510 
the auto button cut button we have the
user<00:01:00.809> keys<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> user<00:01:01.739> keys<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.190> already

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
user keys and the user keys is already

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520 
user keys and the user keys is already
known<00:01:02.789> from<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.270> C<00:01:03.420> 101<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:04.439> of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
known from the C 101 so this is one of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.469 
known from the C 101 so this is one of
the<00:01:04.619> concepts<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.519> transported

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the concepts that we have transported

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.120 
the concepts that we have transported
into<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.049> unit<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.560> then<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.979> have

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
into this unit and then you have

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.800 
into this unit and then you have
directly<00:01:08.580> access<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.150> enabling<00:01:09.600> your

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
directly access to enabling your

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.010 
directly access to enabling your
downstream<00:01:10.530> Kia<00:01:10.890> one<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.610> two<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.869> is

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
downstream Kia one and two and this is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.440 
downstream Kia one and two and this is
what<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.680> picked<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.430> put<00:01:14.670> right<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.240> can

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
what we picked to put right here you can

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.350 
what we picked to put right here you can
program<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.530> differently<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.400> now

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
program it differently if you like now

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.719 
program it differently if you like now
we<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> menu<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.250> haven't<00:01:20.580> seen

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
we have the menu and if you haven't seen

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.850 
we have the menu and if you haven't seen
the<00:01:20.850> menu<00:01:21.119> I'll<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.540> briefly<00:01:21.930> take<00:01:22.830> you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the menu I'll just briefly take you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.590 
the menu I'll just briefly take you
through<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:24.080> done<00:01:25.080> okay<00:01:25.799> now<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.299> of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
through it done okay now you can of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.649 
through it done okay now you can of
course<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.380> menu<00:01:29.180> demonstrated<00:01:30.180> in

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
course have the menu demonstrated in

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.200 
course have the menu demonstrated in
much<00:01:30.869> more<00:01:31.020> detail<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:31.650> watch<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.250> 101<00:01:32.700> video

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
much more detail but watch the 101 video

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.300 
much more detail but watch the 101 video
instead<00:01:33.780> because<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.470> exactly<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.100> same

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
instead because it's exactly the same

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.539 
instead because it's exactly the same
inside<00:01:35.729> now<00:01:36.570> let's<00:01:36.930> get<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.799> really

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
inside now let's get on to the really

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.609 
inside now let's get on to the really
interesting<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.420> different<00:01:39.570> part<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.229> this

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
interesting and different part on this

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.889 
interesting and different part on this
particular<00:01:41.100> unit<00:01:41.549> we<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> extra<00:01:42.689> keys

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
particular unit we have the extra keys

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.190 
particular unit we have the extra keys
up<00:01:43.170> here<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:45.030> extra<00:01:45.479> keys<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.990> be

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
up here and the extra keys can be

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.889 
up here and the extra keys can be
programmed<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.520> whatever<00:01:47.700> functionality<00:01:48.540> you

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
programmed to whatever functionality you

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.200 
programmed to whatever functionality you
like<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> point<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.909> even

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
like and this is the point we have even

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.630 
like and this is the point we have even
constructed<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> software<00:01:52.680> rounded<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
constructed the software rounded in a

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.880 
constructed the software rounded in a
way<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.329> believe<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.200> relatively

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
way so we believe it's it's relatively

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.520 
way so we believe it's it's relatively
easy<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.509> customize<00:01:57.960> each

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
easy for you to customize each

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.920 
easy for you to customize each
functionality<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.430> these<00:01:59.610> buttons<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.119> this

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
functionality of these buttons so this

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.350 
functionality of these buttons so this
is<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.110> default<00:02:01.670> suggestion<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:02.909> what<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:03.210> can

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
is a default suggestion for what we can

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.359 
is a default suggestion for what we can
put<00:02:03.570> there<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.469> one<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.040> we<00:02:05.189> can

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
put there and the one is that we can

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.609 
put there and the one is that we can
press<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.880> bass<00:02:06.299> button<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.290> we<00:02:07.439> press

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
press the bass button and if we press

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.210 
press the bass button and if we press
bass<00:02:08.149> guess<00:02:09.149> what<00:02:09.450> I'm<00:02:09.720> preview<00:02:10.440> we<00:02:10.830> get<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
bass guess what I'm preview we get the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.360 
bass guess what I'm preview we get the
collar<00:02:11.430> bars<00:02:11.700> okay

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
collar bars okay

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.520 
collar bars okay
have<00:02:13.489> also<00:02:13.760> one<00:02:13.940> called<00:02:14.150> called<00:02:14.599> one<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.290> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
have also one called called one and that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.460 
have also one called called one and that
gives<00:02:16.099> us<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.760> ecology<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:17.299> rate<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.659> one<00:02:17.900> we

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
gives us the ecology and rate of one we

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.140 
gives us the ecology and rate of one we
don't<00:02:18.590> have<00:02:18.709> collagen<00:02:19.190> rate<00:02:19.430> or<00:02:19.549> two<00:02:19.760> on<00:02:20.000> this

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
don't have collagen rate or two on this

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.180 
don't have collagen rate or two on this
one<00:02:20.209> because<00:02:20.540> we<00:02:20.690> believe<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.140> we<00:02:22.040> would

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
one because we believe that we would

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.520 
one because we believe that we would
have<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.940> prioritize<00:02:23.599> here<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.440> is

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
have to to prioritize here and this is

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.979 
have to to prioritize here and this is
our<00:02:24.650> our<00:02:25.250> suggestion<00:02:25.909> that<00:02:26.180> now<00:02:26.599> you<00:02:26.659> have<00:02:26.870> at

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
our our suggestion that now you have at

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.149 
our our suggestion that now you have at
least<00:02:27.200> access<00:02:27.379> to<00:02:27.650> one<00:02:27.799> of<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.010> coal

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
least access to one of the coal

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.240 
least access to one of the coal
generators<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:29.360> have<00:02:29.510> Q<00:02:30.140> 1<00:02:30.379> and<00:02:30.530> Q<00:02:30.620> 2<00:02:30.860> which

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
generators you have Q 1 and Q 2 which

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.509 
generators you have Q 1 and Q 2 which
will<00:02:31.430> enable<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.530> upstream<00:02:33.530> kia's<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.069> we

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
will enable the upstream kia's and we

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.430 
will enable the upstream kia's and we
can<00:02:34.670> just<00:02:34.879> do<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.060> quickly<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:35.750> see<00:02:35.959> that<00:02:36.230> on

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
can just do that quickly you see that on

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.030 
can just do that quickly you see that on
upstream<00:02:36.920> key<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.340> one<00:02:37.610> we<00:02:38.269> have<00:02:38.599> a<00:02:39.500> picture

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
upstream key of one we have a picture

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.440 
upstream key of one we have a picture
and<00:02:40.220> picture<00:02:40.310> functionality<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.239> on

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
and picture functionality and on

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.960 
and picture functionality and on
upstream<00:02:41.900> key<00:02:42.170> -<00:02:42.440> we<00:02:42.950> have<00:02:43.159> a<00:02:43.310> name<00:02:43.670> tech

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
upstream key - we have a name tech

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.089 
upstream key - we have a name tech
functionality<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.319> just<00:02:45.590> disabled

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
functionality so it's just disabled

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.699 
functionality so it's just disabled
those<00:02:46.250> but<00:02:46.879> notice<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.810> picture<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.560> picture

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
those but notice the picture and picture

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.789 
those but notice the picture and picture
functionality<00:02:49.519> is<00:02:49.700> enabled<00:02:50.090> with<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.680> a

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
functionality is enabled with the just a

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.460 
functionality is enabled with the just a
cut<00:02:52.129> transition<00:02:52.790> here<00:02:53.060> we<00:02:53.900> have<00:02:54.049> a<00:02:54.079> button

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
cut transition here we have a button

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.920 
cut transition here we have a button
called<00:02:54.799> picture-in-picture<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.970> as<00:02:56.720> you

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
called picture-in-picture and as you

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.509 
called picture-in-picture and as you
might<00:02:57.109> have<00:02:57.260> seen<00:02:57.620> in<00:02:57.980> some<00:02:58.129> of<00:02:58.250> our<00:02:58.340> other

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
might have seen in some of our other

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.509 
might have seen in some of our other
videos<00:02:58.819> we<00:02:59.299> prefer<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.230> fade<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:01.159> picture<00:03:01.459> and

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
videos we prefer to fade the picture and

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.610 
videos we prefer to fade the picture and
picture<00:03:01.640> into<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.359> image<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:02.959> fade<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.470> out

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
picture into the image and fade it out

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.550 
picture into the image and fade it out
again<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.459> is<00:03:04.700> essentially<00:03:05.359> a<00:03:05.540> macro<00:03:06.260> of

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
again and that is essentially a macro of

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.039 
again and that is essentially a macro of
five<00:03:07.069> actions<00:03:07.640> in<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.879> ATM<00:03:08.120> switches<00:03:08.359> so<00:03:08.599> when

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
five actions in the ATM switches so when

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.330 
five actions in the ATM switches so when
I<00:03:09.079> press<00:03:09.319> this<00:03:09.670> see<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.730> fades<00:03:11.090> in<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.870> out

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
I press this see it fades in and out

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.349 
I press this see it fades in and out
fades<00:03:13.340> in<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:14.030> fades<00:03:14.120> out<00:03:15.760> we<00:03:16.760> have<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.150> fade

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
fades in and fades out we have the fade

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.199 
fades in and fades out we have the fade
to<00:03:17.569> black<00:03:17.690> functionality<00:03:18.470> as<00:03:18.560> well

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
to black functionality as well

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.599 
to black functionality as well
fade<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.239> black<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:20.930> then<00:03:21.530> if<00:03:21.799> we<00:03:21.950> press<00:03:22.220> media

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
fade to black and then if we press media

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.140 
fade to black and then if we press media
one<00:03:23.030> guess<00:03:23.900> what<00:03:24.079> happens<00:03:24.500> now<00:03:25.250> we<00:03:25.310> can<00:03:25.669> select

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
laptop here which I can display in the

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.449 
laptop here which I can display in the
background<00:03:44.870> here<00:03:45.079> and<00:03:45.290> I'll<00:03:45.440> do<00:03:45.799> that<00:03:46.040> just

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
background here and I'll do that just

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.080 
background here and I'll do that just
quickly<00:03:46.910> by<00:03:47.919> selecting<00:03:48.919> my<00:03:49.129> laptop<00:03:49.730> for<00:03:50.000> the

quickly by selecting my laptop for the
background<00:03:50.569> and<00:03:51.109> I<00:03:51.709> did<00:03:51.919> that<00:03:52.099> from<00:03:52.250> the

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
background and I did that from the

good so
let's<00:04:27.750> leave<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:28.740> functionality<00:04:29.520> or<00:04:29.610> go

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
let's leave that functionality or go

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.370 
let's leave that functionality or go
back<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:29.940> media<00:04:30.330> one<00:04:30.540> let's<00:04:30.840> say<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.200> we

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
back to media one let's say that we

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.680 
back to media one let's say that we
enable<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:32.610> name<00:04:32.820> tech<00:04:33.120> which<00:04:33.300> was<00:04:33.510> an

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
enable the name tech which was an

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.940 
enable the name tech which was an
upstream<00:04:34.080> Kia<00:04:34.380> too<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:36.110> we<00:04:37.110> could<00:04:37.260> now<00:04:37.470> select

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
upstream Kia too and we could now select

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.000 
upstream Kia too and we could now select
the<00:04:38.790> name<00:04:39.120> tech<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:39.780> we<00:04:39.930> like<00:04:40.140> which<00:04:40.620> is<00:04:40.650> on

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
the name tech that we like which is on

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.660 
the name tech that we like which is on
three<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:42.270> name<00:04:42.420> tech<00:04:42.690> goes<00:04:42.930> there<00:04:43.670> and

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
three and the name tech goes there and

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.580 
three and the name tech goes there and
we<00:04:45.330> can<00:04:45.510> cut<00:04:46.260> it<00:04:46.380> out<00:04:46.470> again<00:04:47.690> alright<00:04:48.690> so<00:04:49.140> that

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
we can cut it out again alright so that

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.920 
we can cut it out again alright so that
was<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:50.010> extra<00:04:50.310> keys<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.820> stuff<00:04:51.330> you<00:04:51.630> can<00:04:51.780> put

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
was the extra keys and stuff you can put

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.620 
was the extra keys and stuff you can put
up<00:04:52.080> there<00:04:52.400> it's<00:04:53.400> customizable<00:04:53.940> you<00:04:54.600> can

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
up there it's customizable you can

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.870 
up there it's customizable you can
program<00:04:55.230> it<00:04:55.380> differently<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:56.190> now<00:04:56.520> let's<00:04:56.730> go

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
program it differently and now let's go

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.880 
program it differently and now let's go
to<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.090> smart<00:04:57.300> witch's<00:04:57.660> and<00:04:57.990> I'm<00:04:58.470> gonna<00:04:58.680> turn

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
to the smart witch's and I'm gonna turn

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.460 
to the smart witch's and I'm gonna turn
the<00:04:59.130> unit<00:04:59.400> so<00:04:59.700> that<00:04:59.880> you<00:05:00.060> can<00:05:00.240> see<00:05:00.480> what<00:05:01.290> is

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
the unit so that you can see what is

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.950 
the unit so that you can see what is
shown<00:05:01.770> on<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:02.100> Smart<00:05:02.340> Switches<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:03.630> first

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
shown on the Smart Switches the first

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.790 
shown on the Smart Switches the first
one<00:05:04.340> determines<00:05:05.340> how<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:05.940> program<00:05:06.800> select

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
one determines how the program select

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.760 
one determines how the program select
bus<00:05:08.280> buttons<00:05:09.150> right<00:05:09.570> here<00:05:09.630> what<00:05:10.380> they<00:05:10.590> are

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
bus buttons right here what they are

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.730 
bus buttons right here what they are
actually<00:05:10.980> selecting<00:05:11.670> and<00:05:11.940> right<00:05:12.840> now<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:13.380> says

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
in the normal program mode if I press it

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.740 
in the normal program mode if I press it
again<00:05:26.700> already<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:29.310> says<00:05:29.640> now<00:05:29.820> auxilary<00:05:30.390> one

again already it says now auxilary one
and<00:05:31.080> it<00:05:31.320> means<00:05:31.500> that<00:05:31.620> this<00:05:32.070> bus<00:05:32.400> will<00:05:32.850> select

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
and it means that this bus will select

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.900 
and it means that this bus will select
auxilary<00:05:33.840> one<00:05:34.230> output<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:35.100> that's<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.760> magic

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
auxilary one output and that's the magic

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.540 
auxilary one output and that's the magic
I<00:05:36.270> did<00:05:36.510> just<00:05:36.780> before<00:05:36.930> because<00:05:37.620> this<00:05:38.280> is

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
I did just before because this is

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.850 
I did just before because this is
axillary<00:05:39.030> one<00:05:39.270> output<00:05:39.660> from<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:40.620> ATM

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
axillary one output from the ATM

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.070 
axillary one output from the ATM
switcher<00:05:41.250> and<00:05:41.370> I<00:05:41.850> just<00:05:42.090> went<00:05:42.330> into<00:05:42.480> that<00:05:42.630> menu

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
switcher and I just went into that menu

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.930 
switcher and I just went into that menu
selected<00:05:43.560> two<00:05:43.710> which<00:05:43.920> is<00:05:44.070> the<00:05:44.250> output<00:05:44.430> from<00:05:44.850> my

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
selected two which is the output from my

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.880 
selected two which is the output from my
computer<00:05:45.240> and<00:05:45.480> as<00:05:45.930> you<00:05:46.050> can<00:05:46.170> see<00:05:46.230> we<00:05:46.530> could<00:05:46.710> go

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
computer and as you can see we could go

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.440 
computer and as you can see we could go
through<00:05:47.220> all<00:05:47.250> the<00:05:47.670> inputs<00:05:48.030> that<00:05:48.150> we<00:05:48.300> have

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
through all the inputs that we have

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.260 
through all the inputs that we have
available<00:05:48.660> and<00:05:49.140> they'll<00:05:50.130> display<00:05:51.030> on

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
available and they'll display on

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.680 
available and they'll display on
auxiliary<00:05:51.660> one<00:05:52.200> output<00:05:52.590> as<00:05:52.980> I<00:05:53.520> press<00:05:53.880> again

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
auxiliary one output as I press again

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.340 
auxiliary one output as I press again
and<00:05:55.130> again<00:05:56.130> you<00:05:56.760> can<00:05:56.940> see<00:05:57.180> that<00:05:57.210> it's<00:05:57.780> it<00:05:58.110> goes

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
and again you can see that it's it goes

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.830 
and again you can see that it's it goes
on<00:05:58.590> to<00:05:58.770> auxiliary<00:05:59.190> to<00:05:59.580> auxiliary<00:06:00.150> three<00:06:00.570> and

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
on to auxiliary to auxiliary three and

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.320 
on to auxiliary to auxiliary three and
then<00:06:01.530> it<00:06:01.560> goes<00:06:01.860> back<00:06:02.130> to<00:06:02.340> program<00:06:02.820> again

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
then it goes back to program again

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.900 
then it goes back to program again
so<00:06:03.660> it<00:06:03.780> basically<00:06:03.960> cycles<00:06:04.860> through<00:06:05.190> four

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
so it basically cycles through four

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.770 
so it basically cycles through four
different<00:06:08.030> opportunities<00:06:09.030> for<00:06:09.210> what<00:06:09.420> the

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
different opportunities for what the

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.500 
different opportunities for what the
program<00:06:10.470> select<00:06:10.860> bus<00:06:11.100> will<00:06:11.340> do<00:06:11.490> enough<00:06:12.420> of

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
program select bus will do enough of

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.960 
program select bus will do enough of
that<00:06:12.570> I<00:06:12.930> think<00:06:13.080> you<00:06:13.380> get<00:06:13.590> it<00:06:13.740> this<00:06:14.340> one<00:06:14.640> will

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
that I think you get it this one will

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.940 
that I think you get it this one will
select<00:06:15.630> another<00:06:15.930> thing<00:06:16.230> related<00:06:16.620> to

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
select another thing related to

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.710 
select another thing related to
picture-in-picture<00:06:17.400> so<00:06:17.910> let's<00:06:18.090> just<00:06:18.300> enable

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
picture-in-picture so let's just enable

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.510 
picture-in-picture so let's just enable
picture-in-picture<00:06:19.080> and<00:06:19.830> you<00:06:19.890> can<00:06:20.070> see<00:06:20.220> here

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
picture-in-picture and you can see here

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.940 
picture-in-picture and you can see here
it<00:06:20.580> is<00:06:20.700> again<00:06:21.000> in<00:06:21.120> our<00:06:21.210> multi<00:06:21.630> viewer<00:06:21.890> so<00:06:22.890> we

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
it is again in our multi viewer so we

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.170 
it is again in our multi viewer so we
have<00:06:23.070> picture<00:06:23.340> and<00:06:23.430> picture<00:06:23.550> on<00:06:23.790> the<00:06:23.910> left

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
have picture and picture on the left

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.020 
have picture and picture on the left
side<00:06:24.420> and<00:06:24.830> does<00:06:25.830> that<00:06:26.040> correspond<00:06:26.610> with<00:06:26.730> this

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
side and does that correspond with this

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.320 
side and does that correspond with this
graphics<00:06:27.480> yes<00:06:27.840> it<00:06:28.020> does<00:06:28.260> so<00:06:29.130> it<00:06:29.700> actually

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
graphics yes it does so it actually

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.240 
graphics yes it does so it actually
shows<00:06:30.630> where<00:06:31.230> the<00:06:31.410> picture<00:06:31.710> picture<00:06:32.070> will<00:06:32.220> be

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
shows where the picture picture will be

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.870 
shows where the picture picture will be
and<00:06:32.930> if<00:06:33.930> I<00:06:34.050> press<00:06:34.350> it<00:06:34.380> guess<00:06:34.770> what<00:06:35.010> happens<00:06:35.460> it

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
and if I press it guess what happens it

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.150 
and if I press it guess what happens it
now<00:06:36.450> changes<00:06:37.110> the<00:06:37.260> picture<00:06:37.620> and<00:06:37.710> picture<00:06:37.800> to

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
now changes the picture and picture to

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.399 
now changes the picture and picture to
the<00:06:38.250> right<00:06:38.430> side<00:06:38.730> and<00:06:39.090> the<00:06:39.300> button<00:06:39.690> display

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409
