00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.440 
couple of things we've got a pot nice
little<00:00:10.440> top<00:00:10.590> there<00:00:10.910> handle<00:00:11.910> it's<00:00:12.090> also<00:00:12.269> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
little top there handle it's also a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.570 
little top there handle it's also a
clamp<00:00:13.219> but<00:00:14.219> inside<00:00:14.969> donna<00:00:15.809> doll<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:17.070> have<00:00:17.340> a

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
clamp but inside donna doll we have a

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.750 
clamp but inside donna doll we have a
solo<00:00:18.119> stove<00:00:18.710> that<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.949> can<00:00:20.130> use<00:00:20.430> as<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
solo stove that you can use as a

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.650 
solo stove that you can use as a
wood-burning<00:00:21.240> stove<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.800> holes<00:00:23.130> are<00:00:23.609> set<00:00:24.480> up

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
wood-burning stove the holes are set up

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.870 
wood-burning stove the holes are set up
so<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.410> makes<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.099> most<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.640> little

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
so it really makes the most of a little

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.910 
so it really makes the most of a little
bit<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.090> heat<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.529> need<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.830> get

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
bit of heat and so what you need to get

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.330 
bit of heat and so what you need to get
it<00:00:29.039> started<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:30.300> some<00:00:30.510> little<00:00:30.750> twigs<00:00:31.080> not<00:00:32.040> big

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
it started or some little twigs not big

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.360 
it started or some little twigs not big
stuff<00:00:32.730> which<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.090> great<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.989> are<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:35.250> a

stuff which is great if you are in a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.860 
stuff which is great if you are in a
place<00:00:35.550> where<00:00:35.880> you're<00:00:36.000> not<00:00:36.120> allowed<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.420> make

keep it going we got a few of them

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.530 
keep it going we got a few of them
started<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:25.229> we're<00:01:25.350> gonna<00:01:25.439> put<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.860> our

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.160 
started and we're gonna put on our
window<00:01:27.540> screen<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:31.590> our<00:01:31.950> rot<00:01:32.540> water<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:34.079> our

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
window screen and our rot water for our

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:44.630 
window screen and our rot water for our
noodles<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:40.340> it's<00:01:41.340> 11<00:01:41.640> 55<00:01:42.409> right<00:01:43.409> now<00:01:43.649> so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
noodles and it's 11 55 right now so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.980 
noodles and it's 11 55 right now so
let's<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:44.970> how<00:01:45.090> long<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.390> takes<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.689> boil

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
let's see how long it takes to boil

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.039 
let's see how long it takes to boil
these<00:01:46.229> two<00:01:46.470> cups<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.890> water<00:01:47.600> let's<00:01:48.600> cover<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
these two cups of water let's cover it

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.380 
these two cups of water let's cover it
cover<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.409> pot<00:01:49.759> okay<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.210> it'll<00:01:51.509> boil<00:01:51.659> faster

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
cover the pot okay so it'll boil faster

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.170 
cover the pot okay so it'll boil faster
and<00:01:54.649> it's<00:01:55.649> got<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.920> little<00:01:55.979> feed<00:01:56.610> area<00:01:57.000> where

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and it's got this little feed area where

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.580 
and it's got this little feed area where
we<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.570> throw<00:01:57.689> more<00:01:57.960> wood<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.170> there<00:01:58.469> as

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
we can just throw more wood in there as

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.499 
we can just throw more wood in there as
we<00:01:58.770> need<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.729> know<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> get<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> fire

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
we need it you know to get the fire

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.260 
we need it you know to get the fire
going

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.840 

alrighty<00:02:06.270> got<00:02:07.200> quiet<00:02:07.470> about<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.920> flame<00:02:08.550> go<00:02:08.729> and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
alrighty got quiet about of flame go and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.780 
alrighty got quiet about of flame go and
I<00:02:08.880> probably<00:02:09.060> put<00:02:09.330> too<00:02:09.479> much<00:02:10.340> too<00:02:11.340> much<00:02:11.370> wood<00:02:11.760> in

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
I probably put too much too much wood in

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.430 
I probably put too much too much wood in
there<00:02:13.400> but<00:02:14.420> we<00:02:15.420> need<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.780> bring<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.140> water<00:02:16.320> to

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
there but we need to bring the water to

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.930 
there but we need to bring the water to
a<00:02:16.560> boil<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:17.100> we<00:02:17.280> need<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.520> cook<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
a boil and then we need to cook the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.700 
a boil and then we need to cook the
noodles<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.510> about<00:02:18.750> another<00:02:18.870> five<00:02:19.110> or<00:02:19.380> six

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
noodles for about another five or six

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.940 
noodles for about another five or six
minutes<00:02:21.080> still<00:02:22.080> got<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> ways<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.470> go<00:02:22.650> on<00:02:22.860> the
