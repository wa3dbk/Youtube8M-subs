basically only have three dials on this
machine<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:20.460> dial<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.970> detention<00:00:21.359> that's

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
machine this dial is detention that's

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.359 
machine this dial is detention that's
pretty<00:00:22.350> much<00:00:22.470> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> stay<00:00:22.830> wherever<00:00:23.250> it

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
pretty much going to stay wherever it

pretty much going to stay wherever it
comes<00:00:23.490> set<00:00:23.730> out<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.000> box<00:00:24.210> which<00:00:24.420> is

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
comes set out of the box which is

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.859 
comes set out of the box which is
usually<00:00:24.960> four<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:26.460> here<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.510> lines

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
usually four and here you have lines

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
for all the time and it's not like a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.130 
for all the time and it's not like a
yesteryears<00:00:42.329> machine<00:00:42.690> where<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.960> basically

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
yesteryears machine where you basically

here number five there's a little clamp
above<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.390> needle<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.900> then<00:04:10.680> we<00:04:11.220> number<00:04:12.180> six

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
above the needle and then we number six

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.900 
above the needle and then we number six
is<00:04:12.630> obviously<00:04:13.019> threading<00:04:13.860> our<00:04:13.950> needle<00:04:14.310> make

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
is obviously threading our needle make

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.699 
is obviously threading our needle make
sure<00:04:15.150> whenever<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.840> do<00:04:16.019> thread<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.470> upper

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709

the presser foot in the up position that

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.760 
the presser foot in the up position that
ensures<00:04:20.669> proper<00:04:20.970> threading<00:04:21.540> and<00:04:21.810> that's<00:04:22.530> just
