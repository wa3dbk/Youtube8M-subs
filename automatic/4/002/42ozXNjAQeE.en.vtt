00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:08.060
 well let's see friends today let's see 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.480
 I will try to explain how it is done 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:15.200
 for you to play a musical theme 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.350
 on the piano and they can record it in their 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.370
 computer directly direct sound 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:26.320
 from the piano to the computer for which 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:29.440
 I bought a cable this auxiliary cable 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.340
 it's rsa 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.840
 and audio input to the computer is 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.280
 a cable is called auxiliary 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.640
 rsa I suppose well 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.410
 I have this piano 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.200
 and in the back 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:53.000
 I have 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.530
 midi output midi output midi usb 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.410
 that is, but 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.329
 we are going to use in this case the output of 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.030
 rsa what is this that most of the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.600
 pianos must have it then he connected 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.600
 red 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.920
 with this the black one in this case goes 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.170
 in the White 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.400
 if it is white on the inside 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.430
 be white 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.860
 and this is what I connect where it says out 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.290
 because the sound will come out through the wire 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.290
 and will go to the computer the other side 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.920
 the other end I come to the back 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.670
 from my computer here back in my 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.840
 computer 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.939
 my video card has then output 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.899
 microphone or microphone input 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.049
 headset output that at that time 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.950
 I do not have it, I have it disconnected 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:54.159
 microphone and blue is audio input 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:02:01.600
 then in that blue I'm going to connect 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:05.159
 the piano there connected the piano and the piano 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.159
 I have it on 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.740
 ready ready to touch the truth very 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.120
 all right 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.099
 here I have open the city ​​grape 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.660
 when you connect a cable 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.680
 entry of 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.689
 from audio behind the computer 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.819
 here on the screen the 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.390
 cartelito depends on the audio board 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.150
 that have 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.550
 so that you can choose what is it 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.030
 that connected generally good I 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.260
 I have windows 7 ultimate and a plate 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.260
 real high definition 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.410
 if you are going to ask me for xp those things 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.840
 I do not know, I'm telling you how 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.760
 I do to record my piano in the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.870
 computer 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:59.040
 in a windows 7 ultimate with a plate 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.909
 Real sound tech high definition 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.909
 so 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.750
 in the window that comes out if you 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.209
 they have a sound plate common to 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.019
 say yes it has plugged in a 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.120
 connector and there have to tick what 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.239
 what they connected you have to give in 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.640
 audio input because on the piano 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.080
 we had connected the rca cable 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.420
 in audio output 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.120
 on the other end of the cable I would go in 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.190
 audio for the PC so that the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.740
 piano sound will go directly to 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.290
 the pc good as I captured it in this 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:41.800
 case he was saying he captured it with 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.820
 the audacity program 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.430
 which is free is easily achieved 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.489
 In the net 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.689
 well here in the classroom so we have to 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.689
 this is the recording button 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.730
 the play button the stop button 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.159
 recording and the pause 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.470
 here what I do I will leave these 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.750
 put out then this would be 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.730
 theoretically ready to record what 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.220
 he played on the piano for that I give him play 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.540
 here in record 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.540
 and I 'm going to play the piano 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.910
 in a small sample like that so they can see 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.910
 how it was recorded I put you to stop 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:47.060
 and I'm going to the end of the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:52.600
 once I finish recording like me 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.600
 It took me a while to make him record and go 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.349
 piano all this is silent sounds 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:01.520
 why do not you touch any key then 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.520
 What I do is select it 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.030
 I go here to the 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.280
 scissors 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.120
 I put in the little scissors we can 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.510
 cut then I cut it 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.780
 and if at the end of it 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.450
 of the song that I played 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.910
 sound in silence this is to tell you that 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:28.030
 I have it, it is in vain that I have it 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.240
 then select it I give to the 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:35.000
 scissors 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.000
 erase and then there I have 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.700
 the theme that he plays on the piano in 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.790
 problem audacity then this I do 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.570
 I'm going here 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.570
 archive 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.020
 to export 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.840
 In some folder I put the name to 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.470
 what I just did 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.470
 I dont know 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.090
 I put any name files see you 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.870
 it says mp3 audio file then it 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.580
 I save 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.580
 Here I am making you accept 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.680
 is it so 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.169
 that is, there was not a little window that 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.550
 is saving it because it was very fast 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.040
 because it's a little bit books are this 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.700
 I just recorded but that's 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:33.080
 what I wanted to show you today 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:35.270
 how to connect a piano and playing 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.970
 directly from the piano record in the 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.430
 computer what we're playing I've 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.020
 gone crazy looking for internet where 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.930
 someone who could teach me this 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.460
 I have sold midi cables but for 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.160
 which is that having a program that reads 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.349
 midi then it was very complicated and of 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.360
 this way I consider it much more 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:57.710
 simple easier direct and at the moment 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:00.460
 you can be listening in mp3 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.460
 your music 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.810
 what you have recorded 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.069
 I have some temitas there, Christ says 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:13.080
 well that's all friends I hope 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:14.879
 sorry for the bad of the recording but 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.900
 I more or less wanted 

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:22.080
 teach them how I did to record 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:25.370
 the piano on my computer many 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.370
 thanks greetings to all
