tough but it's kind of a grind if you

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.910 
tough but it's kind of a grind if you
don't<00:03:11.730> do<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.709> survival<00:03:13.709> arena<00:03:14.670> mode<00:03:15.859> on<00:03:16.859> a

other<00:03:23.340> game<00:03:23.700> modes<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.329> think<00:03:24.540> they<00:03:24.660> should

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
other game modes I think they should

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.930 
other game modes I think they should
implement<00:03:25.430> by<00:03:26.430> far<00:03:26.760> capture<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.810> flag<00:03:27.989> or

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
implement by far capture the flag or

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.319 
implement by far capture the flag or
even<00:03:29.940> king<00:03:30.209> of<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.390> hill<00:03:31.430> or<00:03:32.430> like<00:03:32.579> domination

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
even king of the hill or like domination

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.810 
even king of the hill or like domination
in<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.630> sense<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.709> would<00:03:35.340> think<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.609> would<00:03:35.700> be

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
in a sense I would think it would be

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.170 
in a sense I would think it would be
quite<00:03:36.480> awesome<00:03:37.310> some<00:03:38.310> other<00:03:38.459> really<00:03:38.940> cool

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
quite awesome some other really cool

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.300 
quite awesome some other really cool
things<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.780> surely<00:03:40.380> like<00:03:40.530> in<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.829> implement<00:03:41.220> it

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
things I surely like in the implement it

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.280

Hunger Games which I find this a lot of

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.160 
Hunger Games which I find this a lot of
fun<00:03:47.670> but<00:03:47.850> needs<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.359> be<00:03:48.450> slightly<00:03:48.630> worked<00:03:48.989> out

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
fun but needs to be slightly worked out

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.240 
fun but needs to be slightly worked out
due<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.950> fact<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:51.109> after<00:03:52.109> you<00:03:52.170> die<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:53.100> can

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
due to the fact of after you die you can

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.059 
due to the fact of after you die you can
spectate<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.760> course

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
spectate of course

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.709 
spectate of course
but<00:03:55.730> many<00:03:55.849> people<00:03:55.939> don't<00:03:56.180> want<00:03:56.420> to<00:03:56.540> stick

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:56.719 
but many people don't want to stick

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.179 
but many people don't want to stick
around<00:03:56.749> to<00:03:57.019> spectate<00:03:57.499> so<00:03:58.069> your<00:03:58.700> prize

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:00.189 
around to spectate so your prize

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.470 
around to spectate so your prize
decreases<00:04:01.189> on<00:04:01.340> how<00:04:01.489> many<00:04:01.670> people<00:04:01.939> are<00:04:02.060> at<00:04:02.269> the
