00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
abilities like there's an assassin kit

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.260

that can make you a visible invisible

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.100 
that can make you a visible invisible
and<00:00:36.480> then<00:00:37.079> there<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.700> some<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:39.960> there's

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and then there is some I think there's

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.840 
and then there is some I think there's
one<00:00:40.350> called<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> barbarian<00:00:41.280> kit<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.700> gives

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
one called the barbarian kit that gives

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.060 
one called the barbarian kit that gives
you<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.149> +2<00:00:42.960> damage<00:00:43.410> or<00:00:43.620> something<00:00:43.920> like

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
you like +2 damage or something like

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.190 
you like +2 damage or something like
that<00:00:44.129> or<00:00:44.520> +1<00:00:44.730> damage<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.420> +2<00:00:45.960> would<00:00:46.110> be

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
that or +1 damage I think +2 would be

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.680 
that or +1 damage I think +2 would be
kind<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.620> P<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.760> yeah<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:47.969> gives<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.270> plus<00:00:48.510> 2

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
kind of a P but yeah it gives you plus 2

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.389 
kind of a P but yeah it gives you plus 2
damage<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:49.230> there's<00:00:49.410> also<00:00:49.559> mobs<00:00:50.100> that

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
damage and then there's also mobs that

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.400 
damage and then there's also mobs that
run<00:00:51.120> around<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.420> try<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> kill<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.170> stuff

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
run around and try to kill you and stuff

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.020 
run around and try to kill you and stuff
and<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.739> also<00:00:52.860> kill<00:00:53.160> mobs<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.610> swords

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.450 
kind of stuff you can buy and do and
that's<00:01:04.229> pretty<00:01:04.470> much<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.890> coming<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.280> at

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
that's pretty much it I coming in at

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.399 
that's pretty much it I coming in at
number<00:01:05.670> 4<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.420> mineplex<00:01:06.689> server<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
number 4 we have the mineplex server and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.719 
number 4 we have the mineplex server and
on<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> mineplex<00:01:07.740> server<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> pretty

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
on the mineplex server is a pretty

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.390 
on the mineplex server is a pretty
massive<00:01:09.000> server<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.810> think<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.860> holds<00:01:11.010> upwards

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
massive server I think it holds upwards

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850 
massive server I think it holds upwards
of<00:01:11.520> thirty<00:01:11.729> six<00:01:12.000> thousand<00:01:12.510> players<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
hub is really cool as well as the lobby

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.050 
hub is really cool as well as the lobby
here<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.890> tells<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.400> how<00:01:17.490> much<00:01:17.640> time<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.939> have

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
something that most servers don't have

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.760

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the uber minecraft server if you don't

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.010 
the uber minecraft server if you don't
know<00:02:05.909> what<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.360> basically<00:02:06.659> just<00:02:06.810> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
know what it is it's basically just a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.300 
know what it is it's basically just a
server<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.439> has<00:02:07.560> all<00:02:07.710> kind<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.009> different

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
server that has all kind of different

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.960 
server that has all kind of different
game<00:02:08.429> types<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.940> one<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.970> notice

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
game types this one is just the notice

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.640 
game types this one is just the notice
this<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.360> obviously<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> hungry

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
this is obviously the hungry

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.589 
this is obviously the hungry
but<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.010> one<00:02:14.189> is<00:02:14.430> probably<00:02:15.209> I<00:02:15.269> think<00:02:15.450> there's

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
but this one is probably I think there's

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.440 
but this one is probably I think there's
a<00:02:15.659> lot<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:15.959> different<00:02:16.409> hunger<00:02:16.620> game<00:02:16.739> servers

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
a lot of different hunger game servers

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.020 
a lot of different hunger game servers
but<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:19.079> one's<00:02:19.319> not<00:02:19.650> quite<00:02:20.069> as<00:02:20.489> big<00:02:20.700> it's

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
but this one's not quite as big it's

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.690 
but this one's not quite as big it's
probably<00:02:21.840> holds<00:02:22.349> about<00:02:22.799> I<00:02:22.829> think<00:02:23.189> it<00:02:23.459> was<00:02:23.489> like

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
probably holds about I think it was like

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.970 
probably holds about I think it was like
five<00:02:24.000> thousand<00:02:24.450> players<00:02:24.629> maybe<00:02:25.230> ten<00:02:25.590> thousand

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
five thousand players maybe ten thousand

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.280 
five thousand players maybe ten thousand
I<00:02:26.040> think<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.340> was<00:02:26.430> five<00:02:26.670> thousand<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:28.079> over

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
I think it was five thousand the over

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.960 
I think it was five thousand the over
minecraft<00:02:28.709> but<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.040> not<00:02:29.220> as<00:02:29.400> big<00:02:29.670> but<00:02:29.819> it's

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
minecraft but it's not as big but it's

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.599 
minecraft but it's not as big but it's
still<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.239> really<00:02:30.810> fun<00:02:31.079> server<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:32.099> just<00:02:32.370> kind

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
still a really fun server to just kind

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.490 
still a really fun server to just kind
of<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:33.480> know<00:02:33.569> run<00:02:33.780> around<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.200> play<00:02:34.260> around

cool and then that's pretty much it for
this<00:02:50.519> server<00:02:50.879> guys<00:02:52.879> yeah<00:02:53.879> I<00:02:53.909> think<00:02:54.030> that's

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
this server guys yeah I think that's

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.339 
this server guys yeah I think that's
pretty<00:02:54.480> much<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:54.690> for<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:55.049> one<00:02:55.170> all<00:02:55.260> right

pretty much it for this one all right

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.270 
pretty much it for this one all right
coming<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.709> at<00:02:55.859> number<00:02:56.280> 2<00:02:57.379> we<00:02:58.379> have<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.650> hive

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
coming in at number 2 we have the hive

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.619 
coming in at number 2 we have the hive
server<00:02:59.549> now<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.790> hive<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.239> pretty<00:03:00.450> massive

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
server now the hive is a pretty massive

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.990 
server now the hive is a pretty massive
server<00:03:01.049> as<00:03:01.200> well<00:03:01.439> it<00:03:01.680> holds<00:03:01.829> twenty<00:03:02.489> thousand

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
server as well it holds twenty thousand

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.050 
server as well it holds twenty thousand
players<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:04.500> think<00:03:05.370> normally<00:03:05.849> there's

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
players I think normally there's

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.670 
players I think normally there's
probably<00:03:06.389> about<00:03:06.659> seven<00:03:07.109> thousand<00:03:07.500> players

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
probably about seven thousand players

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.990 
probably about seven thousand players
maybe<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.159> weekends<00:03:08.579> it<00:03:08.700> gets<00:03:08.819> up<00:03:08.970> to

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
maybe on the weekends it gets up to

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.449 
maybe on the weekends it gets up to
about<00:03:09.150> twelve<00:03:09.629> thousand<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:11.010> maps<00:03:11.220> on

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
about twelve thousand and the maps on

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.399 
about twelve thousand and the maps on

they use item boxes which is really

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.640 
they use item boxes which is really
interesting<00:03:17.579> because<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.810> can<00:03:19.079> kind<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.470> hide

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
interesting because you can kind of hide

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.500 
interesting because you can kind of hide
the<00:03:19.919> item<00:03:20.190> boxes<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.790> have<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.120> be<00:03:21.209> kind<00:03:21.419> of

skillful<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:22.049> find<00:03:22.290> them<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.669> then<00:03:23.669> you<00:03:23.819> can

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
skillful to find them and then you can

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.930 
skillful to find them and then you can
also<00:03:24.090> buy<00:03:24.389> packs<00:03:24.720> on<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.379> one<00:03:25.699> there's<00:03:26.699> also

also buy packs on this one there's also
like<00:03:27.239> assassin<00:03:27.840> packs<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:28.530> then<00:03:28.650> there's

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
like assassin packs and then there's

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.979 
like assassin packs and then there's
like<00:03:29.010> brute<00:03:29.430> packs<00:03:29.819> and<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.389> can<00:03:30.569> start<00:03:30.840> out

like brute packs and you can start out

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.009 
like brute packs and you can start out
with<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.709> gear<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.459> think<00:03:32.909> I'm<00:03:33.239> not<00:03:33.510> really<00:03:33.569> sure

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
with a gear I think I'm not really sure

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.409 
with a gear I think I'm not really sure
I<00:03:34.079> think<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.739> start<00:03:34.949> out<00:03:35.099> with<00:03:35.129> gear<00:03:35.579> but

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
I think you can start out with gear but

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.449 
I think you can start out with gear but
this<00:03:36.810> one<00:03:36.959> has<00:03:37.109> a<00:03:37.139> deathmatch<00:03:37.560> at<00:03:38.159> the<00:03:38.280> end

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
this one has a deathmatch at the end

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.069 
this one has a deathmatch at the end
which<00:03:38.699> is<00:03:38.849> really<00:03:39.150> cool<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.449> top<00:03:39.659> two<00:03:39.870> have

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
which is really cool the top two have

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.699 
which is really cool the top two have
death<00:03:40.349> matches<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.900> really<00:03:43.290> enjoy<00:03:43.560> the

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
death matches and I really enjoy the

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.800 
death matches and I really enjoy the
death<00:03:43.919> matches<00:03:44.159> because<00:03:44.639> you<00:03:44.760> can<00:03:44.909> get<00:03:45.120> get<00:03:45.780> to

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
death matches because you can get get to

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.420 
death matches because you can get get to
the<00:03:45.989> end<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.739> know<00:03:46.859> it's<00:03:47.010> kind<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.250> boring

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
the end and you know it's kind of boring

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.860 
the end and you know it's kind of boring
because<00:03:47.579> you<00:03:47.760> can't<00:03:47.940> find<00:03:48.150> anybody<00:03:48.419> so<00:03:48.750> they

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
because you can't find anybody so they

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.240 
because you can't find anybody so they
just<00:03:48.989> kind<00:03:49.169> of<00:03:49.229> plop<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.620> down<00:03:49.799> your<00:03:50.099> low

just kind of plop you down your low

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.280 
just kind of plop you down your low
arena<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.269> just<00:03:51.479> kind<00:03:51.659> of<00:03:51.720> fight<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.169> the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
arena and you just kind of fight to the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.920 
arena and you just kind of fight to the
death<00:03:52.319> so<00:03:52.859> death<00:03:53.329> matches<00:03:54.329> are<00:03:54.449> definitely<00:03:54.900> a

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
death so death matches are definitely a

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.270 
death so death matches are definitely a
plus<00:03:55.229> for<00:03:55.290> me<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.650> don't<00:03:55.919> know<00:03:55.979> if<00:03:56.069> you<00:03:56.159> guys

actually like that but they're

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.360 
actually like that but they're
definitely<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:58.139> plus<00:03:58.409> for<00:03:58.470> me<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:58.859> definitely
