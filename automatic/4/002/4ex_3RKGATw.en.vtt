is<00:03:59.070> going<00:03:59.730> to<00:04:00.090> use<00:04:00.450> up<00:04:01.790> carbohydrate<00:04:02.790> glycogen

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
is going to use up carbohydrate glycogen

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.710 
is going to use up carbohydrate glycogen
and<00:04:03.870> muscle<00:04:04.670> because<00:04:05.670> your<00:04:05.820> body<00:04:06.060> can't<00:04:06.450> fuel

workout<00:04:35.070> nutrition<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.820> my<00:04:36.350> supplement<00:04:37.639> what

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
workout nutrition and my supplement what

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.629 
workout nutrition and my supplement what
I<00:04:38.669> take<00:04:38.910> I<00:04:39.120> take<00:04:39.630> six<00:04:40.139> grams<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.620> omega-3s<00:04:41.400> a

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
I take I take six grams of omega-3s a

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.870 
I take I take six grams of omega-3s a
day<00:04:41.880> so<00:04:42.389> it's<00:04:42.539> like<00:04:42.770> 45<00:04:43.770> depending<00:04:44.370> on<00:04:44.669> how

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
day so it's like 45 depending on how

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.469 
day so it's like 45 depending on how
much<00:04:45.030> omega-3<00:04:45.630> s<00:04:46.910> research<00:04:47.910> shows<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.180> you

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
much omega-3 s research shows that you

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.800 
much omega-3 s research shows that you
increase<00:04:48.870> muscle<00:04:49.199> and<00:04:49.970> decrease<00:04:50.970> fat<00:04:51.270> just<00:04:51.690> by

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
increase muscle and decrease fat just by

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.950 
increase muscle and decrease fat just by
supplementing<00:04:52.080> those<00:04:52.530> without<00:04:53.280> a<00:04:54.180> change<00:04:54.600> in

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
supplementing those without a change in

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.080 
supplementing those without a change in
diet<00:04:55.289> or<00:04:55.380> exercise<00:04:55.490> so<00:04:56.490> there<00:04:56.639> you<00:04:56.669> go<00:04:56.759> plus

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
diet or exercise so there you go plus

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.960 
diet or exercise so there you go plus
has<00:04:57.270> cardiovascular<00:04:58.190> benefits<00:04:59.190> so<00:04:59.820> that's

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
has cardiovascular benefits so that's

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.000 
has cardiovascular benefits so that's
good<00:05:00.350> secondly<00:05:01.350> I<00:05:01.380> take<00:05:01.590> creatine

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
good secondly I take creatine

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.110 
good secondly I take creatine

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
how to take it the first five days you

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.050 
how to take it the first five days you
take<00:05:26.490> five<00:05:26.789> scoops<00:05:28.340> which<00:05:29.340> measures<00:05:29.729> out<00:05:29.880> to

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
take five scoops which measures out to

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.500 
take five scoops which measures out to
like<00:05:30.180> 25<00:05:30.630> grams<00:05:30.870> of<00:05:31.080> creatine<00:05:32.180> just<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.300> load

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
like 25 grams of creatine just to load

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.060 
like 25 grams of creatine just to load
it<00:05:33.690> and<00:05:33.780> then<00:05:34.020> after<00:05:34.260> that<00:05:34.380> you<00:05:34.530> only<00:05:34.680> need<00:05:34.860> two

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
it and then after that you only need two

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.860 
it and then after that you only need two
grams<00:05:35.340> per<00:05:35.610> day<00:05:35.760> which<00:05:35.910> is<00:05:36.030> a<00:05:36.060> half<00:05:36.300> scoop<00:05:36.570> you

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
grams per day which is a half scoop you

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.950 
grams per day which is a half scoop you
don't<00:05:37.020> have<00:05:37.139> to<00:05:37.260> cycle<00:05:37.500> off<00:05:37.710> of<00:05:37.889> it<00:05:38.010> so<00:05:38.960> yeah

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
don't have to cycle off of it so yeah

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.520 
don't have to cycle off of it so yeah
it's<00:05:40.380> really<00:05:40.530> good<00:05:40.800> creatine<00:05:41.729> is<00:05:42.530> probably

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
it's really good creatine is probably

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.409 
it's really good creatine is probably
the<00:05:43.740> most<00:05:43.919> research<00:05:44.340> supplement<00:05:44.909> besides

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
the most research supplement besides

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.510 
the most research supplement besides
whey<00:05:45.630> protein<00:05:46.050> and<00:05:46.580> it<00:05:47.580> works<00:05:47.849> so<00:05:48.659> take<00:05:49.409> that

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
whey protein and it works so take that

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.760 
whey protein and it works so take that
don't<00:05:50.520> be<00:05:50.639> taken<00:05:50.970> out<00:05:51.840> all<00:05:51.900> the<00:05:52.260> other<00:05:52.530> crap

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
don't be taken out all the other crap

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.510 
don't be taken out all the other crap
