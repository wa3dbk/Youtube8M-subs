 a super hint of twine that actually 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.880
 such as working with color adjustments and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.460
 images without leaving the string without 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.800
 use another program in the body direction 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.750
 Just that this tip I'll give you the most 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.890

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.760
 you learn to work with the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.340
 code tools for you to have 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.430
 a good result with them touch everything to 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.050
 artistic area the market area for 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.120
 a more student area does not 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.750

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.020

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.670

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.479
 the tools anyone coming back here to 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.340
 say is this how am I 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.920
 work with the image color of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.700
 bitmap without leaving the simple choreographer - 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.070
 bitmap click on the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.930
 image if you want to leave the image 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.479
 a little more saturated 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.150
 if you create a contrast here ó you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.830
 has temperature saturation dyes 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.869
 now I'll leave it for a little longer 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.680
 intense if you also found 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.020
 money 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.409
 look here will see that she some areas 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.049
 it already calculates already saturates if you want 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.880
 take a little more to cut it is 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.100
 working with color because the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.780
 color helps sell the product or service 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.490

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.799
 special with her 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.520

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.649
 always know dose right there to cut glare 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.610
 without very light magic to the dark you 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.540
 you can determine this setting is shadow 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.840
 if you have too much dark area you 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.920
 changes dark shadow she is adjusting 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.550

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.550
 at the time of the 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.620
 temperature since I did not mention it is for 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.959
 you leave the setting a little more 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.390
 né worked in a warmer color 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.300
