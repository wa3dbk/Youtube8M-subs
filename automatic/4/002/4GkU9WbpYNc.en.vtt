which<00:00:21.589> one<00:00:21.859> is<00:00:22.009> which<00:00:22.279> as<00:00:22.519> we<00:00:23.119> go<00:00:23.300> through<00:00:23.509> this

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
which one is which as we go through this

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.109 
which one is which as we go through this
lesson<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:25.220> first<00:00:25.249> property<00:00:25.999> the

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
lesson the first property the

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.050 
lesson the first property the
commutative<00:00:26.929> property<00:00:26.989> is<00:00:27.789> shown<00:00:28.789> like<00:00:28.819> this

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
commutative property is shown like this

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.440 
commutative property is shown like this
a<00:00:29.509> plus<00:00:29.899> B<00:00:30.109> plus<00:00:30.289> C<00:00:30.619> is<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.339> same<00:00:31.519> thing<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:32.119> plus

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
a plus B plus C is the same thing a plus

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.920 
a plus B plus C is the same thing a plus
C<00:00:32.689> plus<00:00:32.720> B<00:00:34.149> now<00:00:35.149> it's<00:00:35.329> kind<00:00:35.540> of<00:00:35.600> hard<00:00:35.810> to

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
C plus B now it's kind of hard to

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.630 
C plus B now it's kind of hard to
remember<00:00:36.200> unless<00:00:36.530> we<00:00:36.770> have<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:36.950> special<00:00:37.490> way<00:00:37.610> to

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
remember unless we have a special way to

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.880 
remember unless we have a special way to
remember<00:00:38.060> for<00:00:38.960> me<00:00:39.080> I<00:00:39.110> remember<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.710> word

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
remember for me I remember the word

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.890 
remember for me I remember the word
commute<00:00:40.430> if<00:00:40.940> you<00:00:41.090> have<00:00:41.180> ever<00:00:41.330> heard<00:00:41.540> that<00:00:41.690> word

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
commute if you have ever heard that word

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.750 
commute if you have ever heard that word
like<00:00:42.080> maybe<00:00:42.410> on<00:00:42.620> your<00:00:42.830> parents<00:00:43.190> commute<00:00:43.550> to

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
like maybe on your parents commute to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.090 
like maybe on your parents commute to
work<00:00:43.940> maybe<00:00:44.240> you<00:00:44.390> commute<00:00:44.810> to<00:00:44.840> school<00:00:45.290> means

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
work maybe you commute to school means

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.590 
work maybe you commute to school means
that<00:00:46.280> you<00:00:46.340> move<00:00:46.550> there<00:00:46.790> right<00:00:46.970> like<00:00:47.420> you'd

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
that you move there right like you'd

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.960 
that you move there right like you'd
ride<00:00:47.810> well<00:00:48.650> in<00:00:48.740> this<00:00:48.860> case<00:00:49.130> you<00:00:49.310> have<00:00:49.430> a<00:00:49.610> plus<00:00:49.940> B

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
ride well in this case you have a plus B

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.570 
ride well in this case you have a plus B
plus<00:00:50.330> C<00:00:50.450> you<00:00:51.350> have<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.590> same<00:00:51.830> exact<00:00:52.250> three

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
plus C you have the same exact three

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.850 
plus C you have the same exact three
numbers<00:00:52.940> only<00:00:53.150> they've<00:00:53.450> moved<00:00:53.780> around<00:00:54.290> right

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
numbers only they've moved around right

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.170 
numbers only they've moved around right
they've<00:00:55.040> gone<00:00:55.220> somewhere<00:00:55.520> else<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.000> B

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
they've gone somewhere else the B

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.520 
they've gone somewhere else the B
decided<00:00:56.750> it<00:00:56.870> was<00:00:56.990> going<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.230> go<00:00:57.320> to<00:00:57.380> the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
decided it was going to go to the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.710 
decided it was going to go to the
embassy<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:58.220> they<00:00:58.430> kind<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.670> switched<00:00:58.970> when

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
embassy and they kind of switched when

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.900 
embassy and they kind of switched when
you're<00:00:59.900> adding<00:01:00.170> numbers<00:01:00.620> together<00:01:00.980> it<00:01:01.460> does

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
you're adding numbers together it does

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.640 
you're adding numbers together it does
not<00:01:02.180> matter<00:01:02.510> if<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:03.110> move<00:01:03.320> them<00:01:03.500> around

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
not matter if you move them around

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.620 
not matter if you move them around
that's<00:01:04.159> basically<00:01:04.640> what<00:01:04.879> this<00:01:05.000> property<00:01:05.299> is

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
that's basically what this property is

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.779 
that's basically what this property is
saying<00:01:05.900> they<00:01:06.530> can<00:01:06.740> commute<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.280> wherever<00:01:07.460> they

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
saying they can commute to wherever they

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.399 
saying they can commute to wherever they
want<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.179> happen<00:01:08.450> whatever<00:01:08.749> order<00:01:09.259> you<00:01:09.289> want

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
want to happen whatever order you want

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.679 
want to happen whatever order you want
you're<00:01:10.039> done<00:01:10.249> that's<00:01:10.969> the<00:01:11.299> commutative

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
you're done that's the commutative

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.819 
you're done that's the commutative
property<00:01:13.359> another<00:01:14.359> addition<00:01:15.079> property<00:01:15.649> is

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
property another addition property is

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.940 
property another addition property is
the<00:01:16.460> associative<00:01:17.270> property<00:01:17.329> and<00:01:18.109> that<00:01:18.649> means

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
the associative property and that means

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.139 
the associative property and that means
that<00:01:19.670> it's<00:01:20.659> usually<00:01:21.229> shown<00:01:21.499> with<00:01:22.149> parentheses

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
that it's usually shown with parentheses

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.149 
that it's usually shown with parentheses
the<00:01:23.659> numbers<00:01:24.020> will<00:01:24.200> stay<00:01:24.439> in<00:01:24.499> the<00:01:24.619> same<00:01:24.829> order

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
the numbers will stay in the same order

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.349 
the numbers will stay in the same order
like<00:01:25.399> this<00:01:25.549> ABC<00:01:26.450> ABC<00:01:27.520> but<00:01:28.520> we're<00:01:28.670> choosing<00:01:28.969> in

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
like this ABC ABC but we're choosing in

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.719 
like this ABC ABC but we're choosing in
this<00:01:29.840> one<00:01:30.049> we're<00:01:30.200> adding<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:30.979> B<00:01:31.130> first<00:01:31.399> in

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
this one we're adding a and B first in

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.419 
this one we're adding a and B first in
this<00:01:31.969> side<00:01:32.179> we<00:01:32.869> could<00:01:33.049> add<00:01:33.229> B<00:01:33.469> and<00:01:33.619> C<00:01:33.799> first<00:01:34.159> in

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
this side we could add B and C first in

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.090 
this side we could add B and C first in
other<00:01:35.090> words<00:01:35.389> it<00:01:35.689> doesn't<00:01:36.590> matter<00:01:36.799> which

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
other words it doesn't matter which

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.580 
other words it doesn't matter which
order<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.609> add<00:01:37.789> them<00:01:38.060> largely<00:01:38.990> saying<00:01:39.409> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
order you add them largely saying the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.099 
order you add them largely saying the
same<00:01:39.799> thing<00:01:40.069> as<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.310> commutative<00:01:40.880> property

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
same thing as the commutative property

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.840 
same thing as the commutative property
only<00:01:42.109> with<00:01:42.289> this<00:01:42.499> one<00:01:42.770> you're<00:01:43.579> using

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
only with this one you're using

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.149 
only with this one you're using
parentheses<00:01:44.600> or<00:01:44.810> grouping<00:01:44.840> symbols<00:01:45.799> of<00:01:45.950> some

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
parentheses or grouping symbols of some

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.660 
parentheses or grouping symbols of some
sort<00:01:46.429> and<00:01:47.170> you're<00:01:48.189> associating<00:01:49.189> these<00:01:49.399> two

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
sort and you're associating these two

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.489 
sort and you're associating these two
together<00:01:49.999> first<00:01:50.359> or<00:01:50.719> in<00:01:50.959> this<00:01:51.049> case<00:01:51.259> you're

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:51.499 
together first or in this case you're

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:53.469 
together first or in this case you're
associating<00:01:52.159> these<00:01:52.310> ones<00:01:52.549> together<00:01:52.729> first<00:01:53.149> I

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
associating these ones together first I

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.569 
associating these ones together first I
like<00:01:54.049> in<00:01:54.229> school<00:01:54.560> all<00:01:55.009> right<00:01:55.100> these<00:01:55.310> same

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
like in school all right these same

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.120 
like in school all right these same
three<00:01:55.909> girls<00:01:56.240> maybe<00:01:56.479> next<00:01:56.779> time<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:57.229> girl<00:01:57.920> in

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
three girls maybe next time this girl in

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.339 
three girls maybe next time this girl in
blue<00:01:58.310> is<00:01:58.369> going<00:01:58.549> to<00:01:58.609> be<00:01:58.670> talking<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:59.090> her<00:01:59.349> right

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
blue is going to be talking to her right

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.919 
blue is going to be talking to her right
so<00:02:00.979> but<00:02:01.819> this<00:02:01.969> time<00:02:02.240> they're<00:02:02.509> talking

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
so but this time they're talking

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.289 
so but this time they're talking
together<00:02:03.249> right<00:02:04.249> maybe<00:02:04.609> a<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.029> B<00:02:05.119> are<00:02:05.240> a

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
together right maybe a and B are a

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.239 
together right maybe a and B are a
little<00:02:05.420> bit<00:02:05.659> snobby<00:02:05.929> today<00:02:06.319> I<00:02:06.349> don't<00:02:06.529> know<00:02:06.799> but

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
little bit snobby today I don't know but

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:10.480 
little bit snobby today I don't know but
either<00:02:07.429> way<00:02:07.759> they're<00:02:08.470> associating<00:02:09.490> with

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
either way they're associating with

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.700 
either way they're associating with
different<00:02:10.970> numbers<00:02:11.300> first<00:02:11.780> in<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.560> end

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
different numbers first in the end

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.900 
different numbers first in the end
you're<00:02:12.890> going<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.130> get<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.430> same<00:02:13.670> result

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
you're going to get the same result

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.480 
you're going to get the same result
that's<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.660> associative<00:02:16.200> property<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
that's the associative property and the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.660 
that's the associative property and the
property<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:18.000> equality<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:19.070> whatever<00:02:20.070> you

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
property of equality is whatever you

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.250 
property of equality is whatever you
have<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.300> side<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.720> equal<00:02:22.020> sign<00:02:22.050> you

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
have on one side of the equal sign you

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.770 
have on one side of the equal sign you
have<00:02:22.590> on<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.890> other<00:02:22.940> so<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.240> case<00:02:24.510> we

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
have on the other so in this case we

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.400 
have on the other so in this case we
added<00:02:25.260> one<00:02:25.530> we<00:02:25.980> had<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.340> equals<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.810> added<00:02:28.200> one

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
added one we had a equals a we added one

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.560 
added one we had a equals a we added one
to<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.830> left<00:02:29.160> side<00:02:29.370> we<00:02:29.640> add<00:02:29.790> one<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> right

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
to the left side we add one to the right

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.810 
to the left side we add one to the right
side<00:02:30.900> I've<00:02:31.440> heard<00:02:31.710> it<00:02:31.830> called<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.130> monkey-see

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
side I've heard it called the monkey-see

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.330 
side I've heard it called the monkey-see
monkey-do<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.720> property<00:02:34.380> whatever<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.130> do<00:02:35.220> to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
monkey-do of property whatever you do to

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.520 
monkey-do of property whatever you do to
one<00:02:35.370> side<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:35.940> do<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.330> other<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:37.230> want<00:02:37.410> to

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
one side and do to the other you want to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.200 
one side and do to the other you want to
subtract<00:02:38.010> six<00:02:38.310> from<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.670> side<00:02:38.910> go<00:02:39.180> ahead

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
subtract six from this side go ahead

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.210 
subtract six from this side go ahead
just<00:02:39.690> make<00:02:39.900> sure<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.170> subtract<00:02:40.620> 6<00:02:40.890> from<00:02:40.950> that

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
just make sure to subtract 6 from that

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.810 
just make sure to subtract 6 from that
side<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:42.150> want<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.420> multiply<00:02:42.600> 8<00:02:43.260> times<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.950> go

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
side you want to multiply 8 times a go

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.820 
side you want to multiply 8 times a go
for<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.360> just<00:02:45.570> make<00:02:45.750> sure<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.050> multiply<00:02:46.530> 8

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
for it just make sure to multiply 8

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.800 
for it just make sure to multiply 8
times<00:02:46.860> both<00:02:47.550> sides<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.270> equal<00:02:48.630> sign

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
times both sides of the equal sign

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.680 
times both sides of the equal sign
that's<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.650> property<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.190> equality<00:02:50.690> all

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
that's the property of equality all

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.510 
that's the property of equality all
right<00:02:51.840> whatever<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.230> do<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.500> one<00:02:52.530> side<00:02:52.710> you<00:02:53.220> do

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
right whatever you do to one side you do

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.540 
right whatever you do to one side you do
to<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.670> other<00:02:54.080> there<00:02:55.080> are<00:02:55.260> some<00:02:55.590> subgroups<00:02:56.340> of

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
to the other there are some subgroups of

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.310 
to the other there are some subgroups of
the<00:02:56.610> property<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.210> equality<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.990> I<00:02:58.020> want<00:02:58.230> to

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
the property of equality and I want to

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.430 
the property of equality and I want to
talk<00:02:58.500> about<00:02:58.740> but<00:02:59.750> largely<00:03:00.750> they're<00:03:01.050> going<00:03:01.320> to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
talk about but largely they're going to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.920 
talk about but largely they're going to
follow<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.950> same<00:03:02.190> rules<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:03.420> reflective

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
follow the same rules the reflective

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.540 
follow the same rules the reflective
property<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.560> just<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:05.070> know<00:03:05.130> when<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.400> have

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
property is just you know when you have

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.120 
property is just you know when you have
something<00:03:06.000> it's<00:03:06.120> reflected<00:03:06.750> exactly<00:03:07.350> on<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
something it's reflected exactly on the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.680 
something it's reflected exactly on the
other<00:03:08.250> side<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.880> equals<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.970> symmetric

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
other side a equals a the symmetric

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.920 
other side a equals a the symmetric
property<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.890> if<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.250> equals<00:03:14.940> B<00:03:15.030> then<00:03:15.540> B

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
property is that if a equals B then B

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.830 
property is that if a equals B then B
also<00:03:16.740> equals<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.670> can<00:03:17.940> switch<00:03:18.330> if

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
also equals a so you can switch if

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.300 
also equals a so you can switch if
you've<00:03:19.050> got<00:03:19.260> something<00:03:19.650> on<00:03:19.740> one<00:03:19.950> side<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.250> the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
you've got something on one side of the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.770 
you've got something on one side of the
equal<00:03:20.640> sign<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:20.880> something<00:03:21.480> on<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.690> other

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
equal sign and something on the other

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.500 
equal sign and something on the other
side<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.200> can<00:03:22.380> kind<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.710> switch<00:03:22.980> there<00:03:23.510> them

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
side you can kind of switch there them

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.760 
side you can kind of switch there them
and<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.810> doesn't<00:03:25.110> matter<00:03:25.230> if<00:03:25.410> they're<00:03:25.530> on<00:03:25.650> the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
and it doesn't matter if they're on the

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.580 
and it doesn't matter if they're on the
right<00:03:25.920> or<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.100> left<00:03:26.340> all<00:03:27.210> right<00:03:27.270> so<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.110> you

right or the left all right so that you

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.680 
right or the left all right so that you

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.010 
can just switch them back and forth to
either<00:03:45.720> side<00:03:46.080> of<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.320> equal<00:03:46.620> sign<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:48.020> then

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
either side of the equal sign and then

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.600 
either side of the equal sign and then
there's<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.380> transitive<00:03:50.010> property<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.550> this

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
there's the transitive property and this

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.820 
there's the transitive property and this
one<00:03:50.820> here<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.300> think<00:03:51.570> needs<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.230> little<00:03:52.470> bit<00:03:52.620> more

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
one here I think needs a little bit more

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.320 
one here I think needs a little bit more
explanation<00:03:53.130> on<00:03:54.020> if<00:03:55.020> a<00:03:55.940> is<00:03:56.940> equal<00:03:57.300> to

explanation on if a is equal to

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.720 
explanation on if a is equal to
something<00:03:57.750> we'll<00:03:58.740> call<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.040> be<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.490> a<00:03:59.670> it

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
something we'll call it be it a it

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.090 
something we'll call it be it a it
equals<00:04:00.270> something<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.380> same<00:04:01.740> something

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
equals something and that same something

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.640 
equals something and that same something
is<00:04:02.490> equal<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.910> C<00:04:03.150> then<00:04:03.660> you<00:04:03.810> can<00:04:03.990> eliminate<00:04:04.260> the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
is equal to C then you can eliminate the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.550 
is equal to C then you can eliminate the
middleman<00:04:04.950> here<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.490> B<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.140> just<00:04:07.140> say<00:04:07.380> that

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
middleman here of B and just say that

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.620 
middleman here of B and just say that
the<00:04:07.770> first<00:04:08.160> number<00:04:08.610> is<00:04:08.850> equal<00:04:09.240> to<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.450> last

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
the first number is equal to the last

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.680 
the first number is equal to the last
number<00:04:10.020> again<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.830> is<00:04:11.040> used<00:04:11.430> in<00:04:11.730> proof<00:04:12.209> when

you're<00:04:12.870> trying<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.170> prove<00:04:13.350> something<00:04:13.410> you'll

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
you're trying to prove something you'll

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.699 
you're trying to prove something you'll
use<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.490> transitive<00:04:15.120> property<00:04:15.150> on<00:04:15.870> occasion

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.470 
use the transitive property on occasion
I'll<00:04:17.130> show<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.489> some<00:04:17.700> examples<00:04:17.730> of<00:04:18.330> these

we've<00:04:23.669> talked<00:04:23.970> about<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:25.860> property<00:04:26.340> that

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
we've talked about the property that

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.500 
we've talked about the property that
says<00:04:26.700> a<00:04:26.940> plus<00:04:27.419> B

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
C is equal to a plus B plus C and just

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.270 
C is equal to a plus B plus C and just
decide<00:04:32.260> to<00:04:32.470> put<00:04:32.650> parentheses<00:04:33.250> around

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
decide to put parentheses around

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.450 
decide to put parentheses around

plus<00:04:44.590> three<00:04:44.800> this<00:04:45.760> actually<00:04:46.420> this<00:04:46.660> one<00:04:46.930> here

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
plus three this actually this one here

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.000 
plus three this actually this one here
is<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:48.070> little<00:04:48.220> bit<00:04:48.400> more<00:04:48.610> practical<00:04:49.090> because

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
is a little bit more practical because

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.470 
is a little bit more practical because
when<00:04:51.010> you're<00:04:51.160> adding<00:04:51.340> three<00:04:51.880> numbers<00:04:52.240> in<00:04:52.390> a

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
when you're adding three numbers in a

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.540 
when you're adding three numbers in a
row<00:04:52.630> maybe<00:04:52.930> you'd<00:04:53.170> add<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.770> ones<00:04:53.980> that<00:04:54.250> add<00:04:54.490> up

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
row maybe you'd add the ones that add up

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.500 
row maybe you'd add the ones that add up
to<00:04:55.000> 10

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
to 10

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.910 
to 10
right<00:04:55.930> 7<00:04:56.830> +<00:04:56.950> 3<00:04:57.160> is<00:04:57.280> 10<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:58.450> +<00:04:58.690> 4<00:04:58.900> is<00:04:58.930> 14<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.770> might

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
right 7 + 3 is 10 and + 4 is 14 it might

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.360 
right 7 + 3 is 10 and + 4 is 14 it might
be<00:05:00.040> easier<00:05:00.460> than<00:05:00.580> saying<00:05:00.880> 4<00:05:01.540> plus<00:05:01.780> 7<00:05:01.990> is<00:05:02.380> 11<00:05:02.680> 11

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
be easier than saying 4 plus 7 is 11 11

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.240 
be easier than saying 4 plus 7 is 11 11
plus<00:05:03.730> 3<00:05:04.000> is<00:05:04.090> 14<00:05:04.630> might<00:05:05.230> be<00:05:05.380> easier<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.890> put

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
plus 3 is 14 might be easier to put

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.280 
plus 3 is 14 might be easier to put
these<00:05:06.460> ones<00:05:06.700> together<00:05:07.030> first<00:05:07.420> alright<00:05:08.140> this

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
these ones together first alright this

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.040 
these ones together first alright this
will<00:05:08.440> be<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.590> practical<00:05:09.280> use<00:05:09.310> of<00:05:09.850> the<00:05:10.060> property

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
will be a practical use of the property

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.530 
will be a practical use of the property
and<00:05:11.380> it<00:05:11.710> is<00:05:11.980> the<00:05:12.220> associative<00:05:12.910> property<00:05:13.510> of

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
and it is the associative property of

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.960 
and it is the associative property of
addition

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
addition

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.030 
addition
alright<00:05:15.970> here's<00:05:16.270> an<00:05:16.450> a<00:05:16.630> property<00:05:17.200> that<00:05:17.230> says<00:05:17.530> 3

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
alright here's an a property that says 3

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.450 
alright here's an a property that says 3
equals<00:05:18.490> 3<00:05:18.600> if<00:05:19.600> we<00:05:19.720> add<00:05:19.900> 4<00:05:20.260> to<00:05:20.380> that<00:05:20.410> 3<00:05:20.860> plus<00:05:21.070> 4<00:05:21.310> on

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
equals 3 if we add 4 to that 3 plus 4 on

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.610 
equals 3 if we add 4 to that 3 plus 4 on
this<00:05:21.580> side<00:05:21.640> we're<00:05:22.060> going<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.300> add<00:05:22.480> 3<00:05:23.200> equals<00:05:23.440> 4

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
this side we're going to add 3 equals 4

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
this side we're going to add 3 equals 4
on<00:05:23.800> that<00:05:23.950> side<00:05:24.300> equals<00:05:25.300> 4<00:05:25.480> 3<00:05:25.660> plus<00:05:25.840> 4<00:05:26.280> we<00:05:27.280> have<00:05:27.400> 2

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
on that side equals 4 3 plus 4 we have 2

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.890 
on that side equals 4 3 plus 4 we have 2
times<00:05:27.970> X<00:05:28.240> is<00:05:28.650> equal<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:29.980> 2<00:05:30.190> times<00:05:30.460> X<00:05:30.700> let's<00:05:31.630> say

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
times X is equal to 2 times X let's say

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.160 
times X is equal to 2 times X let's say
we<00:05:32.050> wanted<00:05:32.350> to<00:05:32.410> divide<00:05:33.220> this<00:05:33.820> side<00:05:34.090> by<00:05:34.150> X<00:05:34.600> we'd

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
we wanted to divide this side by X we'd

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.770 
we wanted to divide this side by X we'd
also<00:05:35.500> divide<00:05:35.830> this<00:05:36.100> side<00:05:36.340> by<00:05:36.400> X<00:05:36.820> all<00:05:37.720> right

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
also divide this side by X all right

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.690 
also divide this side by X all right
that's<00:05:38.140> the<00:05:38.260> property<00:05:38.620> of<00:05:38.710> equality<00:05:39.130> whatever

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
that's the property of equality whatever

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.250 
that's the property of equality whatever
you<00:05:39.940> turn<00:05:40.090> one<00:05:40.210> side<00:05:40.420> of<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.660> equal<00:05:41.020> sign<00:05:41.050> you

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
you turn one side of the equal sign you

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.350 
1 right when you're adding them together
you<00:06:02.140> can<00:06:02.170> commute<00:06:02.980> them<00:06:03.310> to<00:06:03.640> different<00:06:04.030> places

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
you can commute them to different places

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.290 
you can commute them to different places
this<00:06:05.020> is<00:06:05.260> the<00:06:05.290> commutative<00:06:06.070> property<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:09.300> the

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
this is the commutative property and the

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.180 
this is the commutative property and the
final<00:06:10.780> property<00:06:11.050> that<00:06:11.440> we're<00:06:11.620> going<00:06:11.800> to<00:06:11.920> look

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
final property that we're going to look

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.900 
final property that we're going to look
at<00:06:12.400> is<00:06:12.640> if<00:06:13.570> x<00:06:13.930> equals<00:06:14.410> 4<00:06:14.830> and<00:06:15.540> 4<00:06:16.540> is<00:06:16.750> equal<00:06:17.140> to<00:06:17.320> Y

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
at is if x equals 4 and 4 is equal to Y

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.700 
at is if x equals 4 and 4 is equal to Y
then<00:06:18.910> X<00:06:19.210> is<00:06:19.780> equal<00:06:20.470> to<00:06:20.650> Y<00:06:20.860> you<00:06:21.360> see<00:06:22.360> that<00:06:22.600> if<00:06:22.840> a

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
then X is equal to Y you see that if a

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.380 
then X is equal to Y you see that if a
equals<00:06:24.400> 6<00:06:24.730> and<00:06:25.110> 6<00:06:26.110> equals<00:06:26.710> B<00:06:27.010> and<00:06:27.250> a<00:06:27.700> is<00:06:28.210> the

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
equals 6 and 6 equals B and a is the

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.450 
equals 6 and 6 equals B and a is the

same exact thing as B they're both equal

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.730 
same exact thing as B they're both equal
to<00:06:30.490> 6<00:06:30.820> right<00:06:31.630> they're<00:06:31.840> both<00:06:31.990> equal<00:06:32.470> to<00:06:32.500> each

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
to 6 right they're both equal to each

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.030 
to 6 right they're both equal to each
other

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040
