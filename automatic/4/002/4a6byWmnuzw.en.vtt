the<00:02:29.610> sculpt<00:02:30.120> mode<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:32.330> came<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:35.270> you<00:02:36.270> know

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
the sculpt mode and came in and you know

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.120 
the sculpt mode and came in and you know
put<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> sculpt<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.200> moat<00:02:37.350> around<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.770> rocks

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
put the sculpt a moat around the rocks

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.460 
put the sculpt a moat around the rocks
but<00:02:38.610> I'm<00:02:39.210> kind<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.720> did<00:02:39.930> something<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.410> little

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470

with you guys here let me go to an

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.860 
with you guys here let me go to an
unfinished<00:02:45.030> section<00:02:45.720> here<00:02:45.960> as<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.890> can<00:02:47.130> see<00:02:47.460> I

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
unfinished section here as you can see I

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.890 
unfinished section here as you can see I
used<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.440> great<00:02:50.070> stuff<00:02:50.490> foam<00:02:50.970> behind<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
used that great stuff foam behind the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.160 
used that great stuff foam behind the
rock<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:53.370> then<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.670> stuck<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.390> rock<00:02:54.600> end<00:02:54.960> of

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
rock and then I stuck the rock end of

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.010 
rock and then I stuck the rock end of
the<00:02:55.290> foam<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:56.160> after<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.940> expanded<00:02:57.900> it

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
the foam and after it expanded it

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.080 
the foam and after it expanded it
expanded<00:02:58.650> out<00:02:58.800> over<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.340> rock<00:02:59.580> and<00:02:59.850> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
expanded out over the rock and the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.290 
expanded out over the rock and the
actual<00:03:00.930> rock<00:03:01.710> from<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.010> hydrocal<00:03:02.700> molds<00:03:03.270> that

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
actual rock from the hydrocal molds that

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.450 
actual rock from the hydrocal molds that
I<00:03:03.450> made<00:03:03.810> actually<00:03:04.380> stuck<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.920> great<00:03:07.920> that

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
I made actually stuck to the great that

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.420 
I made actually stuck to the great that
great<00:03:08.640> foam<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.390> expanding<00:03:10.020> foam<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.950> then

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
great foam the expanding foam and then

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.960 
great foam the expanding foam and then
what<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:11.940> did<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.870> after<00:03:13.740> that<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.280> went<00:03:14.820> ahead

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
what I did is after that I went ahead

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.470 
what I did is after that I went ahead
and<00:03:15.180> just<00:03:16.010> sculpt<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.130> moat<00:03:17.340> around<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:18.150> rock

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
and just sculpt a moat around the rock

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.540 
and just sculpt a moat around the rock
so<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:18.989> looks<00:03:19.230> like<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.620> all<00:03:19.800> blends<00:03:20.220> together

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
so it looks like it all blends together

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.060 
so it looks like it all blends together
as<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.480> can<00:03:21.510> see<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:23.430> once<00:03:24.239> I<00:03:24.480> do<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.530> washing

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
as you can see so once I do the washing

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.560 
as you can see so once I do the washing
and<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.940> rock<00:03:27.209> color<00:03:28.010> I'm<00:03:29.010> hoping<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.970> end<00:03:30.209> up

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
and the rock color I'm hoping to end up

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.710 
and the rock color I'm hoping to end up
with<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.989> same<00:03:31.260> color<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.459> rock<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.300> I<00:03:33.330> have

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
with the same color of rock that I have

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.770 
with the same color of rock that I have
here<00:03:34.260> I'll<00:03:35.250> do<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.580> same<00:03:35.850> mixture<00:03:36.300> so<00:03:36.720> it

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
here I'll do the same mixture so it

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
here I'll do the same mixture so it
should<00:03:36.989> look<00:03:37.020> pretty<00:03:37.680> good<00:03:39.110> now<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.170> go<00:03:40.560> back

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
should look pretty good now to go back

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.430 
should look pretty good now to go back
down<00:03:41.190> here<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.640> see<00:03:42.030> what<00:03:42.300> is<00:03:42.450> going<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.930> be<00:03:43.170> in

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
down here to see what is going to be in

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.190 
down here to see what is going to be in
this<00:03:43.620> section<00:03:44.010> well<00:03:44.910> here<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.510> thought<00:03:45.959> of

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
this section well here I thought of

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.870 
this section well here I thought of
bringing<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:46.830> lake<00:03:47.160> out<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.610> then<00:03:47.730> I

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
bringing this lake out and then I

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.680 
bringing this lake out and then I
thought<00:03:48.239> of<00:03:48.570> running<00:03:49.020> a<00:03:49.230> river<00:03:50.209> along<00:03:51.209> this

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
thought of running a river along this

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.310 
thought of running a river along this
rock<00:03:52.050> face<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:53.150> then<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.300> trap<00:03:54.660> along<00:03:55.050> the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
rock face and then the trap along the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.070 
rock face and then the trap along the
river<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.950> then<00:03:56.610> on<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.060> outside<00:03:57.600> of<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:57.840> I'm

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
river and then on the outside of it I'm

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.979 
river and then on the outside of it I'm
thinking<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.860> putting<00:03:59.070> this<00:03:59.430> barn<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.510> have

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
thinking of putting this barn I have

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.800 
thinking of putting this barn I have
here<00:04:01.500> with<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.610> silo<00:04:02.910> as<00:04:03.300> you<00:04:03.450> can<00:04:03.630> see<00:04:03.780> I

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
here with the silo as you can see I

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.770 
here with the silo as you can see I
built<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.800> then<00:04:05.610> also<00:04:06.270> did<00:04:06.660> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
built it and then also did the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.000 
built it and then also did the
weathering<00:04:07.320> of<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:08.850> barn<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.480> then<00:04:10.230> back<00:04:10.590> in

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
weathering of the barn and then back in

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.080 
weathering of the barn and then back in
the<00:04:11.280> corner<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:12.209> am<00:04:12.870> gonna<00:04:13.290> build<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:14.090> mountain

the corner I am gonna build a mountain
there<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.680> am<00:04:16.799> gonna<00:04:17.070> put<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.609> farmhouse

as you see there's a farmhouse they did

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.240 
as you see there's a farmhouse they did
some<00:04:20.609> weathering<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.359> too<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:22.289> built<00:04:23.010> all

some weathering of that too I built all
of<00:04:23.280> this<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.539> took<00:04:24.750> me<00:04:25.020> a<00:04:25.050> little<00:04:25.289> bit<00:04:25.620> but
