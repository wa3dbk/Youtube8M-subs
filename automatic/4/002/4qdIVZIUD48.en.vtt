and it kinda winch and Cole on it we

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.570 
and it kinda winch and Cole on it we
talked<00:01:53.080> about<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.500> specialized<00:01:54.100> steering

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580

these<00:01:54.790> rock<00:01:55.030> trucks<00:01:55.360> have<00:01:55.600> basically<00:01:56.440> they're

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
these rock trucks have basically they're

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.680 
these rock trucks have basically they're
an<00:01:56.920> articulating<00:01:57.670> commander<00:01:58.149> truck

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
an articulating commander truck

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.100 
an articulating commander truck
so<00:01:59.290> when<00:01:59.440> layman<00:01:59.890> terms<00:02:00.190> that<00:02:00.460> means<00:02:00.729> this<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
so when layman terms that means this the

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.170 
so when layman terms that means this the
front<00:02:02.409> end<00:02:02.590> can<00:02:02.830> move<00:02:03.130> while<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.580> back<00:02:03.909> end

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180

remains<00:02:04.479> stationary<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:06.130> bed<00:02:06.340> is<00:02:06.580> you<00:02:06.850> know

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
remains stationary the bed is you know

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.999 
remains stationary the bed is you know
on<00:02:07.119> Seidner<00:02:07.600> articulates<00:02:08.470> on<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.769> front

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
on Seidner articulates on the front

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.680 
on Seidner articulates on the front
sides<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.489> cabs<00:02:09.729> like<00:02:10.000> this<00:02:10.239> right<00:02:10.450> so

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
sides of the cabs like this right so

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.630 
sides of the cabs like this right so
turned<00:02:11.200> like<00:02:11.380> this<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.739> was<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.920> bed<00:02:12.220> this<00:02:12.430> way

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
turned like this it was a bed this way

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.170
