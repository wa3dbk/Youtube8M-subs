nice<00:00:37.150> well<00:00:37.630> okay<00:00:37.960> so<00:00:38.020> what<00:00:38.590> was<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:38.860> hardest

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
nice well okay so what was the hardest

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.840

answer<00:00:39.700> to<00:00:39.940> you<00:00:40.090> or<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:41.410> learn<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:44.730> think<00:00:45.730> it's

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
answer to you or to learn I think it's

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.090

good<00:00:46.390> amount<00:00:46.780> of<00:00:46.870> it<00:00:46.989> was<00:00:47.200> kind<00:00:47.680> of<00:00:47.800> hard<00:00:48.010> to

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
good amount of it was kind of hard to

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.319 
good amount of it was kind of hard to
learn<00:00:48.250> just<00:00:48.610> because<00:00:48.790> a<00:00:48.820> whole<00:00:49.000> bunch<00:00:49.180> of<00:00:49.270> the

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
learn just because a whole bunch of the

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.270 
learn just because a whole bunch of the
movie<00:00:49.570> is<00:00:49.660> actually<00:00:49.809> partner<00:00:50.440> work<00:00:50.620> for<00:00:51.220> like
