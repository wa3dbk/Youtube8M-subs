00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 people that it's time that one ottawa 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.440
 nautical and cruise to stroll here 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.360
 today the deal will take a little tip 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.530
 there the distance will decrease from here 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.920
 little pipe 4 when finished is a taste of 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.599
 to see 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.029
 sometimes it feels like when the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.730
 cruise is at a better time of the game 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.010
 that neither the Brazilian team that is a team 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.039
 who is playing the championship has no 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.930
 a mixture of modesty and a part 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.580
 mixed with armory outside 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.219
 that played as mauro put in the blog 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.100
 another day and 43 seconds playing the ball 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.070
 with go seems a little barcelona looks 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.670
 there is a bayern from Munich going straight and 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.040
 will count on speed because he 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.960
 it's very different from the others you say 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.000
 compare the performance of the cruise with 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.920
 performances that I wake up an example came 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.860
 to be only in the example of Basque and 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.079
 flamengo who had brasilia is another 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.820
 nursery seems to have had the planet 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.199
 cruise 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.090
 if you compare with the classic of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.570
 million once old classic 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.399
 millions 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.140
 besides the classic that brought together the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.990
 public of the round 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.030
 then the cruise tastes good enough that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.770
 has a team that gives pleasure because the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.840
 others are not giving this taste 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.479
 especially the teams on the Rio de 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.729
 January and the São Paulo teams 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.009
 no sir taking the Portuguese with a 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.869
 20 times on girl's championship 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.759
 São Paulo team this reaction of the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.110
 who will make the second round and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.840
 bright return 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.579
 Besides, my people are the championship more 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.820
 exciting story of all time 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.590
 not by the title they have already defended by 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.159
 everything that is happening that can give 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.070
 anything is so jammed so 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.229
 confused so little apart from one another 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.579
 What do you say the Flemish will fall? 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.140
 it's not outrageous 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.040
 but if you say that Flemish can 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.220
 staying in the g4 is very far almost 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.200
 It may happen I'll tell you what the saints 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.939
 can stay in the liberators want to have 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.549
 chance of having more places for the 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.950
 athletic champion of the brazilian cup is 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.719
 possible the saints may fall 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.100
 it is very difficult but who knows 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.180
 corinthians also because of the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.310
 Corinthians is a team that has a 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.910
 supporter here at the table you want can 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.910
 fall can
