to<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.900> extra<00:01:22.890> crane<00:01:23.880> build<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.930> course<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
to the extra crane build of course you

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.460 
to the extra crane build of course you
get<00:01:25.460> instructions<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.150> set<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.869> so

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
get instructions in the set for this so

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.960 
get instructions in the set for this so
you<00:01:28.560> don't<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.979> look<00:01:29.189> everywhere<00:01:29.430> around

to<00:01:30.930> figure<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.259> how<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.409> build<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.829> it's

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
to figure out how to build this it's

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.920 
to figure out how to build this it's
right<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> box<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.119> really<00:01:33.420> nice<00:01:33.630> from

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
right in the box so really nice from

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.069 
right in the box so really nice from
Lego<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:36.840> been<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
Lego to do that so this is just been a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.230 
Lego to do that so this is just been a
quick<00:01:37.350> overview<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.070> extra<00:01:38.759> build<00:01:39.000> of

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
quick overview of the extra build of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.760 
quick overview of the extra build of
course<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.600> said<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.869> will<00:01:40.110> probably<00:01:40.380> be

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
course I said I will probably be

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.679 
course I said I will probably be
inserting<00:01:41.340> these<00:01:41.460> into<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:42.119> Technic<00:01:42.450> builds

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
inserting these into the Technic builds

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.749 
inserting these into the Technic builds
from<00:01:42.810> now<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.399> don't<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.670> to

from now on so that you don't have to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.389 
from now on so that you don't have to
watch<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.270> extra<00:01:45.780> little<00:01:45.810> video<00:01:46.350> real<00:01:47.130> short

watch this extra little video real short

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.539 
watch this extra little video real short
video<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.060> figure<00:01:48.450> out<00:01:48.630> whether<00:01:49.470> or<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:49.860> it's

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
video to figure out whether or not it's

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.210 
video to figure out whether or not it's
worth<00:01:50.880> building<00:01:51.630> as<00:01:51.899> well<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.860> definitely

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
worth building as well so definitely

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.609 
worth building as well so definitely
worth<00:01:53.369> building<00:01:53.640> as<00:01:53.880> well<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.110> me<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
worth building as well this is me the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.000 
worth building as well this is me the
doctor<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:56.700> signing<00:01:57.180> out

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010
