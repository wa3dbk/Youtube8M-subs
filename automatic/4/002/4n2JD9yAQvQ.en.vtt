00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
gamertag if you already know what that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.940 
gamertag if you already know what that
is<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:20.960> I'm<00:01:21.960> very<00:01:22.170> unlikely<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.710> read<00:01:22.830> it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
is and I'm very unlikely to read it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.649 
is and I'm very unlikely to read it
though<00:01:23.070> because<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.520> 300<00:01:24.150> messages<00:01:24.270> now

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
though because I have 300 messages now

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.740 
though because I have 300 messages now
so<00:01:25.409> um<00:01:25.710> yeah<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.880> probably<00:01:27.330> shouldn't

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
so um yeah I probably shouldn't

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.929 
so um yeah I probably shouldn't
publicize<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.229> gamertag<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:30.200> anyway<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.579> yeah
