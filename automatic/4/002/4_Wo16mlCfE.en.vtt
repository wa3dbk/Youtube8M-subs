00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.130 

okay<00:00:24.759> I'm<00:00:24.880> really<00:00:25.090> excited<00:00:25.419> to<00:00:25.689> teach<00:00:25.869> you<00:00:26.050> the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
okay I'm really excited to teach you the

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.720 
okay I'm really excited to teach you the
speed<00:00:26.439> I<00:00:26.619> think<00:00:26.919> it<00:00:27.040> will<00:00:27.160> help<00:00:27.309> you<00:00:27.489> out<00:00:27.550> in

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
speed I think it will help you out in

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.479 
speed I think it will help you out in
four<00:00:28.630> way<00:00:28.840> independence<00:00:29.529> as<00:00:29.770> well<00:00:29.950> as<00:00:30.130> speed

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
four way independence as well as speed

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.690 
four way independence as well as speed
and<00:00:30.669> endurance<00:00:31.890> now<00:00:32.890> think<00:00:33.130> of<00:00:33.219> this<00:00:33.399> drum

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
and endurance now think of this drum

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.819 
and endurance now think of this drum
beat<00:00:33.879> in<00:00:34.030> two<00:00:34.270> parts<00:00:34.719> I'll<00:00:35.020> demonstrate<00:00:35.410> the

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
beat in two parts I'll demonstrate the

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:51.140 
beat in two parts I'll demonstrate the
first<00:00:36.100> part<00:00:36.340> then<00:00:36.790> the<00:00:36.970> second<00:00:37.330> part

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:01:06.650 

when<00:00:52.150> we<00:00:52.270> put<00:00:52.480> them<00:00:52.660> together<00:00:52.810> we<00:00:53.350> get<00:00:53.530> this<00:00:53.830> I

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.180 

really<00:01:07.660> like<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.960> second<00:01:08.380> half<00:01:08.590> of<00:01:08.770> this<00:01:08.920> beat

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
really like the second half of this beat

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.940 
really like the second half of this beat
this<00:01:09.730> pattern<00:01:10.240> here<00:01:10.480> can<00:01:11.020> be<00:01:11.140> used<00:01:11.440> in<00:01:11.710> all

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
this pattern here can be used in all

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.100 
this pattern here can be used in all
kinds<00:01:11.980> of<00:01:12.550> up-tempo<00:01:13.060> of<00:01:13.330> X<00:01:13.540> just<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.930> add<00:01:14.080> a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
kinds of up-tempo of X just to add a

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:30.420 
kinds of up-tempo of X just to add a
little<00:01:14.230> bit<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.560> spice<00:01:28.830> when<00:01:29.830> learning<00:01:30.070> a<00:01:30.220> beat

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
little bit of spice when learning a beat

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.340 
little bit of spice when learning a beat
like<00:01:30.670> this<00:01:30.970> I<00:01:31.240> find<00:01:31.720> it's<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:31.930> good<00:01:32.080> idea<00:01:32.200> to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
like this I find it's a good idea to

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.469 
like this I find it's a good idea to
break<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:32.830> down<00:01:32.979> limb<00:01:33.490> by<00:01:33.670> limb<00:01:33.700> so<00:01:34.390> we're

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
break it down limb by limb so we're

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:35.880 
break it down limb by limb so we're
going<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:34.660> start<00:01:34.840> off<00:01:34.960> with<00:01:35.020> just<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.619> snare

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
going to start off with just a snare

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.430 
going to start off with just a snare
drum<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.369> hi-hat<00:01:36.640> keeping<00:01:37.300> time<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:37.810> then<00:01:38.290> we

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
drum and hi-hat keeping time and then we

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.950 
drum and hi-hat keeping time and then we
start<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:38.770> add<00:01:38.979> in<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.430> other<00:01:39.580> hand<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.150> foot

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
start to add in the other hand and foot

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.200 
start to add in the other hand and foot
on<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.560> kick<00:01:41.740> drum<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.220> we'll<00:01:42.700> start<00:01:42.940> to<00:01:43.030> put

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
on the kick drum and we'll start to put

00:01:43.210 --> 00:02:46.550 
on the kick drum and we'll start to put
the<00:01:43.300> beat<00:01:43.479> together

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.720 

okay<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:47.950> if<00:02:48.010> we're<00:02:48.160> still<00:02:48.340> having<00:02:48.580> trouble

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
okay so if we're still having trouble

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.510 
okay so if we're still having trouble
something<00:02:49.570> else<00:02:49.720> we<00:02:49.870> can<00:02:49.900> do<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.530> try<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.310> in

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
something else we can do is try it in

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.880 
something else we can do is try it in
different<00:02:51.730> order<00:02:52.330> so<00:02:52.990> this<00:02:53.320> time<00:02:53.590> we'll<00:02:53.800> just

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
different order so this time we'll just

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.710 
different order so this time we'll just
do<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.130> snare<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.790> kick<00:02:54.850> first<00:02:55.300> then

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
do the snare and the kick first then

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.090 
do the snare and the kick first then
bring<00:02:56.020> in<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.230> right<00:02:56.380> then<00:02:56.680> bring<00:02:56.890> in<00:02:57.010> the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
bring in the right then bring in the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:55.660 
bring in the right then bring in the
hi-hat<00:02:57.490> and<00:02:57.610> we'll<00:02:57.850> see<00:02:58.000> how<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.209> goes

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.770 

so<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.760> thing<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.240> think<00:03:57.300> is<00:03:57.570> most

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
so the thing that I think is most

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.080 
so the thing that I think is most
challenging<00:03:57.990> about<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:58.830> beat<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.490> it

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
challenging about this beat is it

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.420 
challenging about this beat is it
requires<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:00.840> much<00:04:01.020> for<00:04:01.410> way<00:04:01.650> independence

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
requires so much for way independence

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.610 
requires so much for way independence
now<00:04:03.330> what<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.510> means<00:04:03.810> is<00:04:04.080> that<00:04:04.140> your<00:04:04.470> left

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
now what that means is that your left

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.650 
now what that means is that your left
foot<00:04:04.950> right<00:04:05.220> foot<00:04:05.280> left<00:04:05.820> hand<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.450> right<00:04:06.600> hand

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
foot right foot left hand and right hand

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.930 
foot right foot left hand and right hand
are<00:04:07.140> all<00:04:07.320> playing<00:04:07.560> different<00:04:07.680> rhythms<00:04:08.340> but

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
are all playing different rhythms but

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.760 
are all playing different rhythms but
all<00:04:09.060> at<00:04:09.210> the<00:04:09.300> same<00:04:09.480> time<00:04:09.540> so<00:04:10.470> that's<00:04:10.590> why<00:04:10.740> I

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
all at the same time so that's why I

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.100 
all at the same time so that's why I
like<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:11.100> break<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.460> down<00:04:11.610> limb<00:04:11.910> by<00:04:12.090> limb<00:04:12.120> so

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
like to break it down limb by limb so

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.740 
like to break it down limb by limb so
that<00:04:13.260> we<00:04:13.350> can<00:04:13.500> start<00:04:13.740> to<00:04:14.070> organize<00:04:14.640> our<00:04:15.480> limbs

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
that we can start to organize our limbs

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.690 
that we can start to organize our limbs
one<00:04:15.990> at<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.170> time<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.680> then<00:04:16.980> eventually<00:04:17.250> play

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
one at a time and then eventually play

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.410 
one at a time and then eventually play
it<00:04:17.850> all<00:04:17.970> together<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:19.109> for<00:04:19.650> starters<00:04:20.420> don't

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
it all together so for starters don't

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.090 
it all together so for starters don't
worry<00:04:21.540> about<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.870> left<00:04:22.320> foot<00:04:22.500> in<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.710> hi-hat

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
worry about the left foot in the hi-hat

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.950 
worry about the left foot in the hi-hat
to<00:04:23.280> last<00:04:23.580> because<00:04:24.000> that's<00:04:24.300> probably<00:04:24.780> the

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
to last because that's probably the

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.620 
to last because that's probably the
hardest<00:04:25.410> just<00:04:26.310> work<00:04:26.520> on<00:04:26.730> getting<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:27.150> snare<00:04:27.450> and

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
hardest just work on getting a snare and

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.110 
hardest just work on getting a snare and
kick<00:04:27.690> together<00:04:28.169> then<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.250> ride<00:04:29.460> cymbal<00:04:29.940> and

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
kick together then the ride cymbal and

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.990 
kick together then the ride cymbal and
then<00:04:31.130> hopefully<00:04:32.130> it<00:04:32.250> all<00:04:32.310> comes<00:04:32.370> together<00:04:32.790> for

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
then hopefully it all comes together for

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.860 
then hopefully it all comes together for
you<00:04:34.310> okay<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:35.490> has<00:04:35.580> been<00:04:35.730> Ross<00:04:36.000> from<00:04:36.390> roscoes
