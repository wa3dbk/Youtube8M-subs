it's<00:02:48.190> a<00:02:48.280> good<00:02:48.400> company<00:02:48.730> we<00:02:48.910> would<00:02:49.030> have<00:02:49.120> liked

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
it's a good company we would have liked

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.780 
it's a good company we would have liked
on<00:02:49.480> them<00:02:49.750> we<00:02:50.290> had<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.530> right<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.920> match<00:02:51.130> what

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
on them we had the right to match what

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
the the French company was doing and we

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.220 
the the French company was doing and we

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
just didn't think that made sense so you

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.410 
just didn't think that made sense so you
know<00:02:56.290> I'd<00:02:56.380> rather<00:02:56.620> not<00:02:56.980> do<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.220> deal<00:02:57.519> than<00:02:58.090> then

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
know I'd rather not do a deal than then

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.610 
know I'd rather not do a deal than then
stretch<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.959> do<00:02:59.080> one<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.440> I'm<00:02:59.530> not

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620
