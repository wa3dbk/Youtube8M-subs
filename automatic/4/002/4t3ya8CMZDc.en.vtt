well like what inspired you to come up
with<00:00:12.370> this<00:00:12.670> technique<00:00:13.150> I<00:00:13.540> was<00:00:14.260> in<00:00:14.410> Holland<00:00:14.770> so

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
with this technique I was in Holland so

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.240 
with this technique I was in Holland so
I<00:00:15.790> like<00:00:16.060> well<00:00:16.299> I<00:00:16.510> can<00:00:16.779> teach<00:00:17.020> and<00:00:17.410> I<00:00:17.590> had<00:00:17.740> adult

I<00:00:20.710> just<00:00:21.010> I'm<00:00:21.310> I<00:00:21.610> guess

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
I just I'm I guess

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.519 
I just I'm I guess
Michelle<00:00:22.660> I've<00:00:22.810> always<00:00:22.990> had<00:00:23.110> that<00:00:23.170> kind<00:00:23.470> of

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
Michelle I've always had that kind of

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.040 
Michelle I've always had that kind of
mind<00:00:23.950> I<00:00:23.980> just<00:00:24.189> went<00:00:24.400> what<00:00:25.240> does<00:00:25.450> the<00:00:25.570> body<00:00:25.750> have

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
mind I just went what does the body have

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.050 
mind I just went what does the body have
to<00:00:26.200> learn<00:00:26.349> first<00:00:26.680> there's<00:00:27.099> no<00:00:27.250> bar<00:00:27.489> to<00:00:27.520> hold<00:00:27.790> on

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
to learn first there's no bar to hold on

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.400 
to learn first there's no bar to hold on
to<00:00:28.300> we<00:00:28.540> don't<00:00:28.689> have<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:28.960> mirror<00:00:29.169> for

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
to we don't have the mirror for

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.010 
to we don't have the mirror for
referencing<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.520> I<00:00:31.090> worked<00:00:31.329> with<00:00:31.599> all<00:00:31.840> of

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
referencing and I worked with all of

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.580 
referencing and I worked with all of
these<00:00:32.140> adult<00:00:32.500> beginners<00:00:32.650> and<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:34.840> it<00:00:35.470> was

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
these adult beginners and just it was

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.740 
these adult beginners and just it was
interesting<00:00:36.340> I<00:00:36.520> knew<00:00:36.760> that<00:00:37.120> what<00:00:37.420> I<00:00:37.450> had

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
interesting I knew that what I had

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.850 
interesting I knew that what I had
studied<00:00:38.020> in<00:00:38.290> New<00:00:38.320> York

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
studied in New York

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.310 
studied in New York
I<00:00:38.890> couldn't<00:00:39.399> just<00:00:39.930> superimpose<00:00:40.930> on<00:00:41.170> those

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
I couldn't just superimpose on those

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.630 
I couldn't just superimpose on those
adult<00:00:41.680> beginners<00:00:41.829> because<00:00:42.460> they<00:00:42.579> were

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
adult beginners because they were

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.959 
adult beginners because they were
beginners<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.809> class<00:00:44.079> that<00:00:44.320> my<00:00:44.469> body<00:00:44.769> knew<00:00:45.070> so

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
beginners the class that my body knew so

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.970 
beginners the class that my body knew so
over<00:00:46.269> those<00:00:46.390> four<00:00:46.660> years<00:00:46.690> in<00:00:47.140> Holland<00:00:47.620> I

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
over those four years in Holland I

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.189 
over those four years in Holland I
really<00:00:48.940> developed<00:00:49.090> what<00:00:49.570> would<00:00:49.809> become<00:00:49.960> the

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
really developed what would become the

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.529 
really developed what would become the
basis<00:00:50.649> of<00:00:50.679> what<00:00:51.429> people<00:00:51.730> call<00:00:51.910> silence<00:00:52.359> and

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
basis of what people call silence and

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.310 
basis of what people call silence and
technique<00:00:52.899> and<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:55.329> was<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.570> most<00:00:55.780> important

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
technique and it was the most important

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.590 
technique and it was the most important
time<00:00:56.500> for<00:00:56.530> me<00:00:57.010> really<00:00:57.760> an<00:00:58.059> important<00:00:58.449> time

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
time for me really an important time

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.970 
time for me really an important time
because<00:00:58.629> I<00:00:58.960> was<00:00:59.170> away<00:00:59.289> from<00:00:59.620> all<00:00:59.800> my

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
because I was away from all my

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.849 
because I was away from all my
influences<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:00.850> I<00:01:01.210> went<00:01:01.390> in<00:01:01.570> words<00:01:01.809> and<00:01:02.620> I

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
influences and I went in words and I

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.280 
influences and I went in words and I
just<00:01:03.129> referenced<00:01:03.969> what<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.449> our<00:01:05.050> most

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
just referenced what is our most

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.520

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.890 
started studying anatomy on my own and
questioning<00:01:18.850> doctors<00:01:19.270> so<00:01:19.480> that<00:01:19.690> was<00:01:19.870> very

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
questioning doctors so that was very

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.770 
questioning doctors so that was very
much<00:01:20.260> a<00:01:20.440> part<00:01:20.800> of<00:01:20.890> it<00:01:21.010> that<00:01:21.670> no<00:01:22.030> you<00:01:22.480> know<00:01:22.600> my

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
much a part of it that no you know my

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.120 
much a part of it that no you know my
knee<00:01:22.840> blue<00:01:23.230> because<00:01:23.560> I<00:01:23.680> was<00:01:23.800> so<00:01:23.920> hyper

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
knee blue because I was so hyper

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.310 
knee blue because I was so hyper
extended<00:01:24.820> mynique<00:01:25.150> her<00:01:25.360> back<00:01:25.630> so<00:01:25.930> much<00:01:26.140> I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
extended mynique her back so much I

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.320 
extended mynique her back so much I
dislocated<00:01:26.650> my<00:01:26.980> knee<00:01:27.130> in<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:27.520> class<00:01:27.730> in<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.150> art

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
dislocated my knee in a class in the art

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.390 
dislocated my knee in a class in the art
so<00:01:28.840> all<00:01:28.990> that<00:01:29.200> stuff<00:01:29.380> was<00:01:29.650> in<00:01:29.680> my<00:01:29.800> head<00:01:30.130> when<00:01:30.370> I

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
so all that stuff was in my head when I

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.190 
so all that stuff was in my head when I
went<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.640> Amsterdam<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.930> thought<00:01:32.170> of

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
went to Amsterdam the thought of

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.380 
went to Amsterdam the thought of
injuries<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.310> how<00:01:33.400> I've<00:01:33.550> been<00:01:33.760> injured<00:01:34.180> and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
injuries and how I've been injured and

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.210 
injuries and how I've been injured and
how<00:01:34.480> my<00:01:34.630> training<00:01:35.050> had<00:01:35.200> been<00:01:35.380> forced<00:01:35.830> and<00:01:36.070> in

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
how my training had been forced and in

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.760 
how my training had been forced and in
fact<00:01:36.400> I<00:01:36.580> didn't<00:01:36.880> have<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.060> much<00:01:37.390> turnout<00:01:37.770> but

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
fact I didn't have that much turnout but

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.320 
fact I didn't have that much turnout but
I've<00:01:38.920> been<00:01:39.100> trained<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.520> work<00:01:39.790> much<00:01:40.120> more

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
I've been trained to work much more

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.900 
I've been trained to work much more
turned<00:01:40.630> out<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.070> just<00:01:42.100> always<00:01:42.400> a<00:01:42.670> quick

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
turned out so it just always a quick

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.960 
turned out so it just always a quick
coalescing<00:01:43.690> period<00:01:44.400> but<00:01:45.400> that's<00:01:45.610> how<00:01:45.820> it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
coalescing period but that's how it

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.050 
coalescing period but that's how it
started<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.920> Oh<00:01:48.190> could<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:48.550> just<00:01:48.820> talk<00:01:49.000> a

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
started so Oh could you just talk a

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.120 
started so Oh could you just talk a
little<00:01:49.360> bit<00:01:49.570> about<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:50.110> Simonson<00:01:50.680> technique

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
little bit about the Simonson technique

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.130 
little bit about the Simonson technique
I<00:01:51.580> think<00:01:51.970> what<00:01:52.330> makes<00:01:52.480> the<00:01:52.660> Simonson

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
I think what makes the Simonson

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.780 
I think what makes the Simonson
technique<00:01:53.500> different<00:01:53.860> is<00:01:54.010> that<00:01:54.040> it's<00:01:54.400> really

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
technique different is that it's really

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.690 
technique different is that it's really
geared<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.480> individual<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:56.440> that<00:01:57.400> each

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
geared to the individual and that each

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.910 
geared to the individual and that each
teacher<00:01:58.060> is<00:01:58.360> trained<00:01:58.720> to<00:01:58.930> recognize<00:01:59.140> that

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
teacher is trained to recognize that

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.360 
teacher is trained to recognize that
every<00:02:00.670> person's<00:02:01.120> body<00:02:01.300> is<00:02:01.660> different

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
every person's body is different

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.110 
every person's body is different
and<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.600> look<00:02:03.870> at<00:02:04.110> each<00:02:04.320> student<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.520> terms<00:02:05.850> of

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
and to look at each student in terms of

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.450 
and to look at each student in terms of
a<00:02:06.240> student's<00:02:06.720> individual<00:02:07.350> possibilities<00:02:08.250> but

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
a student's individual possibilities but

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.270 
a student's individual possibilities but
also<00:02:08.960> where<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.170> range<00:02:10.380> of<00:02:10.560> motion<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.070> and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
also where the range of motion is and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.000 
also where the range of motion is and
what<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.490> limitations<00:02:11.640> might<00:02:12.420> be<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.320> that's

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
what the limitations might be and that's

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.470 
what the limitations might be and that's
the<00:02:14.160> most<00:02:14.310> important<00:02:14.850> thing<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.150> it's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
the most important thing is that it's

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.450 
the most important thing is that it's
for<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.080> individual<00:02:16.740> person<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:17.370> not

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
for the individual person it's not

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.970 
for the individual person it's not
