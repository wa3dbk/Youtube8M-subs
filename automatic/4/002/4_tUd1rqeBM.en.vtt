00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.429
 in him 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.410
 hello everyone I'm destroyed and today I 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.710
 I bring a creepy pasta that I came up with 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.410
 the other day good without further explanations 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.539
 let's start well, it was a Friday 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.600
 end of February when we left the 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.400
 institute at 1 hours and 30 minutes 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.379
 it was bad weather and it looked like 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.050
 would storm the sky was very 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.940
 cloudy and cold it always came back to 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.800
 house next to a friend who lives at the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.199
 street next to my house and always 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.960
 We went together to the crossroads that we 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.180
 we separated but just when we arrived 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.530
 At the crossing he told me before I left or 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.619
 he is devastated he has in the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.140
 playstation 2 For clear yes because 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:02.379
 you do not say because I want to give you this game 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.879
 me and bored me goodbyes troyer that 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.979
 have a good weekend 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.439
 he gave me the game and he left as if 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.960
 something will happen although I did not give 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.570
 importance to this I went to my house to 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.090
 try the game 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.490
 I turned on the console and inserted the game and 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.530
 I started playing as if nothing could 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.350
 choose between different levels of 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.780
 difficulty the normal and professional easy 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.940
 but I noticed a level of difficulty 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.030
 that I had never heard of him in 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.740
 no game I before playing I decided 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.990
 search online for this level of 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.690
 difficulty that apparently was the most 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.780
 difficult of all is level of difficulty 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.970
 it's called hell mode after hours 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.270
 search on the internet I did not find 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.210
 nothing at the end I closed my laptop and I started 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.190
 to play at once like it was the first 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.880
 Once I played I decided to put the level of 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.259
 Easy difficulty to train me a little 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.479
 finally on Sunday night 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.149
 I finished the game in easy and the truth 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.640
 I saw that it was very good that I already 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.649
 pass the difficulty level easy I decided 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.110
 go directly to the uncertain level 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.280
 but with that it was 11 o'clock at night 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.680
 Sunday they made me go to sleep 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.150
 the next morning I find myself 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.330
 friend at school and he told me what 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.480
 following before entering classes the 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.240
 destroyer liked the clear game that yes 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.569
 because you say it by itself they have noticed something 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.640
 weird but what do you say what's weird is not 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.760
 nothing nothing forget it 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.980
 we go to class because we will be late 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.799
 after telling me this I entered a 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.569
 great intrigue was anxious to return to 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.760
 play the game and try such a level of 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.980
 difficulty for what my friend told me 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.069
 I was sure he was referring to 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.200
 this level of this difficulty was 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.360
 all day thinking about this until 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.989
 finally I hit the alarm to leave 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.909
 class this time when we went out my friend 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.829
 it was not with me since they came to 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.590
 search by car and they invited me to go up 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.049
 but I decided to go alone I could not 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.200
 resist me more I really wanted to 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.480
 try what was mentioned before finally 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.400
 I arrived home I left the suitcase and I took advantage 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.950
 they did not give us homework to play 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.200
 once I opened the main menu of the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.079
 game I sweating I decided to select the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.120
 hell level but when I select it 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.920
 instead of leaving me the introduction of 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.760
 game I got a message on the screen 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.760
 what did he say 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.430
 I did not give any importance and I gave 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.280
 the option if then after being 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.170
 half an hour playing they kill me once I 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.410
 I did not give any importance and continue 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.900
 playing past 10 minutes sounds the 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.610
 phone that I was alone at home what 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.010
 I took myself and they told me the following 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.220
 good evening we call from the hospital 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.700
 of barcelona but what happens to 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.580
 her grandmother entered her cancer 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.010
 is the pure truth is in serious condition 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.950
 no better I have to call my mother 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.470
 to warn you of this 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.290
 I freaked out when I heard these 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.049
 words that scared me xerez the 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.880
 game and turn off the console then just 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.889
 when I was dialing the number for 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.330
 call my mother right before pressing 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.250
 the last digits 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.169
 the phone rings again and I 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.330
 they call the ones in the hospital telling me that 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.310
 it was a false alarm 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.770
 I calmed myself down and went back to 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.680
 turn on the game they killed me again 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.300
 right away since it was very difficult to 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.160
 kill they called me again from the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.560
 hospital that they have detected cancer 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.660
 my grandmother again , I this time I 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.180
 I felt like I was being wasted 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.700
 joke so I went back to close the game and 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.620
 turn off the console once the 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.560
 game call me back from the hospital 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.139
 that is false alarm again finally what 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.720
 I understood all the message he said to 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.270
 The beginning was true, that's why it should be 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.310
 that my friend gave me the game a day 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.500
 next I meet my friend by 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.240
 the street and I tell him what happened to me 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.880
 He explained that his grandfather died 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.800
 when he tried this game he wanted to test if 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.600
 it was for the game but I was afraid of 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.370
 lose someone from your family and I 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.380
 he gave serious 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.449
 I was very lucky to discover the 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.220
 secret because it could have come to 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.110
 lose loved ones 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.120
 then I ask him what I do with the game 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.120
 and he said he could do what he wants 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.040
 and even if I wanted I could destroy myself 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.960
 without thinking twice do not throw to the 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.690
 fire of the fireplace the disc of 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.370
 game and the box were disintegrating it was heard 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.830
 a very strange noise that came from the 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.990
 fireplace was like a dying spirit 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.000
 I was scared to hear this but when the 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.210
 box and disc disintegrated by 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.520
 completely stopped making that noise from 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.410
 that day I did not play a game of 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.229
 this guy for fear of my life and my 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.449
 loved ones good friends I hope that 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.520
 You liked my first creepy pasta 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.400
 do not criticize me since it is the first time 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.780
 that I make a good one goodbye and that 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.780
