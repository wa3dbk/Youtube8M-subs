going to be teaching you guys how to

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.790 
going to be teaching you guys how to
crochet<00:00:13.590> with<00:00:13.860> eyelash<00:00:14.580> yarn<00:00:15.350> so<00:00:16.350> as<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.680> can

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
crochet with eyelash yarn so as you can

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.070 
crochet with eyelash yarn so as you can
see<00:00:16.859> here<00:00:17.279> eyelash<00:00:17.699> yarn<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:18.300> really<00:00:18.779> fluffy

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
see here eyelash yarn is really fluffy

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.990 
see here eyelash yarn is really fluffy
and<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.710> can<00:00:19.859> be<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> little<00:00:20.189> bit<00:00:20.340> difficult<00:00:20.640> to

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
and it can be a little bit difficult to

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.130 
and it can be a little bit difficult to
see<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:22.199> actual<00:00:23.359> string<00:00:24.359> part<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> yarn

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
see the actual string part of the yarn

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.349 
see the actual string part of the yarn
with<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> excess<00:00:26.220> fluff<00:00:26.609> everywhere<00:00:27.119> and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
with the excess fluff everywhere and

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.099 
with the excess fluff everywhere and
even<00:00:27.900> sequins<00:00:28.529> or<00:00:28.740> whatever<00:00:29.039> else<00:00:29.250> they<00:00:29.400> add

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
even sequins or whatever else they add

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.920 
even sequins or whatever else they add
so<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.439> usually<00:00:32.309> use<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:33.000> needle<00:00:33.719> that's

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
so I usually use a needle that's

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.600 
so I usually use a needle that's
slightly<00:00:34.350> bigger<00:00:34.559> than<00:00:34.920> what<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.430> would

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
slightly bigger than what I would

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.340 
slightly bigger than what I would
normally<00:00:35.760> use<00:00:36.000> for<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> width<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.870> make<00:00:37.110> sure

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
normally use for the width and make sure

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.410 
normally use for the width and make sure
that<00:00:37.680> I'm<00:00:37.860> crocheting<00:00:38.370> loosely<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.270> I

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
that I'm crocheting loosely so that I

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.479 
that I'm crocheting loosely so that I
can<00:00:39.719> see<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.260> string<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.920> where<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.280> put<00:00:41.430> my

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
can see the string and where to put my

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.720 
can see the string and where to put my
hook<00:00:42.410> so<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> begin<00:00:43.649> with<00:00:43.920> I'm<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.550> going<00:00:44.700> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
hook so to begin with I'm just going to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:53.369 
hook so to begin with I'm just going to
chain<00:00:45.090> ten

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.810 

nice<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.280> loose<00:00:54.519> and<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:56.289> I'll<00:00:56.649> chain<00:00:57.489> one

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
nice and loose and then I'll chain one

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.259 
nice and loose and then I'll chain one
to<00:00:58.089> turn<00:00:58.420> actually<00:00:59.379> two<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.800> turn<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.339> I'm

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
to turn actually two to turn and I'm

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.910 
to turn actually two to turn and I'm
going<00:01:01.449> to<00:01:01.539> be<00:01:01.659> using<00:01:01.870> a<00:01:02.199> double<00:01:02.739> crochet

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.030 
going to be using a double crochet
stitch<00:01:03.269> so<00:01:04.269> that<00:01:04.299> it's<00:01:04.659> easier<00:01:05.229> to<00:01:05.530> use<00:01:05.560> this

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
stitch so that it's easier to use this

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.200 
stitch so that it's easier to use this
yarn<00:01:06.430> now<00:01:07.390> go<00:01:07.659> ahead<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:08.320> do<00:01:08.740> one<00:01:09.430> double

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.609 

there's<00:01:23.409> a<00:01:23.470> little<00:01:23.680> bit<00:01:23.979> difficult<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.759> see<00:01:25.619> so

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
there's a little bit difficult to see so

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:33.600 
there's a little bit difficult to see so
just<00:01:26.830> go<00:01:27.009> nice<00:01:27.220> and<00:01:27.250> slow<00:01:27.759> and<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:33.490> you
