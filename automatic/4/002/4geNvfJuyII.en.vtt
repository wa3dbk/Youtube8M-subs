bothering this because somebody's

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.490 
bothering this because somebody's
picking<00:00:56.530> at<00:00:56.740> my<00:00:56.860> leg<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:58.140> I'll<00:00:59.140> show<00:00:59.470> the

picking at my leg and I'll show the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.870 
picking at my leg and I'll show the
design<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:02.320> right<00:01:02.560> we're<00:01:02.740> under<00:01:03.490> the<00:01:03.580> porch

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880

this<00:01:07.000> is<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.240> square<00:01:07.780> bucket

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
this is a square bucket

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.560 
this is a square bucket
I<00:01:08.439> used<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.490> tidy<00:01:09.700> cat<00:01:09.970> buckets<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.420> lot

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
I used the tidy cat buckets a lot

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.730 
I used the tidy cat buckets a lot
because<00:01:10.689> we<00:01:10.869> have<00:01:10.900> so<00:01:11.140> many<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.470> them<00:01:11.590> because

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
because we have so many of them because

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.469 
because we have so many of them because

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
of our Tidy Cats and on three sides I

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.010 
of our Tidy Cats and on three sides I
have<00:01:17.200> put<00:01:17.880> feeder<00:01:19.829> holes<00:01:20.829> and<00:01:21.689> these<00:01:22.689> holes

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
have put feeder holes and these holes

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.899 
have put feeder holes and these holes
supply<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:23.799> with<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.429> glad<00:01:24.640> we're<00:01:24.850> doing

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.220 

I<00:01:30.130> stole<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.310> basic<00:01:31.730> idea<00:01:32.210> off<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.540> internet

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
I stole the basic idea off the internet

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.090 
I stole the basic idea off the internet
I<00:01:33.820> think<00:01:34.820> I've<00:01:35.180> improved<00:01:35.510> this<00:01:35.780> um<00:01:35.990> on<00:01:36.650> three

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
I think I've improved this um on three

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.640 
I think I've improved this um on three
sides<00:01:37.400> as<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.300> can<00:01:38.570> see<00:01:38.840> I<00:01:39.080> have<00:01:40.870> two<00:01:41.870> inch<00:01:42.200> or

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
sides as you can see I have two inch or

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.180 
sides as you can see I have two inch or
maybe<00:01:42.890> it's<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.160> two<00:01:43.370> and<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.550> half<00:01:43.790> inch<00:01:45.190> elbow

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
maybe it's a two and a half inch elbow

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.740 
maybe it's a two and a half inch elbow
PVC<00:01:46.820> elbow<00:01:47.060> plumbing<00:01:48.050> elbow<00:01:48.800> and<00:01:49.730> what<00:01:50.510> that

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
PVC elbow plumbing elbow and what that

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.940 
PVC elbow plumbing elbow and what that
does<00:01:52.540> look<00:01:53.540> inside<00:01:53.870> of<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:54.200> empty<00:01:54.530> almost

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
does look inside of the empty almost

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.630 
does look inside of the empty almost
empty<00:01:55.900> container<00:01:56.900> is<00:01:57.440> that<00:01:57.740> allows<00:01:58.010> them<00:01:58.370> to

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
empty container is that allows them to

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.640 
empty container is that allows them to
stick<00:01:58.880> their<00:01:59.060> head<00:01:59.330> into<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:01.760> bucket<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.650> get

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
stick their head into the bucket and get

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.650 
stick their head into the bucket and get
feed<00:02:04.930> but<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.710> feed<00:02:06.950> does<00:02:07.160> not<00:02:07.340> get<00:02:07.550> wet<00:02:07.790> and

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660

this<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.630> five<00:02:27.130> gallon<00:02:28.130> bucket<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.850> think

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
this is a five gallon bucket I think

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.920 
this is a five gallon bucket I think
thirty<00:02:29.630> pound<00:02:29.900> five<00:02:30.110> gallon<00:02:30.410> bucket<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:31.930> I

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
thirty pound five gallon bucket and I

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.650 
thirty pound five gallon bucket and I
only<00:02:33.080> have<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.500> check<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:34.030> if<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.120> fill<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.450> up<00:02:35.540> I

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
only have to check it if I fill it up I

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.320 
only have to check it if I fill it up I
only<00:02:35.720> have<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.989> check<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.350> once<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.100> week<00:02:37.330> now

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
only have to check it once a week now

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330 
only have to check it once a week now
what<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.600> did<00:02:38.930> is<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:39.260> obviously<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.830> cut<00:02:40.310> a

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
what I did is I obviously I cut a

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.370 
what I did is I obviously I cut a
circular<00:02:40.640> hole<00:02:40.850> on<00:02:41.330> three<00:02:41.600> on<00:02:41.750> three<00:02:41.900> sides<00:02:42.140> of

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
circular hole on three on three sides of

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.320 
circular hole on three on three sides of
the<00:02:42.560> bucket<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.940> then<00:02:44.150> what<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:44.420> did<00:02:44.570> is<00:02:45.130> to

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
the bucket and then what I did is to

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.670 
the bucket and then what I did is to
secure<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:49.070> elbow<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:50.090> PVC<00:02:50.600> elbow<00:02:50.780> into

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
secure the the elbow the PVC elbow into

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.979 
secure the the elbow the PVC elbow into
the<00:02:51.800> bucket<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.430> think<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.150> can<00:02:53.330> see<00:02:53.510> there<00:02:53.780> I

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
the bucket I think you can see there I

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.660 
the bucket I think you can see there I
cut<00:02:55.870> thin<00:02:56.870> pieces<00:02:57.320> probably<00:02:57.860> about<00:02:58.220> half<00:02:58.520> an

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
cut thin pieces probably about half an

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.920 
cut thin pieces probably about half an
inch<00:02:58.840> thin<00:02:59.840> pieces<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:00.910> straight<00:03:01.910> PVC<00:03:02.660> pipe

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
inch thin pieces of straight PVC pipe

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.190 
inch thin pieces of straight PVC pipe
and<00:03:03.320> then<00:03:04.100> bent<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.489> out<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.940> glued<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.510> to

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
and then bent it out and glued it to

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.020 
and then bent it out and glued it to
