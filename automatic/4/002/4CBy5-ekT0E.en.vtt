00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.370
 hello everyone in today's video 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.470
 I want to make the promised comparison review 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.510
 two lipsticks from catrice 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.050
 and maybelin which you have already seen mine 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.610
 shopping they look like this 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.789
 What unites them is that they 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.160
 colorless lipstick vests say but on 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.710
 each lips looks in its own way that is 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.420
 they have their own subject 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.640
 absent practically and they 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.440
 will feel the subject of your lips and 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.480
 that is, even 1 floor of lipstick on different 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.050
 Your lips will look good. 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.020
 well let's start with packing as if 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.440
 two completely different decorated 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.809
 lipstick from catrice more so serious 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.540
 sleek design in the sleeve resembles 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:59.020
 i am over 9 and tender pink from 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.000
 Maybellin there if to compare in terms of 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.430
 reliability for some reason it seems to me 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.140
 to be completely unreasonable that the cards 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.830
 because the packaging is more reliable that is 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.080
 so here bangs securely and here 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.180
 as if too well snaps the mind and 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.310
 ticket but all the time it seems to me that there is 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.530
 the risk that this one is a cap once 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.229
 breadbasket cracks anyway 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.940
 will break and and accordingly will 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:27.819
 fly loose and hold bad not 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.000
 I know how true it is here I think 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:33.190
 the same amount of product on 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.910
 packaging which did not find how much 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.550
 here and more precisely just rolled 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.649
 3 grams, but I donâ€™t have a smart belen 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.179
 it turned out to discover what 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.849
 product quantity is at a standstill 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:49.750
 but then I managed to find here if 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:52.920
 take this one sticker you open that 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.920
 full list 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.899
 full list 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.220
 ahahah ingredients here you can 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.700
 read what is contained in this lipstick and 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.750
 etc. etc. 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.149
 which of course does the patrice fly next to them 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.610
 both so stable one bottom 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:17.969
 which you can put it will stand 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.890
 and and there and fill up these open 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:23.080
 lipstick as i'm saying no longer in volume 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.890
 about the same because 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.220
 at least here if visually 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.920
 feelings so look here they have 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.720
 same amount of product like this 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.700
 here they look you see even k structure 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.330
 their very similar shade also looks like 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.330
 on each other and 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.700
 and now let's get to the point 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.040
 if you care about it of course it's important 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.950
 west since having fallen product you 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.370
 put on lips you feel it can even 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.420
 You are somewhere try it in terms of odor 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.980
 undoubtedly wins the furniture here is very 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.890
 gentle fruit some kind of berry 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.510
 even beta 0 is no more apple 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.440
 some kind of smell is very nice 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.390
 there is also a smell catrice he is not 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.459
 he pushes himself completely normal but 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:24.100
 more chemically here you such 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:27.489
 the smell of pleasure does not deliver like hers 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.450
 belen further if we look like 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:34.390
 Apply lipstick here too I want 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.980
 notice that more meybellin wins 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:42.579
 my comparison is my preference i give u 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.799
 the companies are my ticket because he just 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.370
 traveled very gently very easily 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.750
 applied just slips over your lips 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.610
 completely easy and natural 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.000
 really very nice to wear 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.070
 put on actresses lips too nothing 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.880
 there is no difficult to make up your lips 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:04.900
 this lipstick but it is more 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.190
 or solid that's how the actors by their 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.810
 its structure or just 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.310
 harder to apply more firmly about 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.739
 no other word is in my head now 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.169
 firmly firmer i.e. furniture 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:21.459
 softer and easier just like that how 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:23.389
 oil is applied by catrice lipstick 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.909
 a little bit so it 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.020
 rougher it can be a little bit like that 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:32.990
 a little rougher but also enough 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.539
 easy to apply but in my furniture 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.460
 preference in this here in this aspect 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:44.360
 goes goes on on lipstick furniture now 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:49.310
 let's see moisten this furniture 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:52.389
 and here it is catrice so here they are 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.759
 look too basically 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:58.849
 Again, all cases are similar 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.500
 a closer look at their lips and hands as you like in 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.479
 open view can be viewed 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.360
 all links on my site 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:10.360
 put down here so here it looks 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:15.800
 I think that more will be 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.539
 reddish more pinkish catrice and 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.069
 more reddish and belay 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:23.719
 I go get me but this again from 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:25.669
 lighting depends see you now and the sun 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:28.009
 gets more on the furniture in cages he 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:31.370
 more it seems that we killed on those on 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:33.289
 more pinkish and this one from which 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.580
 it gets dark that is crabat lighting too 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:40.279
 depends but in general they are on each other 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.009
 are similar of course in terms of endurance as they 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:46.129
 rests on the lips this particular distinction 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:48.500
 here I did not notice that mobile 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:51.289
 catrice is equally equally good in 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.520
 In general, they do not roll down anywhere 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:56.000
 not numb anything because 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.029
 enough so the other structure 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.029
 possesses what remains on the lips where 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:03.409
 you keep your them not like that 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.960
 soft liquid consistency what are they 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:08.960
 somewhere can spread out bring it to 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.469
 some folds hide no well 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.839
 The main difference is not of course this price. 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:16.300
 furniture costs 12 euros i'm talking about prices 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:23.379
 balande 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:23.379
 to 34 a ticket costs three times as much 

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:29.960
 well and has some small plus 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:34.689
 advantages compared with catrice that is 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:37.179
 for me it is the smell and lightness of annecy 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:38.559
 not if you are not so sensitive smell 

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:40.149
 where you are completely unimportant 

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:41.799
 what is there because here too 

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:44.229
 which and I will not I will not say that 

00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:46.089
 unpleasant smell but it is a little more 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:47.949
 chemically than furniture 

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:51.179
 but if you have this moment absolutely not 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:53.499
 confuses and the price plays enough such 

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:55.829
 decisive role then of course like here 

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:59.259
 You can buy without any problems it will be you 

00:06:55.829 --> 00:07:01.119
 practically the same product as 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.279
 these are my blees in their properties 

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:05.349
 if for you the price in general is not not not 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:07.599
 especially and the obstacles in the selection and purchase 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:08.999
 cosmetic products then 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:11.889
 uniquely furniture 

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:14.829
 so look decide 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:18.610
 I hope that I seemed to you somewhere 

00:07:14.829 --> 00:07:21.399
