00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.230 
most important things DJ's need to have
access<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.080> instantly<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:41.910> have<00:03:42.030> eight

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
access to instantly and you have eight

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.490 
access to instantly and you have eight
of<00:03:42.270> those<00:03:42.510> this<00:03:42.720> time<00:03:42.750> because<00:03:43.080> in<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.290> trig

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
of those this time because in a trig

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.860 
of those this time because in a trig
event<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.790> let's<00:03:44.820> now<00:03:45.240> talk<00:03:45.300> about<00:03:45.660> one<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.810> the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
event so let's now talk about one of the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.720 
event so let's now talk about one of the
cool<00:03:46.080> things<00:03:46.110> that<00:03:46.410> separates<00:03:47.190> twitch<00:03:47.460> from

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
cool things that separates twitch from

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.470 
cool things that separates twitch from
the<00:03:47.820> normal<00:03:48.060> stuff

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
the normal stuff

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.660 
the normal stuff
the<00:03:48.750> firing<00:03:48.960> fader<00:03:49.260> when<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.130> Ben<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.430> pressed

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
the firing fader when the Ben is pressed

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.750 
the firing fader when the Ben is pressed
off<00:03:50.850> obviously<00:03:51.090> turned<00:03:51.510> upon<00:03:51.690> down<00:03:51.900> there<00:03:52.080> is

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
off obviously turned upon down there is

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.310 
off obviously turned upon down there is
normal<00:03:53.760> but<00:03:54.270> we<00:03:54.540> added<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.870> button<00:03:55.050> called<00:03:55.230> a

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
normal but we added a button called a

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.050 
normal but we added a button called a
fader<00:03:55.560> effect<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.070> when<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.370> engage<00:03:56.520> it<00:03:56.850> look

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
fader effect so when you engage it look

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.810 
fader effect so when you engage it look
what<00:03:57.150> happens<00:04:00.050> you<00:04:01.050> can<00:04:01.230> select<00:04:01.590> any<00:04:02.070> effect

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
what happens you can select any effect

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.360 
what happens you can select any effect
you<00:04:02.910> want<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.390> really<00:04:03.959> use<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.260> fader<00:04:04.560> come

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
you want and really use the fader come

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.800 
you want and really use the fader come
up<00:04:05.459> with<00:04:05.580> some<00:04:05.700> really<00:04:05.820> creative<00:04:06.090> stuff<00:04:08.810> so

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
up with some really creative stuff so

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.449 
up with some really creative stuff so
fader<00:04:10.080> effects<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.530> really<00:04:10.770> cool<00:04:10.920> thing<00:04:10.950> but

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
fader effects is a really cool thing but

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.220 
fader effects is a really cool thing but
not<00:04:11.940> only<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.330> we<00:04:12.450> also<00:04:12.480> have<00:04:12.840> global

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
not only that we also have global

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.140 
not only that we also have global
effects<00:04:13.709> on<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.950> top<00:04:14.160> left<00:04:14.400> hand<00:04:14.489> corner<00:04:14.670> of

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
effects on the top left hand corner of

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.090 
effects on the top left hand corner of
the<00:04:15.630> twitch<00:04:15.870> we<00:04:16.320> have<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.530> global<00:04:16.680> effects

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
the twitch we have the global effects

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.920 
the twitch we have the global effects
which<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.370> can<00:04:17.489> apply<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.790> either<00:04:18.060> deck<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.660> or

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
which you can apply to either deck a or

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.110 
which you can apply to either deck a or
deck<00:04:19.169> B<00:04:19.350> which<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.220> can<00:04:20.340> use<00:04:20.430> simultaneously

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
deck B which you can use simultaneously

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.690 
deck B which you can use simultaneously
with<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.329> fader<00:04:21.630> effects<00:04:22.019> kind<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:23.090> emergent

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.880 

basics<00:04:29.700> to<00:04:29.850> put<00:04:30.000> it<00:04:30.180> yeah<00:04:30.810> what<00:04:31.470> more<00:04:31.650> is<00:04:31.860> that

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
basics to put it yeah what more is that

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.510 
basics to put it yeah what more is that
the<00:04:32.669> high<00:04:32.820> EQ<00:04:33.750> section<00:04:34.020> is<00:04:34.290> fully<00:04:34.590> killed<00:04:34.950> so

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
the high EQ section is fully killed so

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.880 
the high EQ section is fully killed so
when<00:04:35.790> you<00:04:35.940> pass<00:04:36.600> all<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.050> EQ<00:04:37.320> section<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.770> can

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
when you pass all the EQ section you can

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.250 
when you pass all the EQ section you can
fully<00:04:38.160> bandpass<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.300> freeze<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:40.020> full

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
fully bandpass and freeze the full

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.860 
fully bandpass and freeze the full
signal<00:04:40.669> which<00:04:41.669> are<00:04:41.850> very<00:04:42.060> powerful<00:04:42.300> EP

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
signal which are very powerful EP

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.500 
signal which are very powerful EP
filters

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.100 
separate column control for each we also
have<00:05:17.550> auxiliary<00:05:18.090> inputs<00:05:18.540> which<00:05:18.720> makes<00:05:18.990> it

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
have auxiliary inputs which makes it

really cool that allows you to take you

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.760 
really cool that allows you to take you
