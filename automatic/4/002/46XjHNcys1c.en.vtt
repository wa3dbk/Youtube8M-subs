of the 50 hundred total maybe two or
three<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.259> said<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.549> tone<00:02:03.329> comes<00:02:03.899> separated

guide will COO

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.199 
guide will COO
there<00:02:07.359> but<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.170> think<00:02:08.440> that<00:02:08.470> could<00:02:08.769> be<00:02:09.209> being

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
there but I think that could be being

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.059 
there but I think that could be being
played<00:02:10.509> overpowered<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.379> minute<00:02:11.620> tearing

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
played overpowered a minute tearing

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.600 
played overpowered a minute tearing
apart<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.670> someone<00:02:13.260> overpowered<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.410> but<00:02:15.310> I

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
apart and someone overpowered it but I

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.280 
apart and someone overpowered it but I
think<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:16.120> might<00:02:16.480> be<00:02:16.540> good<00:02:16.780> enough<00:02:16.989> for<00:02:17.050> me<00:02:17.260> I

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
think it might be good enough for me I

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.220 
think it might be good enough for me I
