00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
efficient it could be this coal there's

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.770 
efficient it could be this coal there's
a<00:01:36.560> lot<00:01:36.679> of<00:01:36.770> resources<00:01:37.159> here<00:01:37.429> actually<00:01:37.780> gold

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
a lot of resources here actually gold

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:47.710 
a lot of resources here actually gold
coal<00:01:40.210> you<00:01:41.210> logs<00:01:41.569> a<00:01:42.729> Dior's<00:01:45.610> mithril<00:01:46.610> gold<00:01:47.179> and

coal you logs a Dior's mithril gold and
he<00:01:47.929> again<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.200> lot<00:01:48.409> idea<00:01:48.770> was<00:01:48.890> actually<00:01:49.130> the

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
he again a lot idea was actually the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.330 
he again a lot idea was actually the
disguiser<00:01:50.119> when<00:01:50.420> I<00:01:50.509> got<00:01:50.720> him<00:01:50.899> he<00:01:50.929> very<00:01:51.200> much

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
disguiser when I got him he very much

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.880 
disguiser when I got him he very much
you<00:01:52.340> kill<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:52.789> tack<00:01:53.090> him<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.780> higher<00:01:53.959> mining

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
you kill you tack him the higher mining

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.399 
you kill you tack him the higher mining
level<00:01:55.159> you<00:01:55.250> have<00:01:55.429> and<00:01:55.849> the<00:01:56.479> easier<00:01:57.080> would<00:01:57.259> be

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
level you have and the easier would be

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.749 
level you have and the easier would be
for<00:01:58.039> you<00:01:58.099> to<00:01:58.130> call<00:01:58.459> him
