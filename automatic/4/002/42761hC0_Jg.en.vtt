00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
and it's a one hit kill so you know they

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.979 
and it's a one hit kill so you know they
could<00:00:48.309> take<00:00:48.489> on<00:00:48.700> people<00:00:48.880> with<00:00:49.090> like<00:00:49.180> smgs<00:00:49.809> and

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
could take on people with like smgs and

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.420

assault rifles at very close range

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.430 
assault rifles at very close range
because<00:00:52.030> of<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.210> speed<00:00:52.450> of<00:00:52.510> us<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:53.110> now<00:00:53.380> due

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
because of the speed of us and now due

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.310 
because of the speed of us and now due
to<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.860> reduction<00:00:54.190> of<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.760> bolt<00:00:55.660> action<00:00:56.140> I

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
to the reduction of the bolt action I

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.680 
to the reduction of the bolt action I
find<00:00:56.829> the<00:00:56.950> fact<00:00:57.160> that<00:00:57.309> this<00:00:58.180> isn't<00:00:58.540> more

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
find the fact that this isn't more

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.090 
find the fact that this isn't more

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
sniper rifle because personally I see a

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.590 
sniper rifle because personally I see a
lot<00:01:11.289> of<00:01:11.350> people<00:01:11.649> moaning<00:01:12.459> about<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.420> bolt

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
lot of people moaning about the bolt

lot of people moaning about the bolt
action<00:01:13.869> sniper<00:01:13.959> is<00:01:14.200> being<00:01:14.439> nerfed<00:01:14.799> now<00:01:15.069> but<00:01:15.490> in

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
action sniper is being nerfed now but in

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.870 
action sniper is being nerfed now but in
actual<00:01:16.810> fact<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:17.799> sniper<00:01:18.069> rifles<00:01:18.490> are<00:01:18.609> still

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
actual fact the sniper rifles are still

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.550 
actual fact the sniper rifles are still
fine<00:01:19.179> you<00:01:19.420> can<00:01:19.569> feel<00:01:19.840> a<00:01:19.869> little<00:01:20.200> bit<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.499> a

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
fine you can feel a little bit of a

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.480 
fine you can feel a little bit of a
difference<00:01:20.889> in<00:01:21.039> the<00:01:21.100> reduction<00:01:21.429> there<00:01:21.880> but

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
difference in the reduction there but

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.639 
difference in the reduction there but
personally<00:01:24.490> I<00:01:24.639> think<00:01:24.880> that<00:01:25.810> it's<00:01:26.109> not<00:01:26.319> a<00:01:26.380> huge

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
personally I think that it's not a huge

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.609 
personally I think that it's not a huge
problem<00:01:27.159> in<00:01:27.340> my<00:01:27.909> opinion<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:29.229> you<00:01:29.409> can<00:01:29.529> see

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
problem in my opinion as you can see

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:30.749 
problem in my opinion as you can see
from<00:01:29.679> the<00:01:29.799> gameplay<00:01:30.159> I<00:01:30.189> had<00:01:30.369> a<00:01:30.399> couple<00:01:30.639> of

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
from the gameplay I had a couple of

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.389 
from the gameplay I had a couple of
games<00:01:30.909> I<00:01:31.090> guess<00:01:31.319> snipers<00:01:32.319> are<00:01:32.679> still<00:01:33.130> very

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
games I guess snipers are still very

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.249 
games I guess snipers are still very
viable<00:01:33.849> there's<00:01:34.389> nothing<00:01:34.689> wrong<00:01:34.899> with<00:01:34.959> the

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
viable there's nothing wrong with the

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.149 
viable there's nothing wrong with the
nerf<00:01:35.469> it<00:01:36.399> just<00:01:36.670> makes<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:37.649> play<00:01:38.649> a<00:01:38.679> bit<00:01:38.859> smart

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
nerf it just makes you play a bit smart

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.160 
nerf it just makes you play a bit smart
you<00:01:39.340> know<00:01:39.399> you<00:01:39.549> can't<00:01:40.179> run<00:01:40.389> up<00:01:40.509> to<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.659> guy<00:01:40.929> who's

as<00:01:56.079> quick<00:01:56.919> scoping<00:01:57.279> is<00:01:57.459> the<00:01:57.549> most<00:01:57.759> simplest

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
as quick scoping is the most simplest

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:59.849 
as quick scoping is the most simplest
thing<00:01:58.419> especially<00:01:58.630> in<00:01:58.959> black<00:01:59.229> ops<00:01:59.380> 2<00:01:59.469> and

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
thing especially in black ops 2 and

especially with a ballista sniper and
this<00:02:03.130> way<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.639> makes<00:02:03.819> it<00:02:03.969> a<00:02:04.029> little<00:02:04.179> harder<00:02:04.659> for

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
this way it makes it a little harder for
