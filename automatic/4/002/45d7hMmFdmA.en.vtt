00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
bigger and better things which doesn't

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.160 
bigger and better things which doesn't
really<00:00:52.739> make<00:00:52.980> much<00:00:53.039> sense<00:00:53.390> because<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.989> are

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
really make much sense because we are

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.450 
really make much sense because we are
the<00:00:55.350> best<00:00:55.500> club<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.949> world<00:00:55.980> at<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> moment

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the best club in the world at the moment

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:06.050 
the best club in the world at the moment
with<00:00:56.789> 12<00:00:57.239> a<00:01:03.619> little<00:01:04.619> bit<00:01:04.710> optimistic<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.610> think

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
with 12 a little bit optimistic I think

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.750 
with 12 a little bit optimistic I think
we've<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.479> one<00:01:06.720> champions<00:01:07.320> league<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.610> run

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
we've on one champions league and we run

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.070 
we've on one champions league and we run
the<00:01:08.820> Barclays<00:01:09.119> Premier<00:01:09.270> League<00:01:09.540> won<00:01:09.810> every

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the Barclays Premier League won every

the Barclays Premier League won every
cup<00:01:10.320> run<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.770> far<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.060> still<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
cup run so far but we still have the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.120 
cup run so far but we still have the
Champions<00:01:12.900> League<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.290> season<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.799> prove

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
Champions League this season to prove

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.660

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
ourselves and to be quite honest I'm

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.149 
ourselves and to be quite honest I'm
pretty<00:01:17.970> sure<00:01:18.180> we're<00:01:18.420> title<00:01:18.840> contenders<00:01:19.740> we

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
pretty sure we're title contenders we

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.370 
pretty sure we're title contenders we
haven't<00:01:20.369> lost<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.670> match<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.119> far<00:01:21.150> we've<00:01:22.049> drawn

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
haven't lost a match so far we've drawn

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.560 
haven't lost a match so far we've drawn
a<00:01:22.409> couple<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.159> we've<00:01:23.460> pretty<00:01:23.820> much<00:01:23.909> dominated

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
a couple and we've pretty much dominated

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.170 
a couple and we've pretty much dominated
the<00:01:24.810> league<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.320> far<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:26.220> some<00:01:26.640> who<00:01:26.909> would<00:01:27.030> be

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the league so far but some who would be

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.710 
the league so far but some who would be
a<00:01:27.210> good<00:01:27.509> replacement<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:28.880> Kagawa<00:01:29.880> would<00:01:30.600> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
a good replacement for Kagawa would it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.550 
a good replacement for Kagawa would it
be<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.229> zoo<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:32.310> Arsenal<00:01:32.729> player<00:01:32.900> would<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.200> be

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
be a zoo the Arsenal player would it be

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.380 
be a zoo the Arsenal player would it be
eden<00:01:35.159> hazard<00:01:35.640> or<00:01:36.320> should<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:38.240> know<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> was

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
because I don't know why that is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.050 
because I don't know why that is
obviously<00:02:28.040> because<00:02:28.220> he<00:02:28.310> wears<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.520> long<00:02:28.700> shirt

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
during normal games I guess that now Ned

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.620 
during normal games I guess that now Ned
sighing<00:02:34.460> it<00:02:34.670> reverts<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.240> opposite

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
sighing it reverts to the opposite

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.600 
sighing it reverts to the opposite
because<00:02:35.750> not<00:02:36.050> normally<00:02:36.980> people<00:02:37.280> don't<00:02:37.340> you

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
because not normally people don't you

because not normally people don't you
wear<00:02:37.790> long-sleeve<00:02:38.240> I<00:02:38.360> know<00:02:38.510> why<00:02:38.690> that<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:38.900> that

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
wear long-sleeve I know why that is that

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.770 
wear long-sleeve I know why that is that
doesn't<00:02:39.380> make<00:02:39.440> much<00:02:39.590> sense<00:02:39.910> Kagawa<00:02:40.910> nearly<00:02:41.660> on

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
unfortunately because we spent all our

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.410 
unfortunately because we spent all our
money<00:06:21.800> on<00:06:22.040> earth<00:06:22.280> I<00:06:22.580> wasn't<00:06:22.880> able<00:06:22.970> to<00:06:23.180> get<00:06:23.270> him

million<00:06:26.810> if<00:06:27.620> you<00:06:27.950> guys<00:06:28.160> can<00:06:28.490> remember<00:06:28.970> and<00:06:29.120> I

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
million if you guys can remember and I

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.090 
million if you guys can remember and I
was<00:06:30.050> trying<00:06:30.290> to<00:06:30.350> get<00:06:30.470> him<00:06:30.620> back<00:06:30.740> for<00:06:30.950> a<00:06:30.980> little

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
was trying to get him back for a little

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.910 
was trying to get him back for a little
bit<00:06:31.250> cheaper<00:06:31.730> because<00:06:31.880> I<00:06:32.300> swear<00:06:33.140> I<00:06:33.200> reckon<00:06:33.830> he

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:33.920 
bit cheaper because I swear I reckon he

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.290 
bit cheaper because I swear I reckon he
likes<00:06:34.100> Majesty<00:06:34.520> night<00:06:34.640> in<00:06:34.760> his<00:06:34.850> heart<00:06:35.090> and

an<00:06:50.729> offer<00:06:50.939> for<00:06:51.179> frimpong<00:06:51.830> basically<00:06:52.830> because

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:53.569 
an offer for frimpong basically because

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.869 
an offer for frimpong basically because
i'll<00:06:54.569> just<00:06:55.399> essentially<00:06:56.399> this<00:06:56.550> is<00:06:56.669> called

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879 
i'll just essentially this is called

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:00.019 
i'll just essentially this is called
true<00:06:57.029> a<00:06:57.239> squad<00:06:58.669> rotational<00:06:59.669> player<00:06:59.849> i

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:00.029 
true a squad rotational player i

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:01.309 
true a squad rotational player i
probably<00:07:00.269> won't<00:07:00.479> playing<00:07:00.719> with<00:07:00.929> him<00:07:01.080> but<00:07:01.229> i

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 
probably won't playing with him but i

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:03.259 
probably won't playing with him but i
think<00:07:01.559> samesies<00:07:02.399> cheap<00:07:02.699> we<00:07:02.879> might<00:07:03.029> be<00:07:03.119> able<00:07:03.179> to

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:03.269 
think samesies cheap we might be able to

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:04.600 
think samesies cheap we might be able to
make<00:07:03.330> a<00:07:03.419> profit<00:07:03.689> on<00:07:03.869> that's<00:07:04.169> basically

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
make a profit on that's basically

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.129 
make a profit on that's basically
because<00:07:05.610> i'm<00:07:05.759> like<00:07:05.939> a<00:07:05.969> big<00:07:06.300> club<00:07:06.689> and<00:07:06.869> i<00:07:06.899> don't

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 
because i'm like a big club and i don't

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:09.079 
because i'm like a big club and i don't
really<00:07:07.319> need<00:07:07.739> to<00:07:08.009> sign<00:07:08.219> players<00:07:08.429> on<00:07:08.789> the<00:07:08.879> last

to<00:07:11.279> make<00:07:11.339> a<00:07:11.399> profit<00:07:11.580> essentially<00:07:12.300> it<00:07:13.199> sounds

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:13.529 
to make a profit essentially it sounds

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:15.889
