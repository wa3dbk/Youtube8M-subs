00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:14.065
Go go go!

00:00:37.932 --> 00:00:42.006
Today we're driving possibly the ultimate getaway car!

00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:43.675
Recently it has been in the news a few times...

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.888
...because it was used during robberies 
on money transport companies.

00:00:47.534 --> 00:00:54.387
The getaway cars were fast BMW's and Audi's,
and today we are driving the brand new Audi S6.

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.768
Enough exhaust pipes at the back
in which you can easily slide some gold bars.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.748
And enough power in the front to escape bizarre fast!

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:18.985
And it does this in a very easy manner,
with its quattro, 420 hp and 550 Nm.

00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:21.811
Seriously, everybody can drive this car.

00:01:21.812 --> 00:01:27.173
I can even take my grandmother out of her scoot mobile,
put her in this car and tell her where the gas pedal is.

00:01:27.174 --> 00:01:29.976
She doesn't know where the gas pedal is,
because she never had a driver's license.

00:01:29.977 --> 00:01:37.831
As long as she holds the steering wheel in the right direction,
she can easily keep going until she reaches 268 km/h (167 mph).

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:59.906
This car is so easy to drive and so fast,
it's simply unimaginable.

00:01:59.907 --> 00:02:03.082
For safety reasons it's a bit understeered.

00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:16.244
But, you can make it more exciting by turning
traction control off and hitting the gas pedal a bit.

00:02:23.608 --> 00:02:31.198
But in general it's very safe to drive this car,
keep the safety tools on, accelerate, steer, brake.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.114
Then your're the Colin McRae of your street.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.265
It's really amazing,
it's so easy to drive very fast!

00:02:49.693 --> 00:02:51.688
So, is there anything to complain about?

00:02:52.595 --> 00:02:54.342
Yes, there is something to complain about.

00:02:54.343 --> 00:02:59.488
I've driven with the S tronic transmission a few times,
and I know that Wouter has also mentioned it before...

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.008
...but it's not a very pleasant transmission.

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:10.721
Automatic mode works fine, 
and the sport mode makes the S6 more aggressive...

00:03:10.722 --> 00:03:13.503
...but using the manual mode is pretty frustrating.

00:03:13.504 --> 00:03:20.840
It's equipped with some kind of fool-proof system,
which changes gears if you're getting above 6500 rpm.

00:03:20.841 --> 00:03:23.712
Because of this it is impossible
to drive it at higher rpm...

00:03:23.713 --> 00:03:26.570
...because it already changed gears,
which simply sucks, sorry.

00:03:26.571 --> 00:03:32.922
Please scrap the S tronic, and install a manual gearbox
or another automatic gearbox which doesn't do this.

00:03:32.923 --> 00:03:39.750
Or change the software, because it's probably 
only one checkmark that is responsible for changing gears.

00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:42.541
And then you can change gears whenever you want,
which will be really good.

00:03:46.532 --> 00:03:50.665
The Audi is S6 is available from 100.520 euro (in the Netherlands).

00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:53.381
Nobody knows where the last 20 euro comes from..
Anyway:

00:03:53.382 --> 00:03:56.221
The Avant is of course a couple of grand more expensive.

00:03:56.222 --> 00:04:01.708
Now the question is:
is the S6 too dull regarding its appearance?

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:09.695
Which I can imagine, because it's basically an A6 with
larger wheels, better brakes and a spoiler at the back.

00:04:09.696 --> 00:04:13.414
It also has silver mirror caps, 
which are all pretty subtle adjustments.

00:04:13.415 --> 00:04:14.889
Is it not extreme enough for you?

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.783
Then you have to be patient, because the RS6 
and RS7 are currently driving the NÃ¼rburgring.

00:04:24.262 --> 00:04:25.897
Now, the Autoblog top tip:

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:29.172
Do you need the ultimate car 
that can be used for bank robberies in your area,

00:04:29.173 --> 00:04:33.166
which is now in the showroom, 
doesn't attract attention and is really fast?

00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:35.128
And one in which your grandmother can also drive?

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:36.455
Then buy the Audi S6!
