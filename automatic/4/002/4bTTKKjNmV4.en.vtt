into<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.070> second<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:26.460> anyways<00:00:27.230> this

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
into that in a second but anyways this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.140 
into that in a second but anyways this
might<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.439> like<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> new<00:00:28.890> series<00:00:29.189> even<00:00:30.029> though

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
might be like a new series even though

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.220 
might be like a new series even though
it<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.359> episode<00:00:30.840> 3<00:00:31.230> because<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:33.750> episodes<00:00:34.140> are

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230

they're not retarded but i have dropped
60<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.560> i'm<00:01:46.560> gonna<00:01:46.680> try<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> upload<00:01:47.369> as<00:01:47.490> many<00:01:47.520> of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
60 so i'm gonna try to upload as many of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.550 
60 so i'm gonna try to upload as many of
the<00:01:47.970> ones<00:01:48.180> against<00:01:48.450> masters<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.049> i<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.380> at

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the ones against masters that i can at

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.550 
the ones against masters that i can at
first<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.689> then<00:01:51.689> move<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.229> other<00:01:52.350> ones

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
first and then move on to the other ones

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.440 
first and then move on to the other ones
i<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:52.680> that'll<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.040> better<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.549> pretty

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
i think that'll be better but pretty

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.539 
i think that'll be better but pretty
much<00:01:54.860> that's<00:01:55.860> pretty<00:01:56.070> much<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.219> basic

attainable<00:02:20.160> but<00:02:20.280> anyways<00:02:20.900> let<00:02:21.900> me<00:02:21.990> break<00:02:22.230> down

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
attainable but anyways let me break down

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.480 
attainable but anyways let me break down
the<00:02:22.470> class<00:02:22.650> setups<00:02:22.950> real<00:02:23.100> quickly<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.430> then

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
the class setups real quickly and then

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.440 
the class setups real quickly and then
I'll<00:02:23.580> talk<00:02:23.730> some<00:02:23.880> more<00:02:23.970> about<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.180> gameplay

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
I'll talk some more about the gameplay

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.320 
I'll talk some more about the gameplay
and<00:02:24.600> stuff<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:26.940> guys<00:02:27.060> saw<00:02:27.209> in<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
and stuff so you guys saw in the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330 
and stuff so you guys saw in the
beginning<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.660> using<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.990> scorpion<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.650> then

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
beginning of using a scorpion and then

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.620 
beginning of using a scorpion and then
I'm<00:02:29.430> switching<00:02:29.700> over<00:02:29.850> here<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.209> Remington

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
I'm switching over here to the Remington

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.270 
I'm switching over here to the Remington
and<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.440> actually<00:02:31.560> meant<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.950> switch<00:02:32.130> the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
and I actually meant to switch the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.860 
and I actually meant to switch the
Remington<00:02:32.610> for<00:02:32.790> down<00:02:32.940> low<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.420> didn't<00:02:33.690> die

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
Remington for down low but I didn't die

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.540 
Remington for down low but I didn't die
so<00:02:34.290> then<00:02:34.470> when<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:34.800> finally<00:02:34.950> died<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.459> was

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
so then when I finally died it was

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.250 
so then when I finally died it was
already<00:02:35.730> back<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> top<00:02:36.390> hill<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:37.200> I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
already back to the top hill so I

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.600 
already back to the top hill so I
decided<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.770> just<00:02:37.830> stick<00:02:38.220> with<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.459> and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
decided to just stick with it and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.920 
decided to just stick with it and
actually<00:02:38.880> end<00:02:39.150> up<00:02:39.209> working<00:02:39.390> out<00:02:39.600> pretty<00:02:39.810> well

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
actually end up working out pretty well

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.760 
actually end up working out pretty well
for<00:02:40.050> me<00:02:40.350> but<00:02:42.080> pretty<00:02:43.080> much<00:02:43.110> for<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:43.410> scorpion

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770

for my streaks you guys can see there's

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.740 
for my streaks you guys can see there's
some<00:03:13.620> normal<00:03:13.980> streaks<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.510> hell<00:03:15.510> storm

some normal streaks of hell storm
lightning<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.320> century<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:16.920> think<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.130> probably

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
lightning and century I think I probably

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.560 
lightning and century I think I probably
could've<00:03:17.580> got<00:03:17.670> still<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.910> chopper<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.209> this<00:03:18.420> as

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
could've got still a chopper in this as

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.539 
could've got still a chopper in this as
well<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.959> think<00:03:19.860> right<00:03:19.980> there<00:03:20.190> where<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.370> just

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
well I think right there where I just

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.190 
well I think right there where I just
died<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.760> almost<00:03:21.180> overlap<00:03:21.630> my<00:03:21.750> streets<00:03:22.019> that

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
died I almost overlap my streets that

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.229 
died I almost overlap my streets that
probably<00:03:22.470> been<00:03:22.680> Estelle<00:03:22.920> chopper<00:03:23.280> but<00:03:24.209> I

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
probably been Estelle chopper but I

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.170 
probably been Estelle chopper but I

gym hill or the weight room side Hill

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.110

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
and then the down low Hill basically

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.370 
and then the down low Hill basically
they<00:04:21.269> had<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.479> anchor<00:04:21.810> for<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:22.080> way<00:04:22.169> troops

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.680 
they had the anchor for that way troops
ide<00:04:22.590> Hill<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.120> we<00:04:24.120> couldn't<00:04:24.270> break<00:04:24.510> him<00:04:24.539> in

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
ide Hill and we couldn't break him in

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.940 
ide Hill and we couldn't break him in
because<00:04:24.810> we're<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.020> man<00:04:25.229> down<00:04:25.260> so<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.830> was

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
because we're a man down so it was

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.680 
because we're a man down so it was
really<00:04:26.039> hard<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.310> break<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.669> so

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
really hard to break it so

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.450 
really hard to break it so
I<00:04:27.780> don't<00:04:28.350> know<00:04:28.410> they<00:04:28.770> came<00:04:28.920> back<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.130> little<00:04:29.220> bit

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.150 
the other team then you should be able
to<00:04:54.090> win<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:54.360> three<00:04:54.600> on<00:04:54.690> this<00:04:54.840> map<00:04:55.050> but<00:04:55.380> on

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
to win the three on this map but on

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.980 
to win the three on this map but on
bigger<00:04:56.790> maps<00:04:57.000> say<00:04:57.240> like<00:04:57.360> Yemen<00:04:57.540> or<00:04:57.750> something

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
bigger maps say like Yemen or something

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.270 
bigger maps say like Yemen or something
would<00:04:58.080> be<00:04:58.200> very<00:04:58.320> hard<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.620> learn<00:04:58.740> three<00:04:58.980> people

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
would be very hard to learn three people

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.820 
would be very hard to learn three people
but<00:04:59.370> anyways<00:05:00.290> that's<00:05:01.290> pretty<00:05:01.380> mature<00:05:01.560> for<00:05:01.650> the
