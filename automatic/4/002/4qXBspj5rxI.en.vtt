00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.119 
match in the online qualifier for Dallas
which<00:00:39.930> means<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.739> play<00:00:40.920> through

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
which means that we have to play through

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.799 
which means that we have to play through
the<00:00:41.219> open<00:00:41.520> bracket<00:00:41.879> or<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> amateur<00:00:42.420> bracket

the open bracket or the amateur bracket
which<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.649> really<00:00:43.920> shitty<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:44.430> it

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
which is really shitty because it

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.350 
which is really shitty because it
shouldn't<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.690> been<00:00:45.780> online<00:00:45.989> like<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.360> don't

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
shouldn't have been online like I don't

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.049 
shouldn't have been online like I don't
know<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:49.140> just<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.620> don't<00:00:50.219> understand<00:00:50.850> why

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
know it's just I don't understand why

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.250 
know it's just I don't understand why
they<00:00:51.210> would<00:00:51.239> make<00:00:51.480> something<00:00:51.750> online

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
they would make something online

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200 
they would make something online
whenever<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.829> stakes<00:00:53.129> are<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.460> high<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
whenever the stakes are that high to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.389 
whenever the stakes are that high to
qualify<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.410> tournament<00:00:55.590> because<00:00:56.010> some

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
qualify for the tournament because some

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.000 
qualify for the tournament because some
teams<00:00:56.670> play<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> lot<00:00:57.840> better<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.170> land<00:00:58.559> then

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
teams play a lot better on land then

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.420 
teams play a lot better on land then
online<00:00:59.190> such<00:00:59.789> as<00:00:59.820> our<00:01:00.120> team<00:01:00.530> because<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.770> big

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
online such as our team because a big

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.640 
online such as our team because a big
timer<00:01:02.699> doesn't<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.180> best<00:01:03.390> connection

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
timer doesn't have the best connection

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
timer doesn't have the best connection
Joey<00:01:04.650> doesn't<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> best<00:01:05.400> connection

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
Joey doesn't have the best connection

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.340 
Joey doesn't have the best connection
all<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> time<00:01:06.270> me<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:06.810> usually<00:01:07.200> have

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
all the time me and not usually have

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
all the time me and not usually have
pretty<00:01:07.590> consistent<00:01:08.220> connections<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:08.820> then

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
pretty consistent connections but then

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.960 
pretty consistent connections but then
that's<00:01:09.150> about<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.549> know<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.820> really

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that's about it so you know it's really

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.940 
that's about it so you know it's really
tough<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.299> us<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.869> able<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.110> excel<00:01:13.530> online

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
tough for us to be able to excel online

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.130 
tough for us to be able to excel online
and<00:01:14.220> win<00:01:14.430> as<00:01:14.700> much<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.180> do<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.509> land<00:01:15.840> it's

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
and win as much as we do on land it's

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.039 
and win as much as we do on land it's
just<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.560> tough<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.670> sucks<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.119> it

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
just it's tough and it sucks that it

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.560 
just it's tough and it sucks that it
came<00:01:19.320> down<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.680> best<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.070> threes<00:01:20.400> online<00:01:21.060> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you go trying to hit those heads but

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.649

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
this guy's a slippery ass pickle but

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.789 
this guy's a slippery ass pickle but
like<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.780> said<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.200> they<00:01:46.320> would<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.590> would

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
like I said if they would just would

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.679 
like I said if they would just would
have<00:01:46.890> done<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.310> big<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.060> know<00:01:48.090> bracket

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
have done it for a big you know bracket

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.200 
have done it for a big you know bracket
and<00:01:48.840> wherever<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.710> won<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.549> got<00:01:50.670> seeded<00:01:51.000> I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and wherever you won you got seeded I

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.179 
and wherever you won you got seeded I
think<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.540> would<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:51.720> been<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.840> lot<00:01:52.020> better

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
think that would have been a lot better

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.710 
think that would have been a lot better
it's<00:01:53.189> still<00:01:53.460> what<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:54.299> wouldn't<00:01:54.630> have

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
it's still what a it wouldn't have

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.200 
it's still what a it wouldn't have
randomized<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.560> bracket<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.000> wouldn't

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
randomized the bracket but it wouldn't

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.959 
randomized the bracket but it wouldn't
have<00:01:57.329> made<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.719> how<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.009> now<00:01:59.250> which<00:01:59.790> is

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
have made it how it is now which is

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.030 
have made it how it is now which is
basically<00:02:00.380> teams<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.560> are<00:02:01.680> better<00:02:01.799> online

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
basically teams that are better online

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.100 
basically teams that are better online
are<00:02:02.610> gonna<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.180> championship<00:02:03.420> bracket

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
are gonna be in the championship bracket

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.359 
are gonna be in the championship bracket
which<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.350> going<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.500> give<00:02:04.680> them<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> better

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
which is going to give them a better

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.119 
which is going to give them a better
chance<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:06.350> placing<00:02:07.350> Pro<00:02:07.560> they<00:02:07.799> pretty<00:02:08.009> much

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
chance of placing Pro they pretty much

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.100 
chance of placing Pro they pretty much
already<00:02:08.399> placed<00:02:08.819> Pro<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.840> they

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
already placed Pro if they if they

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.410 
already placed Pro if they if they
qualify<00:02:10.619> through<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> online<00:02:11.400> qualifier<00:02:12.150> so

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
qualify through the online qualifier so

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.550 
qualify through the online qualifier so
it's<00:02:12.840> just<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.140> sort<00:02:13.319> of

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
it's just it's sort of

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.380 
it's just it's sort of
