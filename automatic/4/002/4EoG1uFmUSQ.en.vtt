00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.200
 As a Moroccan, I like to come to people's homes 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.189
 as a result of, among other things, being in line 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.159
 so we have not yet sat at home 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:17.999
 9 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:20.570
 the 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.859
 being central 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.170
 We only know that really is a lot of this I just had all the time 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:28.159
 making jokes 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.300
 the share boeing most I think 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.540
 it is a certain profession that just needs to be very serious 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.220
 for example, daughters 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.820
 I still want my daughter to be unsure because the man could sit the children 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.810
 now does the photos 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.780
 so is the fourth round 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.120
 already 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.120
 magath 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.170
 hahahahahaha he there the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.520
 extra calls were made to live there 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.450
 I read an expensive lawyers The Netherlands is those lawyers only one day 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.180
 general public not placed 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.180
 sleep well believe 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.410
 a crystals and 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.720
 there could have been at that time where the 23 prisoners escaped in the time that 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.830
 he got the job and nothing to do with it or so on at 23 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.680
 and then the prison jail profession is bad 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.850
 that was also the case where the second prisoners had released it 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.850
 and they have a grinder to smuggle in 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.860
 in which steps they do not 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.860
 I can imagine if your feet are one of the city the escaped one 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.030
 fourth car way it is makers link together one 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.350
 one there has the bin read the cake here on the map 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.840
 it should not meet this matter 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.340
 I have I imagine you have the win huh 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.240
 and the sound and a hacksaw that sounds very different from the sound of 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.910
 grinding wheel 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.910
 but the sound of cozy demands 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.430
 thousands of countrymen have gone abroad 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.229
 no I did not contain any commercial messages
