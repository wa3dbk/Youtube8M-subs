00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.890
 the last time i'm listening 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.929
 experience in Zoetermeer ended on 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.219

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.290
 this pressed into my hands the tons 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.480
 Luka forms a bit that arrive 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.890
 we dress from wood to concrete 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.330

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.840

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.140
 chapelle 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.140
 er thread 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.430
 oh is nice that you are there 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.960
 absolutely with it might come again but 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.700
 now it was true that I was in last time 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.720
 the car was full of pressing questions and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.940
 he was whole or forgot to ask 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.010
 how many cubes is there in this? 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.150
 up to 10,000 in the garment sit 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.160
 5000 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.559
 period but we work is because we 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.940
 intro hey but well mean it's mine 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.840
 a little higher and a completely different branch 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.080
 sport 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.350
 look further my dress ah 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.239
 concrete or wood was impossible it is it 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.950
 The concrete is also beautiful, yes Kevin 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.289
 think trind pull your liquid away 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.030
 And then you can stop these effects with it 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.220
 reach then I actually see 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.930
 have to see much more of it so once 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.330
 go watch 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.050
 you've never arrived that fast 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.050
 I want to show you something 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.689
 what did you do with 19 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.420
 for the sake of the research, I think 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.100
 little bit cold with your building environment 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.200
 if you see it this way then it feels 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.979
 very different to the contrary is your 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.020
 proven 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.190
 organic of course but it is him 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.020
 of course so many people 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.030
 so many wishes and one finds this more beautiful 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.350
 kind here but the other one passing through in one 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.149
 other color what can you do about the colors 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.130
 tell these people for one 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.500
 taupe color I chose but would be black 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.100
 can take or go to very extreme 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.530
 colors 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.960
 I want to touch albert what strikes me 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.909
 that the worksheet both here and here and 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.810
 the wall that looks like it itself became it is 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.179
 the same 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.610
 it is both concrete structures and 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.009
 any kind of structure in making fur or 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.179
 not tied glimpse 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.179
 actually it applicable everywhere 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.480
 what strikes me is that the windowsill 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.460
 actually in the same material 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.500
 but the color on the because how 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.540
 is that established spectrum 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.000
 color spectrum colors are colors that 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.890
 being a DNA bank from a family 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.890
 therefore supple fit together 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.380
 if talking about the floors have some 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.580
 I see that it is very present 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.640
 actually lives 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.440
 each organic on paraffin in water 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.610
 were fien kitchen polished 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.230
 fit 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.820
 a whole new story because of that 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.350
 but sometime for coming back 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.760
