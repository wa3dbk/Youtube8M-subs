00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 the alcamo leaves the scene and does so second 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.779
 the usual trend that has characterized 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.240
 almost the entire season 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.849
 so much bad luck and no help from 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.679
 arbitration decisions also yesterday in the first 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.330
 play offs with marsala i 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.880
 kiko guys besides not deserving 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.250
 absolutely defeat they had 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.350
 to say about the many yellow cards 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.779
 suffered against only 1 per 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.060
 opponents and on a couple of occasions 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.640
 decisive the network canceled at the 26th 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.349
 of the recovery and the rigor granted to 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.960
 blues in the seventh of the second 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.610
 so much misfortune therefore for 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.309
 the alcamo in this season finale 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.739
 there are still ninety in the eyes 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.260
 minutes against a buried Leonfortian 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.890
 by actions and by the game but promoted into 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.230
 series d 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.570
 but let's order riccardo chicco in 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.399
 forward prefers the young Maltese to 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.039
 galluccio while sandri leaves in 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.989
 bench refines that boarded the alcamo 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.329
 it starts right away shows that it is 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.059
 the basin shook from the mind 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.250
 leonfortese in the seventh the first danger 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.040
 with a nice shot of the Maltese savior who 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.270
 ends one meter to the side at 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.460
 fourteenth we try palazzone la 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.280
 his conclusion goes even closer to 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.170
 marsala riser no news from 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.119
 seventeenth one placed roll of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.369
 cardinals and ends a little high on 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.740
 brings the landlords to him 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.600
 they insist and it's up to Russello to jump well 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.119
 head on corner without though 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.009
 address its gossamer well i 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.200
 bianconeri control the marvelously 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.479
 match and only one before the rest 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.909
 amazing recovery of bonino stops the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.560
 counterattack of the Alcamo of the recovery e 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.540
 the marsala to take the field more 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.820
 motivated and by the tenth goes very close to 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.310
 goal before norfo that is stopped 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.200
 prodigiously and has given back and then the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.729
 close blunda conclusion but 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.009
 neutralized by a miracle of 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.439
 conticelli the blues now do 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.149
 game but do not sting that much indeed 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.979
 are the bianconeri at eighteenth a 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.570
 miss the advantage at the conclusion of 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.840
 an opportunity arose from the punishment 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.240
 kicked by of donated to the 26th le 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.829
 first protests of the ball landlords 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.500
 recovered in fast midfield 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.630
 penetration and faith networks for the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.469
 linesmen talk bitro friulano and the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.490
 offside 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.100
 then they light up minds 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.900
 few in the stands and at the 43rd the alcamo 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.510
 it still becomes dangerous with a stroke 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.670
 of cardinal head you go to 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.070
 additional and in the first with the teams 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.440
 exhausted there is nothing to tell i 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.360
 second 15 minutes are decisive 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.250
 the second galluzzo mulls into 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.500
 counter-attack but a beautiful mind 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.270
 combination with cardinal and then al 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.310
 seventh the rigor 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.720
 the expert is clever norfo you touch at 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.090
 limit of the area with alderuccio 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.790
 the latter then clashes with ermini 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.160
 while norfo falls to the ground in area from 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.740
 diskette beats alcamese ciccio 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.870
 pirrone 1 to 0 and finished game 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.460
 kiko 's guys get off balance the 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.770
 marsala on the break and gets a 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.960
 another strict rigor doubles from the 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.030
 alcamo disk at home with so much 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.760
 bitterness marsala rage at the final play 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.500
 off on the parma ground or not dancing 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.140
 we have had so much luck in this 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.210
 championship we played openly 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.280
 all the races we have touched on 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.360
 you have seen these playoffs promotion 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.010
 you too 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.840
 we have been unlucky we have not been 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.230
 good at closing the game in different 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.690
 occasions from Marsala to blazon of 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.340
 marsala that however came here and has 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.140
 made his mestissima a game e 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.100
 so congratulations to the marsala for the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.900
 I continue 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.240
 in short, if we want to find a fault 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.030
 of this team is the fact that 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.880
 builds so many goal balls so much game 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.170
 but the report also marks very little 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.170
 you're shot and eventually made them to 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.760
 facts and therefore accordingly 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.180
 let's say that 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.220
 we were marked and then in the end 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.290
 we have created throughout the championship 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.299
 several goal balls a lot of goal ball 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.739
 we arrived there the goddess luck 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.470
 bendata was against us 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.700
 bitterness for bad luck or maybe for 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.829
 some arbitrage not really 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.329
 friendly because in short you had to 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.890
 fight against everything and everyone 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.930
 without receiving any help 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.209
 I don't think we received any 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.599
 help this is the management school 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.629
 players and technicians that day after 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.980
 day they made so many sacrifices there 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.959
 we have arrived at this and therefore we are 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.510
 we are happy with this too 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.430
 now a few weeks of rest and then 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.130
 we will think about the near future 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.620
 I had prepared the game in the arc 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.030
 of the first 90 minutes and then in the 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.220
 remaining extra time because 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.419
 I knew we had to face one of the 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.430
 best teams in the league one 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.840
 team that is hard to beat that 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.760
 he had almost never lost 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.860
 we know about the defensive force 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.449
 alcohol so you have guys from 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.380
 try not to go under because in 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.630
 that case would become 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.010
 very difficult to recover went well 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.960
 on that penalty kick then we were 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.300
 good at managing the game after that 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.380
 however it rewards the marsala extremely 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.849
 compared to what we saw on 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.620
 field no 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.720
 but this is a game where we 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.580
 we had to repeat only one result already 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.470
 i played last year i did the 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.990
 playout and I know what it means to play on 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.010
 two results we played one 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.260
 game reminds me of last year 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.190
 very bad we did we 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.650
 we knew we absolutely had to 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.539
 win I didn't think you could 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.190
 play great football as well as for 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.199
 the field for the situation in which 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.300
 alcohol was in the field very well 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.919
 where he defended himself well and only how 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.370
 everything maybe in one episode could change 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.289
 the match 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.000
 thanking god it went well for us and 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.960
 I'm sorry for the atom that I think is 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.349
 one of the best trainings in 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.349
 championship
