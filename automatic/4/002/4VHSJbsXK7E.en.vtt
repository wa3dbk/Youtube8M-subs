actually<00:03:18.540> he<00:03:18.660> did<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> bunch<00:03:19.049> of<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.350> art<00:03:20.190> on

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
actually he did a bunch of the art on

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.910 
actually he did a bunch of the art on
second<00:03:21.600> thoughts<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.870> brutal<00:03:22.170> legend<00:03:22.470> he

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
second thoughts and brutal legend he

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.590 
second thoughts and brutal legend he
drew<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.250> really<00:03:23.640> awesome<00:03:23.820> kind<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.450> like

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
drew this really awesome kind of like

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.259 
drew this really awesome kind of like
smoky<00:03:25.230> shadowy<00:03:25.590> figures<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.250> had<00:03:26.400> these<00:03:26.549> TVs

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
smoky shadowy figures that had these TVs

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.539 
smoky shadowy figures that had these TVs
embedded<00:03:27.810> in<00:03:27.930> them<00:03:28.110> just<00:03:28.739> super<00:03:28.980> fun<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.310> shoot

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
embedded in them just super fun to shoot

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.180 
embedded in them just super fun to shoot
basically<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:31.110> took<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.680> as<00:03:31.890> like<00:03:32.040> the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
basically so I took that as like the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.400 
basically so I took that as like the
original<00:03:32.519> concept<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.150> we<00:03:33.780> got<00:03:33.900> Peter<00:03:34.140> Chan

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
original concept and we got Peter Chan

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.860 
original concept and we got Peter Chan
to<00:03:34.950> help<00:03:35.130> out<00:03:35.280> through<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:35.790> idea<00:03:36.060> at<00:03:36.390> him<00:03:36.690> and

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
to help out through that idea at him and

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.539 
to help out through that idea at him and
like<00:03:36.989> what's<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.290> craziest<00:03:37.709> teeny<00:03:38.070> monster

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
like what's the craziest teeny monster

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.789 
like what's the craziest teeny monster
Peter<00:03:39.060> Chan<00:03:39.299> can<00:03:39.570> come<00:03:39.720> up<00:03:39.840> with<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:40.200> he<00:03:40.470> came

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
Peter Chan can come up with so he came

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.920 
Peter Chan can come up with so he came
up<00:03:40.950> with<00:03:41.040> these<00:03:41.190> really<00:03:41.610> organic<00:03:42.540> kind<00:03:42.780> of

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
up with these really organic kind of

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.580 
up with these really organic kind of
insectoid<00:03:44.150> monovision<00:03:45.150> enemies

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
insectoid monovision enemies

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.420 
insectoid monovision enemies
in<00:03:47.590> each<00:03:47.710> mission<00:03:47.920> you're<00:03:48.160> going<00:03:48.280> to<00:03:48.340> be

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
in each mission you're going to be

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.130 
in each mission you're going to be
defending<00:03:48.880> one<00:03:49.240> or<00:03:49.360> more<00:03:49.450> buildings<00:03:49.870> from

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
defending one or more buildings from

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.170 
defending one or more buildings from
these<00:03:50.260> waves<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:50.890> mana<00:03:51.370> vision<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:51.820> hackers

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
these waves of mana vision and hackers

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.450 
these waves of mana vision and hackers
so<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:52.840> can<00:03:53.110> start<00:03:53.260> out<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:53.560> you<00:03:53.650> we<00:03:54.280> give<00:03:54.430> you

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
so you can start out and you we give you

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.040 
so you can start out and you we give you
a<00:03:54.610> decent<00:03:55.030> amount<00:03:55.330> of<00:03:55.360> scrap<00:03:55.660> that's<00:03:55.960> the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
a decent amount of scrap that's the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.840 
a decent amount of scrap that's the
resource<00:03:56.350> in<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.530> game<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:57.550> there's<00:03:57.760> no

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
resource in the game and there's no

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.060 
resource in the game and there's no
towers<00:03:58.300> on<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.510> field<00:03:58.720> so<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.650> first<00:03:59.890> wave

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
towers on the field so the first wave

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.580 
towers on the field so the first wave
will<00:04:00.220> come<00:04:00.340> in<00:04:00.520> and<00:04:00.880> from<00:04:01.810> there<00:04:02.020> it's<00:04:02.290> pretty

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
will come in and from there it's pretty

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.320 
will come in and from there it's pretty
much<00:04:02.740> you<00:04:03.070> you<00:04:03.370> know<00:04:03.460> despite<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.970> your

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
much you you know despite of your

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.420 
much you you know despite of your
weapons<00:04:04.710> there's<00:04:05.710> some<00:04:05.830> downtime<00:04:06.220> in<00:04:06.400> between

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
weapons there's some downtime in between

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.610 
weapons there's some downtime in between
the<00:04:06.790> waves<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.270> we<00:04:07.630> had<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.110> experiment<00:04:08.530> with

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
the waves and we had the experiment with

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.260 
the waves and we had the experiment with
that<00:04:08.770> with<00:04:09.100> like<00:04:09.130> how<00:04:09.400> much<00:04:09.520> downtime<00:04:09.760> is

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
that with like how much downtime is

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.940 
that with like how much downtime is
enough<00:04:10.540> because<00:04:11.050> if<00:04:11.440> we<00:04:11.530> don't<00:04:11.620> give<00:04:11.830> you

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
enough because if we don't give you

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.640 
enough because if we don't give you
enough<00:04:12.070> time<00:04:12.250> between<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.940> waves<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.900> sort<00:04:14.620> of

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
enough time between the waves it sort of

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.320 
enough time between the waves it sort of
becomes<00:04:14.920> really<00:04:15.220> frantic<00:04:15.580> like<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.150> game

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
becomes really frantic like the game

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.510 
becomes really frantic like the game
loses<00:04:17.110> that<00:04:17.260> strategic<00:04:17.830> element<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.340> feel

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
loses that strategic element you feel

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.130 
loses that strategic element you feel
really<00:04:18.880> rushed<00:04:19.180> everything<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:19.870> you<00:04:19.930> do

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
really rushed everything that you do

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.200 
really rushed everything that you do
people<00:04:20.560> are<00:04:20.620> just<00:04:20.680> stressed<00:04:21.520> out<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:21.940> not

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
people are just stressed out and not

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.850 
people are just stressed out and not
having<00:04:22.390> that<00:04:22.510> much<00:04:22.720> fun<00:04:22.750> on<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.530> other<00:04:23.650> side

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
having that much fun on the other side

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.800 
having that much fun on the other side
of<00:04:23.890> this<00:04:24.070> too<00:04:24.280> long<00:04:24.490> you<00:04:25.210> collect<00:04:25.540> all<00:04:25.720> the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
of this too long you collect all the

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.480 
of this too long you collect all the
resources<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.320> make<00:04:26.800> your<00:04:26.920> decisions<00:04:27.310> about

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
resources you make your decisions about

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.740 
resources you make your decisions about
where<00:04:27.730> you're<00:04:27.820> gonna<00:04:27.880> put<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.180> turrets<00:04:28.480> and

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
where you're gonna put the turrets and

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.510 
where you're gonna put the turrets and
get<00:04:29.320> yourself<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.800> good<00:04:29.890> position<00:04:29.950> for<00:04:30.340> the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
get yourself in a good position for the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.520 
get yourself in a good position for the
next<00:04:30.730> enemy<00:04:30.850> wave<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.450> then<00:04:32.110> you<00:04:32.230> just<00:04:32.380> kind

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
next enemy wave and then you just kind

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.230 
next enemy wave and then you just kind
of<00:04:32.650> sit<00:04:32.860> there<00:04:33.040> yeah<00:04:33.520> I<00:04:33.550> took<00:04:33.670> some<00:04:33.970> back<00:04:34.090> and

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
of sit there yeah I took some back and

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.420 
of sit there yeah I took some back and
forth<00:04:34.330> to<00:04:34.690> get<00:04:34.810> it<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.530> point<00:04:35.740> where<00:04:36.040> it's

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
forth to get it to the point where it's

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.310 
forth to get it to the point where it's
I<00:04:36.790> think<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.660> don't<00:04:37.780> want<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:37.960> give<00:04:38.050> away<00:04:38.080> all<00:04:38.290> my

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
I think I don't want to give away all my

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.550 
I think I don't want to give away all my
secrets<00:04:38.470> but<00:04:38.950> it's<00:04:39.370> about<00:04:39.580> it's<00:04:39.880> perfect<00:04:40.540> I

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.830 

think<00:04:44.560> changing<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.310> core<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.390> chassis<00:04:46.810> of

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
think changing the core the chassis of

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.750 
think changing the core the chassis of
the<00:04:46.930> mech<00:04:47.170> is<00:04:47.410> really<00:04:47.770> fundamental<00:04:48.040> like<00:04:48.580> so

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
the mech is really fundamental like so

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.490 
the mech is really fundamental like so
you<00:04:48.850> can<00:04:48.970> pick<00:04:49.180> between<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:49.810> smaller

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
you can pick between the smaller

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.500 
you can pick between the smaller

so<00:05:04.300> we<00:05:04.390> let<00:05:04.540> you<00:05:04.630> change<00:05:04.750> with<00:05:04.930> chassis<00:05:05.320> the

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
so we let you change with chassis the

so we let you change with chassis the
legs<00:05:06.690> weapons<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:08.530> emplacements<00:05:09.250> then<00:05:09.970> we

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
legs weapons the emplacements then we

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.850 
legs weapons the emplacements then we
have<00:05:10.210> some<00:05:10.390> vanity<00:05:10.870> options<00:05:11.410> on<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.650> top<00:05:11.830> of

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
have some vanity options on the top of

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.410 
have some vanity options on the top of
that<00:05:12.040> I<00:05:12.340> knew<00:05:12.700> that<00:05:12.850> I<00:05:12.910> really<00:05:13.120> want<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.300> do

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
that I knew that I really want to do

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.750 
that I knew that I really want to do
from<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:13.720> get-go<00:05:13.990> at<00:05:14.140> trenches<00:05:14.610> make<00:05:15.610> the

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
from the get-go at trenches make the

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.670 
from the get-go at trenches make the
scale<00:05:16.000> a<00:05:16.030> lot<00:05:16.240> smaller<00:05:16.600> so<00:05:17.350> that<00:05:17.380> you<00:05:17.560> can

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
scale a lot smaller so that you can

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.310 
scale a lot smaller so that you can
always<00:05:17.890> see<00:05:18.130> your<00:05:18.720> your<00:05:19.720> trench<00:05:20.020> Marine<00:05:20.290> on

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
always see your your trench Marine on

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.650 
always see your your trench Marine on
the<00:05:20.560> screen<00:05:20.860> at<00:05:21.070> all<00:05:21.280> times<00:05:21.550> so<00:05:22.210> this<00:05:22.330> lets<00:05:22.540> us

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
the screen at all times so this lets us

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.960 
the screen at all times so this lets us
do<00:05:22.840> like<00:05:23.050> cool<00:05:23.290> vanity<00:05:23.710> options<00:05:24.070> like<00:05:24.400> like

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
do like cool vanity options like like

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.730 
do like cool vanity options like like
hats<00:05:25.180> and<00:05:25.480> jackets<00:05:25.600> in<00:05:26.080> between<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:26.500> mission

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
hats and jackets in between the mission

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.960 
hats and jackets in between the mission
you're<00:05:26.950> running<00:05:27.190> around<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.490> ship<00:05:27.730> and

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
you're running around the ship and

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.640 
you're running around the ship and
you're<00:05:28.090> actually<00:05:28.210> running<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:28.930> pilot<00:05:29.380> around

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
you're actually running the pilot around

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.320 
you're actually running the pilot around
rather<00:05:29.980> than<00:05:30.130> running<00:05:30.340> your<00:05:30.580> your<00:05:31.030> trench

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
rather than running your your trench

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.930 
rather than running your your trench
around<00:05:31.480> and<00:05:31.870> so<00:05:32.350> it<00:05:32.740> lets<00:05:33.130> you<00:05:33.340> have<00:05:33.520> this<00:05:33.670> more

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
around and so it lets you have this more

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.990 
around and so it lets you have this more
like<00:05:34.030> human<00:05:34.360> connection<00:05:34.810> to<00:05:35.550> to<00:05:36.550> the<00:05:36.730> actual

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
like human connection to to the actual

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.940 
like human connection to to the actual
giant<00:05:37.270> robot<00:05:37.720> like<00:05:37.960> so<00:05:38.140> instead<00:05:38.650> of<00:05:38.710> just

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
giant robot like so instead of just

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.500 
giant robot like so instead of just
feeling<00:05:39.130> like<00:05:39.370> a<00:05:39.430> giant<00:05:39.670> robot<00:05:40.030> you're

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
feeling like a giant robot you're

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.879 
feeling like a giant robot you're
feeling<00:05:40.900> like

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
feeling like

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.730 
feeling like
the<00:05:42.009> actual<00:05:42.490> guy<00:05:43.330> who's<00:05:43.659> piloting<00:05:44.259> the<00:05:44.530> big

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
the actual guy who's piloting the big

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.040 
the actual guy who's piloting the big
giant<00:05:45.249> really<00:05:46.210> hit<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.360> sweet<00:05:46.569> spot<00:05:46.629> with<00:05:47.020> the

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
giant really hit a sweet spot with the

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.469 
giant really hit a sweet spot with the
number<00:05:47.319> of<00:05:47.409> customization<00:05:48.039> options<00:05:48.340> you<00:05:49.060> end

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
number of customization options you end

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.179 
number of customization options you end
up<00:05:49.629> changing<00:05:49.990> it<00:05:50.259> a<00:05:50.319> lot<00:05:50.499> like<00:05:50.770> and<00:05:50.889> we<00:05:50.979> throwed

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:51.189 
up changing it a lot like and we throwed

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:53.550 
up changing it a lot like and we throwed
it<00:05:51.310> for<00:05:51.430> challenges<00:05:51.849> at<00:05:51.999> you<00:05:52.180> so<00:05:52.719> that<00:05:52.900> you<00:05:53.110> you

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
it for challenges at you so that you you

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.649 
it for challenges at you so that you you
really<00:05:54.249> have<00:05:54.490> to<00:05:54.699> be<00:05:54.729> changing<00:05:55.210> it<00:05:55.300> up<00:05:55.360> to<00:05:55.569> be

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
really have to be changing it up to be

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:57.119 
really have to be changing it up to be
successful<00:05:56.259> there's<00:05:56.620> some<00:05:56.740> depth<00:05:56.949> and

00:05:57.119 --> 00:05:57.129 
successful there's some depth and

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:58.920 
successful there's some depth and
complexity<00:05:57.550> to<00:05:57.819> it<00:05:57.849> like<00:05:58.180> we<00:05:58.330> didn't<00:05:58.569> we

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
complexity to it like we didn't we

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.110 
complexity to it like we didn't we
didn't<00:05:59.110> completely<00:05:59.560> gut<00:05:59.979> what<00:06:00.669> makes<00:06:00.879> Mecca

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
didn't completely gut what makes Mecca

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.080 
didn't completely gut what makes Mecca
is<00:06:01.330> great<00:06:02.249> it's<00:06:03.249> really<00:06:03.520> fun<00:06:03.729> watching<00:06:04.029> this

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
is great it's really fun watching this

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.399 
is great it's really fun watching this
game<00:06:04.270> come<00:06:04.479> together<00:06:04.689> because<00:06:04.870> it<00:06:04.990> really<00:06:05.199> is

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
game come together because it really is

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:06.869 
game come together because it really is
a<00:06:05.439> game<00:06:05.650> i<00:06:05.770> think<00:06:05.800> that<00:06:06.039> proves<00:06:06.340> that<00:06:06.490> the

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:06.879 
a game i think that proves that the

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:08.700 
a game i think that proves that the
premise<00:06:07.870> of<00:06:07.960> what<00:06:08.110> we're<00:06:08.259> trying<00:06:08.409> to<00:06:08.499> do<00:06:08.680> with

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
premise of what we're trying to do with

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.529 
premise of what we're trying to do with
these<00:06:08.949> multiple<00:06:09.370> projects<00:06:09.789> which<00:06:09.939> is<00:06:10.090> explore

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
these multiple projects which is explore

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.719 
these multiple projects which is explore
creative<00:06:11.409> ideas<00:06:11.710> wherever<00:06:11.979> they<00:06:12.099> take<00:06:12.279> us<00:06:12.490> and

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
creative ideas wherever they take us and

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.249 
creative ideas wherever they take us and
letting<00:06:13.029> them<00:06:13.300> express<00:06:13.689> the<00:06:13.840> people<00:06:14.080> that<00:06:14.169> are

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
letting them express the people that are

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:15.570 
letting them express the people that are
making<00:06:14.349> them<00:06:14.680> i<00:06:14.800> think<00:06:14.830> drench<00:06:15.279> really

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
making them i think drench really

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.839 
making them i think drench really
expresses<00:06:16.150> Brad<00:06:17.020> and<00:06:17.349> his<00:06:17.379> take<00:06:18.069> on<00:06:18.189> games<00:06:18.520> and

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
expresses Brad and his take on games and

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:20.550 
expresses Brad and his take on games and
what<00:06:18.969> he<00:06:19.060> thinks<00:06:19.300> is<00:06:19.419> fun<00:06:19.659> and<00:06:19.960> in<00:06:20.289> the<00:06:20.409> same

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
what he thinks is fun and in the same

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.439 
what he thinks is fun and in the same
way<00:06:20.620> that<00:06:20.949> costume<00:06:21.639> quests<00:06:21.909> are<00:06:21.969> stacking

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
way that costume quests are stacking

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.050 
way that costume quests are stacking
once<00:06:23.169> upon<00:06:23.289> a<00:06:23.349> monster<00:06:23.740> reflect<00:06:24.490> the<00:06:24.789> people

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
once upon a monster reflect the people

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.580 
once upon a monster reflect the people
who<00:06:25.120> are<00:06:25.210> making<00:06:25.360> those<00:06:25.569> games<00:06:25.870> and<00:06:26.169> this<00:06:26.379> is<00:06:26.560> a

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
who are making those games and this is a

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.230 
who are making those games and this is a
game<00:06:26.830> that<00:06:26.860> seems<00:06:27.310> in<00:06:27.639> a<00:06:27.699> lot<00:06:27.879> of<00:06:27.909> ways<00:06:28.060> is

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
game that seems in a lot of ways is

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.939 
game that seems in a lot of ways is
different<00:06:28.659> than<00:06:28.810> stacking<00:06:29.289> in<00:06:29.409> costume<00:06:29.740> quest

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 
different than stacking in costume quest
