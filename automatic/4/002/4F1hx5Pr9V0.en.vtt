00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
I Andres this is Leonard taking the punt

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.030 
I Andres this is Leonard taking the punt
panda<00:00:06.390> transmission<00:00:07.379> apart<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:09.860> about<00:00:10.860> ready

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
panda transmission apart and about ready

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.709 
panda transmission apart and about ready
to<00:00:11.099> put<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.400> new<00:00:11.429> axles<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.150> so<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.389> took<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
to put the new axles in so I took the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.599 
to put the new axles in so I took the
diff<00:00:12.900> out<00:00:13.700> and<00:00:14.700> it's<00:00:15.509> not<00:00:15.960> looking<00:00:16.350> too<00:00:16.560> good

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
diff out and it's not looking too good

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.620 
diff out and it's not looking too good
this<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.500> transmission<00:00:19.500> here<00:00:20.630> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
this is the transmission here the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.450 
this is the transmission here the
synchros<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.170> good<00:00:22.320> everything<00:00:22.619> else<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.039> good

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
synchros is good everything else is good

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.250 
synchros is good everything else is good
about<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.730> transmission<00:00:25.640> except<00:00:26.869> as<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.140> can

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
about the transmission except as you can

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.429 
about the transmission except as you can
see<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.590> pinion<00:00:28.890> gear<00:00:30.109> teeth<00:00:31.109> they're<00:00:31.260> broke

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
see the pinion gear teeth they're broke

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.830 
see the pinion gear teeth they're broke
off<00:00:32.149> so<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.210> got<00:00:33.360> about<00:00:35.239> three<00:00:36.239> or<00:00:36.390> four<00:00:36.600> teeth

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
off so I got about three or four teeth

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.840 
off so I got about three or four teeth
that<00:00:37.500> are<00:00:37.649> damaged<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:40.460> with<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> amount<00:00:41.760> of

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
that are damaged and with the amount of

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.090 
that are damaged and with the amount of
motor<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.600> horsepower<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
motor and horsepower at that

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.790 
motor and horsepower at that
Luke<00:00:44.579> motor<00:00:44.820> puts<00:00:45.059> out<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.500> ripped<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
Luke motor puts out it just ripped the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130 
Luke motor puts out it just ripped the
rest<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.070> those<00:00:47.160> teeth<00:00:47.460> off<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.180> got<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> go

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
rest of those teeth off so I got to go

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.500 
rest of those teeth off so I got to go
find<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.469> ring<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.739> pinion<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.329> Austria<00:00:51.329> and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
find a ring and pinion in Austria and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.090 
find a ring and pinion in Austria and
pull<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.140> or<00:00:52.230> whatever<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.829> bring<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.070> back

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
pull in or whatever and bring it back

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.939 
pull in or whatever and bring it back
and<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.910> fit<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.079> transmission<00:00:55.710> case

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and and fit it to this transmission case

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.810 
and and fit it to this transmission case
so<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.989> synchronized<00:00:58.500> transmission<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
so the synchronized transmission is on a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.349 
so the synchronized transmission is on a
hold<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:02.219> other<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> nerve<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> one

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
hold and the other one the nerve the one

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.770 
hold and the other one the nerve the one
that<00:01:03.480> was<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> Fiat<00:01:04.049> 500<00:01:05.299> it's<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.510> brand

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
that was in the Fiat 500 it's like brand

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.950 
that was in the Fiat 500 it's like brand
new

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
new

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.480 
new
so<00:01:07.380> I'm<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> stick<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.040> one<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.250> all

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
so I'm going to stick this one in all

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.070 
so I'm going to stick this one in all
the<00:01:08.610> character<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.270> transmission<00:01:09.990> is

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the character this transmission is

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.010 
the character this transmission is
literally<00:01:11.010> brand<00:01:11.490> new<00:01:11.670> inside<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.900> we're

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
literally brand new inside so we're

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.539 
literally brand new inside so we're
gonna<00:01:13.110> stick<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.040> time<00:01:14.280> being

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
gonna stick this one in the time being

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.130 
gonna stick this one in the time being
and<00:01:14.760> then<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.450> want<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> five-speed<00:01:16.380> kit

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
and then you want to do a five-speed kit

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.109 
and then you want to do a five-speed kit
that's<00:01:19.140> something<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.670> build<00:01:20.880> here

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
going back in with the Pook engine you

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.580 
going back in with the Pook engine you
just<00:01:27.360> want<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> synchronized<00:01:28.350> first

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
just want to have a synchronized first

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.700 
just want to have a synchronized first
gear<00:01:28.860> or<00:01:28.890> second<00:01:29.340> gear<00:01:30.259> that's<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:31.619> now

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
gear or second gear that's it for now

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.980 
gear or second gear that's it for now
give<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.460> another<00:01:32.610> look<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:33.000> what's<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.720> on

here

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.290 
here
that's<00:01:36.470> what<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.860> opinion<00:01:37.460> looks<00:01:37.820> like<00:01:38.060> I<00:01:38.180> was

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
that's what the opinion looks like I was

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.480 
that's what the opinion looks like I was
reason<00:01:39.230> I<00:01:39.290> took<00:01:39.470> this<00:01:39.620> out<00:01:39.800> he's<00:01:40.010> got<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.370> new

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
reason I took this out he's got the new

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.070 
reason I took this out he's got the new
axle<00:01:40.880> shafts<00:01:41.120> here<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:41.510> we're<00:01:41.600> gonna<00:01:41.690> go<00:01:41.900> in

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
axle shafts here that we're gonna go in

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.070 
axle shafts here that we're gonna go in
it<00:01:42.170> which<00:01:43.130> are<00:01:43.250> shorter<00:01:43.610> so<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.720> pan<00:01:44.930> that's

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
it which are shorter so the pan that's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.750 
it which are shorter so the pan that's
got<00:01:45.290> longer<00:01:45.470> axles<00:01:46.010> you<00:01:46.130> got<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.340> put<00:01:46.490> shorter

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
got longer axles you got to put shorter

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.520 
got longer axles you got to put shorter
ones<00:01:46.940> in<00:01:47.120> to<00:01:47.240> run<00:01:47.330> them<00:01:47.480> in<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.660> boot<00:01:47.840> or<00:01:48.350> the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
ones in to run them in the boot or the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.390 
ones in to run them in the boot or the
Fiat<00:01:49.340> either<00:01:49.610> way<00:01:50.770> anyhow<00:01:51.770> upon<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.220> teardown
