00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.789
 le guennec and its important to start with the active designer 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:19.919
 Perhaps what is explained is that people who have eyelids 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.340
 fallen in this case to be a good example because 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.730
 this side of the world 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.789
 fallen 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.160
 not so quiet but at least unemployment increases enough of laws the line of 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.210
 the eyelashes therefore a perfect delineated clearly there is misery a 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.230
 bit 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.710
 and if to put it in some way 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.670
 the when and where wave line is when you notice much more difference with 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.970
 the margin of safety with a loaded eyeliner a little exaggerated perhaps for 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.650
 a more night look 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.210
 and names then do it soon because of the character 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.710
 the ciemat and margin fees came to win 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.620
 classic kate 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.620
 let's take then they would not have delineated 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.070
 You may want to honor the message that you specified 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.480
 and what is going to prove then what happens 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.080
 not unless we have the lower eyelid 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020
 we follow the natural line of the eye 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.180
 that we had opened 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.490
 already gave name in English 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.800
 on the screens 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.800
 and then the promise and yellow to follow 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.549
 I think that should be enough 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.250
 since he owes the drawn line 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.620
 in diagonal 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.620
 really common has to be demining 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.430
 so completely in the air a bit affected precisely in the match of 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.890
 Going 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.570
 that line will be completed before crown 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.209
 guadarrama variants and lourdes mind 11 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.859
 with an agreement here that is really ugly killer 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.840
 when you do not know how to correct them the truth you think you had a little 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:19.550
 almost integrate the team said that we have us parker 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.080
 I'm going to take out until Thursday and yesterday as Pete seeger plot to make them more and 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.350
 the same steps first we were attentive to a little bit of dignity 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.369
 while the base 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.839
 yoli usually what the factory in a bit the brother of the nobel 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.899
 Being here 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:38.899
 to deliver in all the hair series 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.899
 the gold you need the more you pulled yourself 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.709
 so let's keep the eye open like we would 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:54.139
 as a good person would not be good even allow me to break up and go 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.129
 to be aligned with the open eye 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.829
 We went to a I realized that the width of the Madrid ticket and as for that I 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.119
 I started working 

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:05.119
 tosello will ship heat 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.779
 and I'm going to start thinking about my line 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:26.219
 if they are fixed 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:27.539
 it's coming 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:32.159
 marked the line is still missing a little bit so we are going to apply 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.879
 junior master 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:44.899
 I'm telling you where the guidelines now require that you can see the 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.899
 effect 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:58.179
 7 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:03.329
 this same diagonal line and the sale balance and do not wobble though she 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.669
 It is still necessary that all makeup is lamented and that it feels the effect on 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:07.839
 line in the eye 

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:10.979
 despite their houses and jaÃ©n when I am low 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:16.400
 I read that they have a completely different form the perfect delineation and that 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.549
 always have to do 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.599
 so 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.879
 what you have to do is finish filling those lines 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:24.879
 abel luque removes the eye 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.259
 may involve a little more money than expected 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.719
 and the novel 'the city 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:36.860
 enough already exactly the subject points out that I have not even done 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.089
 according to the windbreaks of it and that this was a concession in the eye 

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:42.080
 why 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.680
 in milliseconds that does not die chestnuts the nothing therefore the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.990
 people do not realize this and in which they will spend with the eye closed 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.229
 all the time 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.170
 of the same 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.620
 what do you know that agassi 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.590
 the idea is that they know how to correct how good to clean an eye that has a 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.550
 palpado fall I know that does not be exaggerated 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.400
 that after the morning the brands analyze their state she has to solve 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.629
 can be 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.919
 manuel santiago is minimized depends on you this technique and services 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.519
 imposing soon in a video tutorial then just go take care
