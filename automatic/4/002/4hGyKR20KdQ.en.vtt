they<00:00:19.590> want<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.920> plan<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.490> they<00:00:20.670> were<00:00:20.730> in

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789

their<00:00:20.970> starfighters<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> thought<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.050> was

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
their starfighters I thought it was

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.929 
their starfighters I thought it was
pretty<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.470> cool<00:00:22.800> way<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.949> open<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.430> episode

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
pretty a cool way to open this episode

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.519 
pretty a cool way to open this episode
because<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.779> ever<00:00:24.900> really<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> lot<00:00:25.500> of

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
because we ever really see a lot of

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.410 
because we ever really see a lot of
Starfighter<00:00:26.099> acts<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:27.060> quite<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> while

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
Starfighter acts and in quite a while

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.359

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
and you know especially at all in the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.130 
and you know especially at all in the
season<00:00:29.670> 5<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.269> was<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> good<00:00:30.510> way<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.720> open<00:00:30.900> up

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
season 5 so it was a good way to open up

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.380 
season 5 so it was a good way to open up
the<00:00:31.199> episode<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:32.160> know<00:00:32.279> with<00:00:32.460> an<00:00:32.640> accent<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the episode you know with an accent and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.330 
the episode you know with an accent and
then<00:00:33.930> what<00:00:34.230> happened<00:00:34.530> was<00:00:34.710> after<00:00:34.950> they<00:00:35.190> were

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
then what happened was after they were

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.520 
then what happened was after they were
done<00:00:35.550> they<00:00:35.610> were<00:00:36.300> called<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.780> by<00:00:36.989> Master<00:00:37.350> Yoda

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
done they were called in by Master Yoda

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.139 
done they were called in by Master Yoda
because<00:00:37.890> apparently<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.460> judge<00:00:38.489> temper<00:00:39.030> was

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
because apparently the judge temper was

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.979 
because apparently the judge temper was
attacked<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.809> some<00:00:40.530> Jedi<00:00:41.540> clone<00:00:42.540> troopers

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
attacked and some Jedi clone troopers

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.869 
attacked and some Jedi clone troopers
and<00:00:43.320> some<00:00:43.559> other<00:00:43.710> civilians<00:00:44.250> were<00:00:44.340> killed<00:00:44.370> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and some other civilians were killed and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.560 
and some other civilians were killed and
injured<00:00:45.420> during<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.260> explosion<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.570> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
injured during the explosion and of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.180 
injured during the explosion and of
course<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> big<00:00:49.350> deal<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
course this was a big deal and that the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.760 
course this was a big deal and that the
Jedi<00:00:50.340> counter<00:00:50.820> had<00:00:51.059> thought<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.110> Jedi

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
Jedi counter had thought that a Jedi

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.229 
Jedi counter had thought that a Jedi
could<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:53.010> been<00:00:53.190> behind<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.640> attack<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
could have been behind this attack and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.700 
could have been behind this attack and
the<00:00:54.390> reason<00:00:54.690> why<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.870> because<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.500> know<00:00:55.590> with

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the reason why is because you know with

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.580 
the reason why is because you know with
this<00:00:55.829> war<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.199> Jedi<00:00:58.559> are

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
this war going on you know the Jedi are

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.229 
this war going on you know the Jedi are
not<00:00:58.800> supposed<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.399> these<00:00:59.579> generals<00:01:00.090> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
not supposed to be these generals and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.729 
not supposed to be these generals and
commanders<00:01:00.750> they're<00:01:01.230> supposed<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> be

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
commanders they're supposed to be

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.009 
commanders they're supposed to be
peacekeepers<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.460> then<00:01:02.789> longer<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.870> this

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
peacekeepers and then longer that this

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.530 
peacekeepers and then longer that this
war<00:01:04.320> goes<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.519> more<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.090> you'll<00:01:06.270> see

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
war goes on the more that you'll see

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.200 
war goes on the more that you'll see
more<00:01:06.780> Jedi<00:01:07.049> change<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.040> actually<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.119> know

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
was infected with the whole bunch of

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.899 
was infected with the whole bunch of
nano-droids<00:01:36.750> which<00:01:37.740> caused<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.340> explosion

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
nano-droids which caused the explosion

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.670

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
they agree with one another knowledge

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.370 
they agree with one another knowledge
situation<00:03:21.880> especially<00:03:22.030> how<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.840> Jedi<00:03:23.200> should

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380
