00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.020 
through that holds till the wheels on
once<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.840> get<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.080> first<00:01:28.140> four<00:01:29.070> screw<00:01:29.790> leg

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
once you get that first four screw leg

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.240 
once you get that first four screw leg
on<00:01:30.240> it'll<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.630> obvious<00:01:30.810> where<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.710> other<00:01:31.950> side

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
on it'll be obvious where the other side

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.710 
on it'll be obvious where the other side
of<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.670> because<00:01:32.880> two<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.270> legs<00:01:33.450> have

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
of that is because two of the legs have

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.380 
of that is because two of the legs have
a<00:01:33.750> through<00:01:34.500> hole<00:01:34.850> for<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> bolt<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.329> holds

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
a through hole for the bolt that holds

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.929 
a through hole for the bolt that holds
those<00:01:37.380> two<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.979> those<00:01:38.340> two<00:01:38.520> wheels<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.909> place

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
those two like those two wheels in place

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.030 
those two like those two wheels in place
look<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.930> first<00:01:40.170> get<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.740> and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
look for that first get that one on and

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.950 
look for that first get that one on and
everything<00:01:41.340> will<00:01:41.460> fall<00:01:41.490> into<00:01:41.820> place<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.720> last

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
everything will fall into place the last

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.359 
everything will fall into place the last
part<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.350> wanted<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.710> go<00:01:43.829> over<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.189> the
