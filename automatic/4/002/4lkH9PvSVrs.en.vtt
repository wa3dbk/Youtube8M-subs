00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.429
 we feel like we are introducing ourselves 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.939
 we wanted to get all of the new message with exactly that I was too 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.590
 shown carefully 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.310
 where all this is not just our hobby but also and said reputation 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.130
 that means many steps on the market 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.730
 but a lot of stress and risks by example no jobs at five 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.710
 Percent for possible 4 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.470
 if it goes well then that means freedom 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.300
 a lot of money for electricity 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.760
 18 11 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.950
 Schaffeld creates chaos APA 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.380
 some say that fits at all 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.440
 Caution makes us nine years old when we started as small children 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.040
 Lego male making stop motion movie 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.240
 and then the piece has evolved piece by piece that's ours 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.700
 Hobby we want to make 2004 we had our first small 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.100
 Digital camera to include small films made 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.100
 funny but also pretty cheap 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.580
 and year 2007 then got me our first own website where we then ours 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.619
 the first films have been shared with the world since the piece by piece has become 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.800
 has to be developed more and more trained 5 percent reported 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.060
 3d fect movie and so on and now we have our own business 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.140
 can be nice for you 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.270
 similarly rated 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.010
 three things would 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.830
 this effect will be 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.830
 Image montage and everything possible with media instead 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.180
 Exactly and if that's exactly what it is and then comes a chunk 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.039
 Websites the link can be found below in the cradle description 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.469
 Of course, having your own company also means that you can at best be one 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:13.150
 own office should have or even its own studio and exactly that 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.150
 we did 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.979
 Explain that the small patient self-made Award 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.339
 works and we can do a whole lot with the times 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:30.820
 In any case, evolve 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.740
 yes then the beginning of our animated School of Finance so seen and percent 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.740
 Enriched as exactly did 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.860
 Theol here you see and say that the logo or redeveloped and developed 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.179
 and designed 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.829
 You can do a lot with it, we'll be back later 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.829
 somewhere another nations percent of the votes 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.260
 we have used the 3D program for the logo clocks and some countries 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.559
 Achterfeld 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:09.499
 and Ronaldo will premiere exactly that are the drivers program and then we have 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:14.339
 still like DVDs from Video Copilot point with once used right here 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:15.709
 Cool, Fekter said 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.229
 and then here really cool video on demand for the explosion of custom and drew 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:21.149
 continue 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:26.209
 and the videos Ferrer the DVD is that you can so Satchmo at around 200 euros 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:30.049
 You can not buy for eviction 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.019
 so that looked like the original had that had its first in 3d 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.649
 at the 1 2 in Val d'or nominated and the construction of an underpass in the area 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:42.809
 flies 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:45.809
 we emigrated one 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.819
 around in three levels 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.309
 the hands of the rebels Abdel Fattah imported 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:57.399
 each level introduce the big and small ball and Antoine a and for 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:59.099
 Landlords combined 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.629
 the three levels 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.069
 we all clearly a vehicle here first in pink for testing bertest 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.499
 Send another one 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:11.659
 Sickle less promptly implemented Olofsson brought up to shine 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.379
 and then, for example, you see when the ball collides with your son 

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:17.299
 Allemand 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.630
 what would have inserted it can not stop that is how Nina sees it 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.629
 Smoke parliament from just me from this DVD 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:25.749
 used 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:28.959
 exactly and here, for example, here you can see such a problem » 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.479
 if we lose that 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.819
 and keep that from this DVD from Viveo Group 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.099
 but everything combines a step further Müller still 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.120
 No, there to mind 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.099
 perfectly set so a bluish colored 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.129
 next to reflection 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.239
 and then a hemisphere is supposed to change we just have a smoker lament 

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:54.239
 taken and clubs Google sold set 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.129
 and then with that one looks pretty good 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.469
 in the end nice explosions followed 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:05.309
 Company is under logo 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:06.180
 and the 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.000
 Of course we like to take it with us Premiere has the percent for it 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.099
 without traffic from the video watching all used 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.440
 Here you can see another project actually quite simple in palm form 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:19.279
 perfect in the top 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.059
 he just the newspaper 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:24.150
 but it grows 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.150
 Just Jamie 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.879
 if Mr. Buchholz and explosions and fires 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:39.180
 drums-beats have been used under Blancs and long and Boris and 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.319
 combined and 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.599
 I'll find everything together then cool 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:48.399
 yes Leuthard «I hope our first video via failed 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.540
 and maybe in the future, if you feel like it and have time, maybe we will 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:53.809
 do a few more 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:56.580
 and medially hard to say 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.330
 if you do not have to do that there is boiling and actually means high hacking now 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.479
 best Miss Marple square kitchen, we will make the movie world unsafe
