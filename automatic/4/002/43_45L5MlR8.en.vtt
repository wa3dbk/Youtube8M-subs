00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.650
 so it's an action that's always 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.189
 still where I'm talking to you and it's a 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.500
 peaceful activist action to make 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:15.269
 defeat the right and freedom 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:19.320
 individual and collective and not the 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:23.470
 blow to you at the system level with 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.259

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:31.599
 fed up a Bouteflika himself said when 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.699
 I 'm coming to step jean louis jobard to 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:36.099
 keith ballard is barak is wrong 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:39.009
 it's enough to let young people leave them 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.810
 people take their hands a young 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:44.139
 is going back to the third generation of the 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.720
 youth ballack has that young 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.030
 take their hand their destiny me I 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.370
 do my life but I continue to fight 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.320
 as a free activist I do not have I 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.449
 no trend 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.349
 I do not have any color or politics 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:02.650
 religious I advocate for the right and the 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:04.570
 freedom of expression and to restore 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.159
 in a state of law the rule of law 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.349
 does not exist it exists only in 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.430
 texts it's not true in Algeria there are 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.710
 no rule of law 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.020
 it's the mafia that runs the mafia 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.789
 essentially French from the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.620
 corruption and evil gods 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.979
 that's what I wanted to say thank you we 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.400
 did a peaceful action 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.680
 the goal was 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.389
 communication with the authorities 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.090
 because these authorities have 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.470
 always ignored another that's it 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.030
 very well passed even the police 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.210
 were satisfied there was no breakage 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.500
 because it was not our goal 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.190
 the objective was to point out that 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.020
 we are unhappy 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:49.759
 you want to pass on a message to this gotha 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.199
 lighthouse for delegates there are people 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.479
 right here 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.820
 the suffering Algerians who have 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.680
 rights flouted 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:01.060
 there are people not drinking can not 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.220
 expel one after the other 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.729
 we are ready to negotiate we are not 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:10.400
 thugs like I see ourselves and I 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.169
 think we have succeeded at least is that 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.810
 people know that there is a problem 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:20.000
 finally there was no breakage 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:22.699
 thankfully but the next ones 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.669
 events if there is no 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:28.270
 feedback one more name guarantee us 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.270
 nothing at all
