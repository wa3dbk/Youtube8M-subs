00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.330
 bruno finally broke the silence 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.799
 in the interrogation that lasted about 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.139
 six hours 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.929

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.119
 checked 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.060
 and the silence of almost three years was 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.600
 broken early in the session 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.150
 bruno answered the judge's questions 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.910
 admitted that he feels guilty but denied 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.410
 who knew the plan to kill eliza as 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.719
 client of the photos 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.270
 I deny but in a way I feel 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.120
 guilty in the interrogation that lasted 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.180
 almost six hours bruno said that it was 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.230
 jorge luiz rosa who attended eliza 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.989

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.750

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.629
 pasta took the victim to a house in 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.840
 Vespasian and gave her to a man the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.109
 in which according to the police it is 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.660
 appeared the saints eliza ball would have 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.049
 been killed by asphyxiation in the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.750
 ex-cop and the body thrown to the dogs 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.869
 bruno cried and said he heard when 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.740
 Jorge Macarrão went back alone to the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.860
 site 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.080
 I asked them where's the pull eliza 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.560
 My love , what did you do to her? 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.990
 this time noodles spoke so I O 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.930
 I solved the problem, the problem that both 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.450
 that tormented the defendant did not respond to 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.060
 questions from the prosecution further clarified 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.549
 doubts of the jurors stated that it had 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.979
 fear of denouncing his friend and 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.770
 yes I avoided eliza's death 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.369
 the defense is confident but admits that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.549
 bruno may have lied is possible by 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.579
 that I do not see a lie in journalism 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.470
 I see a doctor's lie. 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.770
 Judge promoter because I was not going 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.579
 believe that it is possible with bruno claro 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.460
 that may may not be something pretty can 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.140
 be something criticized but it is perfectly 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.030
 believable than one who is not obliged 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.399
 even tell the truth that it is not 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.009
 committed the truth the little something 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.750
 thing its due to the prosecution not 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.920
 there were confession ladies and gentlemen 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.960
 the defendant bruno fernandes of the pains of souza 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:22.720
 did not confess there is not even a single 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.210
 trace of confession in his words 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.030
 The prosecutor believes that just as 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.940
 words from bruno's silences too 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.220
 will weigh in the decision of the jurors 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.100
 Bruno is not being tried for a 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.860
 bruno court of justice is being 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.870
 judged by seven witch judges 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:47.560
 be judged by seven lay citizens 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.530
 the silence of the pot view 'justify them O 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.739
 legality of the physical point of view, 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.230
 principle can not be prejudicial to the 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.730
 nobody but the jury decides by intimate 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.790
 conviction and my perception of the citizen 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.820
 who cala consent as it is in the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.550
 perception of the look that 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.430
 any moral and ethical posture of those who 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.830
 whether it is the debates this Thursday 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.739
 the athlete's defense will seek the reduction 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.709
 qualifications and based on the 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.320
 result of last year's 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.709
 absolution of the crime of concealment of 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.019
 bruno's corpse with his posture with 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.420
 recognition of their possibility that 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.820
 have fluid in the change of result 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.560
 which would be recognition of the death of 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.200
 eliza samudio I think this posture 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.810
 Today, he ends up directing 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.630
 same positioning of the pasta is 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.600
 that hearing the prosecution is 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.480
 work to get Bruno's conviction 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.760
 triple-homicide 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.100
 for abduction by hiding the corpse 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.600
 ladies and gentlemen and wait 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:01.030
 an exemplary conviction was acquitted of 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.750
 but we can not forget that the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.900
 bruno as principal he knew all about 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.420
 which would be promoted to guarantee 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.910
 including impunity, and we 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.910
 victim's own words that are still 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.709
 to affirm in an interview with the extra newspaper 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.350
 but also in testimony given to the 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.900
 civil police of rio de janeiro 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.520
 in the sense that bruno would have told her 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.260
 Look, if I kill you and throw you in 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.120
 anywhere we have the foreshadowing 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.640
 of his corpse concealment 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.800
 if I kill you to play you in any 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.800
 No one comes after me.
