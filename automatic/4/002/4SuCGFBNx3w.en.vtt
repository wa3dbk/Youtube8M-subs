00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.009
 and very good friends of youtube that 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.799
 we're in a new video this time it's a 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.339
 but boxing is a very special Boxing 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.619
 a phone a new mobile phone 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:17.580
 galaxy 3 plus this new phone that is 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:19.230
 the next to the galaxy train that is 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.690
 pretty good and good let's start 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.530
 opening it 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.220
 A) Yes 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.610
 well I decided the phone that 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.850
 It has 4 inches of screen 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.050
 double core to 1 with 2 gigahertz each 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.780
 one 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.180
 front camera 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.630
 the rear camera with flash included 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.520
 without such a good mobile with your android 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.520
 Take Android 4.2 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.050
 this version 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.130
 well here we go the typical one that brings the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.050
 manual or fast track 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.270
 your charger 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.610
 perhaps 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.640
 for the microusb computer 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.860
 and the matter 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.370
 well let's look a little bit like in 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.090
 the interface 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.970
 inside the interface of the android 4.2 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.880
 so let's go riding it as 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.350
 We can see on this mobile for 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.390
 enter the assignment is not necessary 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.030
 remove the battery as it is done by 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.820
 up here 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.390
 and the same goes for the microsd queue 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 that is introduced here by the lateral 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.740
 we have the slot 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.740
 we open 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:41.310
 or be much faster and more comfortable 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.050
 when for example the and if there is that the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.090
 another phone came from under the battery 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.610
 something that is much more to maquila 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.620
 overheats above that 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.480
 overheating we would have to turn off the 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.080
 phone obligatorily to remove it 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.750
 for example in this model that does not happen 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.990
 since it would simply be enough to withdraw 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.720
 the housing 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.079
 let's turn on the signal a little bit the 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.079
 Interface 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.850
 good let's see 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.800
 the buttons below light up 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.140
 the one to go backwards 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.140
 lose options as we can see 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.370
 it's already quite big 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.069
 well here we see the interface 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.170
 new version of 4 points of 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.170
 Android that has all the windows 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.220
 these mobiles and as a novelty they have 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.340
 direct access wifi zone and hands mode 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.340
 free 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.590
 then torsion android 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.060
 because it's pretty good in this 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.070
 Android version is it shows you the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.790
 percentage of page battery 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.790
 Upper right 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.160
 to know the battery that you have left without 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.160
 need to install an application 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160
 external 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.739
 and well here so many options the interface 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.739
 changes compare with 4.1 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.240
 here we can give 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.970
 in version 4.2 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.100
 fairly good 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.010
 and well, well 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.519
 that has been everything to caracas has liked 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.200
 this boxing of this mobile that does not model 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.450
 I would recommend it enough as a 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.790
 quality level price for the 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.500
 performance is pretty good 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.860
 I hope you liked it we'll see you 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.860
 following
