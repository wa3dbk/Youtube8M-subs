00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
and it was pretty fantastic so I'm

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.300 
and it was pretty fantastic so I'm
really<00:03:13.239> excited<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.930> do<00:03:14.379> a<00:03:14.410> video<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.100> get

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
really excited to do a video and get

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.729 
really excited to do a video and get
into<00:03:15.579> that<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.120> then<00:03:16.780> towns<00:03:17.049> like<00:03:17.290> we<00:03:17.410> love<00:03:17.560> her

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
into that so then towns like we love her

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.099 
into that so then towns like we love her
and<00:03:18.040> then<00:03:18.549> because<00:03:19.000> they<00:03:19.120> were<00:03:19.180> on<00:03:19.269> sale<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.959> got

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
and then because they were on sale I got

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.280 
and then because they were on sale I got
this<00:03:20.350> one<00:03:20.760> which<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:22.299> looked<00:03:22.750> at<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.109> I<00:03:23.170> was

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
this one which I looked at it and I was

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
this one which I looked at it and I was
like<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.829> don't<00:03:24.160> get<00:03:24.549> this<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.170> evidently<00:03:26.310> this

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
like I don't get this and evidently this

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.990 
like I don't get this and evidently this
being<00:03:27.670> skinnier<00:03:28.450> right<00:03:29.290> here<00:03:29.739> it<00:03:29.950> pops<00:03:30.730> the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
being skinnier right here it pops the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.660 
being skinnier right here it pops the
root<00:03:31.180> up<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:31.630> then<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:32.109> it<00:03:32.739> actually<00:03:33.040> ends<00:03:33.609> up

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
root up and then so it actually ends up

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.729 
root up and then so it actually ends up
being<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.180> same<00:03:34.209> size<00:03:34.870> from<00:03:35.290> root<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.560> tip

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
being the same size from root to tip

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.099 
being the same size from root to tip
it's<00:03:36.190> just<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.609> ruse<00:03:36.849> lifted<00:03:37.450> I'm<00:03:37.690> gonna

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
it's just that the ruse lifted I'm gonna

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.500 
it's just that the ruse lifted I'm gonna
do<00:03:38.260> a<00:03:38.290> video<00:03:38.500> about<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:38.920> too<00:03:39.160> but<00:03:39.970> so<00:03:40.450> we

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
do a video about that too but so we

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.339 
do a video about that too but so we
bought<00:03:40.690> two<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:40.900> those<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:43.260> thinking<00:03:44.260> a

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
bought two of those and thinking a
