can<00:02:22.300> get<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.930> notice<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.440> part<00:02:24.099> comes

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
can get it you notice this part comes

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.940 
can get it you notice this part comes
out<00:02:24.550> here<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.120> see<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.290> there's<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.530> kind<00:02:26.830> of

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
out here and see that there's a kind of

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.720 
out here and see that there's a kind of
a<00:02:27.040> cool<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.400> nice<00:02:27.670> little<00:02:28.470> joint<00:02:29.470> or<00:02:29.700> yeah<00:02:30.700> I

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
a cool that nice little joint or yeah I

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.190 
a cool that nice little joint or yeah I
guess<00:02:30.879> you<00:02:30.940> can<00:02:31.030> call<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.209> joint<00:02:31.390> there<00:02:31.629> comes

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
guess you can call the joint there comes

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.070 
guess you can call the joint there comes
out<00:02:32.760> back<00:02:33.760> in<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.890> can<00:02:36.310> bring<00:02:36.520> in<00:02:36.670> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
out back in and you can bring in the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.599 
out back in and you can bring in the
bringing<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.170> arms<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.590> little<00:02:38.620> bit<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.519> not

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
bringing the arms a little bit it's not

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.369 
bringing the arms a little bit it's not
a<00:02:39.670> joint<00:02:39.969> there

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.289 

now<00:02:43.379> in<00:02:43.650> terms<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.980> his<00:02:44.129> elbow<00:02:44.430> articulation

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:55.039 

that's<00:02:48.299> pretty<00:02:48.540> upset<00:02:49.110> their<00:02:52.670> hands<00:02:53.989> they<00:02:54.989> do

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
that's pretty upset their hands they do

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.899 
that's pretty upset their hands they do
go<00:02:55.290> back<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.650> forth<00:02:55.709> like<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:58.340> fingers<00:02:59.340> the

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
go back and forth like this fingers the

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.179 
go back and forth like this fingers the
thumb<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.299> on<00:03:00.390> its<00:03:00.569> own<00:03:00.689> joint<00:03:01.109> and<00:03:01.409> this

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
thumb is on its own joint and this

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:06.830 
thumb is on its own joint and this
finger<00:03:02.519> right<00:03:04.970> right<00:03:05.970> here<00:03:06.239> that's<00:03:06.569> on<00:03:06.689> its

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
finger right right here that's on its

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.539 
finger right right here that's on its
own<00:03:06.989> joy<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.409> these<00:03:07.560> three<00:03:07.859> are<00:03:07.890> also<00:03:08.159> on

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
own joy and these three are also on

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.220 
own joy and these three are also on
their<00:03:09.060> own<00:03:09.180> joint<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:09.750> kind<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.590> interesting

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
their own joint so kind of interesting

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.360 
their own joint so kind of interesting
articulation<00:03:13.230> there<00:03:13.379> but<00:03:14.069> I'm<00:03:14.159> glad<00:03:14.340> that

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
articulation there but I'm glad that

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.399 
articulation there but I'm glad that
they<00:03:14.730> decide<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.180> add<00:03:15.389> some<00:03:15.659> articulation<00:03:15.959> the

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
they decide to add some articulation the

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:25.210 
they decide to add some articulation the
fingers<00:03:16.680> that's<00:03:16.829> really<00:03:17.069> cool<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.590> waste

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.099 

this<00:03:26.220> isn't<00:03:26.519> you<00:03:26.609> this<00:03:26.909> gripe<00:03:27.510> isn't<00:03:27.870> unique

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
this isn't you this gripe isn't unique

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.770 
this isn't you this gripe isn't unique
to<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:28.829> particular<00:03:29.040> figure<00:03:29.579> it's<00:03:29.849> just<00:03:30.030> why

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
to this particular figure it's just why

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.869 
to this particular figure it's just why
would<00:03:31.049> they<00:03:31.139> make<00:03:31.349> rotation<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.639> that<00:03:32.849> I

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
would they make rotation like that I

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.670 
would they make rotation like that I
mean<00:03:33.120> yeah<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:33.329> can<00:03:33.569> get<00:03:33.720> some<00:03:33.959> nice<00:03:34.200> poses

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
mean yeah you can get some nice poses

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.250 
mean yeah you can get some nice poses
but<00:03:34.970> what<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.299> happening<00:03:36.780> back<00:03:36.989> here

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
but what it is that happening back here

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.520 
but what it is that happening back here
is<00:03:37.409> you<00:03:37.590> see<00:03:37.799> that<00:03:37.980> that's<00:03:39.049> this<00:03:40.049> is<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.409> way

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
is you see that that's this is the way

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.520 
is you see that that's this is the way
its<00:03:40.650> design<00:03:40.920> it's<00:03:41.670> exposed<00:03:42.569> like<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.319> and

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
its design it's exposed like that so and

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.319 
its design it's exposed like that so and
of<00:03:43.950> course<00:03:44.129> you<00:03:44.430> probably<00:03:44.549> all<00:03:44.790> know<00:03:44.819> that<00:03:45.120> but

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
of course you probably all know that but

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.599 
of course you probably all know that but
I<00:03:45.510> would<00:03:46.230> prefer<00:03:46.349> that<00:03:46.560> not<00:03:46.889> be<00:03:47.069> articulated

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
I would prefer that not be articulated

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.009 
I would prefer that not be articulated
actually<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.060> be<00:03:48.090> honest<00:03:50.120> or<00:03:51.120> they<00:03:51.389> can<00:03:51.870> find

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
actually to be honest or they can find

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.509 
actually to be honest or they can find
some<00:03:52.199> way<00:03:52.319> to<00:03:52.379> do<00:03:52.680> without<00:03:52.859> having<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.370> kind

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
some way to do without having that kind

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.409 
some way to do without having that kind
of<00:03:53.609> joint<00:03:53.819> I<00:03:54.690> prefer<00:03:55.169> that<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:56.419> nothing

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
of joint I prefer that so nothing

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.750 
of joint I prefer that so nothing
nothing<00:03:57.629> particular<00:03:58.139> about<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:59.040> figure<00:03:59.519> but

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
nothing particular about this figure but

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.050 
nothing particular about this figure but
just<00:04:00.000> kind<00:04:00.209> of<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.419> general<00:04:00.449> observation<00:04:01.049> about

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
just kind of a general observation about

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.030 
just kind of a general observation about
action<00:04:03.060> figures<00:04:03.419> in<00:04:03.569> general<00:04:03.900> all<00:04:04.590> right<00:04:04.739> so

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
action figures in general all right so

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.390 
action figures in general all right so
let's<00:04:05.879> take<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.180> look<00:04:06.359> at<00:04:06.449> the<00:04:06.629> hips<00:04:07.280> looks<00:04:08.280> like

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
let's take a look at the hips looks like

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.550 
let's take a look at the hips looks like
you<00:04:08.489> can<00:04:08.699> have<00:04:09.269> some<00:04:09.510> movement<00:04:09.930> although<00:04:10.169> it's

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
you can have some movement although it's

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.949 
you can have some movement although it's
kind<00:04:10.799> of<00:04:10.859> off<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.370> side<00:04:11.720> towards<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.720> back

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
kind of off to the side towards the back

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:19.520 
kind of off to the side towards the back
and<00:04:13.290> then<00:04:13.739> up<00:04:14.250> like<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:17.060> interesting<00:04:18.530> nyanyi

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
and then up like that interesting nyanyi

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.199 
and then up like that interesting nyanyi
articulation<00:04:20.190> it's<00:04:20.340> got<00:04:20.459> two<00:04:20.639> joints<00:04:21.000> as<00:04:21.090> you

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
articulation it's got two joints as you

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.800 
articulation it's got two joints as you
can<00:04:21.299> see<00:04:21.510> here<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.229> there<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.690> that's<00:04:24.690> about

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
can see here and there and that's about

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.350 
can see here and there and that's about
as<00:04:25.650> far<00:04:25.680> as<00:04:25.949> it's<00:04:26.099> going<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.280> go<00:04:26.400> as<00:04:26.940> far<00:04:27.120> as<00:04:27.240> the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
as far as it's going to go as far as the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.500 
as far as it's going to go as far as the
bin<00:04:28.520> but<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.669> they<00:04:30.150> are<00:04:30.270> individually

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
bin but the they are individually

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.240 
bin but the they are individually
articulate<00:04:31.260> which<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.470> kind<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.710> nice<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:32.130> can

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
articulate which is kind of nice you can

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
articulate which is kind of nice you can
get<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.880> little<00:04:33.810> more<00:04:33.960> movement<00:04:34.320> their<00:04:35.270> terms

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
get a little more movement their terms

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:43.250 
get a little more movement their terms
of<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.690> ankles<00:04:38.150> let's<00:04:39.150> see<00:04:40.820> they<00:04:41.820> can<00:04:41.970> go<00:04:42.260> back

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
of the ankles let's see they can go back

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.580 
of the ankles let's see they can go back
and<00:04:43.289> forth<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:45.110> then<00:04:46.110> you've<00:04:46.320> got<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.470> little

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
and forth and then you've got a little

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.779
