a<00:03:13.069> pin<00:03:13.250> in<00:03:13.340> my<00:03:13.430> hair<00:03:13.609> up<00:03:13.700> into<00:03:13.940> like<00:03:14.060> five

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
a pin in my hair up into like five

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.539 
a pin in my hair up into like five
sections<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.200> then<00:03:15.650> work<00:03:15.950> on<00:03:16.130> each<00:03:16.310> section

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
sections and then work on each section

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.629 
sections and then work on each section
individually<00:03:17.420> all<00:03:18.019> right<00:03:18.319> so<00:03:18.829> as<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.340> can<00:03:19.579> see

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
I'm taking them to section I think in

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.860 
I'm taking them to section I think in
general<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:21.980> want<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.459> apply<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.239> wet<00:03:23.660> hair

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
nice and soaked with water then I apply

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.629 
nice and soaked with water then I apply
the<00:03:31.489> mud<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.480> my<00:03:32.690> hair<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.319> I<00:03:33.799> kind<00:03:34.069> of<00:03:34.220> rake<00:03:34.459> it

the mud to my hair and I kind of rake it

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.780 
the mud to my hair and I kind of rake it
through<00:03:34.959> detangling<00:03:35.959> make<00:03:36.889> sure<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.069> cover<00:03:37.489> you

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
through detangling make sure I cover you

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.150 
through detangling make sure I cover you
know<00:03:37.910> all<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.329> strands<00:03:38.780> with<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.109> mud<00:03:39.349> and

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
know all the strands with the mud and

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.210 
know all the strands with the mud and
what<00:03:40.609> I<00:03:40.639> notice<00:03:41.120> is<00:03:41.299> that<00:03:41.329> it<00:03:41.810> really<00:03:42.410> defines

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
what I notice is that it really defines

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.670 
what I notice is that it really defines
my<00:03:43.609> hair<00:03:43.880> like<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.269> makes<00:03:44.510> my<00:03:44.720> curls<00:03:45.290> clump

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
my hair like it makes my curls clump

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.280 
my hair like it makes my curls clump
together<00:03:45.859> and<00:03:46.489> gives<00:03:47.389> me<00:03:47.599> some<00:03:47.959> crazy

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
together and gives me some crazy

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.770 
together and gives me some crazy
definition<00:03:49.160> while<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.669> mud<00:03:49.910> is<00:03:50.060> on<00:03:50.269> there<00:03:50.569> it

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
definition while the mud is on there it

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.530

whole<00:05:37.930> defining<00:05:38.530> process<00:05:38.979> and<00:05:39.310> that<00:05:39.910> is

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
whole defining process and that is

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.439 
whole defining process and that is
pretty<00:05:40.300> much<00:05:40.539> the<00:05:41.470> whole<00:05:41.650> process<00:05:42.070> so<00:05:42.820> this<00:05:43.300> is

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
pretty much the whole process so this is

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:44.820 
pretty much the whole process so this is
a<00:05:43.479> shot<00:05:43.750> of<00:05:43.780> my<00:05:43.990> hair<00:05:44.229> like<00:05:44.410> right<00:05:44.590> up<00:05:44.710> the

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
a shot of my hair like right up the

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.980 
a shot of my hair like right up the
shower<00:05:45.070> after<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.760> mud<00:05:45.940> wash<00:05:46.150> as<00:05:46.419> you<00:05:46.570> can<00:05:46.720> see

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
shower after the mud wash as you can see

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.740 
shower after the mud wash as you can see
my<00:05:47.590> hair<00:05:47.800> is<00:05:47.830> really<00:05:48.370> defined

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
my hair is really defined

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.930 
my hair is really defined
in<00:05:49.810> certain<00:05:50.110> spots<00:05:50.560> I've<00:05:51.040> noticed<00:05:51.580> that<00:05:51.760> the

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
in certain spots I've noticed that the

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.670 
in certain spots I've noticed that the
more<00:05:52.120> I<00:05:52.150> use<00:05:52.450> the<00:05:52.720> mutt<00:05:52.870> wash<00:05:53.080> the<00:05:53.470> more

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
more I use the mutt wash the more

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.520 
more I use the mutt wash the more
definition<00:05:54.370> I<00:05:54.430> get<00:05:54.670> with<00:05:54.790> my<00:05:54.820> washing<00:05:55.120> goals

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
definition I get with my washing goals

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.320 
definition I get with my washing goals
so<00:05:56.530> I<00:05:56.860> think<00:05:57.160> it's<00:05:57.310> actually<00:05:57.670> really<00:05:57.880> great

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
so I think it's actually really great

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.760 
so I think it's actually really great
for<00:05:59.460> definition<00:06:00.460> and<00:06:00.960> moisture<00:06:01.960> and<00:06:02.200> that<00:06:02.560> is

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
for definition and moisture and that is

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.070 
for definition and moisture and that is
how<00:06:03.010> I<00:06:03.340> cleanse<00:06:04.120> my<00:06:04.270> hair<00:06:04.480> with<00:06:04.630> the<00:06:04.720> mutt<00:06:04.900> wash

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
how I cleanse my hair with the mutt wash

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.160 
how I cleanse my hair with the mutt wash
I<00:06:05.290> usually<00:06:05.710> do<00:06:05.860> it<00:06:06.040> once<00:06:06.850> a<00:06:07.030> week<00:06:07.060> or<00:06:07.510> you<00:06:07.600> know

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.170 
I usually do it once a week or you know

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.900 
I usually do it once a week or you know
every<00:06:08.470> time<00:06:08.620> I<00:06:08.710> hear<00:06:08.800> needs<00:06:09.010> to<00:06:09.100> be<00:06:09.220> washed<00:06:09.490> and

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
every time I hear needs to be washed and

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.570 
every time I hear needs to be washed and
I<00:06:10.900> find<00:06:11.200> that<00:06:11.320> if<00:06:11.440> I<00:06:11.500> don't<00:06:11.710> put<00:06:11.860> on<00:06:11.890> my<00:06:12.100> scalp<00:06:12.370> I

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
I find that if I don't put on my scalp I

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.180 
I find that if I don't put on my scalp I
don't<00:06:12.790> have<00:06:12.940> trouble<00:06:13.900> getting<00:06:14.200> it<00:06:14.470> out<00:06:14.620> so<00:06:15.160> I

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
don't have trouble getting it out so I

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.130 
don't have trouble getting it out so I
just<00:06:15.400> I<00:06:15.880> don't<00:06:16.270> have<00:06:16.360> any<00:06:16.510> trouble<00:06:16.720> getting<00:06:16.870> it

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
just I don't have any trouble getting it

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.830 
just I don't have any trouble getting it
off<00:06:17.230> my<00:06:17.260> ends<00:06:17.800> so<00:06:18.190> I<00:06:18.580> find<00:06:19.360> that's<00:06:19.480> the<00:06:19.630> best

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
off my ends so I find that's the best

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.900 
off my ends so I find that's the best
method<00:06:20.290> for<00:06:20.320> my<00:06:20.710> hair<00:06:20.980> and<00:06:21.430> I've<00:06:21.550> watched<00:06:21.790> a

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
method for my hair and I've watched a

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.540 
method for my hair and I've watched a
lot<00:06:21.940> of<00:06:22.090> videos<00:06:22.590> where<00:06:23.590> people<00:06:23.620> put<00:06:24.100> the<00:06:24.310> mud

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
lot of videos where people put the mud

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.159 
lot of videos where people put the mud
on<00:06:24.669> their<00:06:24.790> scalp<00:06:25.090> and<00:06:25.270> they<00:06:25.660> don't<00:06:25.900> have<00:06:26.020> any

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
on their scalp and they don't have any

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.930 
on their scalp and they don't have any
problems<00:06:26.560> getting<00:06:26.770> it<00:06:26.860> out<00:06:26.980> but<00:06:27.190> for<00:06:27.370> me<00:06:27.580> I

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940
