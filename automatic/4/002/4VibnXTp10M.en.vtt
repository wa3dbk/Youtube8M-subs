first need to measure the bearing and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.090 
first need to measure the bearing and
measure<00:01:08.700> your<00:01:08.970> base<00:01:09.630> plate<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> can

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
measure your base plate so you can

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.990 
measure your base plate so you can
properly<00:01:11.580> Center<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.510> bearing<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.700> your<00:01:14.700> base

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
properly Center the bearing on your base

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.539 
properly Center the bearing on your base
plate<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.710> mark<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.250> holes
