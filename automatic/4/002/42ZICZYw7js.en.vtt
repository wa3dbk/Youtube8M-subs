00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.580 
USB 3 support and the thing with the USB
3<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.700> it's<00:00:15.000> actually<00:00:15.809> theoretically<00:00:16.260> 10

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
3 is that it's actually theoretically 10

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.670 
3 is that it's actually theoretically 10
times<00:00:16.859> faster<00:00:17.490> than<00:00:17.609> USB<00:00:17.940> 2<00:00:18.240> standard<00:00:19.140> but

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
times faster than USB 2 standard but

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.010 
times faster than USB 2 standard but
after<00:00:20.250> stood<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.490> lot<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.789> USB<00:00:21.150> 3<00:00:21.420> equipment<00:00:21.900> and

after stood a lot of USB 3 equipment and

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.439 
after stood a lot of USB 3 equipment and
then<00:00:22.410> they<00:00:22.740> generally<00:00:23.189> perform<00:00:23.609> between<00:00:23.789> 3x<00:00:24.330> -

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
then they generally perform between 3x -

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.279 
then they generally perform between 3x -
6<00:00:24.630> X<00:00:24.960> faster<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:26.730> transfers<00:00:27.210> compared<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.050> USB

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
6 X faster for transfers compared to USB

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.310 
6 X faster for transfers compared to USB
2<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.369> use<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.849> USB<00:00:30.119> 3<00:00:30.480> features<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.140> need

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
PC has USB 3 support my PC has that so

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.180 
PC has USB 3 support my PC has that so
we<00:00:42.090> test<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.469> also<00:00:43.680> test<00:00:44.010> it

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
we test it with it and we also test it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.529 
we test it with it and we also test it
and<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:44.370> how<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.030> compares

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and see how it compares

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.110 
and see how it compares

speeds<00:01:43.770> up<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> data<00:01:44.220> transfer<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.119> may

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
speeds up the data transfer but it may

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.210 
speeds up the data transfer but it may
sometimes<00:01:45.990> interfere<00:01:46.409> with<00:01:46.590> calls<00:01:46.890> or<00:01:47.040> data

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
sometimes interfere with calls or data

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.280 
sometimes interfere with calls or data
when<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.119> use<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.630> will<00:01:48.899> turn<00:01:49.110> off

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
when in the use it will turn off

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.410 
when in the use it will turn off
automatically<00:01:49.860> after<00:01:50.070> 10<00:01:50.399> minutes<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:50.880> it's

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
automatically after 10 minutes if it's

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.289 
automatically after 10 minutes if it's
not<00:01:51.630> being<00:01:51.840> used<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.170> USB<00:01:52.409> 2<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:54.180> will

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
not being used to USB 2 but we will

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.620 
not being used to USB 2 but we will
enable<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.659> USB<00:01:55.350> 3<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.790> are<00:01:56.939> connected

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
enable that USB 3 and we are connected

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.840 
enable that USB 3 and we are connected
and<00:01:57.810> now<00:01:58.500> let<00:01:58.710> me<00:01:58.740> move<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> computer<00:01:59.670> and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
and now let me move to the computer and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.370 
and now let me move to the computer and
move<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> final<00:02:00.509> let's<00:02:00.689> see<00:02:00.840> how<00:02:00.990> quickly<00:02:01.170> it

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
move a final let's see how quickly it

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.340 
move a final let's see how quickly it
does<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:03.450> folder<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.990> our

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
does that and this folder is our

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.800 
does that and this folder is our

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
computer to the note 3 and we go to time

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.059 
computer to the note 3 and we go to time
it<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:14.270> let's<00:02:14.959> go<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.319> pictures<00:02:15.770> folder

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
it so let's go to the pictures folder

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.780 
it so let's go to the pictures folder
and<00:02:16.849> I<00:02:17.209> have<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.750> get<00:02:17.930> file<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.610> I'm<00:02:19.610> just

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
and I have this to get file and I'm just

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.839 
and I have this to get file and I'm just
going<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.060> transfer<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:22.580> say<00:02:22.730> just

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
going to transfer it and I just say just

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.420 
going to transfer it and I just say just
copy<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.690> let's<00:02:23.930> start<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.590> as<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.310> can

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
copy it and let's start and as you can

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.820 
copy it and let's start and as you can
see<00:02:25.580> it's<00:02:25.819> copying<00:02:26.450> let<00:02:26.810> me<00:02:26.989> just<00:02:27.230> zoom<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.800> a

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
see it's copying let me just zoom in a

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.110 
see it's copying let me just zoom in a
little<00:02:27.980> bit<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:31.130> let's<00:02:31.400> see<00:02:31.550> how<00:02:31.700> much<00:02:31.849> time

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
little bit and let's see how much time

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.710 
little bit and let's see how much time
does<00:02:32.300> it<00:02:32.360> take

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
does it take

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.190 
does it take
it's<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.200> get<00:02:33.380> file<00:02:34.269> again<00:02:35.269> USB<00:02:35.690> 3<00:02:35.900> won't

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
it's a to get file again USB 3 won't

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.009 
it's a to get file again USB 3 won't
make<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.440> big<00:02:36.769> difference<00:02:37.130> if<00:02:37.489> you<00:02:37.610> are

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
make a big difference if you are

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.110 
make a big difference if you are
uploading<00:02:39.019> or<00:02:39.739> downloading<00:02:39.799> small<00:02:40.580> files<00:02:40.819> but

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
uploading or downloading small files but

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.059 
uploading or downloading small files but
if<00:02:41.269> we<00:02:41.360> do<00:02:41.540> transfer<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:41.989> lot<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.319> big<00:02:42.530> file<00:02:42.769> it

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
if we do transfer a lot of big file it

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.280 
if we do transfer a lot of big file it
should<00:02:43.310> make<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.519> significant<00:02:44.450> difference<00:02:44.660> in

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
should make a significant difference in

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.420 
should make a significant difference in
as<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.340> can<00:02:46.489> see<00:02:47.440> it's<00:02:48.440> been<00:02:48.739> about<00:02:48.980> 25

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
as you can see it's been about 25

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.220 
as you can see it's been about 25
seconds<00:02:50.090> it's<00:02:50.209> going<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.720> be<00:02:50.810> done<00:02:51.049> almost<00:02:51.290> now

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
seconds it's going to be done almost now

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.400 
seconds it's going to be done almost now
and<00:02:54.230> it's<00:02:54.590> done<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:56.299> took<00:02:56.480> 31<00:02:56.870> seconds

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
and it's done so it took 31 seconds

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.180 
and it's done so it took 31 seconds
using<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:58.040> USB<00:02:58.790> 3<00:02:59.209> let's<00:03:00.110> try<00:03:00.410> it<00:03:00.590> using<00:03:01.040> now

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
using the USB 3 let's try it using now

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.670 
using the USB 3 let's try it using now
USB<00:03:01.760> 2<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.450> now<00:03:02.780> what<00:03:03.019> we<00:03:03.170> have<00:03:03.200> done<00:03:03.349> is

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
USB 2 and now what we have done is

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.789 
USB 2 and now what we have done is
replace<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.310> USB<00:03:04.730> 3<00:03:04.970> cable<00:03:05.000> with<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.900> USB<00:03:06.380> 2

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
replace the USB 3 cable with the USB 2

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.430 
replace the USB 3 cable with the USB 2
cable<00:03:07.190> this<00:03:07.640> is<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.819> USB<00:03:08.209> 2<00:03:08.480> cable<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.019> I<00:03:09.200> got

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
cable this is the USB 2 cable that I got

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.620 
cable this is the USB 2 cable that I got
with<00:03:09.620> my<00:03:09.769> samsung<00:03:10.100> galaxy<00:03:10.489> s4<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:10.970> now<00:03:11.570> we

with my samsung galaxy s4 and now we

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.810 
with my samsung galaxy s4 and now we
want<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.049> do<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:12.260> same<00:03:12.470> transfer<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.160> see<00:03:13.280> how

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
want to do the same transfer and see how

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.180 
want to do the same transfer and see how
it<00:03:13.970> affects<00:03:14.299> us<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:15.260> now<00:03:15.560> I've<00:03:15.739> connected<00:03:15.980> the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
it affects us and now I've connected the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.670 
it affects us and now I've connected the
note<00:03:16.459> 3y<00:03:17.090> USB<00:03:17.600> 2<00:03:17.750> cable<00:03:18.109> and<00:03:18.260> you're<00:03:18.470> going<00:03:18.590> to

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.809 
do the same thing and transfer this to
kick<00:03:20.510> file<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:20.989> now<00:03:21.230> real<00:03:21.590> time<00:03:21.859> and<00:03:22.069> so<00:03:22.760> I

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
kick file and now real time and so I

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.410 
kick file and now real time and so I
just<00:03:23.150> move<00:03:23.420> it<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:25.100> just<00:03:25.340> say<00:03:25.519> copy<00:03:26.030> and

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
just move it and I just say copy and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.160 
just move it and I just say copy and
let's<00:03:26.630> start

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
let's start

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.150 
let's start
so<00:03:28.100> it's<00:03:28.459> transferring<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.150> file

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.700 

and<00:03:34.250> make<00:03:35.150> sure<00:03:35.390> that<00:03:35.570> you<00:03:35.750> connect<00:03:36.110> your<00:03:36.350> USB

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.140 
cable directly to your computer if
you're<00:03:38.450> using<00:03:38.600> extender<00:03:39.290> or<00:03:39.590> something

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
you're using extender or something

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.900 
you're using extender or something
generally<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.900> does<00:03:42.140> not<00:03:42.320> work<00:03:42.910> I've

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
generally it does not work I've

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.230 
generally it does not work I've
connected<00:03:44.270> directly<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.110> computer<00:03:45.290> and

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
connected directly to the computer and

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.640 
connected directly to the computer and
looks<00:03:47.240> like<00:03:47.330> it's<00:03:47.600> going<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.810> take<00:03:48.020> a<00:03:48.260> lot<00:03:48.620> more

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
looks like it's going to take a lot more

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.360 
looks like it's going to take a lot more
time

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
time

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.510 
time
it's<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.540> 2gig<00:03:50.900> Phi<00:03:51.260> D<00:03:52.660> with<00:03:53.660> USB<00:03:53.930> three<00:03:54.520> hours

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
it's a 2gig Phi D with USB three hours

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.520 
it's a 2gig Phi D with USB three hours
and<00:03:55.610> 31<00:03:55.910> seconds<00:03:56.450> it<00:03:56.570> was<00:03:56.720> done<00:03:59.050> so<00:04:00.050> it<00:04:00.260> looks

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
and 31 seconds it was done so it looks

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.650 
and 31 seconds it was done so it looks
like<00:04:00.770> it's<00:04:01.670> almost<00:04:02.330> -<00:04:02.780> it's<00:04:02.960> faster<00:04:03.770> as<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.370> now

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.940 

again<00:04:08.660> as<00:04:08.780> I<00:04:08.870> told<00:04:09.080> if<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.320> move<00:04:09.500> a<00:04:09.530> lot<00:04:09.830> of

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
again as I told if you move a lot of

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:10.900 
again as I told if you move a lot of
content

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
content

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.120 
content
gifts<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:11.930> gains<00:04:12.200> of<00:04:12.440> content<00:04:12.830> from<00:04:12.980> your

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
gifts and gains of content from your

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.460 
gifts and gains of content from your
phone<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.670> this<00:04:14.150> USB<00:04:14.600> 3<00:04:14.810> will<00:04:15.020> be<00:04:15.140> a<00:04:15.170> lot

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
phone and this USB 3 will be a lot

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.930 
phone and this USB 3 will be a lot
faster<00:04:17.380> so<00:04:18.459> it's<00:04:19.930> 54<00:04:20.930> seconds<00:04:21.550> that<00:04:22.550> one<00:04:22.790> was

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
faster so it's 54 seconds that one was

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.470 
faster so it's 54 seconds that one was
31<00:04:23.390> seconds<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:25.460> should<00:04:25.490> be<00:04:25.880> done<00:04:26.090> anytime

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
31 seconds and it should be done anytime

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.590 
31 seconds and it should be done anytime
now<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:29.330> it's<00:04:29.540> done<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:31.090> one<00:04:32.090> minute<00:04:32.270> 3

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
now and it's done so one minute 3

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.310 
now and it's done so one minute 3
seconds<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:33.170> almost<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.950> USB<00:04:34.480> 3<00:04:35.480> transfer<00:04:36.050> are

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
seconds so almost the USB 3 transfer are

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.880 
seconds so almost the USB 3 transfer are
a<00:04:36.380> 2x<00:04:37.070> faster<00:04:37.630> compared<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.930> USB<00:04:39.770> two

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
a 2x faster compared to the USB two

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.280 
a 2x faster compared to the USB two
transverse<00:04:40.250> on<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.700> note<00:04:40.880> 3<00:04:41.120> so<00:04:41.840> that's<00:04:42.110> it

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
transverse on the note 3 so that's it

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.860
