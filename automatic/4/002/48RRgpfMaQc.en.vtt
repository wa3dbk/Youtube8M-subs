00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.189
 the data disclosed by the idea are 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:30.489
 based on information from ibge to 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.649
 research took place between 2003 and 2009 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.680
 according to ipea the number of 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:39.399
 firearm purchase fell from 57 000 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.589
 in 2003 to 37 thousand in 2009 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.140
 still according to the survey the number of 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:47.199
 men who buy weapons is eight times 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.989
 higher than women however 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.710
 demand for male purchase demand 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.199
 fell 45.1 percent the study shows 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.379
 although in the last 30 years 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:02.559
 1.5 million weapons were 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.040
 Brazil in the last six years the purchase of 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:09.159
 weapons decreased 40.6 percent she has 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.920
 who bring an application and say in 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.990
 your application state which is the 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.630
 reason that is causing her to 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.170
 has the effective need to have the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.420
 year 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.640
 not a generic claim saying 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.610
 that there is a lack of security 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.409
 this is not a sufficient reason why 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.290
 possession of the weapon implies a series of 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.040
 factors also implies the risk to the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.650
 family 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.600
 and another thing to have the registered gun not 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.000
 is the same size have to 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.250
 to carry a weapon, the statute is clear to the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.710
 say that the carrying of a weapon is prohibited 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.750
 saved for people who are 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.510
 Finally, the police officers 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.799
 institutional security office 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.979
 understand then I have some people 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.020
 that are listed with the sessions are 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.090
 authorized to bear the possession of a 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.920
 status of disarmament with the 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.409
 national campaign of the federal government 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.290
 helped to reduce the purchase of weapons 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:10.959
 the citizen can know more about this 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.970
 subject at www.entreguesuaarma.gov.br and 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.170
 in case of complaints call the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.230
 phone 194 if the population really 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.110
 engage in a campaign not only denounce the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.629
 illegal weapon to report all types 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.330
 of crime of which she has knowledge will 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.849
 greatly facilitate the lives of police and 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.859
 in return it will also facilitate the 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.859
 life in community in society
