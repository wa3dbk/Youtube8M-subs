this<00:00:01.589> video<00:00:01.890> will<00:00:02.070> demonstrate<00:00:02.129> how<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.850> use

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
this video will demonstrate how to use

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.990 
this video will demonstrate how to use
external<00:00:03.720> memory<00:00:04.170> such<00:00:04.710> as<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> microSD<00:00:05.700> card

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
external memory such as a microSD card

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.839 
external memory such as a microSD card
or<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.990> USB<00:00:07.020> stick<00:00:07.589> on<00:00:08.099> your<00:00:08.340> Cambridge

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
or a USB stick on your Cambridge

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.220 
or a USB stick on your Cambridge
Sciences<00:00:09.360> star<00:00:09.570> pad<00:00:09.780> 7<00:00:10.429> on<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.599> star<00:00:12.599> pad<00:00:12.780> 7

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
Sciences star pad 7 on the star pad 7

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.770 
Sciences star pad 7 on the star pad 7
there's<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.040> full-sized<00:00:14.549> USB<00:00:14.580> slot<00:00:15.480> there

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
there's a full-sized USB slot there

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.870 
there's a full-sized USB slot there
which<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.440> where<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.770> put<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.310> your<00:00:17.580> USB<00:00:18.300> stick

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
which is where you put in your USB stick

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.750 
which is where you put in your USB stick
so<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:20.970> don't<00:00:21.270> need<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.480> USB<00:00:22.279> adapter<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
so you don't need a USB adapter with the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.279 
so you don't need a USB adapter with the
Cambridge<00:00:24.090> signs<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.390> start<00:00:24.630> at<00:00:24.779> seven<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
Cambridge signs to start at seven and

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.970 
Cambridge signs to start at seven and
then<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.630> couple<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.779> ports<00:00:28.109> away<00:00:28.320> from<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.710> is

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
then a couple of ports away from that is

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.099 
then a couple of ports away from that is
your<00:00:29.250> microSD<00:00:29.939> port<00:00:29.970> which<00:00:30.720> takes<00:00:30.960> your

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
your microSD port which takes your

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.310 
your microSD port which takes your
microSD<00:00:31.740> card<00:00:32.540> if<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.630> slot<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.320> there

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
microSD card if you slot that in there

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.410

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
pad 7 you can also reduce basically what

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.910 
pad 7 you can also reduce basically what
you<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.329> with<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> star<00:01:51.750> pad<00:01:51.930> 7<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.409> you

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
you can do with the star pad 7 is you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.800 
you can do with the star pad 7 is you
can<00:01:53.070> actually

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.639 

make<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.619> video<00:01:56.920> bigger<00:01:57.220> or<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:59.049> pinch<00:01:59.350> zoom

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
make the video bigger or you pinch zoom

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.249 
make the video bigger or you pinch zoom
in<00:01:59.799> and<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.070> can<00:02:00.189> actually<00:02:00.340> make<00:02:00.700> it<00:02:00.850> smaller

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
in and it can actually make it smaller

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.899 
in and it can actually make it smaller
okay<00:02:02.259> so<00:02:02.320> that's<00:02:02.680> that<00:02:02.920> for<00:02:03.189> that<00:02:03.369> part<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:03.820> it
