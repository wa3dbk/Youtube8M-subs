00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.670
 it seems that there is always something there in favor 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.630
 to raise awareness but when the t-shirt 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.759
 arbitration now that they put it 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.759
 green to this so gerardo 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.449
 talk much talk 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.449
 i 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.580
 good 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:51.100
 if it's a robbery they pay I said look 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.170
 how it came to last also flogged me 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.170
 I think the sole is worn 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.400
 now fortunately for cardoso 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.990
 starts to recover because he had had 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.000
 irregularity in the environment will have 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.300
 very good closing of toluca tournament 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.970
 with this an example of america monterrey 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.810
 here it seems to me that toluca raises the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:18.760
 hand for the title go over the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.300
 monterrey for that but with what 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.970
 it showed fog that's why they are irregular 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.280
 everything louis what you rely on to say 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.280
 that will close with everything tied with 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.840
 puebla continue for you won the atlas 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.270
 it was misery because it failed a penalty that 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.030
 the atlas please that's not fault it's not 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.490
 blame for backing only pushed back 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.560
 of the team all the time cardoso now 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.190
 that he has lacked expressiveness edomex 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.430
 and ball to where they keep receives america and 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.560
 close tigers 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.560
 someone to toluca with a toluca toluca 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.220
 he is going is recovering isaac brizuela 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.330
 total but the hand will last me 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.330
 I think that there is no doubt 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:22.489
 but that's where the help from the network is 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:25.750
 that gives the match 1-0 because the goal 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.340
 from venezuela here and to create 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.440
 circumstantial this one was already very thrown 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.150
 to be in front of the atlas trying but more 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.470
 hit the back trying to tie 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.470
 that with the order that came 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.560
 characterizing not if he decides he despaired 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.280
 in the atlas no to any rival well has 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.280
 accommodated back 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.490
 how 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.270
 circumstantial
