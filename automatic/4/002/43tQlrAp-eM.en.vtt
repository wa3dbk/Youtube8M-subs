you will notice that has guides on it it
is<00:00:39.079> also<00:00:39.290> self-healing<00:00:40.010> which<00:00:40.460> means<00:00:40.730> it

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
is also self-healing which means it

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.600 
is also self-healing which means it
mends<00:00:41.329> itself<00:00:41.780> after<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.260> cut<00:00:42.470> on<00:00:42.620> it<00:00:42.800> you

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
without so this is my design I'm cutting

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.610 
without so this is my design I'm cutting
it's<00:00:52.850> been<00:00:53.360> in<00:00:53.480> here<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:53.960> foam<00:00:54.170> core<00:00:54.440> with

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
it's been in here to the foam core with

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.740 
it's been in here to the foam core with
spray<00:00:54.860> adhesive<00:00:55.390> even<00:00:56.390> though<00:00:56.480> it<00:00:56.630> has

spray adhesive even though it has
straight<00:00:57.079> edges<00:00:57.500> I've<00:00:57.739> added<00:00:58.460> crop<00:00:58.850> marks<00:00:59.410> for

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
straight edges I've added crop marks for

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.549 
straight edges I've added crop marks for
easier<00:01:00.800> cutting<00:01:01.690> so<00:01:02.690> we'll<00:01:02.840> place<00:01:03.050> our<00:01:03.200> ruler

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
easier cutting so we'll place our ruler

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.870 
easier cutting so we'll place our ruler
on<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:04.309> inside<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.909> crop<00:01:05.119> marks<00:01:06.729> if<00:01:07.729> we

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
on the inside of the crop marks if we

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.730 
on the inside of the crop marks if we
were<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.149> place<00:01:08.329> it<00:01:08.509> on<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.659> outside<00:01:08.899> we<00:01:09.530> might

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
were to place it on the outside we might

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.099 
were to place it on the outside we might
run<00:01:09.920> into<00:01:10.069> a<00:01:10.189> problem<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:10.819> slip<00:01:11.509> and<00:01:11.780> cut<00:01:11.929> into

run into a problem and slip and cut into

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:15.309 
run into a problem and slip and cut into
our<00:01:12.289> image<00:01:12.709> we'll<00:01:13.700> take<00:01:13.909> our<00:01:14.060> knife<00:01:14.319> holding

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
our image we'll take our knife holding

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
to pop this out and that's how we cut

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.940 
to pop this out and that's how we cut
out<00:01:48.710> from<00:01:48.890> core
