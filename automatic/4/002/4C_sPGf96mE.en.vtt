00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
reason why was talking about it I didn't

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.479 
reason why was talking about it I didn't
realize<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:36.989> slash<00:00:37.620> had<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> high<00:00:38.129> critical

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
realize that slash had a high critical

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.430 
realize that slash had a high critical
hit<00:00:38.640> ratio<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.420> idea<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.780> far<00:00:39.989> fetch<00:00:40.230> was

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
hit ratio the idea of far fetch was

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.979 
hit ratio the idea of far fetch was
using<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> crit<00:00:41.190> stick<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.730> now<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.870> have

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
using the crit stick and now if you have

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.810 
using the crit stick and now if you have
a<00:00:43.020> stab<00:00:43.320> crit<00:00:43.590> stick<00:00:43.860> move<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.430> something<00:00:44.789> I

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
a stab crit stick move so something I

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.940 
a stab crit stick move so something I
did<00:00:44.969> want<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.329> address<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.260> then<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.559> still

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
did want to address and then you still

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.529 
did want to address and then you still
run<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> same<00:00:47.370> far-fetched<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.329> slash

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
run the same far-fetched but with slash

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.360 
run the same far-fetched but with slash
because<00:00:48.809> most<00:00:49.320> damage<00:00:49.680> possible<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:50.219> you're

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
because most damage possible if you're

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.069 
because most damage possible if you're
not<00:00:50.489> hitting<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.789> superfecta<00:00:51.239> pit<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.870> right

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
not hitting a superfecta pit all right

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.360 
not hitting a superfecta pit all right
now<00:00:52.199> let's<00:00:52.379> also<00:00:52.530> look<00:00:52.649> at<00:00:52.890> some<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.250> move

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
now let's also look at some of the move

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.939 
now let's also look at some of the move

busted it's like rest stops suicune but

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.569 
busted it's like rest stops suicune but
but<00:04:13.709> better<00:04:13.889> because<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.280> just<00:04:14.400> have<00:04:14.519> a

higher base defense and you're going to

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.479 
higher base defense and you're going to
be<00:04:16.440> able<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.650> set<00:04:16.769> up<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:16.919> coal<00:04:17.070> mines<00:04:17.310> really

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489

little bit of extra damage over them and

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.890 
little bit of extra damage over them and
then<00:06:23.610> just<00:06:23.820> try<00:06:23.940> to<00:06:24.000> convert<00:06:24.360> off<00:06:24.510> of<00:06:24.690> drain

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.960 
then just try to convert off of drain
punches<00:06:25.260> and<00:06:25.380> ice<00:06:25.500> punches<00:06:25.950> and<00:06:26.130> crazy<00:06:26.669> things

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
punches and ice punches and crazy things

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.880 
punches and ice punches and crazy things
like<00:06:27.120> that<00:06:27.270> so<00:06:27.450> this<00:06:27.539> can<00:06:27.720> be<00:06:27.750> really<00:06:28.350> solid

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
like that so this can be really solid

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.500 
like that so this can be really solid
and<00:06:29.070> then<00:06:29.190> muck<00:06:29.430> look<00:06:29.970> it's<00:06:30.120> kind<00:06:30.210> of<00:06:30.300> the<00:06:30.419> same

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
and then muck look it's kind of the same

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.060 
and then muck look it's kind of the same
idea<00:06:30.660> except<00:06:31.080> this<00:06:31.229> one<00:06:31.440> doesn't<00:06:31.620> really<00:06:31.830> have
