kind<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> Google<00:01:13.830> glass<00:01:14.070> where<00:01:14.310> you

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
kind of like the Google glass where you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.940 
kind of like the Google glass where you
can<00:01:14.490> read<00:01:14.640> those<00:01:15.060> messages<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.540> they're

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
can read those messages and they're

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.399 
can read those messages and they're
semi-transparent<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.960> monocular<00:01:18.960> sized

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
semi-transparent it's a monocular sized

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.690 
semi-transparent it's a monocular sized
view<00:01:19.770> which<00:01:19.979> means<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.310> go<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.580> get<00:01:20.640> that

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
view which means you go and get that

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.969 
view which means you go and get that
from<00:01:20.970> one<00:01:21.210> eye<00:01:21.240> instead<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.900> two<00:01:22.080> eyes<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.860> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
from one eye instead of two eyes but it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.800 
from one eye instead of two eyes but it
still<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.310> quite<00:01:23.340> interesting<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
still is quite interesting so the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
still is quite interesting so the
packaging<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.259> quite<00:01:25.380> nicely<00:01:25.650> done<00:01:25.950> again<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
packaging is quite nicely done again the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.370 
packaging is quite nicely done again the
premise<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.939> having<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.299> spy<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.630> experience

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
premise of having a spy like experience

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.580 
premise of having a spy like experience
is<00:01:28.530> quite<00:01:28.770> attractive<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:30.590> unfortunately

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
is quite attractive but unfortunately

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.050 
is quite attractive but unfortunately
during<00:01:31.740> testing<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.250> didn't<00:01:32.640> find<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.970> be

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
during testing we didn't find this to be

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.539 
during testing we didn't find this to be
as<00:01:33.210> good<00:01:33.659> as<00:01:33.810> advertisements<00:01:34.680> are<00:01:35.009> telling<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
as good as advertisements are telling it

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
to be or as fun perhaps but it still

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.249 
to be or as fun perhaps but it still
works<00:01:38.490> really<00:01:38.850> well<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.509> again<00:01:39.930> pretty

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
works really well and again pretty

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.719 
works really well and again pretty
interesting<00:01:40.619> take<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> look<00:01:41.070> especially<00:01:41.640> in

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
interesting take a look especially in

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.700 
interesting take a look especially in

look at some more advertisements for how

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.690 
look at some more advertisements for how
the<00:01:46.350> device<00:01:46.590> fits<00:01:46.979> into<00:01:47.189> your<00:01:47.220> head<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.670> looks

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the device fits into your head it looks

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.389 
the device fits into your head it looks
like<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:49.500> that's<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.890> area<00:01:50.189> where

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
like this and that that's the area where

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.889 
like this and that that's the area where
you<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.549> read<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> LCD<00:01:51.210> display<00:01:51.630> which<00:01:51.780> is

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
you can read the LCD display which is

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.330 
you can read the LCD display which is
backlit<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.649> can<00:01:52.770> read<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.009> even<00:01:53.130> in

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
backlit so you can read it even in

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.740 
backlit so you can read it even in
darker<00:01:53.640> environments<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.299> it's

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
darker environments and it's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.410 
darker environments and it's
semi-transparent<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.130> even<00:01:56.250> see

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
semi-transparent so you can even see

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.459 
semi-transparent so you can even see
directly<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.540> front<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.290> not

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
directly in front of you so it's not

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.010 
directly in front of you so it's not
entirely<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.909> know<00:01:59.939> blocking<00:02:00.689> your<00:02:00.780> view

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
entirely you know blocking your view

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.660 
entirely you know blocking your view
it's<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.560> scrolling<00:02:01.860> message<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.369> can<00:02:02.520> even

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670

see<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.000> repeatedly<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.409> save

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
see it repeatedly and you can save

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.480 
see it repeatedly and you can save
messages<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.130> well

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
messages as well

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.029 
messages as well
the<00:02:05.820> keyboard<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.420> there<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.380> go<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.680> runs<00:02:07.890> on

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the keyboard and there you go it runs on

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.830 
the keyboard and there you go it runs on
double-a<00:02:08.489> batteries<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.479> easy<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
double-a batteries so it is easy to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.330 
double-a batteries so it is easy to
interchange<00:02:10.200> when<00:02:10.679> those<00:02:10.800> batteries<00:02:11.190> will

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
interchange when those batteries will

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.590 
interchange when those batteries will
run

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
run

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.830 
run
out<00:02:12.100> there<00:02:13.100> taking<00:02:13.280> open<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.610> lid<00:02:13.790> we<00:02:14.480> can<00:02:14.630> see

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
out there taking open the lid we can see

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.840 
out there taking open the lid we can see
that<00:02:15.050> we<00:02:15.350> have<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.920> first<00:02:16.190> unit<00:02:16.460> like<00:02:16.610> so

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
that we have the first unit like so

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.730 
that we have the first unit like so
these<00:02:17.330> actually<00:02:17.720> are<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.870> lot<00:02:18.260> bulkier<00:02:18.710> than

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
these actually are a lot bulkier than

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.540 
these actually are a lot bulkier than
what<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.010> expected<00:02:19.160> from<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:21.310> packaging<00:02:22.310> what

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
what I expected from the packaging what

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.160 
what I expected from the packaging what
it<00:02:22.640> looks<00:02:22.880> like<00:02:23.060> these<00:02:23.330> are<00:02:23.510> quite<00:02:23.780> large<00:02:23.990> and

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
it looks like these are quite large and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.510 
it looks like these are quite large and
to<00:02:24.410> be<00:02:24.500> honest<00:02:24.770> especially<00:02:25.220> at<00:02:25.280> something

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
to be honest especially at something

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.160 
to be honest especially at something
designed<00:02:25.790> for<00:02:25.940> kids<00:02:26.240> I<00:02:26.510> don't<00:02:26.840> think<00:02:27.050> it's

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
designed for kids I don't think it's

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.380 
designed for kids I don't think it's
that<00:02:27.350> suitable<00:02:27.770> especially<00:02:28.400> because<00:02:28.550> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
that suitable especially because the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.870 
that suitable especially because the
device<00:02:29.600> again<00:02:29.960> does<00:02:30.110> have<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.350> huge<00:02:31.250> bulky

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
device again does have this huge bulky

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.210 
device again does have this huge bulky
QWERTY<00:02:32.510> keyboard<00:02:32.870> piece<00:02:33.230> actually<00:02:33.860> contains

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
QWERTY keyboard piece actually contains

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.980 
QWERTY keyboard piece actually contains
the<00:02:34.370> batteries<00:02:34.760> underneath<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.570> hood

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
the batteries underneath the hood

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.210 
the batteries underneath the hood
luckily<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.560> batteries<00:02:36.860> for<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.070> thing

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
luckily the batteries for this thing

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.550 
luckily the batteries for this thing
last<00:02:37.490> for<00:02:37.760> around<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:38.180> few<00:02:38.840> years<00:02:38.900> actually

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
last for around a few years actually

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.930 
last for around a few years actually

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
before you willing to interchange them

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.640 
before you willing to interchange them
so<00:02:41.090> that's<00:02:41.210> see<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.780> good<00:02:41.960> news<00:02:42.140> but<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.620> bad

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
news is again that it is quite bulky the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.900 
news is again that it is quite bulky the
keyboard<00:02:45.740> is<00:02:45.830> also<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.160> know<00:02:46.460> although<00:02:46.700> it's

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
keyboard is also you know although it's

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.280 
keyboard is also you know although it's
risen<00:02:47.150> above<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.360> surface<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:47.720> easy<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.080> type

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
risen above the surface and easy to type

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.230 
risen above the surface and easy to type
on<00:02:48.410> it's<00:02:48.620> very<00:02:48.710> grippy<00:02:49.670> it's<00:02:49.820> not<00:02:50.030> very

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
on it's very grippy it's not very

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.170 
on it's very grippy it's not very
tactile<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:51.110> gal<00:02:52.070> like<00:02:52.310> it's<00:02:52.580> not<00:02:52.760> like<00:02:53.150> a

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
tactile it's on gal like it's not like a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.850 
tactile it's on gal like it's not like a
real<00:02:53.480> keyboard<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.200> might<00:02:54.440> use<00:02:54.650> on<00:02:54.680> a

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
real keyboard that you might use on a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.440 
real keyboard that you might use on a
computer<00:02:55.310> or<00:02:55.460> on<00:02:55.490> the<00:02:55.670> smartphone<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:56.330> that's

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
computer or on the smartphone so that's

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.150 
computer or on the smartphone so that's
the<00:02:56.570> downside<00:02:56.720> as<00:02:56.990> well<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.710> can<00:02:57.860> wear<00:02:57.980> this

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
the downside as well you can wear this

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.010 
the downside as well you can wear this
or<00:02:58.340> also<00:02:58.520> take<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.120> earpiece<00:02:59.480> off<00:02:59.660> like<00:02:59.870> we've

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
or also take the earpiece off like we've

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.990 
or also take the earpiece off like we've
done<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.440> can<00:03:00.770> see<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.520> shows<00:03:01.580> up<00:03:01.880> like

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
done you can see that it shows up like

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.310 
done you can see that it shows up like
so<00:03:02.210> and<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.690> is<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.870> piece<00:03:03.110> word

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
so and this is the piece word

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.530 
so and this is the piece word
semi-transparent<00:03:04.280> again<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.240> can<00:03:05.360> see

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
semi-transparent again you can see

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.540 
semi-transparent again you can see
through<00:03:05.720> this<00:03:05.810> earpiece<00:03:05.990> and<00:03:06.470> see<00:03:07.370> what's

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
through this earpiece and see what's

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.310 
through this earpiece and see what's
going<00:03:07.790> on<00:03:07.970> that's<00:03:08.240> your<00:03:08.360> outside<00:03:08.630> world<00:03:08.870> you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
going on that's your outside world you

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.720 
going on that's your outside world you
get<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.440> bit<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.680> an<00:03:09.770> insight<00:03:10.040> they're<00:03:10.280> very

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
get a bit of an insight they're very

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.160 
get a bit of an insight they're very
similar<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.210> Google<00:03:11.450> glass<00:03:11.600> series<00:03:11.810> let's

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
similar to the Google glass series let's

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.320 
similar to the Google glass series let's
take<00:03:12.350> off<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.800> light<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.310> show<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.270> few

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
take off the light and show you a few

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.520 
take off the light and show you a few
messages<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:14.960> if<00:03:15.050> I<00:03:15.110> type<00:03:15.410> something<00:03:15.650> I<00:03:17.530> can

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
messages so if I type something I can

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.030 
messages so if I type something I can
hopefully<00:03:19.900> see<00:03:20.900> what's<00:03:21.440> going<00:03:21.650> on<00:03:21.710> there<00:03:21.920> you

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
hopefully see what's going on there you

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.500 
hopefully see what's going on there you
go<00:03:22.160> it's<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.610> little<00:03:22.760> bit<00:03:22.940> difficult<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.330> see

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
go it's a little bit difficult to see

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.910 
go it's a little bit difficult to see
again<00:03:23.720> it's<00:03:23.870> not<00:03:23.960> as<00:03:24.140> easy<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.440> see<00:03:24.530> but<00:03:24.830> you

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
again it's not as easy to see but you

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.950 
again it's not as easy to see but you
can<00:03:25.010> see<00:03:25.040> our<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.640> I<00:03:26.090> can<00:03:26.240> go<00:03:26.360> space<00:03:26.660> and

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
can see our and I can go space and

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.050 
can see our and I can go space and
basically<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.860> types<00:03:28.130> messages<00:03:28.850> back<00:03:29.030> and

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
basically it types messages back and

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.790 
basically it types messages back and
forth<00:03:29.240> in<00:03:29.570> this<00:03:29.810> format<00:03:30.140> it's<00:03:30.380> better<00:03:30.620> than

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
forth in this format it's better than

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.200 
forth in this format it's better than
what's<00:03:30.980> being<00:03:31.160> showing<00:03:31.400> up<00:03:31.550> on<00:03:31.670> camera<00:03:31.700> for

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
what's being showing up on camera for

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.970 
what's being showing up on camera for
some<00:03:32.330> reason<00:03:32.660> but<00:03:33.140> and<00:03:33.440> then<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.590> can<00:03:33.740> send

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
some reason but and then I can send

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.830 
some reason but and then I can send
these<00:03:34.070> back<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:34.910> forth<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.420> someone<00:03:35.720> can

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
these back and forth and someone can

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.840 
these back and forth and someone can
send<00:03:36.020> them<00:03:36.110> back<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.470> me<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:37.550> would<00:03:37.640> scroll

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
send them back to me and it would scroll

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.550 
send them back to me and it would scroll
back<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.210> forth<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.600> it<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:38.930> easier<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.350> read

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
back and forth and it is easier to read

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.320 
back and forth and it is easier to read
than<00:03:39.770> again<00:03:40.310> with<00:03:40.430> showing<00:03:40.610> up<00:03:40.730> on<00:03:40.850> camera<00:03:40.880> but

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
than again with showing up on camera but

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.470 
than again with showing up on camera but
there<00:03:41.660> you<00:03:41.750> go<00:03:41.840> that's<00:03:41.990> basically<00:03:42.350> review<00:03:42.830> and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
there you go that's basically review and

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.640 
there you go that's basically review and
looking<00:03:44.480> out<00:03:44.600> you<00:03:44.780> can<00:03:44.900> still<00:03:45.050> see<00:03:45.200> an<00:03:45.320> outside

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
looking out you can still see an outside

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.410 
looking out you can still see an outside
view<00:03:45.800> on<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.070> side<00:03:46.280> so<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:46.880> very<00:03:47.210> interesting

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
view on the side so a very interesting

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.060 
view on the side so a very interesting
toy<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:47.930> very<00:03:48.080> interesting<00:03:48.380> premise<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:48.920> did

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
toy and very interesting premise it did

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.950 
toy and very interesting premise it did
work<00:03:49.340> I<00:03:49.550> found<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.180> 200<00:03:50.660> feet<00:03:50.780> we're<00:03:50.930> a

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
work I found that 200 feet we're a

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.240 
work I found that 200 feet we're a
little<00:03:51.020> bit<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.290> stretch<00:03:51.590> we<00:03:52.010> can<00:03:52.130> only

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
little bit of a stretch we can only

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.770 
little bit of a stretch we can only
really<00:03:52.490> go<00:03:52.640> up<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.850> 100<00:03:53.300> feet<00:03:53.330> before

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
really go up to 100 feet before

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.780 
really go up to 100 feet before
communication<00:03:54.680> sometimes<00:03:55.010> faltered<00:03:55.550> and

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
communication sometimes faltered and

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.610 
communication sometimes faltered and
again<00:03:56.450> our<00:03:56.630> biggest<00:03:56.870> disappointment<00:03:57.530> for

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
again our biggest disappointment for

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.950 
again our biggest disappointment for
these<00:03:57.890> are<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.340> fact<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.510> bulkiness<00:03:59.840> of

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
these are the fact the the bulkiness of

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.750 
these are the fact the the bulkiness of
the<00:04:00.170> units<00:04:00.470> themselves<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.520> fact<00:04:01.700> that

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
the units themselves and the fact that

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.950 
the units themselves and the fact that
the<00:04:01.880> screens<00:04:02.120> can<00:04:02.270> only<00:04:02.390> display<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:02.750> few

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
the screens can only display a few

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.690 
the screens can only display a few
characters<00:04:03.410> overall<00:04:04.070> an<00:04:04.190> interesting<00:04:04.550> toy

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
characters overall an interesting toy

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.820 
characters overall an interesting toy
and<00:04:05.020> just<00:04:06.020> something<00:04:06.260> interesting<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.680> note
