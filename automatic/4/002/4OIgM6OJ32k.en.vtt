00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.260
 Y 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.289
 when redesigning the website the 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.709
 governing body took into account that 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:19.039
 for many people this page is 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.810
 our business card 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.210
 we wanted to make changes to the page 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.090
 especially because we wanted to take the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.200
 good news of the kingdom to the greatest number 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.300
 of possible people 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.420
 Our organization is global 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.970
 we preach everywhere and if they arise 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.810
 questions on your own phone do you have 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.810
 the answers 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.770
 this is still the internet site 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.100
 has helped me to be a better teacher of the 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.170
 Bible 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.690
 now I am able to preach to the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.410
 University students does not matter 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.410
 what language do you speak 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.940
 you can use at any time your 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.470
 phone or your tablet to find 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.100
 information on the topic that most 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.100
 interest 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.540
 I'm no longer a taxi driver and I use the jw site to 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.980
 tell them about the bible my passengers 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.470
 many young people have phones with 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:22.180
 internet and when I give them the address 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:24.010
 page immediately seek ground 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.020
 have good conversations with them 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.510
 about our most recent magazines 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.310
 when I tell them they can download 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.009
 they do it at the moment 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.210
 I wanted to show the video of the children that 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.759
 they beat others because it's very good 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.020
 I wrote it down on a paper to my teacher and 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.180
 said maybe we can see it I decided 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.460
 show the class this video because 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.670
 It deals with a problem that affects them 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.979
 all the guys without and then that the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.259
 qr code is very useful to present the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.659
 page that can take a picture of 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.030
 code and immediately access 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.909
 information in your language is a 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.119
 wonder 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.610
 I often go to work in the subway 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.640
 sometimes he preached to whom I have next 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.560
 using the website with the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.080
 website I enjoy more of the 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.400
 preaching because I feel more comfortable 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.400
 when talking to people 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.560
 sometimes seeing what's on the page 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.659
 find something interesting for a 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.049
 student or revisit and I send him the 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.049
 link 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.060
 and we wanted it to be attractive and easy 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.879
 of using that people could 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.180
 find out who we are that we believe and 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.069
 How to get in touch with us 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.019
 for years he had been going to church 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.720
 but I did not find answers to my 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.470
 questions why I decided to investigate in 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.980
 internet and I stumbled upon jw point or heretic 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.670
 It was like breathing the fresh air 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:05.170
 explanations were very simple I already 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.200
 78 years have clearly did not believe that 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.709
 I could use the page I thought that 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.780
 it was for the youth my granddaughters 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.030
 they helped to use it 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.099
 I can listen to the publications or 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.150
 increase the size of the letter to 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.150
 can read them 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.870
 now that we see what has been achieved with 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.639
 this web page we have to recognize 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.969
 that has been more than we had 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.969
 imagined 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.040
 This website is a powerful 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.760
 tool is a gift from jehovah but 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.760
 my question is what are you using 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.760
 fully
