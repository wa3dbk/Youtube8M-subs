00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.769
 I finished the first round here 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.110
 last six high points here in this 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.150
 place and now what follows is to close the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.850
 back these were the first six 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.160
 high points that we remember that we said 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.580
 three chains to give height then 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.530
 here nothing else in the third string that 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.230
 we are up here we put the hook 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.240
 we get together and draw slipped 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.430
 we close this round and here we are going to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.980
 continue weaving our second 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.440
 back but how are they going to be four 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.440
 high points instead of six we 're going 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.100
 to go to the second point that is this 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.500
 with slipped point so now we're 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.870
 at the height of the second high point of 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.260
 here I'm going to weave three chains for 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.600
 start the round 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.920
 and here I'm going to start weaving the 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.739
 high points that I need that are only 4 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.960
 remember that it is a point about each 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.750
 point we do not have the first nor do we have 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.289
 the last one as we did in the other 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.380
 finished side here not in the second 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:16.659
 yes in this and here we should stay 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.659
 four true this is 2 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.810
 4 well let's go like this all this 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.180
 back and now we see the end of this 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.550
 turn also look here as 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.280
 observation these returns that we are 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.100
 closing we are staying circular or 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.900
 rather like tubular then it's not going to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.370
 have here that we have one for the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.710
 right and then we turn around and 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.350
 we protect for the reverse in this case 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.030
 the two are on the side 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.460
 right and the one that follows we will have left 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.530
 also on the right side for the same 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.650
 when we set up this second round that 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.750
 is the one of the four high points and for 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.240
 define where it should be or where it should 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.070
 enter the hook because nothing else is seen 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.590
 little hole even a little less 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.300
 but this is where they put the hook and 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.450
 the time to put it on top 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.610
 of the hook should see two threads and 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.440
 that's where you're going to weave your 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.170
 high point 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.420
 look here at the top you see 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.240
 like a good chain that chain is 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.220
 the one we're going to grab so look at us 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.580
 it's as if we were hanging 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.480
 hence the point and so good then here 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.060
 I finished this round 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.720
 what is going to be the same we are going to close 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.480
 already with my 4 high points here I am going to 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.030
 close it with the same slipped point 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.670
 which will be in the third chain of the 3 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.610
 first that we chased and here he took with 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.069
 well slipped point here we were left 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.460
 this second round and we're going to weave a 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.160
 last return for nothing more 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.290
 that we do not have these holes left 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.260
 to knit one last round of high point 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.050
 and already with that in the case of the part of 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.630
 down here if we tell you two laps 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.240
 extras but then the bottom part as 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.370
 that if it is a bit longer and in 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.460
 what is the part of the good sleeve to 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.090
 I liked more how it was with just one 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:21.260
 back then I'm going to weave the latter 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.930
 return of high points and points on 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.300
 point and then I will do the finished 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.100
 with the crab point and with this already 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.100
 the sleeve will be finished 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.700
 show them how this project was left 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.650
 and finally here I am the bullfighter 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.920
 completed 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.560
 here is the finished sleeves 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.720
 what is a little bit shorter than the 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.760
 finished here from below good to me 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.950
 that's how I thought it was fine but it's already 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.980
 the taste that you 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.580
 and put each of your tissues and 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.610
 Well here I put this button 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:01.540
 and then that is the finished product of 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.620
 our effort and dedication to weave 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.620
 this is bullfighter 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.820
 I want to show you how sometimes 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.020
 we use the same 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:19.630
 materials and we leave the same the tissue 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.730
 it will not be the same for us sometimes 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.770
 it happens that when weaving our 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.260
 hand weaves like a little tighter 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.920
 so I want to show you here is 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.340
 bullfight 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.980
 we have a very little difference to the 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.030
 white bullfighter I stay a little bit more 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.740
 small that what is beige color what 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.470
 we can notice a little here in the 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.110
 neck really is very little 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.780
 difference and a little bit in the sleeves 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.630
 regarding the length of this good bullfighter 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.330
 the beige bullfighter has a little longer 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.830
 what is this look here are one two 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.350
 three four and a half stitches and in the 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.180
 here I 'm only three and a half 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.250
 difference do not interrupt if they are 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.560
 doing a big project like this 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.990
 that it does not take us a day or two in 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.390
 do it but it takes us weeks to do 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.820
 a project like this because it is in 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.810
 It's a little bit that we have good if you 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.600
 they leave this project 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.240
 to weave with a thicker thread and a 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.190
 thicker hook something else maybe 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.190
 when they come to knit again this 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.800
 project the fabric does not stay the same 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.620
 this is for you to consider that 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.310
 yes it is important to start a project and 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.710
 then finish preferably without 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.740
 start another look here you can 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.770
 observe how the point is a bit 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.169
 looser I used the hook number 4 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.620
 which is the same one that I used to weave 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:52.700
 this bullfighter and here the stitch if you 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.130
 they fix is ​​not equal to open is more 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.800
 closed the point and well for me 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:01.160
 like me it makes me look better 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.830
 but although giving a little looser 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.130
 the fabric is also appreciated well if 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.800
 you want your tissues to advance 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:13.760
 a little more good if you in this 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.070
 case they saw we use the crystal thread and 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.860
 the hook of number 4 but if you 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.960
 leave 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.979
 something tight can use the hook 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:26.310
 of number 2 and they can also use 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:28.979
 up to number 0 this in this case I 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.800
 I have a little tight tissue and I 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:35.189
 I stay like this with the number 4 if you 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.099
 prefer a little looser or with the 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:39.870
 number mouth the hook of number 2 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:42.360
 possibly it would be like that if you 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.789
 when it comes to knitting your fabric is not very 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.009
 loose good are tips that happened to them that 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:49.620
 maybe you guys sometimes say 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:51.539
 carlo a lot but honestly to me I know 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.349
 it makes them important points to 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:54.349
 to consider 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.600
 that I'm fine until the next
