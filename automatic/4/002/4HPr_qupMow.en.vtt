dress could not find one and the reason

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.250 
dress could not find one and the reason
is<00:01:05.460> most<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> maternity<00:01:06.540> clothes<00:01:06.750> come<00:01:07.049> in

is most of the maternity clothes come in

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.500 
is most of the maternity clothes come in
jewel<00:01:07.619> tones<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.130> that's<00:01:08.310> what<00:01:08.490> I've<00:01:08.580> got<00:01:08.850> but

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
jewel tones so that's what I've got but

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.330 
jewel tones so that's what I've got but
I<00:01:09.600> was<00:01:09.750> able<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.960> find<00:01:10.200> some<00:01:10.439> color<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.159> is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
I was able to find some color so this is

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.120 
I was able to find some color so this is
one<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> my<00:01:11.700> favorites<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.510> also<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
one of my favorites I also like this

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.390 
one of my favorites I also like this
bright<00:01:14.460> purple<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.659> these<00:01:15.869> greens<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.740> think

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
bright purple in these greens I think

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.670 
bright purple in these greens I think
the<00:01:17.490> reason<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.850> they<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.360> more<00:01:18.750> jewel<00:01:19.320> tones

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the reason that they do more jewel tones

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.100 
the reason that they do more jewel tones
and<00:01:20.040> dark<00:01:20.280> colors<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:21.030> basically<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.080> just

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and dark colors is basically you just

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.010 
and dark colors is basically you just
look<00:01:22.500> better<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:23.009> them<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.790> while<00:01:24.360> girl<00:01:24.630> has<00:01:24.869> to

look better in them so while girl has to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.260 
look better in them so while girl has to
have<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> bunch<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.470> colors<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:25.950> TV<00:01:26.280> reality
