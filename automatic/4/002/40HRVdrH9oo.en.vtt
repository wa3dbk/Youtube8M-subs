00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.520 

alright<00:04:35.300> so<00:04:35.539> as<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:35.870> can<00:04:35.930> see<00:04:36.050> you<00:04:36.139> have<00:04:36.169> one

alright so as you can see you have one

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.530 
alright so as you can see you have one
last<00:04:36.740> round<00:04:36.889> it's<00:04:37.130> a<00:04:37.190> dramatic<00:04:37.340> difference<00:04:37.820> in

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
last round it's a dramatic difference in

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.630 
last round it's a dramatic difference in
the<00:04:38.690> second<00:04:39.140> pair<00:04:39.440> I<00:04:39.470> am<00:04:39.650> going<00:04:39.980> to<00:04:40.220> be<00:04:40.400> putting

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
the second pair I am going to be putting

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.900 
the second pair I am going to be putting
a<00:04:40.850> thin<00:04:41.210> line<00:04:41.660> of<00:04:41.690> glue<00:04:41.960> again<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:43.070> let<00:04:43.760> that

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
a thin line of glue again and let that

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.990 
a thin line of glue again and let that
get<00:04:44.090> tacky<00:04:44.420> okay<00:04:45.350> fan<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:45.890> and<00:04:46.160> I<00:04:46.280> mean<00:04:46.550> I<00:04:46.760> guess

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
get tacky okay fan it and I mean I guess

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.100 
get tacky okay fan it and I mean I guess
you<00:04:47.120> could<00:04:47.150> blow<00:04:47.390> on<00:04:47.510> it<00:04:47.540> too

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
you could blow on it too

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.050 
you could blow on it too
I'm<00:04:48.590> you're<00:04:48.800> gonna<00:04:48.890> set<00:04:49.190> that<00:04:49.340> in<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.550> center

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
I'm you're gonna set that in the center

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.450 
I'm you're gonna set that in the center
and<00:04:50.390> then<00:04:50.690> you<00:04:50.840> are<00:04:50.960> going<00:04:51.170> to<00:04:51.260> maneuver<00:04:52.160> the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
and then you are going to maneuver the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.070 
and then you are going to maneuver the
lash<00:04:52.670> with<00:04:53.000> tweezers<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.540> I<00:04:53.750> think<00:04:53.960> it's

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
lash with tweezers and I think it's

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.990 
lash with tweezers and I think it's
really<00:04:54.470> helpful<00:04:54.740> if<00:04:54.980> you<00:04:55.130> use<00:04:55.340> a<00:04:55.370> magnified

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
really helpful if you use a magnified

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.410 
really helpful if you use a magnified
mirror<00:04:56.420> and<00:04:57.070> that<00:04:58.070> is<00:04:58.160> pretty<00:04:58.340> much<00:04:58.490> it<00:04:58.760> whew

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420
