years it is a basically a diet that
looks<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.710> our<00:00:23.010> ancestry<00:00:23.970> into<00:00:24.359> how<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.109> ate

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
looks to our ancestry into how we ate

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.929

before we were more civilized and before

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.200 
before we were more civilized and before
we<00:00:30.090> had<00:00:30.500> agricultural<00:00:31.500> ISM<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.610> before<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
we had agricultural ISM and before the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.060 
we had agricultural ISM and before the
Industrial<00:00:33.630> Revolution<00:00:33.710> before<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.950> were

Industrial Revolution before we were

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.010 
Industrial Revolution before we were
farmers<00:00:35.520> basically<00:00:36.000> when<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.239> were<00:00:36.270> more<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
farmers basically when we were more of a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.830 
farmers basically when we were more of a
hunter<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.530> gatherer<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:39.180> basically

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
hunter and gatherer and it basically

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.630 
hunter and gatherer and it basically
eliminates<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.410> lot<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.770> grains<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.399> lot<00:00:41.550> of

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
eliminates a lot of grains and a lot of

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.450 
eliminates a lot of grains and a lot of
things<00:00:41.820> from<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> diet<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.219> can

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
things from the diet and that and it can

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.060 
things from the diet and that and it can
be<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> very<00:00:45.270> very<00:00:45.809> good<00:00:46.020> diet<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> person

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.350 
be a very very good diet for a person
and<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.370> help<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:47.760> autoimmune

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and it can help with autoimmune

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.299

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
individualized diet now we can get in

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.570 
individualized diet now we can get in
the<00:05:09.539> ballpark<00:05:10.050> depending<00:05:10.740> on<00:05:10.860> what<00:05:11.279> we<00:05:11.400> know

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
the ballpark depending on what we know

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.610 
the ballpark depending on what we know
about<00:05:11.699> your<00:05:12.029> general<00:05:12.599> health<00:05:12.659> but<00:05:13.439> if<00:05:13.529> you

really what we do and I want to get

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.439 
really what we do and I want to get
people<00:05:16.770> better<00:05:17.279> we<00:05:17.849> want<00:05:18.090> to<00:05:18.180> get<00:05:18.300> people

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
people better we want to get people

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.010 
people better we want to get people
better<00:05:19.199> here<00:05:19.529> and<00:05:19.969> so<00:05:20.969> what<00:05:21.210> we<00:05:21.330> do<00:05:21.509> we<00:05:21.870> can

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:02.339 
diagnostic labs so that we can figure

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:04.640 
diagnostic labs so that we can figure

00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:55.559 
have cross reactivity basically there

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:58.159 
have cross reactivity basically there
are<00:06:55.589> a<00:06:55.649> lot<00:06:55.800> of<00:06:55.919> foods<00:06:56.189> that<00:06:56.789> will<00:06:57.419> react<00:06:57.839> in

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.169 
are a lot of foods that will react in

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.320 
are a lot of foods that will react in
your<00:06:58.319> body<00:06:58.619> like<00:06:58.979> gluten<00:06:59.429> does<00:06:59.819> which<00:07:00.119> is

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
your body like gluten does which is

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.149 
your body like gluten does which is
comes<00:07:00.779> from<00:07:00.959> wheat<00:07:01.139> and<00:07:01.769> it's<00:07:01.889> in<00:07:02.039> other

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:02.159 
comes from wheat and it's in other

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:04.040 
comes from wheat and it's in other
grains<00:07:02.519> so<00:07:03.300> you<00:07:03.360> have<00:07:03.599> to<00:07:03.719> look<00:07:03.779> at<00:07:03.899> those

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
grains so you have to look at those

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.529 
grains so you have to look at those
cross-reactive<00:07:04.679> foods<00:07:04.919> too<00:07:05.249> you<00:07:05.550> can't<00:07:05.909> you

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539 
cross-reactive foods too you can't you

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:09.139 
cross-reactive foods too you can't you
can't<00:07:06.869> just<00:07:07.169> when<00:07:07.889> you<00:07:08.039> can<00:07:08.249> try<00:07:08.519> it<00:07:08.580> and<00:07:08.789> see

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:09.149 
can't just when you can try it and see

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:09.859 
can't just when you can try it and see
how<00:07:09.300> you<00:07:09.330> do

00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:09.869 
how you do

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:12.079 
how you do
but<00:07:10.199> these<00:07:10.379> these<00:07:10.830> generalized<00:07:11.399> diets<00:07:11.909> are

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:12.089 
but these these generalized diets are

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:14.719 
but these these generalized diets are
actually<00:07:12.839> a<00:07:12.869> lot<00:07:13.110> of<00:07:13.169> people<00:07:13.319> think<00:07:13.769> that's

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:14.729 
actually a lot of people think that's

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:16.279 
actually a lot of people think that's
going<00:07:15.119> to<00:07:15.179> be<00:07:15.330> the<00:07:15.509> thing<00:07:15.689> that<00:07:15.719> helps<00:07:16.139> them

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:16.289 
going to be the thing that helps them

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:17.989 
going to be the thing that helps them
that's<00:07:16.529> going<00:07:16.709> to<00:07:16.769> be<00:07:16.919> the<00:07:17.069> magic<00:07:17.279> bullet<00:07:17.879> and

00:07:17.989 --> 00:07:17.999 
that's going to be the magic bullet and

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:20.480 
that's going to be the magic bullet and
that<00:07:18.089> the<00:07:18.419> fact<00:07:18.689> is<00:07:18.929> if<00:07:19.469> you<00:07:19.679> try<00:07:19.889> it<00:07:20.009> and<00:07:20.279> it

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
that the fact is if you try it and it

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.429 
that the fact is if you try it and it
doesn't<00:07:20.550> work<00:07:20.939> or<00:07:21.240> you<00:07:21.389> your<00:07:21.809> symptoms<00:07:22.169> wax
