watch is really easy to read do you have
one<00:01:52.009> dot<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:52.430> points<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.939> outer<00:01:53.060> circle

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
one dot that points to the outer circle

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.999 
one dot that points to the outer circle
which<00:01:53.689> is<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.960> minute<00:01:54.229> one<00:01:54.530> points<00:01:54.859> at<00:01:54.979> the

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
inner circle which is the hour so it's

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.959 
inner circle which is the hour so it's
just<00:01:56.990> like<00:01:57.079> reading<00:01:57.469> any<00:01:57.619> analog<00:01:58.009> watch<00:01:58.280> some

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
is happening to me I have a pretty

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.190 
is happening to me I have a pretty
average<00:03:48.250> size<00:03:48.670> wrist<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.300> you<00:03:49.720> can<00:03:49.870> see<00:03:50.050> it's

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
average size wrist and you can see it's

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.600 
average size wrist and you can see it's
loot<00:03:50.500> it's<00:03:50.680> fairly<00:03:50.920> loose<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.489> goes

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
loot it's fairly loose and it goes

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.430 
loot it's fairly loose and it goes
pretty<00:03:51.820> far<00:03:52.060> down<00:03:52.239> my<00:03:52.300> arm<00:03:52.630> so<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:52.989> could<00:03:53.260> take<00:03:53.410> a

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
pretty far down my arm so I could take a

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.460 
pretty far down my arm so I could take a
link<00:03:53.709> out<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:53.980> this<00:03:54.100> and<00:03:54.400> still<00:03:55.180> be<00:03:55.269> pretty

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
link out of this and still be pretty

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.449 
link out of this and still be pretty
comfortable<00:03:56.470> so<00:03:56.950> if<00:03:57.040> you<00:03:57.100> have<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> bigger

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
comfortable so if you have a bigger

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.970 
comfortable so if you have a bigger
wrist<00:03:57.760> chances<00:03:58.269> are<00:03:58.390> it's<00:03:58.510> going<00:03:58.570> to<00:03:58.750> fit<00:03:58.980> when

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
wrist chances are it's going to fit when
