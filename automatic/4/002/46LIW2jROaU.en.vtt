00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
really used this before so it's a more

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.580

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
step which is more of a cream obviously

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.240 
step which is more of a cream obviously
because<00:05:03.620> it<00:05:03.680> says<00:05:03.889> it's<00:05:04.039> a<00:05:04.069> cream<00:05:05.590> and<00:05:06.590> then<00:05:06.860> i

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
because it says it's a cream and then i
