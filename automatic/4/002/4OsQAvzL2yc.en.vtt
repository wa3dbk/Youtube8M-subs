00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.600
 What do you do if you make a mistake driving a car? Recently there is a drive recorder . 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.330
 Still expensive 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:17.580
 It is about 20,000 to 50,000 and work to be attached to the car and necessary lesbian 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.590
 Well trial price 20,000 yen a little high There is a useful iphone app there 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.050
 Is a drive recorder 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.500
 This one 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:29.109
 The car mate of car supplies is what the company is offering 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.560
 Carmate I put out various apps and this drive recorder looks like three names this time 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.310
 is 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.310
 It is this 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:41.890
 Start the drive recorder and put it in the record mode. 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:46.329
 It mounts, but at that time acceleration occurs 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:51.429
 When acceleration occurs, it will be recorded in this way . 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:56.589
 It has already been recorded 6 in advance, not from when I felt acceleration 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:01:00.060
 A few seconds later from the acceleration feel before a few seconds 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:05.980
 I will record it, not from the moment of self 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:11.260
 I can get it firmly after I do it before I make an accident 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:16.730
 It's so cheap at 600 yen for the app, I think it is a trial Kirk trial price 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:20.870
 The basic part of the drive recorder can not beat at 600 yen 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:24.560
 When I buy a cheap drive recorder, I do not have the gps function 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:28.400
 iphone version drive recorder gps 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:35.360
 Of course we will work with the map 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:42.440
 This consumption location can be combined with the image after the map is recorded 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:48.950
 I tried it this time, but of course the accident did not have acceleration 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.520
 If you touch this button, you can lock the front and back of the button by touching it 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.830
 I will 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.380
 So I recorded variously and saw the ad drive recorder at night when I bought something cheap 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.280
 Shooting and 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:04.380
 It seems that there is such a defect that becomes very dark 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.070
 Ok if wearing properly dark the way is also practically lock is now Kumano of a car that can light 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.390
 is 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.220
 Where Rassharu with a decent even in the low beam is taken Masu Well of this iphone 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.370
 It may depend on the generation 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.490
 But I went I Fall When was 4 Toka subsequent 4 s 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.540
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.900
 I think there is no doubt I think the previous gray dress and a bit uneasy 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:30.319
 It is be better to try to actually try 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:32.310
 Since it depends on it if Torere that ordinary wall Rareyoru can also be recorded by the drive recorder 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.730
 I will 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:41.250
 First recording will enter a special area 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.480
 Enter a special area in the camera roll with it launched its after The application 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.819
 Export 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.980
 Then you will connect it to a PC or Mac and extract it as a video file . 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.300
 When you export it 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.810
 How to overlay maps and data together 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:02.020
 There are two ways to show only the opening video 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:05.590
 Data rate of the map Toka overlaying and map with or after the speed next to the video 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:10.120
 It is displayed variously This is also convenient 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:14.080
 If course, only the image you're looking for you only can get the image 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.379
 Just resolution vgl is low qvga 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:23.739
 Honesty because it is a quarter of vga 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:25.580
 Well, it is enough for recording, but it is a little bit useless for watching etc. 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.110
 Because it is an easy app 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:32.420
 Or so strange I think that I think we say turned a blind name This drive recorder 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.830
 If you understand what it feels like 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:40.700
 Just 20,000 or 30,000 of the right hardware 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:45.380
 I think it would be better to buy a proper one and install it in the car ness 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:52.600
 Well there is a drawback because I use a smartphone, for example 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:57.310
 It is impossible because you can not raise the drive recorder at the same time as launching the navigation 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.380
 Well people who have to stand-alone navigation will be able to launch the drive recorder in this 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.890
 Because I use 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:06.230
 Well there is such a drawback Well because it is a smartphone 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:11.210
 I think I can not help 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:15.260
 The rest will fall in the middle of the night after recording 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.130
 The application may end This is a bit disappointing 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.320
 but 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.840
 Expect app updates Scratch when exporting google map 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.370
 Though 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.230
 The softening transfer I'd have piled up google map when exporting 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:35.460
 The partial map is displayed if it is not in time 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:39.990
 Be born download that kind of problem there is a map Tteyuu not 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:43.140
 You don't have to wait for rendering 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.930
 That's a bit disappointing I can not see the map 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:50.910
 There is such a place 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:56.430
 There is a slight drawback, but you can enjoy it like a drive recorder 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:58.310
 I recommend you download it and attach it to the car Drive recorder 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.970
 Please try it 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.970
 that's all
