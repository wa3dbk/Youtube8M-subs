00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.980
 Channel Uncle Guilherme 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.980

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.640
 present to a microphone that I just 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.529

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.320
 Sorry, I do not have a camera in there. 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.079
 your web cam so you can keep showing 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.590
 For you all right but I'll open 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.270
 here as much as possible in front of you 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:53.489
 have here and here come 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:58.219
 some papers here are all in Chinese 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.260
 I believe I do not know how to give you a ride. 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:08.960
 and here is the microphone 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.960
 Just beautiful here. 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.770
 oh what a nice microphone 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.530
 I do not know if it 's good, we do not have to be 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:26.720
 still comes a microphone comes also the cable 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.590
 relatively large for you to connect 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:36.860
 microphone and connect directly to the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.790
 computer also comes with a 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.880
 pachi 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.020
 but for you to take the traffic effect 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.860
 When you speak words like paf and vem 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.659
 also 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.979
 This bad shock to put on the tripod 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:02:03.580
 Let me take it for you to see. 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:06.590
 the pectin here better not to lose 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:12.340
 no shock mount also to put 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:15.070
 on the tripod in case you put the microphone 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.340
 inside 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:24.470
 I do not know how it still will be 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.480
 It's not the way it is anyway 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.380
 somehow I put the microphone 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.239
 here inside 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:35.299
 Okay, and then you use it now, I 'll do it. 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.620
 a test for you to see the quality 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.540
 microphone 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.739
 so I 'll be back in a little while, I 'll connect 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.280
 he here on the computer 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.079
 in a little while and then go back surgery 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.340
 I'm back, now with the 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.829
 microphone 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.600
 the audio that is coming now comes straight 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.680
 of the microphone I 'm holding here 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.590
 in front of the microphone 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.780
 I hope it 's good 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.030
 I'll just check in a little while ago 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.920
 you have just finished recording before editing the 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.920
 video to you guys 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.200
 and it 's good to talk a little bit then 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.579
 microphone and I bought that microphone in the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.250
 free market 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.049
 the seller was super cool with me 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.239
 explained it helped a lot and I 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.810
 I will also leave here in the description the 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.790
 link to the seller it does not have any more 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.040
 this microphone was the last one he 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.430
 had but he has a similar one that is a 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.030
 little 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.010
 - the worst zinho but also very good and 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.349
 It was an investment I made here to 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.340
 the channel because my headset it was 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:39.680
 generating a certain echo in the audio I by 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.139
 example I'm playing the game and then the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.180
 game characters were talking 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:47.810
 my micro my headset microphone 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.060
 was picking up the audio also heard 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.790
 besides the audio of the computer then they had 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.620
 sarto echo in the voice of the characters and only 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.139
 I realized when I went to record the first 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.340
 episode of the walking dead that already has 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:03.349
 in the channel you can watch and I solved 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.590
 then buy a desk microphone for 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.269
 computer read in 20 reais and went with it 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.150
 that I recorded the internal walk and that you 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.739
 you may also notice that the audio also 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.719
 it was not very good 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.549
 So I decided to spend more. 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.810
 A bit expensive investment but I think 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.150
 that is very worth it 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.190
 is not a professional microphone but is a 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.300
 microphone that must have a great 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.389
 quality 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.919
 Good, let's see if you really have it then. 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.260
 if you are interested in 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.560
 better check this microphone access 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.550
 description of the seller and can 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.990
 browse the cool balance bm 800 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:44.030
 I hope I have helped you and that you 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.919
 is if they want to buy a microphone I 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.810
 I highly recommend an investment here 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.520
 initial low but it is something that 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.550
 It is worth saying that the microphone 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.979
 It takes too long to break people. 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.940
 I hope you have enjoyed letting me 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.120
 liked it
