00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
know if you remember this guy a long
time<00:01:59.759> ago<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.600> was<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.780> big<00:02:00.990> thing<00:02:01.020> back

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
time ago but it was a big thing back

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.039 
time ago but it was a big thing back
then<00:02:01.829> that's<00:02:02.790> why<00:02:02.909> I'm<00:02:03.149> skeptical<00:02:03.719> on<00:02:03.840> this

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
then that's why I'm skeptical on this

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.539 
then that's why I'm skeptical on this
stuff<00:02:04.259> right<00:02:04.469> here<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:04.920> see<00:02:05.100> any<00:02:05.280> proved

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
stuff right here I don't see any proved

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.700 
stuff right here I don't see any proved
the<00:02:05.729> only<00:02:05.909> proof<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.360> see<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.049> know<00:02:07.170> I

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
the only proof I do see you know I

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.920 
the only proof I do see you know I
bring<00:02:09.520> it<00:02:09.640> up<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:09.820> a<00:02:09.910> second<00:02:10.360> because<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.720> does

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
bring it up in a second because it does

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.210 
bring it up in a second because it does
make<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.320> wonder<00:02:11.350> what<00:02:11.800> in<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.950> heck<00:02:12.070> they're

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
make you wonder what in the heck they're

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.070 
make you wonder what in the heck they're
talking<00:02:12.640> about<00:02:12.700> but<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.540> only<00:02:13.720> proof

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
talking about but this is only proof

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.980 
talking about but this is only proof
that<00:02:14.290> i<00:02:14.320> will<00:02:14.560> go<00:02:14.710> on<00:02:14.920> but<00:02:15.220> uh<00:02:15.660> just<00:02:16.660> going<00:02:16.870> back

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
that i will go on but uh just going back

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.900 
that i will go on but uh just going back
