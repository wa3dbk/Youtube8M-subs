00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:03.440
 Jung Monia Terror 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.490
 and I'll show you 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.629
 The theme of the culprit could be difficult in two final courses 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.119
 Cross came 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.639
 the TRC food stabbing iPod 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.529
 Pole nothing to explain 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.759
 Canon here maybe they can realize that Babs symbol of by 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.869
 he gets the 2 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.960
 instead of 9 now 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.979
 yes, in short, the facts 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.979
 the game big 93 in the Apple Store 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.020
 in my opinion too expensive 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.990
 for what more 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.750
 So it did not show much, though 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.750
 that at least tried 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.670
 and such first time from the campaign maybe later again 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.870
 So a video 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.810
 Multiplayer but now 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.140
 first still further 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.540
 System occupies mission 1 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.540
 they do not have that far yet 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.640
 March we wait a moment 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.210
 so with only short waves for other Black Pegasus 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.000
 Finn Altort 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.210
 essential 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.570
 not graphic from the yacht 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.160
 but not from 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.380
 shape 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.680
 from the Mission or from the campaign MÃ¼nster for a place 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.930
 yes, um 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.750
 also need recently 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.750
 I always test that way from the distribution of controls 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.740
 we find 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.370
 So colleagues area can move us 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.300
 no cloud on the right 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.790
 So what the visor 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.060
 turn the camera panning 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.470
 and no tomorrow if you keep it pressed take care of the sight 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.350
 had 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.330
 You can crouch wrongfully 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.740
 up there on the right want to recognize us can be bad 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.740
 but why always by percent 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.050
 to say one slides second screen 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.820
 who likes to find you can make a change you can 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.499
 So record different Prime 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:12.559
 her promptly 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.599
 there and now the comrade become comrades 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.599
 crispy on the 9th 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:20.349
 looks like this 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.400
 not just such a short gameplay so investigations will be made by Hulu com 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.199
 for complex developments 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:33.219
 the left did not vote 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.679
 in the criticism 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.989
 maybe he leaves open a family man 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.919
 provided accordingly 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.919
 because Michael Strasser is too heavy 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:49.419
 too easy he hated me already dead that's a pretty hard one 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.969
 at the same time to film and play 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.169
 Lord around 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.900
 what can i do now great core hopefully has the short fast 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:01.499
 to get an impression 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.389
 in the video 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.079
 through the Lyon 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.279
 because here still in the main menu account settings still 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:10.939
 Control Space x Factor forest 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.299
 Multiplayer Lisa Zimmermann 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.709
 Haumann video you could be back with trouble 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.090
 out and about was at Colo Colo 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.369
 London 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:22.449
 and then 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.179
 until the flow region
