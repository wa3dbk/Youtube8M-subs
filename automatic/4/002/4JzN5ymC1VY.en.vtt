00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the quest done so I believe I'm probably

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.690 
the quest done so I believe I'm probably
the<00:01:09.840> first<00:01:10.080> person<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.590> put<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> ID<00:01:11.369> because

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the first person to put on a ID because

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.140 
the first person to put on a ID because
uh<00:01:13.010> basically<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.340> looked<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.790> high<00:01:14.880> scores

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
uh basically I looked on the high scores

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.789 
uh basically I looked on the high scores
and<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.330> only<00:01:15.509> people<00:01:15.840> with<00:01:15.930> 70<00:01:16.290> prayer<00:01:16.500> do

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
and the only people with 70 prayer do

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.969 
and the only people with 70 prayer do
not<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.070> 66<00:01:17.640> defense<00:01:18.090> um<00:01:18.470> they're<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.619> 65

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
not have 66 defense um they're like 65

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.950 
not have 66 defense um they're like 65
which<00:01:20.549> means<00:01:20.759> they<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.450> they've<00:01:21.659> done<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
which means they like they've done the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.749 
which means they like they've done the
quest<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.409> don't<00:01:23.130> think<00:01:23.220> they've<00:01:23.400> done<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
quest but I don't think they've done the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.070 
quest but I don't think they've done the
mini-game<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.450> because<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
mini-game for it because if you do the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.749 
mini-game for it because if you do the
quest<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> mini-game<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.159> get<00:01:26.280> 50<00:01:26.640> K

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
quest and the mini-game you get 50 K

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.580 
quest and the mini-game you get 50 K
defense<00:01:27.180> exp<00:01:27.570> which<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.840> believe<00:01:28.110> brings<00:01:28.470> you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
defense exp which I believe brings you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.010 
defense exp which I believe brings you
to<00:01:28.710> 66<00:01:29.280> defense<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> think<00:01:30.509> I'm<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> first

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
to 66 defense so I think I'm the first
