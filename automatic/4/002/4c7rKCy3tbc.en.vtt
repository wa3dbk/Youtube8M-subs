00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.049
 we have 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.240
 yes 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.250
 ah 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.380
 As many of you will already know, I dedicated myself to 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.940
 cycling for 14 years since then 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.710
 since I left him then in the end I've 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.710
 become a lot of tram in quotes 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.090
 because it's a sport that allows me to 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.830
 Less time can train in better 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.070
 conditions that what there was with the bike 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.050
 and then many of you will also know that 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.640
 work or good let's change studying 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.250
 advertising and that I work in an agency 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.649
 of advertising bar agency or production company 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.390
 of content and today's video will go 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.399
 very related to that with the subject of 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.560
 sport and with the theme of advertising and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.940
 is that it hurts especially a lot that 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.580
 this campaign that I am going to teach you today 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.159
 had so little impact so 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.569
 all of today's video will be focused on 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.960
 give visibility to this and I hope that I 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.960
 can you follow 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.470
 yes 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.470
 yes 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.590
 in my career 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.040
 this one that you just saw in images is 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.140
 Shabbat use a woman among so many more 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.810
 of gambia that has to travel 42 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.610
 kilometers every day to be able to go 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.290
 to potable water for his family 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.060
 Last April he decided to run the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.490
 42 kilometers that the marathon has 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.890
 paris to raise awareness about its cause 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.500
 when a bad thing in I shit on the rudder and 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.020
 him and by mime on ebay frank then out for 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.020
 now of your grandson of chiqueros 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.440
 where the dynamics of today is going to be very 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.030
 simple for each source that I 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.030
 find in the tour that I am 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.830
 doing to show solidarity with SÃ¡bato 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.209
 For each source you find, you will donate a 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.209
 euro to the cause were 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.640
 one 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.840
 and with this is how we finish the route of 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.760
 today and this is the fourth source that 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.320
 I found the way so at least 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.210
 we know that we have found four 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.870
 bridges and so you see 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:22.340
 is what he calls a mechanic who 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.340
 they look to accumulate very well 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.060
 so nothing like you have seen at the end 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.370
 I found myself for almost 10 km that 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.710
 I have traveled four sources when 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.950
 really as you have seen it is abated not 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.960
 has not even a well is at 25 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.310
 first away then that's why 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.130
 same as he had commented in the 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.300
 video has decided to donate one euro for each 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.710
 one of the sources that I found 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.720
 during the tour that I made from 10 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.180
 kilometers but as it seemed very little 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.610
 donate four fingers to this cause I will 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.650
 by four because I consider that ten 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.870
 four days as the marathon is done by 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.760
 which will donate sixteen euros to this 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.500
 cause I will leave here the link here 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.540
 down to where you can do your 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.190
 contributions then the 10 kilometers 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.290
 that I have run today as you will see has not 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.380
 been nothing at random because as you can 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.380
 watch 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.680
 I have traveled and I have created the word 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.680
 Orchard 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.180
 and I really wanted to take advantage of this and 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.240
 I think it can be another very cool way 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.340
 to be able to energize this whole issue of 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.470
 the campaign of that abbot a short in the 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.479
 distance that is called that I challenge you to 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.449
 all of you even athletes to 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.250
 whoever you go to the street 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.110
 you run forming a phrase either water 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.330
 or whatever you want 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.220
 do it and do what I've done 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.780
 look at how many accounts you find 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.169
 your path and for each bridge donate 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.169
 one euro
