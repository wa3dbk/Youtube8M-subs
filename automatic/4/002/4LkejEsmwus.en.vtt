00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 in the eyes and compass welcome to another 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.260
 new video and with the saw in the title 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.349
 new update 1.24 and 1.25 of 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.420
 great cars 5 online ok that is it 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.760
 contains and in what help 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.140
 good update was something of which 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.580
 they wanted to speak today because 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.890
 recently these have been a 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.750
 update which contains nothing 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.400
 of new vehicles does not contain 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.080
 new robberies to banks if someone 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.359
 wonders where the new ones are 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.250
 robberies to banks because it does not bring anything of 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.280
 this is not basically that rule in some 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.620
 books and also helps a little and they say 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.780
 many things out there that has helped a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.610
 little to what the graphs are doing and 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.809
 more than anything, some little things 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.270
 Playstation 3 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.770
 it is also rumored by the network that the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.120
 have made a small one of a grade that 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.300
 for those who do not know what a wright is 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.820
 it's an update download and look 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.800
 that I parked I just threw 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.000
 but I'm going to teach you before 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.710
 nothing here as they see it I'm in 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.010
 playstation3 the update on 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.320
 playstation3 weighs almost 100 megabytes like 73 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.810
 megas and when they turn on the console and more 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.820
 that nothing insert the disc and they get 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.880
 You can see that a 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.530
 update more or less in an xbox not 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.380
 It was very soon doing what 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.960
 360 playstation3 and as you see it is the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.810
 version 1.24 here as you can see 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.090
 we have version 1.24 is the version 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.409
 which is going to be applied is remunerated and 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.330
 says a lot of things out there that the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.700
 update on what the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.649
 playstation3 have added a little more 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.119
 graphics since they looked pretty 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.759
 bad robberies to banks when what 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.890
 do we go in big cars 5 online 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.110
 ok either the internal textures of the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.149
 banks some more things or new ones 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.340
 without characters that have been implemented and 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.170
 have been added in the game also it 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 rumored that what they do in the version 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.159
 of Playstation 4 and Xbox One has been done 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.899
 a small low of graphics since they have 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.580
 made a comparison as far as 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.770
 making michael's house either the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.599
 textures and some similar things and it 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.240
 has revealed that some 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:02.189
 textures either the grass or everything like that 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.509
 since you will know when we 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.789
 let's go for example let's do the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.470
 try here here we see the grass 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.539
 and what the old generation doing 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.700
 we can only appreciate what is going 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.560
 basically doing the grass as 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.690
 just as they do not 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.680
 we can not appreciate what it is going 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.599
 making the consoles new 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.050
 generation can be practically 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.209
 see each page that contains the pastor not 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.500
 to put it in some way so it's 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.330
 what is believed to have been done 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.099
 any way rockstar games has not 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.890
 officially announced nothing that e 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.599
 implemented but also what I think 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.970
 that arranged were the public sessions 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.319
 and some things from the invitations already 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.810
 sometimes we did not let invite 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.489
 friends and also when we entered what 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.620
 I was doing online more than anything 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.060
 in public sessions you played you go 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.310
 the game because if you remember 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.200
 when we went to the eclipse towers or 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.840
 any of these apartments what 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.190
 happened was that the vehicles were falling 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.530
 for example if we are going to the eclipse 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.569
 towers and we were heading right here on 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.090
 vehicle was falling the ad began to 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.590
 multiply and many things happened very 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.750
 you miss the truth is something quite 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.730
 good that they have solved the failures 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.730
 since they were fairly constant and 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.739
 also the invitations do not I do not know yet if 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.390
 a patch of tricks has been made 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.400
 because they will know that there was a lot 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.440
 but in the same way if there is any 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.000
 new or if there is some small change it 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.530
 he keeps bringing it in the channel so 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.560
