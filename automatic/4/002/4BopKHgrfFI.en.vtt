region of Japan its heyday was in the

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.420 
region of Japan its heyday was in the
sixteen<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.050> seventeen<00:00:33.230> hundreds<00:00:33.860> of<00:00:34.160> this

sixteen and seventeen hundreds of this
particular<00:00:34.850> design<00:00:35.180> there<00:00:35.839> are<00:00:35.960> only<00:00:36.230> two<00:00:37.160> in

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
particular design there are only two in

particular design there are only two in
North<00:00:38.030> America<00:00:38.570> now

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.280 

I<00:01:03.230> think<00:01:04.230> this<00:01:04.380> is<00:01:04.590> a<00:01:04.670> valuable<00:01:06.290> opportunity

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
I think this is a valuable opportunity

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.890 
I think this is a valuable opportunity
for<00:01:07.440> students<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:09.000> elemental<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.720> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
for students this is as elemental as it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.130 
for students this is as elemental as it
ever<00:01:10.080> gets<00:01:10.200> its<00:01:10.950> traditional<00:01:11.580> primitive<00:01:12.150> yet

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
ever gets its traditional primitive yet

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:22.320 
ever gets its traditional primitive yet
sophisticated

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.030 

this<00:01:23.330> type<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:23.990> kiln<00:01:24.380> was<00:01:24.530> sometimes<00:01:24.950> referred

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
this type of kiln was sometimes referred

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.100 
this type of kiln was sometimes referred
to<00:01:25.280> as<00:01:25.400> a<00:01:25.490> dragon<00:01:25.820> kill<00:01:26.180> just<00:01:26.450> because<00:01:26.630> it's

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
to as a dragon kill just because it's

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.720 
to as a dragon kill just because it's
long<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.410> slender<00:01:27.830> as<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.100> long<00:01:28.370> tail<00:01:28.700> that

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
long and slender as a long tail that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.110 
long and slender as a long tail that
goes<00:01:29.150> up<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.450> hill<00:01:29.480> and<00:01:29.930> it<00:01:30.470> breathes<00:01:30.710> fire

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
goes up the hill and it breathes fire

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.820 
goes up the hill and it breathes fire
and<00:01:32.120> it<00:01:32.420> seems<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:32.930> have<00:01:33.050> a<00:01:33.080> life<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.500> its<00:01:33.680> own

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
and it seems to have a life of its own

00:01:33.830 --> 00:02:04.120 
and it seems to have a life of its own
during<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.310> time<00:01:34.550> that<00:01:34.580> it's<00:01:34.880> firing

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.919 

and<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.119> hardest<00:02:06.299> part<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.840> whole

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
and one of the hardest part of the whole

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.979 
and one of the hardest part of the whole
process<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.679> this<00:02:07.890> waiting<00:02:08.190> period<00:02:08.360> we<00:02:09.360> did<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
process is this waiting period we did a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.199 
process is this waiting period we did a
whole<00:02:10.440> day<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.769> loading<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.610> kiln<00:02:11.849> with<00:02:12.090> all

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
whole day of loading the kiln with all

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.550 
whole day of loading the kiln with all
the<00:02:12.330> students<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.930> then<00:02:13.590> three<00:02:14.489> full<00:02:14.910> days

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
the students and then three full days

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.460 
the students and then three full days
firing<00:02:16.700> very<00:02:17.700> labor<00:02:18.000> intensive<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:18.870> then

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
firing very labor intensive and then

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.770 
firing very labor intensive and then
sealing<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.010> all<00:02:20.129> up<00:02:20.310> afterwards<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.180> then

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
sealing it all up afterwards and then

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.229 
sealing it all up afterwards and then
you<00:02:22.019> have<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.260> weight<00:02:22.560> we<00:02:22.769> kind<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.239> wonder

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
you have this weight we kind of wonder

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.729 
you have this weight we kind of wonder
how<00:02:24.390> what<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.720> pieces<00:02:24.959> really<00:02:25.260> looked<00:02:25.590> like

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
how what the pieces really looked like

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.990 
how what the pieces really looked like
you<00:02:25.860> know<00:02:25.980> what<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.190> firing<00:02:26.610> done<00:02:26.790> really

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
you know what the firing done really

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.180 
you know what the firing done really
well<00:02:27.239> has<00:02:27.780> always<00:02:28.170> has<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> little<00:02:28.830> moments<00:02:29.129> of

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
well has always has a little moments of

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.880 
well has always has a little moments of
struggle<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.819> then<00:02:30.390> ultimately<00:02:30.890> everything

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
struggle and then ultimately everything

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.259 
struggle and then ultimately everything
works<00:02:32.190> out<00:02:32.340> beautiful<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:32.940> then<00:02:33.030> we're<00:02:33.120> just

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
works out beautiful and then we're just

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.819 
works out beautiful and then we're just
waiting<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.750> see<00:02:33.780> what<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> pieces<00:02:34.470> really

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
waiting to see what the pieces really

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:41.220 
waiting to see what the pieces really
look<00:02:35.010> like

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.900 

we<00:02:42.230> -<00:02:42.440> is<00:02:42.650> actually<00:02:42.920> made<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.370> calcium

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
the hottest part of the firing the

this<00:03:02.120> contribution<00:03:02.780> here<00:03:03.320> so<00:03:03.920> other<00:03:04.220> little

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
this contribution here so other little

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.880 
this contribution here so other little

areas around have different colors

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.380 
areas around have different colors
depending<00:03:07.010> on<00:03:07.340> whether<00:03:07.580> they're<00:03:07.850> influenced

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
depending on whether they're influenced

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.600 
depending on whether they're influenced
more<00:03:08.600> by<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:09.530> larger<00:03:09.890> particles<00:03:10.340> or<00:03:10.580> the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
more by the larger particles or the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.830 
more by the larger particles or the
vapors<00:03:11.330> of<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.630> potassium

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840
