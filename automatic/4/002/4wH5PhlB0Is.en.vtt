differences of the first release on and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.890 
differences of the first release on and
the<00:02:22.920> armors<00:02:23.310> odd<00:02:23.490> this<00:02:24.030> one<00:02:24.090> besides<00:02:24.660> having

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
the armors odd this one besides having

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.930 
the armors odd this one besides having
facial<00:02:25.170> hair<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> lot<00:02:25.620> bulkier<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.400> feel<00:02:26.790> like

this is what they wear underneath the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.640 
this is what they wear underneath the
armor<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.600> if<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:31.170> what<00:02:31.350> they<00:02:31.470> wear
