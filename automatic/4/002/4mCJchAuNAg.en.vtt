this puzzle in the mail yesterday from

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.190 
this puzzle in the mail yesterday from
cubes<00:00:08.639> christine<00:00:09.150> as<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.750> can<00:00:09.929> see<00:00:10.170> right

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
cubes christine as you can see right

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.610 
cubes christine as you can see right
here<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:11.090> my<00:00:12.090> mom<00:00:12.120> opened<00:00:12.480> up<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.870> package<00:00:13.290> so

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
here and my mom opened up the package so

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.320 
here and my mom opened up the package so
i<00:00:13.860> just<00:00:14.429> decided<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.880> would<00:00:14.940> do<00:00:15.120> first

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
i just decided I would do first

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.029 
i just decided I would do first
impressions<00:00:15.870> but<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.109> might<00:00:16.320> actually<00:00:16.500> switch

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
impressions but I might actually switch

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.189 
impressions but I might actually switch
to<00:00:17.310> just<00:00:17.490> doing<00:00:17.730> first<00:00:17.880> impressions<00:00:18.480> simply

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
to just doing first impressions simply

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.230 
to just doing first impressions simply
because<00:00:19.470> it's<00:00:19.619> faster<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.130> easier<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.880> do<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
because it's faster and easier to do and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.620 
because it's faster and easier to do and
the<00:00:21.330> box<00:00:21.960> portion<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.269> unboxings<00:00:24.269> really

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
the box portion of the unboxings really

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.220 
the box portion of the unboxings really
are<00:00:24.779> irrelevant<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:26.420> if<00:00:27.420> i<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.720> get<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:27.990> out

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
are irrelevant so if i can get this out

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.229 
are irrelevant so if i can get this out
will<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.769> first<00:00:29.039> impressions<00:00:31.640> so<00:00:32.640> first<00:00:33.030> off

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
will do first impressions so first off

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.420 
will do first impressions so first off
looking<00:00:33.719> at<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.989> stickers<00:00:34.380> i<00:00:34.710> really<00:00:35.250> like

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
looking at the stickers i really like

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.860 
looking at the stickers i really like
the<00:00:35.579> shade<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.000> i<00:00:36.030> probably<00:00:36.300> won't<00:00:36.570> end<00:00:36.750> up

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
the shade so i probably won't end up

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.400 
the shade so i probably won't end up
changing<00:00:37.140> these<00:00:37.559> stickers<00:00:37.829> i<00:00:38.280> also<00:00:39.050> i'm<00:00:40.050> not

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
changing these stickers i also i'm not

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.869 
changing these stickers i also i'm not
quite<00:00:40.649> sure<00:00:40.680> but<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.129> i'm<00:00:41.309> assuming<00:00:41.640> this

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
quite sure but this i'm assuming this

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.400 
quite sure but this i'm assuming this
probably<00:00:42.210> won't<00:00:42.390> become<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:42.809> main<00:00:43.020> because<00:00:43.379> i

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
probably won't become my main because i

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.220 
probably won't become my main because i
really<00:00:43.739> like<00:00:43.920> my<00:00:44.100> mini<00:00:44.280> oh<00:00:44.340> sooo<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.629> from

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
really like my mini oh sooo but from

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.600 
really like my mini oh sooo but from
what<00:00:46.350> i've<00:00:46.469> heard<00:00:46.530> about<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.010> puzzle<00:00:47.430> it's

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
what i've heard about this puzzle it's

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.940 
what i've heard about this puzzle it's
simply<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.270> cheaper<00:00:49.200> version<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> way

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
simply a cheaper version of the way

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.459 
simply a cheaper version of the way
steal<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.460> has<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> similar<00:00:51.420> mechanism<00:00:51.750> it's

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
steal it has a similar mechanism it's

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.410 
steal it has a similar mechanism it's
just<00:00:52.739> made<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.100> cheaper<00:00:53.760> plastic<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
just made with cheaper plastic and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.830 
just made with cheaper plastic and
therefore<00:00:54.870> less<00:00:55.110> expensive<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.820> that's<00:00:57.719> just

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
therefore less expensive but that's just

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.540 
therefore less expensive but that's just
what<00:00:58.020> I've<00:00:58.109> heard<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.530> can't<00:00:58.800> confirm<00:00:59.010> or<00:00:59.340> deny

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
what I've heard I can't confirm or deny

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.920 
what I've heard I can't confirm or deny
it<00:00:59.670> so<00:00:59.910> i'll<00:01:00.000> definitely<00:01:00.390> research<00:01:00.719> that

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it so i'll definitely research that

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.039 
it so i'll definitely research that
before<00:01:01.230> i<00:01:01.260> do<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.559> review<00:01:02.570> but<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> get

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
before i do the review but just to get

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.940 
before i do the review but just to get
into<00:01:04.170> first<00:01:04.470> turns<00:01:06.260> these<00:01:07.260> technically<00:01:07.830> are

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
into first turns these technically are

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.770 
into first turns these technically are
not<00:01:08.130> my<00:01:08.310> first<00:01:08.549> turns<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.330> these<00:01:09.420> if
