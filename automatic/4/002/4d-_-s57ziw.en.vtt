today<00:00:10.790> we<00:00:10.880> will<00:00:11.000> be<00:00:11.090> going<00:00:11.270> through<00:00:11.390> the

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:11.600 
today we will be going through the

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.590 
today we will be going through the
dendrochronology<00:00:12.110> technique<00:00:13.100> as<00:00:13.600> discussed

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 
dendrochronology technique as discussed

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.820 
dendrochronology technique as discussed
in<00:00:14.660> our<00:00:14.780> like<00:00:14.990> an<00:00:15.170> auditory<00:00:15.530> video

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
in our like an auditory video

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.859 
in our like an auditory video
dendrochronology<00:00:16.610> can<00:00:17.300> be<00:00:17.450> used<00:00:17.689> in

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
dendrochronology can be used in

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.170 
dendrochronology can be used in
conjunction<00:00:18.050> with<00:00:18.500> lichen<00:00:19.040> operatory<00:00:19.490> to

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
conjunction with lichen operatory to

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.480 
conjunction with lichen operatory to
date<00:00:20.480> rock<00:00:20.960> full<00:00:21.230> of<00:00:21.349> it<00:00:21.470> and<00:00:21.710> as<00:00:22.130> you<00:00:22.310> can<00:00:22.430> see

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
date rock full of it and as you can see

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.880 
date rock full of it and as you can see
we're<00:00:23.180> standing<00:00:23.450> in<00:00:23.540> an<00:00:23.630> area<00:00:24.020> of<00:00:24.050> a<00:00:24.349> previous

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
we're standing in an area of a previous

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:34.229 
we're standing in an area of a previous
massive<00:00:25.550> rock<00:00:25.790> full<00:00:26.029> event

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.400 

so<00:00:35.239> today<00:00:35.510> we're<00:00:35.629> going<00:00:35.719> to<00:00:35.809> take<00:00:35.989> you<00:00:36.140> through

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
so today we're going to take you through

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.590 
so today we're going to take you through
how<00:00:36.770> to<00:00:36.800> Cora<00:00:37.190> truth<00:00:37.489> so<00:00:38.269> you've<00:00:38.390> got<00:00:38.480> the

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
how to Cora truth so you've got the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.329 
how to Cora truth so you've got the
following<00:00:38.960> instruments<00:00:39.620> to<00:00:39.800> call<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.129> tree

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
following instruments to call the tree

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:45.459 
following instruments to call the tree
so<00:00:43.339> what<00:00:43.519> you<00:00:43.610> want<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:43.940> do<00:00:44.149> is<00:00:44.570> take<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.260> first

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
so what you want to do is take the first

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.680 
so what you want to do is take the first
instrument<00:00:45.860> here<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.789> you<00:00:47.030> want<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.269> place<00:00:47.480> it

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
instrument here and you want to place it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:56.020 
instrument here and you want to place it
roughly<00:00:48.110> at<00:00:48.289> chest<00:00:48.649> level<00:00:49.540> so<00:00:52.750> just<00:00:54.969> put<00:00:55.969> that

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
roughly at chest level so just put that

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.759 
roughly at chest level so just put that
in<00:00:56.239> there<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.629> you<00:00:56.719> take<00:00:56.899> this<00:00:56.960> instrument

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
in there and you take this instrument

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.610 
in there and you take this instrument
here<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:58.629> you<00:00:59.629> place<00:00:59.899> that<00:01:00.170> in<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.469> hole

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
here and you place that in the hole

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.919 
here and you place that in the hole
there<00:01:01.299> and<00:01:02.530> then<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:04.100> rest<00:01:04.489> this<00:01:05.269> instrument

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:05.929 
there and then you rest this instrument

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:07.960 
there and then you rest this instrument
all<00:01:06.080> together<00:01:06.259> move<00:01:07.009> it<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.250> pressure<00:01:07.490> on<00:01:07.789> your

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
all together move it to pressure on your

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:21.389 
all together move it to pressure on your
chest<00:01:11.560> you<00:01:12.560> start<00:01:12.979> to<00:01:13.250> cool

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.429 

so<00:01:21.909> we're<00:01:22.090> removing<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.570> core<00:01:22.929> what<00:01:23.170> you<00:01:23.289> want

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
so we're removing the core what you want

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.120 
so we're removing the core what you want
to<00:01:23.590> do<00:01:23.799> is<00:01:24.070> you<00:01:24.969> want<00:01:25.149> to<00:01:25.240> turn<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:26.409> increment

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
to do is you want to turn the increment

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.020 
to do is you want to turn the increment
90<00:01:27.850> degrees<00:01:28.210> but<00:01:28.390> this<00:01:28.509> time<00:01:28.780> anti-clockwise

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
90 degrees but this time anti-clockwise

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.450 
90 degrees but this time anti-clockwise
before<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.119> take<00:01:31.329> it<00:01:31.479> out<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:32.259> then<00:01:33.100> you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
before you take it out and then you

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.899 
before you take it out and then you
literally<00:01:33.819> just<00:01:34.539> pull<00:01:34.929> out<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.380> core<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:36.850> you

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
literally just pull out the core as you

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.649 
literally just pull out the core as you
can<00:01:37.179> see<00:01:37.329> it's<00:01:37.479> quite<00:01:37.689> difficult<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:40.240> then

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
can see it's quite difficult and then

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.709 
can see it's quite difficult and then
you've<00:01:40.780> got<00:01:40.929> your<00:01:41.020> core<00:01:41.289> and<00:01:42.250> as<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.390> can<00:01:43.479> see

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
you've got your core and as you can see

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.919 
you've got your core and as you can see
that's<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:44.140> halfway<00:01:44.319> mark<00:01:44.530> just<00:01:45.039> there<00:01:45.340> and

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
that's the halfway mark just there and

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.719 
that's the halfway mark just there and
you'd<00:01:46.929> be<00:01:47.079> counting<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.770> Rings<00:01:48.069> from<00:01:48.310> there

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
you'd be counting the Rings from there

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.280 
you'd be counting the Rings from there
to<00:01:49.299> there

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.990 

after<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.500> collected<00:01:55.650> your<00:01:56.130> core<00:01:56.400> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
after you have collected your core the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.330 
after you have collected your core the
next<00:01:57.330> set<00:01:57.510> is<00:01:57.720> to<00:01:57.990> place<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.409> into<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.770> tube<00:01:59.130> or

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
next set is to place it into a tube or

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.060 
next set is to place it into a tube or
container<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.720> store<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.290> prevent<00:02:01.920> it

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
container to store it and prevent it

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.800 
container to store it and prevent it
from<00:02:02.100> being<00:02:02.460> damaged<00:02:02.940> before<00:02:03.090> analysis

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
from being damaged before analysis

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.740 
from being damaged before analysis
always<00:02:04.770> remember<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.670> label<00:02:05.850> your<00:02:06.210> cause<00:02:06.510> as

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
always remember to label your cause as

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.059 
always remember to label your cause as
soon<00:02:07.140> as<00:02:07.320> they<00:02:07.470> have<00:02:07.560> been<00:02:07.710> collected

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.009 

it's<00:02:13.430> also<00:02:13.549> important<00:02:14.299> to<00:02:14.360> note<00:02:14.629> when

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
it's also important to note when

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.170 
it's also important to note when
carrying<00:02:15.409> out<00:02:15.590> dendrochronology<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:17.060> if

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
carrying out dendrochronology that if

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.240 
carrying out dendrochronology that if
you<00:02:17.299> do<00:02:17.510> make<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.780> mistake<00:02:18.019> you<00:02:18.500> cannot<00:02:18.769> then<00:02:19.040> go

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
you do make a mistake you cannot then go

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.429 
you do make a mistake you cannot then go
and<00:02:19.549> caught<00:02:19.909> the<00:02:20.390> treat<00:02:20.629> a<00:02:20.810> second<00:02:21.200> time

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
and caught the treat a second time

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.309 
and caught the treat a second time
because<00:02:22.099> it<00:02:22.340> needs<00:02:22.549> time<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:23.060> regenerate<00:02:23.390> so

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
because it needs time to regenerate so

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.259 
because it needs time to regenerate so
if<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.680> do<00:02:24.860> make<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:25.129> mistake<00:02:25.220> just<00:02:25.879> move<00:02:26.060> on<00:02:26.239> to

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
if you do make a mistake just move on to

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.520 
if you do make a mistake just move on to
another<00:02:26.629> truth
