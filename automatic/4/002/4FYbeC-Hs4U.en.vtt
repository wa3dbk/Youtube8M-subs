00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.000 
Ultron yeah and I think that it didn't
happen<00:00:22.420> quite<00:00:22.930> quick<00:00:23.230> enough<00:00:23.260> and<00:00:23.590> that's<00:00:23.770> why

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
happen quite quick enough and that's why

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.230 
happen quite quick enough and that's why
there's<00:00:24.220> no<00:00:24.370> post<00:00:24.580> credit<00:00:24.880> scene<00:00:24.910> they<00:00:25.180> were

there's no post credit scene they were

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.190 
there's no post credit scene they were
like<00:00:25.450> we're<00:00:25.630> not<00:00:25.720> just<00:00:25.870> gonna<00:00:25.960> throw

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
like we're not just gonna throw

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.110 
like we're not just gonna throw
something<00:00:26.650> on<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:26.830> end<00:00:26.980> of<00:00:27.070> it<00:00:27.160> so<00:00:27.940> I<00:00:27.970> think

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.120 
something on the end of it so I think

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.450
