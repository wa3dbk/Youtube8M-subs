base it's pretty solid too so I'll just

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.740 
base it's pretty solid too so I'll just
get<00:02:37.150> into<00:02:37.329> the<00:02:37.450> base<00:02:37.599> a<00:02:37.629> little<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.659> the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
get into the base a little it's it's the

for he can stand on nicely on there some
good<00:02:57.790> detail<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.329> this<00:02:58.419> base<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:59.049> pretty<00:02:59.560> good

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
good detail in this base of pretty good

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.750 
good detail in this base of pretty good
it's<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.599> pretty<00:03:01.780> solid<00:03:02.049> base<00:03:02.409> too<00:03:02.739> so<00:03:04.590> yeah

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
it's a pretty solid base too so yeah

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.569 
it's a pretty solid base too so yeah
very<00:03:06.760> nice<00:03:06.909> and<00:03:08.069> for<00:03:09.069> a<00:03:09.099> quick<00:03:09.340> size

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
very nice and for a quick size

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.509 
very nice and for a quick size
comparison<00:03:11.189> here's<00:03:12.189> Meg<00:03:12.400> needle<00:03:13.199> and<00:03:14.430> here<00:03:15.430> he

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
comparison here's Meg needle and here he

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.330 
comparison here's Meg needle and here he
is<00:03:15.549> compared<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:17.069> marvel<00:03:18.069> legends

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
is compared to a marvel legends

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.069 
is compared to a marvel legends
Wolverine<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.510> that's<00:03:22.870> pretty<00:03:23.169> good<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.959> know

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
Wolverine so that's pretty good you know

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.780 
Wolverine so that's pretty good you know
I<00:03:26.109> think<00:03:26.349> that's<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.799> beret<00:03:27.159> you<00:03:27.220> know<00:03:27.430> it's<00:03:27.609> not

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
I think that's a beret you know it's not

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.159 
I think that's a beret you know it's not
that<00:03:28.030> bad<00:03:28.209> for<00:03:28.949> another<00:03:29.949> one<00:03:31.799> hi<00:03:32.799> home<00:03:33.989> next<00:03:34.989> to

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
that bad for another one hi home next to

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.809 
that bad for another one hi home next to
Colossus<00:03:36.239> these<00:03:37.239> almost<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.629> same<00:03:37.810> sizes

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
Colossus these almost the same sizes

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:48.830 
Colossus these almost the same sizes
marvel<00:03:39.819> legends<00:03:40.120> classes<00:03:42.419> so<00:03:43.419> yeah

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.160 

so<00:03:49.840> it's<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.680> very<00:03:50.710> good<00:03:51.280> figure<00:03:52.050> but<00:03:53.050> the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
so it's a very good figure but the

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.130 
so it's a very good figure but the
question<00:03:53.470> is<00:03:53.530> do<00:03:53.740> I<00:03:53.830> recommend<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.840> well<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:58.140> do

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
question is do I recommend it well I do

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.290 
question is do I recommend it well I do
recommend<00:03:59.800> it<00:04:00.070> but<00:04:00.190> if<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.550> have<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.970> Marvel

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
recommend it but if you have the Marvel

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.420 
recommend it but if you have the Marvel
Legends<00:04:01.690> make<00:04:01.900> needle<00:04:02.290> then<00:04:02.500> I<00:04:02.650> would<00:04:02.920> skip<00:04:03.130> on

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
Legends make needle then I would skip on

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.970 
Legends make needle then I would skip on
this<00:04:03.610> because<00:04:04.080> although<00:04:05.080> this<00:04:05.470> one<00:04:05.740> is<00:04:05.890> very

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
this because although this one is very

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.840 
this because although this one is very
nice<00:04:06.460> and<00:04:06.820> it's<00:04:06.970> well<00:04:07.480> detailed<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:08.850> limited

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
nice and it's well detailed and limited

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.850 
nice and it's well detailed and limited
articulation<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.750> have<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.230> say<00:04:11.410> that<00:04:11.440> the

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
articulation I have to say that the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.890 
articulation I have to say that the
Marvel<00:04:12.160> Legends<00:04:12.520> big<00:04:12.670> needle<00:04:12.970> just<00:04:13.600> works<00:04:13.780> a

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
Marvel Legends big needle just works a

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.460 
Marvel Legends big needle just works a
lot<00:04:14.080> better<00:04:14.140> in<00:04:14.680> displays<00:04:15.580> and<00:04:16.090> setups<00:04:16.600> this

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
lot better in displays and setups this

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.170 
lot better in displays and setups this
one<00:04:17.650> will<00:04:17.769> work<00:04:18.010> good<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.609> maybe<00:04:18.970> if<00:04:19.090> you

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
one will work good to maybe if you

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.479 
one will work good to maybe if you
haven't<00:04:19.450> been<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.630> back<00:04:19.840> more<00:04:20.340> but<00:04:21.340> if<00:04:21.430> you

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
haven't been the back more but if you

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.820 
haven't been the back more but if you
have<00:04:21.580> an<00:04:21.670> op<00:04:21.790> real<00:04:22.030> close<00:04:22.390> it<00:04:22.870> might<00:04:23.590> look<00:04:23.740> a

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
have an op real close it might look a

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.670 
have an op real close it might look a
little<00:04:23.980> weird<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:25.030> little<00:04:25.150> bit<00:04:25.390> but<00:04:26.170> so<00:04:26.650> I

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
little weird a little bit but so I

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.010
