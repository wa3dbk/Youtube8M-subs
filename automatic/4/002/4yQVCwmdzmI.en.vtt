their approach to building cars from the
ground<00:00:22.660> up<00:00:22.930> typically<00:00:23.740> what<00:00:23.980> happens<00:00:24.010> with

ground up typically what happens with
the<00:00:24.610> car<00:00:24.850> business<00:00:25.060> is<00:00:25.420> you<00:00:25.539> take<00:00:25.750> an<00:00:25.930> older

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
the car business is you take an older

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.200 
the car business is you take an older
engine<00:00:26.500> with<00:00:26.890> maybe<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.220> new<00:00:27.340> transmission<00:00:27.789> and

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
engine with maybe a new transmission and

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.000 
engine with maybe a new transmission and
try<00:00:28.360> and<00:00:28.480> put<00:00:28.600> it<00:00:28.720> into<00:00:28.930> a<00:00:28.960> new<00:00:29.170> body<00:00:29.380> mass<00:00:29.770> has

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
try and put it into a new body mass has

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.380 
try and put it into a new body mass has
decided<00:00:30.369> when<00:00:30.640> they're<00:00:30.760> coming<00:00:31.000> up<00:00:31.090> with<00:00:31.270> new

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.389 
decided when they're coming up with new
vehicles<00:00:31.600> to<00:00:32.259> do<00:00:32.379> a<00:00:32.410> cohesive<00:00:33.100> from<00:00:33.309> the

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
vehicles to do a cohesive from the

vehicles to do a cohesive from the
ground<00:00:33.699> up<00:00:34.000> approach<00:00:34.360> to<00:00:34.809> develop<00:00:35.199> the<00:00:35.289> car

ground up approach to develop the car

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.770 
ground up approach to develop the car
all<00:00:35.710> at<00:00:35.949> once<00:00:36.160> so<00:00:36.760> this<00:00:36.999> vehicle<00:00:37.210> has<00:00:37.539> a<00:00:37.569> new

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
all at once so this vehicle has a new

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.649 
all at once so this vehicle has a new
platform<00:00:38.079> new<00:00:38.859> transmission<00:00:39.640> new<00:00:39.850> engine<00:00:40.480> and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:40.659 
platform new transmission new engine and

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:43.110 
platform new transmission new engine and
they're<00:00:41.109> trying<00:00:41.379> to<00:00:41.440> inject<00:00:41.890> that<00:00:42.159> Mazda<00:00:42.489> DNA

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
they're trying to inject that Mazda DNA

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.939 
they're trying to inject that Mazda DNA
which<00:00:43.329> is<00:00:43.359> zum-zum<00:00:44.170> and<00:00:44.379> everybody<00:00:44.710> knows

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
which is zum-zum and everybody knows

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.399 
which is zum-zum and everybody knows
that<00:00:44.979> so<00:00:45.850> what<00:00:46.479> they've<00:00:46.659> done<00:00:46.690> on<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.079> outside

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
that so what they've done on the outside

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.290 
that so what they've done on the outside
is<00:00:47.530> tried<00:00:47.800> to<00:00:47.829> make<00:00:48.159> it<00:00:48.339> a<00:00:48.460> very<00:00:48.640> aggressive

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
is tried to make it a very aggressive

looks<00:00:51.999> like<00:00:52.239> it's<00:00:52.420> more<00:00:52.629> expensive<00:00:53.260> than<00:00:53.440> it

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
looks like it's more expensive than it

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.860 
looks like it's more expensive than it
actually<00:00:53.710> is<00:00:53.979> it<00:00:54.639> has<00:00:54.789> a<00:00:54.819> long<00:00:55.179> hood<00:00:55.539> with<00:00:55.839> a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
gone with 17 inch alloy wheels you don't

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.270 
gone with 17 inch alloy wheels you don't
have<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.960> spend<00:01:14.200> more<00:01:14.409> to<00:01:14.530> get<00:01:14.680> alloys<00:01:15.009> and

think<00:01:29.619> it's<00:01:29.740> around<00:01:29.950> $1,200<00:01:30.850> so<00:01:31.420> here's<00:01:31.750> the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
think it's around $1,200 so here's the

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.800 
think it's around $1,200 so here's the
first<00:01:32.170> look<00:01:32.469> at<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.649> outside<00:01:32.829> of<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.880> Mazda<00:01:34.509> 6

first look at the outside of the Mazda 6

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.080 
first look at the outside of the Mazda 6
all<00:01:35.109> new<00:01:35.560> with<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.100> new<00:01:36.369> engine<00:01:36.609> that<00:01:36.939> they're

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
all new with a new engine that they're

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.910 
all new with a new engine that they're
also<00:01:37.240> going<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.539> use<00:01:37.810> in<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.140> cx-5<00:01:38.560> we're

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
also going to use in the cx-5 we're

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.200 
also going to use in the cx-5 we're
going<00:01:39.039> to<00:01:39.100> have<00:01:39.189> an<00:01:39.250> update<00:01:39.520> on<00:01:39.549> that<00:01:39.670> vehicle

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
going to have an update on that vehicle

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:50.750 
going to have an update on that vehicle
as<00:01:40.299> well<00:01:40.450> so<00:01:40.659> let's<00:01:40.810> have<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:40.960> look<00:01:41.079> inside

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.920 

what<00:01:51.760> I<00:01:51.790> like<00:01:52.090> about<00:01:52.120> Mazda<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:52.840> their

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
what I like about Mazda and their

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.360 
what I like about Mazda and their
approach<00:01:53.200> for<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.470> inside<00:01:53.800> of<00:01:53.979> their<00:01:54.100> latest

enjoy every day so we talked about the
fact<00:03:42.690> that<00:03:42.870> Mazda<00:03:43.200> has<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.620> suite<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.400> new

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
fact that Mazda has a suite of new

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.240 
fact that Mazda has a suite of new
technology<00:03:45.270> that<00:03:45.300> makes<00:03:45.690> up<00:03:45.900> SKYACTIV<00:03:46.710> well

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
technology that makes up SKYACTIV well

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.500

the<00:03:47.310> first<00:03:47.580> one<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.880> most<00:03:48.030> important<00:03:48.420> with

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
the first one of the most important with

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.820 
the first one of the most important with

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
this master six is the new

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.280 
this master six is the new

you<00:03:59.040> have<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.190> use<00:03:59.310> premium<00:03:59.880> gas<00:04:00.150> when<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.480> use

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
you have to use premium gas when you use

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.390 
you have to use premium gas when you use
high<00:04:00.810> compression<00:04:01.440> but<00:04:01.590> not<00:04:01.890> with<00:04:02.190> this

high compression but not with this

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.070 
high compression but not with this
because<00:04:03.150> what<00:04:03.330> they<00:04:03.420> being<00:04:03.570> able<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.810> do<00:04:03.960> is

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
because what they being able to do is

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.840 
because what they being able to do is
stagger<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:05.010> way<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.430> fuel<00:04:05.700> gets

stagger the way that the fuel gets

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.610 
stagger the way that the fuel gets
injected<00:04:06.090> into<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.900> cylinder<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.470> they've

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
injected into the cylinder and they've

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.560 
injected into the cylinder and they've
changed<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.190> top<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.670> cylinder<00:04:09.000> head<00:04:09.120> and

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
changed the top of the cylinder head and

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.360 
changed the top of the cylinder head and
that<00:04:09.960> means<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.320> can<00:04:10.470> run<00:04:10.650> regular<00:04:11.130> gas

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
that means you can run regular gas

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.110 
that means you can run regular gas

you<00:04:17.160> really<00:04:17.190> notice<00:04:17.700> when<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.090> drive<00:04:18.269> this

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
you really notice when you drive this

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.370 
you really notice when you drive this
