better than most other methods at this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.330 
better than most other methods at this
time<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> game<00:01:28.650> now<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> look

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
time in the game now if you have a look

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.399 
time in the game now if you have a look
exactly<00:01:30.210> what<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.659> before<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.079> start<00:01:31.290> it's

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
exactly what it is before we start it's

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.600 
exactly what it is before we start it's
going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.829> these<00:01:31.950> gold<00:01:32.220> healing

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
going to be with these gold healing

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.550 
going to be with these gold healing
cards<00:01:32.939> now<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.090> reason<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.600> working<00:01:34.140> so

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
cards now the reason this is working so

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560 
cards now the reason this is working so
well<00:01:34.829> at<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.280> time<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.790> obviously<00:01:36.390> because

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
well at this time is obviously because

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.300 
well at this time is obviously because
team<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.869> season<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.159> is

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
team the season and that there is

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.999 
team the season and that there is
unlimited<00:01:38.880> 15k<00:01:39.780> packed<00:01:40.079> out<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.770> another

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
unlimited 15k packed out for another

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.410 
unlimited 15k packed out for another
three<00:01:41.340> days<00:01:41.369> know<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.150> basically

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
three days know what this basically

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.749 
three days know what this basically
means<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.799> there's<00:01:43.979> double<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
means is is that there's double the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.700 
means is is that there's double the
amount<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.090> consumables<00:01:45.659> nearly<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
amount of consumables nearly on the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.929 
amount of consumables nearly on the
market<00:01:47.009> at<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.130> moment<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.790> they're

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
market at the moment then they're

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.789 
market at the moment then they're
normally<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.450> now<00:01:48.659> obviously<00:01:49.020> trading<00:01:49.619> and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
normally is now obviously trading and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.200 
normally is now obviously trading and
healing<00:01:50.189> cars<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.520> stuff<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.820> are

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
healing cars and stuff like that are

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.569 
healing cars and stuff like that are
going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.810> involved<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.380> these<00:01:52.530> packs<00:01:52.860> so

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
going to be involved in these packs so

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.580 
going to be involved in these packs so
that<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.909> why<00:01:54.119> they<00:01:54.450> are<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.810> easy<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.259> trade

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
that is why they are so easy to trade

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.260 
that is why they are so easy to trade
with<00:01:55.829> now<00:01:56.250> as<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.399> said<00:01:56.640> before<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:56.939> done

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
with now as I said before I have done

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.760 
with now as I said before I have done
this<00:01:57.390> sort<00:01:57.570> method<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.990> my<00:01:58.140> channel<00:01:58.619> before

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
this sort method on my channel before

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.530 
this sort method on my channel before
but<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> lot<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.280> them<00:01:59.399> don't<00:01:59.610> work<00:01:59.850> now<00:02:00.060> so

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
but a lot of them don't work now so

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.149 
but a lot of them don't work now so
basically<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.350> time<00:02:01.560> again<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.950> want<00:02:02.100> to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
basically this time again you want to

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.920 
basically this time again you want to
forget<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.790> old<00:02:02.909> methods<00:02:03.329> they've<00:02:03.750> been

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
forget all the old methods they've been

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.450 
forget all the old methods they've been
working<00:02:04.110> great<00:02:04.469> for<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.009> know<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> past

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
working great for that you know the past

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.310 
working great for that you know the past
six<00:02:05.700> or<00:02:05.790> seven<00:02:06.090> months<00:02:06.210> but<00:02:06.719> for<00:02:06.930> now<00:02:06.960> with

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
six or seven months but for now with

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.869 
six or seven months but for now with
team<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> season<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.429> market<00:02:08.789> is

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
team the season out the market is

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.639 
team the season out the market is
completely<00:02:09.450> different<00:02:09.569> with<00:02:09.780> price<00:02:10.020> caps<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
completely different with price caps and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.800 
completely different with price caps and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
ranges these sort of videos now longer

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.460 
ranges these sort of videos now longer
we<00:02:12.930> make<00:02:13.110> an

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
we make an

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.960 
we make an
are<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.950> ones<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.310> are<00:02:14.460> going<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.700> earn<00:02:14.820> you

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
are the ones that are going to earn you

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.060 
are the ones that are going to earn you
lots<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.330> coins<00:02:15.510> now<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.500> prices<00:02:16.920> have

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
lots of coins now the prices have

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.680 
lots of coins now the prices have
completely<00:02:17.670> changed<00:02:17.850> if<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.420> have<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.600> look

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
completely changed if we have a look

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.180 
completely changed if we have a look
that<00:02:18.780> go<00:02:18.990> for<00:02:19.200> now<00:02:19.260> they<00:02:19.560> usually<00:02:19.830> go<00:02:19.920> friend

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
that go for now they usually go friend

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.160 
that go for now they usually go friend
about<00:02:20.280> 800<00:02:20.940> it's<00:02:21.360> easy<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.720> filter<00:02:22.050> out

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
about 800 it's easy to filter out

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.750 
about 800 it's easy to filter out
obviously<00:02:22.740> with<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.920> healing<00:02:23.250> cars<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:23.610> not

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
obviously with the healing cars is not

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.010 
obviously with the healing cars is not
just<00:02:23.970> one<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.180> them<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.570> have<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.780> try<00:02:24.930> and

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
just one of them so you have to try and

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.140 
just one of them so you have to try and
filter<00:02:25.230> out<00:02:25.500> like<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.670> have<00:02:26.760> look<00:02:26.970> for

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
filter out like this if we have look for

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.000 
filter out like this if we have look for
eight<00:02:27.240> hundred<00:02:27.360> coins<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.960> usually<00:02:28.380> are<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.560> few

eight hundred coins I usually are a few
at<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.250> end<00:02:29.520> 750<00:02:30.060> s<00:02:30.120> ago<00:02:30.270> instant<00:02:30.720> they

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
at the end 750 s ago instant they

at the end 750 s ago instant they
actually<00:02:31.380> do<00:02:31.500> go<00:02:31.710> for<00:02:31.920> around<00:02:32.010> about<00:02:32.130> 850

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
actually do go for around about 850

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.790 
actually do go for around about 850
coins<00:02:33.330> which<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.750> good<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.260> when<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.470> comes<00:02:34.650> to

probably get outbid on maybe three or
four<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.540> them<00:02:45.690> but<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:46.230> method<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.709> easily

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
four of them but this method is easily

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.520 
four of them but this method is easily
capable<00:02:47.730> making<00:02:48.240> 50<00:02:48.630> plus<00:02:48.810> k<00:02:49.020> now<00:02:49.200> at<00:02:49.380> this

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
capable making 50 plus k now at this

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.040 
capable making 50 plus k now at this
time<00:02:49.590> look<00:02:50.520> how<00:02:50.880> many<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.240> cars<00:02:51.480> are<00:02:51.690> there<00:02:51.900> is

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
time look how many the cars are there is

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.949 
time look how many the cars are there is
so<00:02:52.470> many<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.400> these<00:02:53.520> cars<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.940> bid<00:02:54.090> on<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.480> that

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
so many of these cars to bid on it that

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.150 
so many of these cars to bid on it that
is<00:02:55.080> obviously<00:02:55.320> very<00:02:55.380> very<00:02:55.800> good<00:02:55.920> for<00:02:56.100> us

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
is obviously very very good for us

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.370 
is obviously very very good for us
because<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.640> many<00:02:56.790> people<00:02:57.420> either<00:02:57.870> look<00:02:58.230> at

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
because not many people either look at

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.810 
because not many people either look at
them<00:02:58.500> because<00:02:58.650> there's<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:59.010> many<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.340> them<00:02:59.459> or

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
them because there's so many of them or

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.790 
them because there's so many of them or
just<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.750> fact<00:03:00.990> that<00:03:01.110> there's<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:01.470> many<00:03:01.530> up

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
just the fact that there's so many up

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.680 
just the fact that there's so many up
that<00:03:02.100> people<00:03:02.459> could<00:03:02.940> don't<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.300> time<00:03:03.510> to

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
that people could don't have time to

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.360 
that people could don't have time to
scroll<00:03:03.959> through<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.470> ones<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.800> got<00:03:04.950> bids<00:03:05.160> on

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
scroll through the ones that got bids on

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.800 
scroll through the ones that got bids on
therefore<00:03:05.910> there<00:03:06.060> are<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.150> lot<00:03:06.300> of<00:03:06.330> good<00:03:06.600> deals

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
therefore there are a lot of good deals

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.570 
therefore there are a lot of good deals
