00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
big its edges are smaller so it's like

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.570 
big its edges are smaller so it's like
if<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.530> pick<00:01:22.680> good<00:01:22.830> Shub<00:01:23.070> spots<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.520> can

if you can pick good Shub spots you can

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.120 
if you can pick good Shub spots you can
be<00:01:23.759> plus<00:01:24.000> EV<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.479> sitting<00:01:24.810> go<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.140> think<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
be plus EV to one sitting go I think a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.800 
be plus EV to one sitting go I think a
lot<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.460> amateurs<00:01:28.250> don't<00:01:29.250> adjust<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
lot of amateurs don't adjust as the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.830 
lot of amateurs don't adjust as the
numbers<00:01:31.140> decrease<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.770> table<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
numbers decrease of the table so you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.810 
numbers decrease of the table so you
know<00:01:34.590> whether<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.009> nine<00:01:35.220> handed<00:01:35.490> or<00:01:35.610> four

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
know whether it be nine handed or four

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.100 
know whether it be nine handed or four
hands<00:01:36.030> gonna<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> significant<00:01:36.780> difference

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
hands gonna be a significant difference

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.230 
hands gonna be a significant difference
and<00:01:37.290> they're<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.430> used<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.759> four<00:01:38.909> handed

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and they're not used to four handed

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.399 
and they're not used to four handed
they're<00:01:39.360> not<00:01:39.450> used<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> shorter<00:01:40.079> handed

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
they're not used to the shorter handed

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.020 
they're not used to the shorter handed
so<00:01:40.710> they'll<00:01:41.369> make<00:01:41.520> quite<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.759> few<00:01:41.880> mistakes

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
so they'll make quite a few mistakes

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.240 
so they'll make quite a few mistakes
there<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:43.380> more<00:01:43.560> shorthand<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.130> are

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
there the more shorthand you are

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.289 
there the more shorthand you are
obviously<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.670> more<00:01:44.790> aggressive<00:01:44.970> got<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
obviously the more aggressive got to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.730 
obviously the more aggressive got to
play<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.659> get<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> pots<00:01:46.140> plus<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> blinds

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
play to get in the pots plus the blinds

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.460 
play to get in the pots plus the blinds
are<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.100> higher<00:01:47.220> too<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.470> generally

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
are going to be higher too and generally

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.319 
are going to be higher too and generally
speaking<00:01:49.799> they're<00:01:49.979> not<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.490> strong<00:01:50.970> between

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
speaking they're not that strong between

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.319 
speaking they're not that strong between
the<00:01:51.570> 10<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.380> 30<00:01:52.590> blind<00:01:52.890> big<00:01:53.220> blind<00:01:53.250> range<00:01:53.700> which

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the 10 to 30 blind big blind range which

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.850 
the 10 to 30 blind big blind range which
is<00:01:54.360> where<00:01:54.780> you'll<00:01:54.930> find<00:01:54.990> yourself<00:01:55.380> usually

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
is where you'll find yourself usually

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.039 
is where you'll find yourself usually
when<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> short<00:01:56.250> hand<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.549> well<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.030> what<00:01:57.899> if<00:01:57.930> i

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
when a short hand as well so what if i

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.149 
when a short hand as well so what if i
don't<00:01:58.290> answer<00:01:58.380> any<00:01:58.979> questions<00:01:59.369> next
