00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello youtube friends below 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.870
 I will teach you a little game with cards 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.019
 what we need for this game is a 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.599
 deck of cards can be any deck 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.299
 a piece of paper or a napkin and a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.250
 marker to start our trick of 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.150
 magic the first thing we need to do 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.060
 is to hold our deck and extend it 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.040
 this way 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.280
 telling the viewer that it is a mallet 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.620
 common and current this will serve us 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.870
 us to see what letters are 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.370
 found in the thirteenth position 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:42.710
 we can do it mentally counting 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:45.230
 3 6 9 12 and we see that 13 is 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.910
 find the 4 of hearts 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.199
 we will continue to pass so that the 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.199
 viewer do not suspect anything 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.560
 finally bolt e we will do our utmost 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.970
 we will tell the viewer that we have 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.540
 had a prediction and we scored on 4 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.540
 hearts 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.660
 we all talk 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.050
 and we ask the viewer to keep it 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.230
 just a moment 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:17.040
 then we will ask the 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.140
 viewer that from the deck take the amount 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.570
 of letters that represent the month that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.640
 I was born 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.700
 in this case for example if he was born in 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.500
 June will take six letters we will 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.830
 we will turn to not see how many 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.930
 letters takes the viewer and we're going to 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.729
 suppose that the viewer was born in May 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.729
 and will draw five cards 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.190
 4 and 5 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.960
 and will keep them in your pocket so that 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.080
 we can not see how many letters 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.930
 later removed we will take 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.720
 the mallet and we will tell the viewer that 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.010
 we will pass a letter representing each 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.830
 month starting from January to December and he 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:11.040
 will only observe the letter that 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:14.910
 corresponds to your month and we spent 1 2 3 4 5 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.910
 he is interested 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:23.950
 1 of diamonds and we will continue 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:27.670
 going on 7 8 9 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.050
 11 and 12 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.770
 we will grab the 12 cards 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.500
 we will place them again on top of the mallet 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.510
 what we have done we have invested the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.310
 sense of the letters well to 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.440
 Then we will ask the viewer 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.870
 to place your letters that you have taken 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.690
 previously we flip we have 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.810
 not to see and we will hold the mallet 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.250
 we will put it on the table and we will ask 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.290
 make a cut in half 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.569
 approximately 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:04.120
 the spectator will cut 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:08.940
 and we will take the bottom 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.830
 and flipping it in this way well 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.510
 we will ask you to take our 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.670
 prediction and tell us what letter in 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.330
 our prediction and it will open the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.790
 prediction and you will see that it is 4 of hearts 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.750
 he will tell us that it is not his letter we will ask 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.010
 moment we are going to do something and 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:33.280
 we will start to take out 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.280
 the letters from both sides in this way 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.990
 A) Yes 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.680
 until arriving 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:45.520
 to the letter that we have seen in 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.520
 our prediction 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.240
 and we have found our letter the 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:56.370
 we will put here and what we will do is 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.920
 flip the viewer's letter 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.200
