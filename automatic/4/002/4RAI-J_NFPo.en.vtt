00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
it's going to pop off in any way so once

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.590 
it's going to pop off in any way so once
you<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.580> case<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:12.030> you'll<00:01:12.299> notice<00:01:12.570> that

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
you get the case on you'll notice that

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.179 
you get the case on you'll notice that
you<00:01:12.780> don't<00:01:13.049> get<00:01:13.229> much<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> way<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.799> lay<00:01:14.070> on

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
you don't get much in the way of lay on

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.980 
you don't get much in the way of lay on
the<00:01:14.310> table<00:01:14.340> protection<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.360> again<00:01:15.869> that's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the table protection and again that's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.539 
the table protection and again that's
true<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.409> most<00:01:16.439> snap<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> back<00:01:17.340> style

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
true with most snap on the back style

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.490 
true with most snap on the back style
cases<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.210> you'll<00:01:18.689> probably<00:01:18.900> want<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> use<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
cases so you'll probably want to use the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.960 
cases so you'll probably want to use the
screen<00:01:19.740> protector<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.250> comes<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.800 
case as far as all the ports and
controls<00:01:23.340> go<00:01:23.759> they're<00:01:24.030> all<00:01:24.210> open<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
controls go they're all open and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.899 
controls go they're all open and
accessible<00:01:25.140> because<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.159> case<00:01:26.310> has<00:01:26.369> full
