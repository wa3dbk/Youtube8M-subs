first<00:00:34.109> thing<00:00:34.260> I'm<00:00:34.350> gonna<00:00:34.469> note<00:00:34.769> on<00:00:34.949> this<00:00:35.129> thing

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:35.339 
first thing I'm gonna note on this thing

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:37.340 
first thing I'm gonna note on this thing
it<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.489> its<00:00:35.879> construction<00:00:36.359> material<00:00:36.960> there's

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
it is its construction material there's

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.169 
it is its construction material there's
a<00:00:37.440> lot<00:00:37.679> out<00:00:37.829> there<00:00:37.859> that<00:00:38.039> use<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> composite<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:39.179 
a lot out there that use a composite and

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:40.489 
a lot out there that use a composite and
it's<00:00:39.359> considered<00:00:39.749> a<00:00:39.839> g10<00:00:40.230> which<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:40.499 
it's considered a g10 which is a

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:41.959 
it's considered a g10 which is a
fiberglass<00:00:40.890> material<00:00:41.429> it's<00:00:41.550> light<00:00:41.730> it's

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
fiberglass material it's light it's

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.700 
fiberglass material it's light it's
strong<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.449> great<00:00:42.659> but<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.350> no<00:00:43.499> comparison

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
strong it's great but it's no comparison

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.799 
strong it's great but it's no comparison
to<00:00:44.190> real<00:00:44.399> carbon-fiber<00:00:44.999> now<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.659> one

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
to real carbon-fiber now this one

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.869 
to real carbon-fiber now this one
actually<00:00:46.079> uses<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.440> multi-layer<00:00:47.129> carbon<00:00:47.609> fiber

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
actually uses a multi-layer carbon fiber

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.509 
actually uses a multi-layer carbon fiber
layup<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> CNC<00:00:49.800> router<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.159> out<00:00:50.309> there

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
layup and then a CNC router it out there

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.029 
layup and then a CNC router it out there
it's<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:50.969> strong<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.659> you<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:52.039> aviation-grade

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it's as strong as you get aviation-grade

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.520 
it's as strong as you get aviation-grade
you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.149> take<00:00:54.449> these<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.809> try<00:00:54.929> and<00:00:55.079> flex<00:00:55.319> them

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
you can take these and try and flex them

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.860 
you can take these and try and flex them
as<00:00:55.649> absolutely<00:00:56.429> max<00:00:56.999> that<00:00:57.179> you<00:00:57.269> can<00:00:57.479> and<00:00:57.719> they

as absolutely max that you can and they

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.110 
as absolutely max that you can and they
will<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.289> budge<00:00:58.589> these<00:00:59.460> these<00:00:59.909> particular

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
will not budge these these particular

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.239 
will not budge these these particular
arms<00:01:00.569> are<00:01:00.659> right<00:01:00.780> at<00:01:00.899> 5<00:01:01.050> millimeters<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.800> if

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.249 
arms are right at 5 millimeters and if

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:03.799 
arms are right at 5 millimeters and if
you<00:01:02.399> count<00:01:02.639> up<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.909> laminations<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.659> looks

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
you count up the laminations it looks

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.870 
you count up the laminations it looks
like<00:01:03.929> it's<00:01:04.110> 1112<00:01:04.739> laminations<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.700> those

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
like it's 1112 laminations in those

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.270 
like it's 1112 laminations in those
particular<00:01:06.090> arms<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:07.350> course<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> motor

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
particular arms of course the motor

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.249 
particular arms of course the motor
mounting<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.850> pretty<00:01:09.299> much<00:01:09.420> universal<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.110> any

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
mounting is pretty much universal so any

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.350 
mounting is pretty much universal so any
of<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:10.500> 16<00:01:10.920> by<00:01:11.219> 19<00:01:11.549> mounting<00:01:11.880> will<00:01:12.000> both<00:01:12.149> on

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
of your 16 by 19 mounting will both on

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.600 
of your 16 by 19 mounting will both on
there<00:01:12.509> now<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.140> optimized<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.799> our<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.009> 22

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
there now it is optimized for our a 22

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.910 
there now it is optimized for our a 22
series<00:01:14.969> style<00:01:15.240> motor<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.659> either<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.899> 22<00:01:16.079> 12<00:01:16.619> or

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
series style motor so either a 22 12 or

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.029 
series style motor so either a 22 12 or
a<00:01:16.979> 22<00:01:17.549> 16<00:01:17.969> I<00:01:18.149> can<00:01:18.719> take<00:01:18.899> up<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.170> about<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.380> 10<00:01:19.890> inch

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
a 22 16 I can take up to about a 10 inch

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.889 
a 22 16 I can take up to about a 10 inch
prop<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:20.820> geared<00:01:21.030> more<00:01:21.479> towards

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
prop but it's really geared more towards

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.840 
prop but it's really geared more towards
sport<00:01:22.289> flying<00:01:22.530> fpv<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.640> you're<00:01:23.759> probably

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
sport flying fpv so you're probably

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.580 
sport flying fpv so you're probably
gonna<00:01:24.119> want<00:01:24.329> some<00:01:24.479> 8-inch<00:01:24.840> props<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
gonna want some 8-inch props on that

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.770 
gonna want some 8-inch props on that
alright<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.399> let's<00:01:27.180> talk<00:01:27.299> about<00:01:27.420> some<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.719> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
alright so let's talk about some of the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.969 
alright so let's talk about some of the
cool<00:01:27.930> features<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.380> course<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.740> got<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
cool features of course it's got the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.289 
cool features of course it's got the
front<00:01:29.189> platform<00:01:29.460> that's<00:01:29.850> kind<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> geared

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
front platform that's kind of geared

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.539 
front platform that's kind of geared
towards<00:01:30.359> a<00:01:30.750> gopro<00:01:31.170> style<00:01:31.469> action<00:01:31.770> camera<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
towards a gopro style action camera it

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.499 
towards a gopro style action camera it
goes<00:01:32.700> right<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:32.969> the<00:01:33.030> front<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.420> got

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
goes right on the front it's got

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.300 
goes right on the front it's got
provisions<00:01:34.020> there<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.159> course

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
provisions there for that and of course

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.830

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.709 
you can put some pads or jello down
there<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.740> stop<00:01:38.000> vibrations<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.390> really

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
there to stop vibrations but it really

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.959 
there to stop vibrations but it really
doesn't<00:01:40.020> need<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.289> right<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.399> back<00:01:41.549> we've

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
doesn't need it right on the back we've

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.550 
doesn't need it right on the back we've
got<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.240> battery<00:01:42.539> and<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> nice<00:01:42.869> slot<00:01:43.200> towards

fpv gear or the battery itself and use

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.529 
fpv gear or the battery itself and use
that<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.310> slide<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.729> forward<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.179> back<00:01:48.299> for

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
that to slide it forward and back for

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.899 
that to slide it forward and back for
center<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.929> gravity<00:01:49.289> now<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> cool<00:01:50.250> thing<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.670> is

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
center of gravity now a cool thing is is

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.330 
center of gravity now a cool thing is is
a<00:01:51.270> lot<00:01:51.630> these<00:01:52.350> frames<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.009> clean<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
a lot these frames I have the clean and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.590 
a lot these frames I have the clean and
dirty<00:01:53.460> plates<00:01:53.820> because<00:01:54.149> they're<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:54.390> using

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
dirty plates because they're not using

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.899 
dirty plates because they're not using
real<00:01:54.929> carbon<00:01:55.350> fiber<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.039> frames<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.759> get

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
real carbon fiber on the frames you get

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.340 
real carbon fiber on the frames you get
some<00:01:57.090> flex<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.780> middle<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.140> that's<00:01:58.259> why

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
some flex in the middle and that's why

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.859 
some flex in the middle and that's why
they<00:01:58.469> put<00:01:58.679> multiple<00:01:59.329> vibration<00:02:00.329> isolation

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
they put multiple vibration isolation

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.690 
they put multiple vibration isolation
all<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> way<00:02:01.350> down<00:02:01.499> the<00:02:01.619> frame<00:02:01.799> since<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.520> is

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
extremely rigid and there's no flex so

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.940 
extremely rigid and there's no flex so
we've<00:02:09.509> actually<00:02:09.690> got<00:02:09.929> bolt<00:02:10.319> through<00:02:10.649> instead

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
we've actually got bolt through instead

what's really nice is in a crash or an

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.289 
what's really nice is in a crash or an
accident<00:02:23.159> that's<00:02:23.400> not<00:02:23.579> gonna<00:02:23.700> come<00:02:23.939> ripping

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
accident that's not gonna come ripping

got these thumb screws and you can go
ahead<00:02:35.129> and<00:02:35.250> uh<00:02:35.400> throw<00:02:35.700> them<00:02:35.849> these<00:02:36.090> pull<00:02:36.540> them

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
ahead and uh throw them these pull them

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.990 
ahead and uh throw them these pull them
forward<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.079> rotate<00:02:37.620> them<00:02:37.709> in<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.069> it's<00:02:38.819> an

included<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.269> kit<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.629> does<00:03:03.810> come<00:03:04.470> with

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
included in this kit it does come with

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.929 
included in this kit it does come with
the<00:03:04.680> power<00:03:04.859> distribution<00:03:05.099> board<00:03:05.700> it's<00:03:05.819> not

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
the power distribution board it's not

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.640 
the power distribution board it's not
integrated<00:03:06.510> into<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.169> board<00:03:07.379> on<00:03:07.530> this

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
integrated into the the board on this

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.800 
integrated into the the board on this
one<00:03:07.859> because<00:03:08.280> since<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.879> is<00:03:09.090> carbon<00:03:09.359> carbon

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
one because since this is carbon carbon

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.360 
one because since this is carbon carbon
is<00:03:09.959> conductive<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.709> so<00:03:10.859> obviously<00:03:11.250> they

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
is conductive and so obviously they

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.190 
is conductive and so obviously they
couldn't<00:03:11.549> have<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.209> PCB<00:03:12.629> traces<00:03:12.900> in

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
couldn't have the the PCB traces in

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.129 
couldn't have the the PCB traces in
there<00:03:13.579> so<00:03:14.579> it<00:03:15.090> does<00:03:15.239> come<00:03:15.419> with<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.659> the

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
there so it does come with the the

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.379 
there so it does come with the the
actual<00:03:16.470> power<00:03:16.650> distribution<00:03:17.220> board<00:03:17.430> has<00:03:18.030> 12

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
actual power distribution board has 12

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.789 
actual power distribution board has 12
points<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:18.720> contact<00:03:19.109> on<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:19.409> and<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.650> cool

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
points of contact on this and the cool

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.979 
points of contact on this and the cool
thing<00:03:20.010> about<00:03:20.069> it<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.430> has<00:03:20.729> a<00:03:20.760> 5<00:03:21.449> volt<00:03:21.629> on<00:03:21.720> 12

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
thing about it is has a 5 volt on 12

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.930 
thing about it is has a 5 volt on 12
volt<00:03:22.139> regulator<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.069> you<00:03:23.159> can<00:03:23.280> run<00:03:23.400> your<00:03:23.489> fpv

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
volt regulator so you can run your fpv

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.839 
volt regulator so you can run your fpv

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
gear other LED lights on there your FFC

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.520 
gear other LED lights on there your FFC
if<00:03:27.060> you're<00:03:27.180> not<00:03:27.329> running<00:03:27.840> into<00:03:27.959> beaks<00:03:28.199> off<00:03:28.409> of

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
if you're not running into beaks off of

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.770 
if you're not running into beaks off of
those<00:03:28.680> off<00:03:28.949> your<00:03:29.159> esc<00:03:29.549> s<00:03:29.609> and<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.299> also<00:03:30.449> has<00:03:30.750> a

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
those off your esc s and it also has a

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.170 
those off your esc s and it also has a
ring<00:03:31.319> around<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.799> outside<00:03:32.159> of<00:03:32.190> blue<00:03:32.489> LEDs<00:03:32.940> so

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
ring around the outside of blue LEDs so

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.390 
ring around the outside of blue LEDs so
when<00:03:33.359> it<00:03:33.479> is<00:03:33.599> lit<00:03:33.840> up<00:03:33.870> gives<00:03:34.829> this<00:03:34.979> really<00:03:35.280> nice

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
when it is lit up gives this really nice

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.509 
when it is lit up gives this really nice
blue<00:03:35.729> alien<00:03:36.239> type<00:03:36.479> of<00:03:36.659> effect<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.139> LEDs<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:38.280> it

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
blue alien type of effect of LEDs so it

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:39.979 
blue alien type of effect of LEDs so it
comes<00:03:38.699> with<00:03:38.879> a<00:03:38.940> power<00:03:39.150> distribution<00:03:39.479> board

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
full carbon fiber layup and it's

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.420 
full carbon fiber layup and it's
extremely<00:03:43.349> light<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.799> mean<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.159> thing<00:03:44.400> is

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
extremely light I mean this thing is

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.640 
extremely light I mean this thing is
just<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:45.209> crazy<00:03:45.659> light<00:03:45.959> for<00:03:46.199> the<00:03:46.319> strength

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
just a crazy light for the strength

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.619 
just a crazy light for the strength
absolutely<00:03:47.639> probably<00:03:47.970> cannot<00:03:48.239> break<00:03:48.449> this
