00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
panel is pretty neat how it works out as

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.499 
panel is pretty neat how it works out as
far<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.540> print<00:01:18.840> quality<00:01:19.259> goes<00:01:19.470> you've<00:01:19.950> got<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
far as print quality goes you've got a

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
far as print quality goes you've got a
individual<00:01:21.509> ink<00:01:21.689> tank<00:01:21.930> system<00:01:22.409> inside<00:01:22.740> here

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
individual ink tank system inside here

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.490 
individual ink tank system inside here
so<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:23.549> open<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.150> printer<00:01:24.600> you've<00:01:25.290> got

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
so if we open up the printer you've got

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.310 
so if we open up the printer you've got
a<00:01:25.530> panel<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.970> pops<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.750> inside<00:01:28.080> here

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
a panel just pops up and inside here

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.530 
a panel just pops up and inside here
you've<00:01:28.439> got<00:01:28.590> individual<00:01:29.100> ink<00:01:29.340> tanks<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.270> if

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
you've got individual ink tanks so if

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.810 
you've got individual ink tanks so if
you<00:01:30.810> run<00:01:30.930> out<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.110> cyan<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> cyan

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
you run out of cyan you just get a cyan

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.910 
you run out of cyan you just get a cyan
cartridge<00:01:33.299> computer<00:01:34.079> printers<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.619> an
