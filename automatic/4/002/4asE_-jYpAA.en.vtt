he's going to get me safely across the
oceans<00:00:28.340> pretty<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.580> boat<00:00:29.820> here's<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.840> pretty

oceans pretty we boat here's a pretty
low<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> how<00:00:33.210> many<00:00:33.270> hours<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.750> gone<00:00:33.870> into<00:00:34.170> the

about two hundred and twenty five weeks
exclude<00:00:39.809> certain<00:00:40.170> tears<00:00:40.590> yeah<00:00:41.120> they're<00:00:42.120> all

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
exclude certain tears yeah they're all

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
built one off over frames rather than

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
built one off over frames rather than
out<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> mold<00:00:45.080> having<00:00:46.080> built<00:00:46.440> traditional

out the mold having built traditional

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.540 
out the mold having built traditional
boats<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.430> kind<00:00:47.790> of<00:00:47.900> fuse<00:00:48.900> modern<00:00:49.550> materials

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
boats I kind of fuse modern materials

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
boats I kind of fuse modern materials
with<00:00:50.730> traditional<00:00:51.300> no<00:00:51.449> power<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:51.960> instance

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
with traditional no power for instance

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.350 
with traditional no power for instance
using<00:00:52.620> kill<00:00:52.860> sins<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.430> then<00:00:53.519> stands<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
using kill sins and then stands and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.350 
using kill sins and then stands and
aprons<00:00:55.100> that's<00:00:56.100> how<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.369> can<00:00:56.610> form<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.210> much

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
aprons that's how we can form that much

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.130 
aprons that's how we can form that much
finer<00:00:57.690> both<00:00:58.320> hey<00:00:59.809> hopefully<00:01:00.809> make<00:01:01.019> this

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
finer both hey hopefully make this

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.549 
finer both hey hopefully make this
little<00:01:01.379> slit<00:01:01.799> through<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.040> water<00:01:03.559> North

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
little slit through the water North

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.730 
little slit through the water North
Pacific<00:01:04.739> 2012<00:01:05.729> North<00:01:06.030> Atlantic<00:01:06.510> 2013<00:01:07.170> they're

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
Pacific 2012 North Atlantic 2013 they're

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.609 
Pacific 2012 North Atlantic 2013 they're
going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.100> epic<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:09.409> think<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> most

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
going to be epic I think the most

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.780 
going to be epic I think the most
challenging<00:01:10.740> parts<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> whole<00:01:11.549> journey

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
challenging parts the whole journey

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.330 
challenging parts the whole journey
really<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.990> need<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.010> know<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.280> I've

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
really and so I need to know that I've

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.000 
really and so I need to know that I've
got<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.520> best<00:01:14.729> boat<00:01:15.000> possible<00:01:15.869> there<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.740> no

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
got the best boat possible there is no

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.149 
got the best boat possible there is no
better<00:01:17.220> boat<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.850> don't<00:01:18.390> think<00:01:19.159> it's

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
better boat I don't think it's

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.710 
better boat I don't think it's
constructed<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:20.790> really<00:01:21.030> hard<00:01:21.240> foam<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
constructed with really hard foam in the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.120 
constructed with really hard foam in the
middle<00:01:21.950> Kevlar<00:01:23.479> bulletproof<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.720> then<00:01:25.470> two

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
middle Kevlar bulletproof and then two

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.880 
middle Kevlar bulletproof and then two
layers<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.549> glass<00:01:27.080> either<00:01:28.080> side<00:01:28.290> glass<00:01:28.590> fiber

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
layers of glass either side glass fiber

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.400 
layers of glass either side glass fiber
it's<00:01:29.580> only<00:01:29.820> what<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:31.080> thick<00:01:31.640> but<00:01:32.640> bomb-proof

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
it's only what that thick but bomb-proof

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.380 
it's only what that thick but bomb-proof
absolutely<00:01:34.410> bomb-proof<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.940> idea<00:01:36.000> being

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
absolutely bomb-proof so the idea being

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.060 
absolutely bomb-proof so the idea being
even<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.780> crash<00:01:37.020> into<00:01:37.350> something<00:01:37.380> then

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
even if I crash into something then

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.300 
even if I crash into something then
hopefully<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:39.060> been<00:01:39.240> no<00:01:39.330> problems<00:01:40.310> you're

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
hopefully have been no problems you're

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.399 
hopefully have been no problems you're
invisible<00:01:41.670> at<00:01:42.000> sea<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.690> you're<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.110> tiny

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
invisible at sea really you're so tiny

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.420 
invisible at sea really you're so tiny
so<00:01:44.120> vulnerable<00:01:45.120> in<00:01:45.240> many<00:01:45.390> ways<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.650> think

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
so vulnerable in many ways but I think

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.100 
so vulnerable in many ways but I think
being<00:01:47.580> in<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.760> boat<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.270> makes<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> feel

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
being in a boat like this makes you feel

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.560 
being in a boat like this makes you feel
that<00:01:49.290> you're<00:01:49.550> you're<00:01:50.550> in<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.760> safe<00:01:51.330> little

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
