process and given that we only had two
weeks<00:00:35.600> we<00:00:35.809> wanted<00:00:36.079> to<00:00:36.110> do<00:00:36.290> something<00:00:36.650> that

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
weeks we wanted to do something that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.990 
weeks we wanted to do something that
took<00:00:36.860> advantage<00:00:37.129> of<00:00:37.309> a<00:00:37.400> lot<00:00:37.579> of<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.730> different

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
took advantage of a lot of the different

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.760 
took advantage of a lot of the different
features<00:00:38.180> of<00:00:38.540> the<00:00:38.629> device<00:00:38.930> I'm<00:00:39.440> everything

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
features of the device I'm everything

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
features of the device I'm everything
from<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.010> touch<00:00:40.220> screen<00:00:40.400> to<00:00:40.760> the

from the touch screen to the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.240 
from the touch screen to the
accelerometer<00:00:41.540> we<00:00:42.110> wanted<00:00:42.320> to<00:00:42.350> have<00:00:42.559> video

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
accelerometer we wanted to have video

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.130 
accelerometer we wanted to have video
and<00:00:43.489> audio<00:00:43.610> you<00:00:44.570> want<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.750> have<00:00:44.839> a<00:00:44.870> game<00:00:45.050> that

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
and audio you want to have a game that

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.960 
and audio you want to have a game that
described<00:00:45.530> all<00:00:45.739> of<00:00:45.769> them<00:00:46.040> so<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.730> game<00:00:46.850> that

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
described all of them so the game that

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.009 
described all of them so the game that
we<00:00:47.030> chose<00:00:47.210> was<00:00:47.269> a<00:00:47.480> game<00:00:47.629> that<00:00:47.660> we<00:00:47.809> have<00:00:47.930> in

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
we chose was a game that we have in

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.049 
we chose was a game that we have in
production<00:00:48.350> called<00:00:48.530> spore<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.790> idea<00:00:49.970> of

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
production called spore and the idea of

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.250 
production called spore and the idea of
spore<00:00:50.390> is<00:00:50.510> it's<00:00:50.660> about<00:00:50.809> taking<00:00:51.019> a

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
spore is it's about taking a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.410 
spore is it's about taking a
microorganism<00:00:51.800> from<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.519> primordial<00:00:52.909> soup

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
microorganism from the primordial soup

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.180 
microorganism from the primordial soup
at<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:53.629> bottom<00:00:53.900> of<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.079> ocean<00:00:54.409> and<00:00:54.589> helping

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
at the bottom of the ocean and helping

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.860 
at the bottom of the ocean and helping
it<00:00:55.280> evolve<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:55.760> grow<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.150> survive<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.750> in

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
it evolve and grow and survive and in

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.469 
it evolve and grow and survive and in
this<00:00:57.110> this<00:00:57.440> interesting<00:00:57.769> world<00:00:57.949> you<00:00:58.100> have<00:00:58.479> you

this this interesting world you have you
can<00:00:59.600> see<00:00:59.720> the<00:00:59.809> sport<00:01:00.110> here<00:01:00.229> in<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.379> center<00:01:00.589> of

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:00.619 
can see the sport here in the center of

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:02.500 
can see the sport here in the center of
the<00:01:00.739> screen<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.729> way<00:01:01.820> that<00:01:02.000> we<00:01:02.239> chose

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
the screen and and the way that we chose

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.180 
the screen and and the way that we chose
to<00:01:02.540> control<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.350> spore<00:01:03.589> was<00:01:03.619> to<00:01:03.890> use<00:01:04.040> the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
to control the spore was to use the

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.370 
to control the spore was to use the
iphones<00:01:04.580> I'm<00:01:05.089> accelerometer<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:05.930> can<00:01:06.020> t<00:01:06.140> John

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
iphones I'm accelerometer you can t John

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.320 
iphones I'm accelerometer you can t John
using<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.040> accelerometer<00:01:07.250> tilted<00:01:07.970> right<00:01:08.180> and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
using the accelerometer tilted right and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.580 
using the accelerometer tilted right and
last<00:01:08.510> we<00:01:08.659> could<00:01:08.780> get<00:01:08.869> some<00:01:09.080> of<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.200> motion

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
last we could get some of that motion

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.630 
last we could get some of that motion
that<00:01:09.680> you<00:01:09.740> saw<00:01:09.950> earlier<00:01:09.979> in<00:01:10.340> that<00:01:10.369> previous

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
that you saw earlier in that previous

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.020 
that you saw earlier in that previous
demo<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:12.530> basic<00:01:13.040> goal<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.549> the<00:01:13.610> game<00:01:13.640> is<00:01:13.820> to

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
demo the basic goal of the game is to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.090 
demo the basic goal of the game is to
take<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:14.840> spore<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:15.290> eat<00:01:15.439> anything<00:01:15.680> smaller

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
take the spore and eat anything smaller

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.560 
take the spore and eat anything smaller
than<00:01:16.189> you<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:16.610> avoid<00:01:16.790> anything<00:01:17.030> larger<00:01:17.540> than

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
than you and avoid anything larger than

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.850 
than you and avoid anything larger than
you<00:01:19.900> if<00:01:20.900> you<00:01:20.990> do<00:01:21.080> a<00:01:21.110> good<00:01:21.200> job<00:01:21.259> of<00:01:21.439> that<00:01:21.590> you're

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
you if you do a good job of that you're

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.440 
you if you do a good job of that you're
rewarded<00:01:22.280> by<00:01:22.430> what<00:01:22.640> we<00:01:22.729> call<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:23.000> evolution

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
rewarded by what we call the evolution

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.789 
rewarded by what we call the evolution
editor<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:23.930> evolution<00:01:24.110> editor<00:01:24.650> is<00:01:24.770> a

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
editor and the evolution editor is a

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.469 
editor and the evolution editor is a
great<00:01:25.070> place<00:01:25.310> for<00:01:25.520> us<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.790> take<00:01:26.000> advantage<00:01:26.450> of

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
great place for us to take advantage of

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.880 
great place for us to take advantage of
a<00:01:26.570> lot<00:01:26.689> of<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.840> touchscreen<00:01:27.290> capabilities<00:01:27.439> of

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
a lot of the touchscreen capabilities of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.649 
a lot of the touchscreen capabilities of
this<00:01:28.100> device<00:01:28.460> we've<00:01:29.060> gone<00:01:29.180> from<00:01:29.299> sort<00:01:29.509> of<00:01:29.570> the

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
this device we've gone from sort of the

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:30.969 
this device we've gone from sort of the
accelerometer<00:01:30.200> now<00:01:30.380> we're<00:01:30.530> playing<00:01:30.710> with<00:01:30.890> the

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
accelerometer now we're playing with the

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.669 
accelerometer now we're playing with the
touch<00:01:31.630> what's<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:32.719> great<00:01:32.869> about<00:01:32.929> this<00:01:33.380> is<00:01:33.439> it

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
touch what's so great about this is it

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.169 
touch what's so great about this is it
allows<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.039> to<00:01:34.130> customize<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.789> game<00:01:34.909> in<00:01:35.030> two

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
allows you to customize the game in two

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:36.580 
allows you to customize the game in two
different<00:01:35.329> ways<00:01:35.570> first<00:01:36.020> we're<00:01:36.439> going<00:01:36.530> to

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
different ways first we're going to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.080 
different ways first we're going to
customize<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.159> gameplay<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.549> little<00:01:37.820> bit<00:01:37.939> so

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
customize the gameplay a little bit so

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.340 
customize the gameplay a little bit so
John's<00:01:38.390> going<00:01:38.539> to<00:01:38.630> go<00:01:38.689> in<00:01:38.780> here<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:38.990> using<00:01:39.289> his

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
John's going to go in here and using his

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.270 
John's going to go in here and using his
finger<00:01:39.560> he's<00:01:39.679> just<00:01:39.799> going<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:39.979> go<00:01:40.070> ahead<00:01:40.130> and

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
finger he's just going to go ahead and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.399 
finger he's just going to go ahead and
touch<00:01:40.429> the<00:01:40.880> offensive<00:01:41.240> tract<00:01:41.689> and<00:01:41.869> he's<00:01:42.289> going

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409

touch the offensive tract and he's going
to<00:01:42.469> add<00:01:42.619> in<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:42.829> pair<00:01:43.069> of<00:01:43.189> formidable-looking

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
to add in a pair of formidable-looking

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.510 
to add in a pair of formidable-looking
mandibles<00:01:44.509> here<00:01:44.659> on<00:01:44.749> the<00:01:44.810> front<00:01:44.990> of<00:01:45.049> our<00:01:45.140> sport

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
mandibles here on the front of our sport

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.950 
mandibles here on the front of our sport
so<00:01:46.520> you<00:01:46.609> see<00:01:46.729> those<00:01:46.880> appear<00:01:47.119> on<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.270> front<00:01:47.539> the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
so you see those appear on the front the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.760 
so you see those appear on the front the
next<00:01:48.140> thing<00:01:48.200> we're<00:01:48.350> going<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.499> do<00:01:48.590> is<00:01:48.679> we're

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
next thing we're going to do is we're

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.719 
next thing we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:48.859> to<00:01:48.920> play<00:01:49.069> with<00:01:49.189> a<00:01:49.249> little<00:01:49.399> bit<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.579> a

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
going to play with a little bit of a

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.130 
going to play with a little bit of a
creative<00:01:50.149> personalization<00:01:50.840> here<00:01:50.960> now<00:01:51.020> this

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
creative personalization here now this

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.899 
creative personalization here now this
part<00:01:51.380> is<00:01:51.530> more<00:01:51.890> about<00:01:52.009> making<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.369> sport<00:01:52.729> look

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
part is more about making the sport look

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.160 
part is more about making the sport look
cool<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:53.210> interesting<00:01:53.359> and<00:01:53.689> it's<00:01:53.869> less<00:01:53.990> to<00:01:54.079> do

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
cool and interesting and it's less to do

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.569 
cool and interesting and it's less to do
with<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.350> gameplay<00:01:54.740> but<00:01:55.189> he's<00:01:55.340> going<00:01:55.429> to<00:01:55.520> go

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
with the gameplay but he's going to go

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:56.649 
with the gameplay but he's going to go
ahead<00:01:55.639> and<00:01:55.789> use<00:01:55.909> his<00:01:56.030> finger<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:56.389> just<00:01:56.450> start

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
ahead and use his finger and just start

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.819 
ahead and use his finger and just start
moving<00:01:56.960> stuff<00:01:57.079> around<00:01:57.289> so<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.619> think<00:01:57.679> he's

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
moving stuff around so I think he's

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.139 
moving stuff around so I think he's
going<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:57.979> move<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.249> eyes<00:01:58.369> forward<00:01:58.789> here<00:01:59.030> and

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
going to move the eyes forward here and

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.580 
going to move the eyes forward here and
he's<00:01:59.539> just<00:01:59.749> touching<00:02:00.109> and<00:02:00.229> moving<00:02:00.259> these

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
he's just touching and moving these

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.260 
he's just touching and moving these
forward<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.100> imagine<00:02:01.460> this<00:02:01.639> is<00:02:02.030> all<00:02:02.119> we've

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
forward so imagine this is all we've

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.609 
forward so imagine this is all we've
done<00:02:02.299> in<00:02:02.479> about<00:02:02.569> two<00:02:02.929> weeks<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:03.380> if<00:02:03.439> we<00:02:03.499> had<00:02:03.590> a

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
done in about two weeks but if we had a

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:04.840 
done in about two weeks but if we had a
lot<00:02:03.799> of<00:02:03.829> time<00:02:04.069> you<00:02:04.280> could<00:02:04.399> imagine<00:02:04.579> us

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
lot of time you could imagine us

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.190 
lot of time you could imagine us
stretching<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.359> spore<00:02:05.630> out<00:02:05.749> and<00:02:05.929> adding

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
stretching the spore out and adding

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.779 
stretching the spore out and adding
collars<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.859> really<00:02:07.310> making<00:02:07.490> this<00:02:07.579> like

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
collars and really making this like

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.669 
collars and really making this like
almost<00:02:08.210> like<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.390> play<00:02:08.660> area<00:02:08.840> two<00:02:09.200> people<00:02:09.440> to

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
almost like a play area two people to

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.500 
almost like a play area two people to
personalize<00:02:10.160> their<00:02:10.369> spores<00:02:10.700> let's<00:02:11.330> go<00:02:11.390> ahead

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
personalize their spores let's go ahead

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.100 
personalize their spores let's go ahead
bring<00:02:11.630> that<00:02:11.750> support<00:02:12.020> back<00:02:12.140> into<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.410> game

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
bring that support back into the game

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.580 
bring that support back into the game
now<00:02:15.110> let's<00:02:15.230> talk<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:15.350> little<00:02:15.410> about

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
now let's talk a little about

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.720 
now let's talk a little about
development<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:16.160> notice<00:02:16.340> we're<00:02:16.430> moving<00:02:16.640> from

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
development you notice we're moving from

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.900 
development you notice we're moving from
level<00:02:17.090> 15<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.870> level<00:02:18.110> 16<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:19.400> when<00:02:19.610> we<00:02:19.700> first

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
level 15 to level 16 and when we first

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.130 
level 15 to level 16 and when we first
came<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.180> we<00:02:20.240> sat<00:02:20.480> down<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.780> started<00:02:21.050> working

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
came and we sat down and started working

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.449 
came and we sat down and started working
with<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.500> framework<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.010> took<00:02:22.130> us<00:02:22.220> about<00:02:22.400> two

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
with the framework it took us about two

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.309 
with the framework it took us about two
days<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:23.060> get<00:02:23.180> cocoa<00:02:23.510> touch<00:02:23.690> up<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.080> running

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
days to get cocoa touch up and running

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.050 
days to get cocoa touch up and running
once<00:02:24.800> we<00:02:24.950> had<00:02:25.069> that<00:02:25.100> up<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.430> running<00:02:25.700> we<00:02:25.970> were

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
once we had that up and running we were

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.730 
once we had that up and running we were
then<00:02:26.150> able<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.420> bring<00:02:26.569> in<00:02:26.600> our<00:02:26.750> entire<00:02:27.080> game

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
then able to bring in our entire game

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.980 
then able to bring in our entire game
development<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:28.510> got<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.630> whole<00:02:29.780> game<00:02:29.959> up

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
development and got the whole game up

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.880 
development and got the whole game up
and<00:02:30.200> running<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:30.500> we're<00:02:30.620> only<00:02:30.740> really

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
and running so we're only really

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.500 
and running so we're only really
demonstrating<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.580> couple<00:02:31.910> levels<00:02:32.090> here<00:02:32.390> in

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
demonstrating a couple levels here in

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.120 
demonstrating a couple levels here in
the<00:02:32.600> editor<00:02:32.900> but<00:02:33.230> we<00:02:33.319> have<00:02:33.410> actually<00:02:33.740> all<00:02:33.920> 80

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
the editor but we have actually all 80

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.589 
the editor but we have actually all 80
net<00:02:34.430> levels<00:02:34.760> up<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:35.030> running<00:02:35.299> we<00:02:35.420> have<00:02:35.510> the

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
net levels up and running we have the

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.630 
net levels up and running we have the
full<00:02:35.810> editor<00:02:36.200> John<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.099> I<00:02:37.129> were<00:02:37.159> sitting<00:02:37.400> here

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
full editor John and I were sitting here

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.020 
full editor John and I were sitting here
playing<00:02:37.879> and<00:02:38.090> creating<00:02:38.330> all<00:02:38.420> these<00:02:38.510> different

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
playing and creating all these different

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.400 
playing and creating all these different
for<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.450> experimenting<00:02:40.110> with<00:02:40.140> what<00:02:40.319> we

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
for is experimenting with what we

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.240 
for is experimenting with what we
thought<00:02:40.560> what<00:02:40.770> we<00:02:40.800> thought<00:02:40.860> might<00:02:41.130> be

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
thought what we thought might be

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.240 
thought what we thought might be
interesting<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.880> show<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.090> all<00:02:42.360> today<00:02:43.250> really
