00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:15.440
 good morning of today I have the great pleasure 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:19.099
 to present the new salewa collection 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.070
 mountain i ring for samb at 2014 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:25.550
 what is the concept of this trolleybus 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.800
 line here we combine things 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.859
 contrary we say lightness 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.660
 along with the strength and I brought you 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.790
 an example 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.180
 this water bottle that weighs less 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.670
 of a half kilo thing in common with i 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.149
 our heads of safety and mountain well 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.899
 we say a lot because taking ours 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.719
 new jacket three layers gore tex model 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.480
 chakra weighs less than this bottle 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.840
 of water here and everything you need 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:01.670
 the head as protection in the mountains 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.640
 itself shows complete with brand new ones 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.030
 steve lee and no top stage technologies 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.070
 with the goretex fabric and the concept yes 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.840
 expresses in the technical 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.720
 every product of ours has a position 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.090
 where it can be packaged and surrendered 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.090
 final of this use and this case 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.860
 other examples always to show the 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.660
 maximum lightness and what is possible 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:34.780
 do is our driving jacket 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.720
 he learned to tex 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.290
 that in a compact way and is presented so 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.690
 the jacket in full shows up in 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.890
 this way here is unique of this 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.130
 product here 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.259
 first we combine in the moment e 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.300
 in the right place the right fabric 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.390
 therefore maximum lightness with a fabric 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.060
 two and a half states where it serves instead 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.009
 in the protection in the air of the shoulders 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.950
 and the hands you use to many below 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.020
 so we combine the advantages 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.140
 of a fabric is in advantage of the high 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.810
 extra fabric 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.480
 we ask so much in an active system of 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.959
 ventilation here you see loosened of 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.350
 all the pockets that can be opened, of course 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:24.870
 outside there is a twenty that opens a canal 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.750
 instead there are air under the sleeve 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.640
 of active ventilation system 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.280
 which are covered by lamellas therefore 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.920
 an athlete a person who stands still 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.209
 remain closed the moment one does 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.920
 moves this system opens and together with 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.680
 this could face that has a 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.040
 channel that gives a great effect of 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.040
 ventilation
