hi<00:00:00.870> everyone<00:00:01.469> creationists<00:00:02.250> have<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.700> crazy

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hi everyone creationists have this crazy

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.280 
hi everyone creationists have this crazy
idea<00:00:04.790> okay<00:00:05.790> one<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.359> crazy<00:00:06.629> ideas<00:00:07.080> they

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
idea okay one of the crazy ideas they

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.280 
idea okay one of the crazy ideas they
have<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.740> that<00:00:08.090> all<00:00:09.090> they<00:00:09.540> have<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.840> do<00:00:10.019> to

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
have is that all they have to do to

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.440 
have is that all they have to do to
prove<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:11.040> they're<00:00:11.280> demonstrably<00:00:12.000> false

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
prove that they're demonstrably false

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.299 
prove that they're demonstrably false
fairytales<00:00:13.440> are<00:00:13.620> true

fairytales are true

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.210 
fairytales are true
is<00:00:14.370> show<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.690> earth<00:00:16.109> isn't<00:00:16.590> four<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
is show that the earth isn't four and a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.570 
is show that the earth isn't four and a
half<00:00:17.250> billion<00:00:17.670> years<00:00:18.060> old<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:19.369> of<00:00:20.369> course

half billion years old and of course

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.599 
half billion years old and of course
they<00:00:20.730> fail<00:00:21.000> miserably<00:00:22.160> here's<00:00:23.160> an<00:00:23.310> example

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
they fail miserably here's an example

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.720 
they fail miserably here's an example

side facing toward it this causes the
oceans<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.030> form<00:00:33.239> bulges<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:33.899> rotate<00:00:34.680> along

oceans to form bulges that rotate along
with<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> moon<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.329> causes<00:00:36.540> tides

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
with the moon this is what causes tides

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.619 
with the moon this is what causes tides
as<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:38.129> Earth<00:00:38.219> spins<00:00:38.250> around<00:00:38.850> its<00:00:39.030> own<00:00:39.180> axis

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
them to end up ahead of the moon but it

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.470 
them to end up ahead of the moon but it
also<00:00:46.800> slows<00:00:47.219> down<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.670> Earth's<00:00:47.850> rotation

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
also slows down the Earth's rotation

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.930 
also slows down the Earth's rotation
this<00:00:49.020> drains<00:00:49.440> angular<00:00:49.890> momentum<00:00:50.460> from<00:00:50.760> the

this drains angular momentum from the

this drains angular momentum from the
