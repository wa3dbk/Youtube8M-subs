upgrade video of this land party PC here
because<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.060> got<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.210> Core<00:00:06.450> 2<00:00:06.480> Duo<00:00:06.629> in<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:06.990> mail

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
because I got a Core 2 Duo in the mail

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.390 
because I got a Core 2 Duo in the mail
well<00:00:07.440> turns<00:00:08.280> out<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.490> Core<00:00:08.820> 2<00:00:09.030> Duo<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.570> dead

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
well turns out that Core 2 Duo is dead

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.650 
well turns out that Core 2 Duo is dead
it's<00:00:11.400> bad<00:00:11.670> it's<00:00:12.240> shorted<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.410> some<00:00:14.040> capacity

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
it's bad it's shorted in some capacity

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.180 
it's bad it's shorted in some capacity
or<00:00:15.660> another<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.500> I'm<00:00:16.619> going<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.770> show<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.010> how

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
or another and I'm going to show you how

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.300 
or another and I'm going to show you how
it<00:00:17.369> behaves<00:00:18.150> when<00:00:18.770> you<00:00:19.770> turn<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> machine<00:00:20.279> on

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
it behaves when you turn the machine on

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.279 
it behaves when you turn the machine on
let<00:00:20.520> me<00:00:20.609> turn<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> light<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.029> now<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.260> a

67 50 and 2.6 this cake hurts 4 Meg's of
cash<00:00:29.699> 1333<00:00:30.599> frontside<00:00:31.019> bus<00:00:31.260> which<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.769> nice

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
cash 1333 frontside bus which is a nice

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.860 
cash 1333 frontside bus which is a nice
chip<00:00:32.309> would<00:00:33.120> really<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.510> well<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.780> this

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
chip would really do well in this

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.979 
chip would really do well in this
machine<00:00:34.100> unfortunately<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:36.450> guy<00:00:36.630> who<00:00:36.690> sold

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
machine unfortunately the guy who sold

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.990 
machine unfortunately the guy who sold
it<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.079> me<00:00:37.290> didn't<00:00:37.530> do<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
it to me didn't do this but the the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.660 
it to me didn't do this but the the
previous<00:00:39.210> owner<00:00:39.570> than<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.070> put<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.340> socket

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
previous owner than that put the socket

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.040 
previous owner than that put the socket
775<00:00:42.180> chip<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:44.219> socket<00:00:44.760> 1155<00:00:45.390> motherboard

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
775 chip in a socket 1155 motherboard

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.560 
775 chip in a socket 1155 motherboard
and<00:00:46.289> somehow<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.920> worked<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.789> actually<00:00:48.300> worked

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
and somehow it worked it actually worked

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.819 
and somehow it worked it actually worked
on<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> board<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.170> don't<00:00:49.200> know<00:00:49.410> how<00:00:49.590> that's

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
on the board I don't know how that's

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.619 
on the board I don't know how that's
possible<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.579> did<00:00:52.910> but<00:00:53.910> obviously<00:00:54.480> it's

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
possible but it did but obviously it's

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.340 
possible but it did but obviously it's
not<00:00:54.750> designed<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.149> yeah<00:00:57.170> this<00:00:58.170> is

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
not designed for that and yeah this is

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.549 
not designed for that and yeah this is
probably<00:00:58.770> why<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.160> shorted<00:00:59.670> because<00:01:00.559> just

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
probably why it's shorted because just

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.399 
probably why it's shorted because just
idiot<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> century<00:01:02.850> put<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> wrong<00:01:03.660> CPU

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
idiot of the century put the wrong CPU

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.870 
idiot of the century put the wrong CPU
in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.100> wrong<00:01:05.280> socket<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:07.790> people<00:01:08.790> if

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
in the wrong socket just people if

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.219 
in the wrong socket just people if
you're<00:01:08.970> gonna<00:01:09.090> work<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.450> computers<00:01:09.900> know<00:01:10.110> what

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you're gonna work on computers know what

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.149 
you're gonna work on computers know what
you're<00:01:10.380> doing<00:01:10.710> first

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you're doing first

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.440 
you're doing first
honestly<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.570> take<00:01:13.200> an<00:01:13.380> A+<00:01:13.799> course<00:01:14.450> or

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
honestly just take an A+ course or

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.340 
honestly just take an A+ course or
something<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.070> because<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.490> just

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
something like that because that is just

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.090 
something like that because that is just
big-time<00:01:19.350> fail<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:20.400> any<00:01:20.729> computer<00:01:21.799> this<00:01:22.799> right

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
big-time fail of any computer this right

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.480 
big-time fail of any computer this right
here<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.580> exactly<00:01:23.850> why<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.659> A+<00:01:25.140> certification

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
here is exactly why the A+ certification

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.460 
here is exactly why the A+ certification
exists<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.750> stuff<00:01:28.049> doesn't<00:01:28.080> happen

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
exists so that this stuff doesn't happen

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.859 
exists so that this stuff doesn't happen
on<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> professional<00:01:29.100> level<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:35.540> let's<00:01:36.540> turn<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
on a professional level so let's turn it

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.910 
on a professional level so let's turn it
on<00:01:36.930> I'll<00:01:37.170> show<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.350> what<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.560> does<00:01:39.920> shuts

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
on I'll show you what it does shuts

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.359 
on I'll show you what it does shuts
right<00:01:41.189> off<00:01:42.619> after<00:01:43.619> powers<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.280> it

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
right off after powers up and it

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.740 
right off after powers up and it
continues<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.880> boot

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
continues to boot

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.450 
continues to boot
yeah<00:01:47.750> just<00:01:48.080> shuts<00:01:48.320> right<00:01:48.710> off<00:01:52.030> so<00:01:53.799> at<00:01:54.799> CPU<00:01:55.250> is

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
yeah just shuts right off so at CPU is

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.420 
yeah just shuts right off so at CPU is
bad<00:01:55.850> it's<00:01:56.390> as<00:01:56.509> bad<00:01:56.720> as<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:56.930> gets<00:01:57.340> when<00:01:58.340> the

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
bad it's as bad as it gets when the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.080 
bad it's as bad as it gets when the
system<00:01:58.759> just<00:01:58.939> won't<00:01:59.090> even<00:01:59.299> boot<00:01:59.450> with<00:01:59.600> it<00:01:59.720> so

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
system just won't even boot with it so

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.620 
system just won't even boot with it so
that's<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.210> shame<00:02:02.450> just<00:02:04.360> figured<00:02:05.360> I'd<00:02:05.450> show<00:02:05.600> you

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
that's a shame just figured I'd show you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.570 
that's a shame just figured I'd show you
guys<00:02:05.720> what<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.140> full-blown<00:02:06.710> CPU<00:02:07.159> failure<00:02:07.490> it

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
guys what a full-blown CPU failure it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.660 
guys what a full-blown CPU failure it
looks<00:02:07.729> like<00:02:08.709> it<00:02:09.709> looks<00:02:09.920> an<00:02:10.100> awful<00:02:10.190> lot<00:02:10.399> like<00:02:10.520> a

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
looks like it looks an awful lot like a

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.460 
looks like it looks an awful lot like a
power<00:02:10.910> supply<00:02:11.150> failure<00:02:11.540> in<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.170> fact<00:02:12.380> that

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
power supply failure in the fact that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.979 
power supply failure in the fact that
the<00:02:12.590> computer<00:02:13.040> shuts<00:02:13.310> off<00:02:13.489> so<00:02:13.910> sometimes<00:02:14.810> it's

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
the computer shuts off so sometimes it's

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.059 
the computer shuts off so sometimes it's
actually<00:02:15.080> hard<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.410> tell<00:02:15.620> whether<00:02:15.800> it's<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
actually hard to tell whether it's the

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.589 
actually hard to tell whether it's the
power<00:02:16.280> supply<00:02:16.610> or<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.819> seat<00:02:17.060> or<00:02:17.420> the

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
power supply or the seat or the

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.559 
power supply or the seat or the
motherboard<00:02:17.989> or<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.170> CPU<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:20.239> this<00:02:20.330> case

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
motherboard or the CPU and in this case

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.509 
motherboard or the CPU and in this case
it's<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.959> CPU<00:02:21.410> because<00:02:22.040> that's<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.430> only

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
it's the CPU because that's the only

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.759 
it's the CPU because that's the only
thing<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.880> changed<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:24.640> there<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.730> have<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.769> I

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
thing I changed so there you have it I

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.259 
thing I changed so there you have it I
just<00:02:28.100> thought<00:02:28.340> I'd<00:02:28.489> show<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.640> guys<00:02:28.880> what<00:02:29.090> that

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
just thought I'd show you guys what that

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.240 
just thought I'd show you guys what that
looks<00:02:29.480> like<00:02:29.569> just<00:02:30.440> in<00:02:30.560> case<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:30.890> ever<00:02:31.010> see

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
looks like just in case you ever see

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.100 
looks like just in case you ever see
that<00:02:31.280> in<00:02:31.549> a<00:02:31.610> computer<00:02:31.910> assume<00:02:32.480> it's<00:02:32.690> probably

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
that in a computer assume it's probably

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.780 
that in a computer assume it's probably
the<00:02:33.230> board<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.680> CPU<00:02:34.069> or<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.220> power<00:02:34.430> supply

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
the board the CPU or the power supply

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.920 
the board the CPU or the power supply
when<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.030> happens<00:02:35.360> but<00:02:35.480> in<00:02:35.630> this<00:02:35.720> particular

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
when that happens but in this particular

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.020 
when that happens but in this particular
case<00:02:36.410> that's<00:02:37.130> what<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.400> looks<00:02:37.580> like<00:02:37.730> when<00:02:37.940> it

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
case that's what it looks like when it

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.459 
case that's what it looks like when it
happens<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.510> CPU<00:02:39.019> a<00:02:39.260> shorted<00:02:40.040> CPU
