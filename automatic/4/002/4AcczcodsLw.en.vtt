00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.059
 in the party of the group he faced 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.549
 to the athletic of madrid to málaga club of 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.339
 football at the end signed the tables the 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.230
 two Spanish teams the old one of 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.789
 madrid who had already played a match 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.279
 I had done it by winning the real club 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.010
 Sporting Espanyol for 3 to 1 this served 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.080
 al málaga to debut in the competition 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.119
 an encounter in which the best started the 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.009
 Andalusian set that had several 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.710
 chances of danger we are seeing 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.890
 this shot by fabio mendes 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.799
 with two very powerful bands the whole 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.229
 malacitano that embarrassed a 

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:42.879
 Atlético de Madrid who trusted him almost 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:47.049
 all he could do his No. 10 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.930
 such an omen that evidently does not have 

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:51.970
 nothing to do with the family theme 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.400
 sergio el kun omen but that for 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.710
 quality we could see reflected is the 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.350
 dorsal number 10 of the athletic one of madrid 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.449
 there we see the whole of Madrid and see 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.400
 to good pulling that looks like a ball that 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.780
 was going to get to the front so that the 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.000
 own omen to shoot yourself with the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.909
 left over the goal 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 defended by the Lithuanian ernests 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.030
 services 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.500
 it was one of the few approaches 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.480
 until the moment of the Madrid set 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.460
 already in the final stretch of the first period 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.120
 again tried fortune from outside the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.400
 area in the left-handed playmaker in this case 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.130
 the ball went away somewhat deviated from 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.320
 left of the goal as even 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.540
 was somewhat out of place in the goalkeeper 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.880
 Malaga and in the second period another 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.510
 once trying fortune from outside the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.680
 area was his third shot the footballer 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.900
 of the atletico de madrid who was 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.300
 agglutinating all the offensive danger of 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:49.340
 his team that already in the final section 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.810
 the party was to be the Malaga which 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.660
 I was going to be more whole and the one that was going to 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.970
 have more dangerous approaches is 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.280
 playing the signature rubén sanchidrián and 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.660
 he does not get to head off maybe with 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.880
 a tad scary 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.820
 flavio méndez the one who did it in 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.759
 this corner kick was the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.810
 midfielder Juan Jose Carmona 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.510
 taking advantage of that 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.690
 span in the first suit had just 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.599
 nodding over the goal and 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.310
 we see a brave departure from the goalkeeper 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.160
 brazilian athletic madrid- 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.620
 alexandre of two saints and in the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.030
 assistance by lucas the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.420
 Malaga player have number 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.209
 10 that came out in the second half that of 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.040
 a true quality choice in 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.450
 this opportunity for the whole 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.700
 rojiblanco 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.000
 on the back number seven oscar clemente 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.459
 that played the first part the position of 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.180
 Dexterous interior but with the substitution 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.160
 de giovani from 9 went to occupy the point 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.019
 of the attack at the end of the game tie to 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.230
 0 between atlético de madrid and málaga club 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.230
