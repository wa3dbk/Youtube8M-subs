restaurants I've seen where it's pretty

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.200 
restaurants I've seen where it's pretty
separated<00:01:09.010> and<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.400> you'll<00:01:09.850> see<00:01:10.000> in<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.119> minute

separated and and you'll see in a minute

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.060 
separated and and you'll see in a minute
what<00:01:10.420> I'm<00:01:10.510> talking<00:01:10.869> about<00:01:10.930> but<00:01:11.650> there's<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:11.920> lot

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
what I'm talking about but there's a lot

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.429 
what I'm talking about but there's a lot
of<00:01:12.100> different<00:01:12.360> setups<00:01:13.360> where<00:01:13.659> different

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
of different setups where different

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.100 
of different setups where different
people<00:01:14.470> can<00:01:15.220> I<00:01:15.369> guess<00:01:15.580> eat<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:16.300> I<00:01:16.810> don't<00:01:17.050> know

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
people can I guess eat and I don't know

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.480 
people can I guess eat and I don't know
if<00:01:17.170> that's<00:01:17.290> a<00:01:17.350> good<00:01:17.380> thing<00:01:17.530> or<00:01:17.680> a<00:01:17.770> bad<00:01:17.800> thing<00:01:17.980> I

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
if that's a good thing or a bad thing I

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.280 
if that's a good thing or a bad thing I
think<00:01:19.000> there's<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.210> reason<00:01:19.480> why<00:01:19.600> people<00:01:19.930> sort

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
think there's a reason why people sort

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.620 
think there's a reason why people sort
of<00:01:20.350> clumped<00:01:20.770> their<00:01:20.890> tables<00:01:21.310> together<00:01:21.520> but<00:01:22.300> I'd

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
of clumped their tables together but I'd

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.240 
of clumped their tables together but I'd
be<00:01:22.810> very<00:01:22.990> curious<00:01:23.110> you<00:01:23.860> know<00:01:23.890> as<00:01:24.100> I<00:01:24.220> was

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
watching you know the customers eat and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.930

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
just sort of see how that works but

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.730 
just sort of see how that works but
we'll<00:01:28.570> get<00:01:28.660> to<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:28.840> as<00:01:29.110> we<00:01:29.200> sort<00:01:29.380> of<00:01:29.440> moved

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
have to admit that I finally kind of

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.590 
have to admit that I finally kind of
said<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.280> angelic<00:01:42.610> holder<00:01:42.909> is<00:01:43.090> sort<00:01:43.540> of

hidden back here I kind of wish it was
not<00:01:46.150> hidden<00:01:46.510> because<00:01:46.750> that's<00:01:47.200> one<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.500> the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.280 
like the juxtaposition of uh you know
the<00:01:59.890> plants<00:02:00.610> with<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.330> man-made<00:02:01.810> stuff<00:02:02.140> I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
the plants with the man-made stuff I

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.890 
the plants with the man-made stuff I
think<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.770> handled<00:02:03.340> right<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.820> think<00:02:04.810> that

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
think that handled right I think that

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.020 
think that handled right I think that
looks<00:02:05.050> great<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:05.740> any<00:02:05.979> restaurant<00:02:06.550> and<00:02:06.909> makes

looks great in any restaurant and makes

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.339 
looks great in any restaurant and makes
it<00:02:07.150> definitely<00:02:07.510> classy<00:02:07.810> because<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.200> don't

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
it definitely classy because you don't

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.229 
it definitely classy because you don't
want<00:02:08.379> something<00:02:08.619> too<00:02:08.890> mechanical<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.759> at<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
want something too mechanical and at the

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.360 
want something too mechanical and at the
same<00:02:10.269> time<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.720> don't<00:02:10.810> want<00:02:10.929> something<00:02:11.560> total

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.000 
right now on the other hand is not like
that<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.450> know<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:20.410> can<00:02:20.440> check<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.800> out<00:02:20.920> if

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
that so you know you can check it out if

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.680 
that so you know you can check it out if
you<00:02:21.130> want<00:02:21.160> but<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:22.060> not<00:02:22.150> like<00:02:22.300> that<00:02:22.360> because

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
you want but it's not like that because

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.630 
you want but it's not like that because

seeing<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.550> with<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.910> one<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.180> don't<00:02:46.420> know<00:02:46.510> if

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
seeing it with this one I don't know if

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.110 
seeing it with this one I don't know if
part<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.710> has<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:47.980> be<00:02:48.100> shaved<00:02:48.340> off<00:02:48.610> or

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
part of it has to be shaved off or

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.820 
part of it has to be shaved off or
something<00:02:49.510> like<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:49.630> but<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.960> looks<00:02:50.650> a

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
something like that but it looks a

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.760 
something like that but it looks a
little<00:02:51.570> maybe<00:02:52.570> it's<00:02:52.810> my<00:02:52.930> vision<00:02:53.470> right<00:02:53.620> now<00:02:53.740> I

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
little maybe it's my vision right now I

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.560 
little maybe it's my vision right now I
don't<00:02:54.100> know<00:02:54.280> but<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.790> seems<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.120> little<00:02:55.150> off<00:02:55.510> in

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
don't know but it seems a little off in

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.900 
don't know but it seems a little off in
some<00:02:56.350> capacity<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:57.250> i<00:02:57.460> would<00:02:57.880> definitely

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
some capacity so i would definitely

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.790 
some capacity so i would definitely
double<00:02:58.570> check<00:02:58.900> with<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.200> but<00:02:59.350> i<00:02:59.380> do<00:02:59.470> like<00:02:59.650> the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
double check with that but i do like the

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.430 
double check with that but i do like the
fact<00:02:59.830> that<00:03:00.040> it's<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.280> wrap<00:03:00.490> around<00:03:00.820> water<00:03:01.440> like

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
fact that it's a wrap around water like

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.230 
fact that it's a wrap around water like
a<00:03:02.470> like<00:03:02.800> a<00:03:02.830> lazy<00:03:03.070> river<00:03:03.310> around<00:03:03.700> here<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.180> of

like the fact that she incorporates this

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.860 
like the fact that she incorporates this

sort of down tile here with a little
Street<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.260> think<00:03:29.530> that's<00:03:29.650> from<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.920> Paris

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
Street I think that's from the Paris

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.730 
Street I think that's from the Paris
week<00:03:30.610> but<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.540> do<00:03:31.720> like<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:31.990> I<00:03:32.230> think<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.560> works

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
week but I do like that I think it works

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.190 
week but I do like that I think it works
well<00:03:33.070> as<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.600> floor<00:03:34.870> for<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.170> eating<00:03:35.470> area

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
well as the floor for the eating area

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.780 
well as the floor for the eating area

an<00:05:15.460> 86<00:05:16.360> only<00:05:17.170> because<00:05:17.320> I<00:05:17.500> i<00:05:17.620> do<00:05:18.160> question<00:05:19.020> the

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
an 86 only because I i do question the

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.500 
an 86 only because I i do question the
the<00:05:20.350> stairs<00:05:20.590> illusion<00:05:21.040> as<00:05:21.460> well<00:05:21.700> as<00:05:21.820> just<00:05:22.000> set

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
the stairs illusion as well as just set

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.750 
the stairs illusion as well as just set
up<00:05:22.630> with<00:05:22.840> breaking<00:05:23.200> it<00:05:23.290> up<00:05:23.410> now<00:05:23.620> that<00:05:24.430> range

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
up with breaking it up now that range

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.000 
up with breaking it up now that range
would<00:05:24.940> probably<00:05:25.300> change<00:05:25.510> if<00:05:25.870> I<00:05:26.260> stay<00:05:26.770> here

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010
