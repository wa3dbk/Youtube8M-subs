takes to the flame really easily and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.419 
takes to the flame really easily and
even<00:01:36.179> on<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.359> light<00:01:36.950> I'm<00:01:37.950> getting<00:01:38.219> a<00:01:38.250> lot<00:01:38.369> of

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
even on the light I'm getting a lot of

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.459 
even on the light I'm getting a lot of
what<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> picked<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.000> into<00:01:39.270> tin<00:01:41.209> earthiness

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
what I picked up into tin earthiness

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.139 
what I picked up into tin earthiness
like<00:01:43.469> a<00:01:43.500> mesquite<00:01:43.950> type<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.399> barbecued<00:01:44.880> thing

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
like a mesquite type of barbecued thing

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.359 
like a mesquite type of barbecued thing
but<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:45.810> not<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> typical<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.619> salty<00:01:47.130> meat

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
but it's not the typical like salty meat

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.830 
but it's not the typical like salty meat
quality<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.209> get<00:01:48.359> from<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.600> lot<00:01:48.719> of

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
quality that you get from a lot of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.169 
quality that you get from a lot of
English<00:01:49.079> blends<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.250> little<00:01:50.490> closer<00:01:50.729> to

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
English blends it's a little closer to

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.800 
English blends it's a little closer to
like<00:01:52.100> vinegar<00:01:53.100> base<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.700> barbecue

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.120 

it's<00:01:57.810> very<00:01:57.989> spicy<00:01:58.259> especially<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.039> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
it's very spicy especially on the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:11.680 
it's very spicy especially on the
retrouvaille

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.220 

sour<00:02:12.410> tangy<00:02:12.890> creamy<00:02:13.460> a<00:02:14.210> slightly<00:02:14.870> sweet<00:02:15.260> and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
sour tangy creamy a slightly sweet and

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.300 
sour tangy creamy a slightly sweet and
actually<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.320> finish<00:02:18.530> is<00:02:18.620> pretty<00:02:18.800> crisp<00:02:19.100> and

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
actually the finish is pretty crisp and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.610 
actually the finish is pretty crisp and
clean<00:02:19.580> for<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.210> lot<00:02:20.660> of<00:02:20.690> key<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.930> have<00:02:21.110> as<00:02:21.230> well<00:02:21.410> I

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
clean for a lot of key to have as well I

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.380 
clean for a lot of key to have as well I
think<00:02:22.130> there's<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.340> decent<00:02:22.760> amount<00:02:22.820> of<00:02:22.970> Latakia

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
think there's a decent amount of Latakia

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.480 
think there's a decent amount of Latakia
here<00:02:23.660> but<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.290> blend<00:02:24.620> almost<00:02:24.950> behaves<00:02:25.250> like

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
here but the blend almost behaves like

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.510 
here but the blend almost behaves like
there's<00:02:25.850> not<00:02:26.150> it's<00:02:26.390> really<00:02:26.630> well<00:02:26.840> balanced

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
there's not it's really well balanced

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:36.030 
there's not it's really well balanced
really<00:02:28.520> complex<00:02:29.090> for<00:02:29.360> an<00:02:29.450> English<00:02:29.720> -<00:02:29.960> I

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.930 

wouldn't<00:02:37.040> go<00:02:37.130> as<00:02:37.160> far<00:02:37.310> as<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.460> say<00:02:37.640> it's<00:02:37.760> lat

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
wouldn't go as far as to say it's lat

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.310 
wouldn't go as far as to say it's lat
forward<00:02:38.330> but<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.540> Latakia<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:38.960> definitely

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
forward but the Latakia is definitely

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.800 
forward but the Latakia is definitely
felt<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:40.430> smokiness<00:02:40.820> is<00:02:41.090> actually<00:02:41.450> subtle

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
felt the smokiness is actually subtle

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.660 
felt the smokiness is actually subtle
though<00:02:41.990> you're<00:02:42.470> getting<00:02:42.680> more<00:02:42.860> of<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.310> cool

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
though you're getting more of the cool

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.470 
though you're getting more of the cool
burn<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.300> creaminess<00:02:44.690> from<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.170> Latakia

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
burn and creaminess from the Latakia

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.880 
burn and creaminess from the Latakia
again<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.510> think<00:02:47.660> that's<00:02:47.870> partly<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.650> because

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
again I think that's partly just because

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.340 
again I think that's partly just because
it's<00:02:49.040> very<00:02:49.160> well<00:02:49.280> balanced<00:02:49.820> overall<00:02:53.350> there's

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
it's very well balanced overall there's

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.930 
it's very well balanced overall there's
a<00:02:54.410> little<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.830> there's<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.160> bit<00:02:55.310> of<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.460> medicinal

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
a little of there's a bit of a medicinal

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.000 
a little of there's a bit of a medicinal
quality<00:02:56.300> to<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.570> taste<00:02:56.780> as<00:02:56.960> well<00:02:56.990> but<00:02:57.890> it's

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
quality to the taste as well but it's

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.070 
quality to the taste as well but it's
not<00:02:58.160> like<00:02:58.430> iodine<00:02:59.210> that<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.660> would<00:02:59.780> get<00:02:59.900> from

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
not like iodine that you would get from

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.960 
not like iodine that you would get from
like<00:03:00.320> Laphroaig<00:03:00.770> or<00:03:01.070> like<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.430> heavily<00:03:01.790> peated

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
like Laphroaig or like a heavily peated

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.560 
like Laphroaig or like a heavily peated
whisky<00:03:02.920> it's<00:03:03.920> closer<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.520> like<00:03:04.670> camphor<00:03:05.210> and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
whisky it's closer to like camphor and

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.120 
whisky it's closer to like camphor and
really<00:03:06.140> there's<00:03:06.380> some<00:03:06.530> stuff<00:03:06.770> there<00:03:06.890> that's

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
really there's some stuff there that's

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.640 
really there's some stuff there that's
really<00:03:07.340> hard<00:03:07.490> to<00:03:07.580> pick<00:03:07.760> up<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:09.080> keep<00:03:09.470> going

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
really hard to pick up but I keep going

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.520 
really hard to pick up but I keep going
back<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.100> forth<00:03:10.310> between<00:03:11.080> like<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.230> light

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
back and forth between like a light

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.890 
back and forth between like a light
floral<00:03:12.920> or<00:03:13.310> something<00:03:13.850> kind<00:03:14.060> of<00:03:14.180> minty<00:03:14.600> or

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
floral or something kind of minty or

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.400 
floral or something kind of minty or
even<00:03:15.500> like<00:03:16.210> rosemary<00:03:17.210> like<00:03:17.990> if<00:03:18.140> you<00:03:18.230> cook<00:03:18.380> a

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
even like rosemary like if you cook a

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.930 
even like rosemary like if you cook a
roast<00:03:18.650> with<00:03:18.920> rosemary<00:03:19.130> in<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.550> oven<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:19.880> that

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
roast with rosemary in the oven and that

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.270 
roast with rosemary in the oven and that
kind<00:03:20.210> of<00:03:20.270> a<00:03:20.360> thing<00:03:23.740> overall<00:03:24.740> though<00:03:24.980> it's<00:03:25.220> a

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
kind of a thing overall though it's a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.010 
kind of a thing overall though it's a
medium<00:03:25.580> bodied<00:03:25.850> blend<00:03:26.120> that<00:03:26.630> actually<00:03:26.900> has<00:03:26.990> a

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
medium bodied blend that actually has a

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.360 
medium bodied blend that actually has a
surprising<00:03:27.470> amount<00:03:27.560> of<00:03:27.710> strength<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.220> I

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
surprising amount of strength and I

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.440 
surprising amount of strength and I
would<00:03:28.490> give<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.730> strength<00:03:28.940> probably<00:03:29.300> like<00:03:29.420> a

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
would give the strength probably like a

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.270 
would give the strength probably like a
medium<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:29.900> full<00:03:30.110> rating<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:31.070> flavor

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
medium to a full rating and the flavor

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.640 
medium to a full rating and the flavor
is<00:03:31.370> also<00:03:31.730> medium<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.210> full<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.660> still<00:03:33.470> think

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
is also medium to full I still think

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.470 
is also medium to full I still think
that<00:03:33.680> this<00:03:33.830> could<00:03:34.040> be<00:03:34.130> an<00:03:34.250> all-day<00:03:34.430> smoke<00:03:35.030> for

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
that this could be an all-day smoke for

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.440 
that this could be an all-day smoke for
Latakia<00:03:36.440> smokers<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.820> really<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.210> great

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
Latakia smokers and really a great

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.940 
Latakia smokers and really a great
change<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.780> pace<00:03:38.810> for<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.200> Virginia<00:03:39.470> guys<00:03:39.740> out

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
change of pace for the Virginia guys out

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.170 
change of pace for the Virginia guys out
there<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.220> aren't<00:03:40.340> typically<00:03:40.730> too<00:03:40.940> crazy

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
there that aren't typically too crazy

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.690 
there that aren't typically too crazy
about<00:03:41.330> a<00:03:41.480> heavy<00:03:41.750> oriental<00:03:42.290> presence<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:43.459> for

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
about a heavy oriental presence so for

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.010 
about a heavy oriental presence so for
that<00:03:43.760> reason<00:03:43.820> I<00:03:44.240> feel<00:03:44.360> like<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.630> fits<00:03:44.870> in

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
that reason I feel like it fits in

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.380 
that reason I feel like it fits in
really<00:03:45.200> well<00:03:45.440> between<00:03:45.820> early<00:03:46.820> morning<00:03:47.180> pipe

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
really well between early morning pipe

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.310 
really well between early morning pipe
and<00:03:47.720> 965<00:03:48.560> or<00:03:48.770> nightcap<00:03:49.160> if<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:50.240> find<00:03:50.570> Durbar

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
and 965 or nightcap if you find Durbar

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.250 
and 965 or nightcap if you find Durbar
or<00:03:52.090> London<00:03:53.090> mixture<00:03:53.360> to<00:03:53.480> be<00:03:53.600> too<00:03:53.780> oriental

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
or London mixture to be too oriental

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.660 
or London mixture to be too oriental
forward<00:03:54.620> and<00:03:54.800> you<00:03:54.950> really<00:03:55.190> just<00:03:55.340> want<00:03:55.580> the

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
forward and you really just want the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.010 
forward and you really just want the
balance<00:03:56.360> between<00:03:56.740> Latakia<00:03:57.740> and<00:03:57.890> Virginia

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
balance between Latakia and Virginia

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.660 
balance between Latakia and Virginia
overall<00:04:00.020> I'm<00:04:00.230> really<00:04:00.860> quite<00:04:01.130> blown<00:04:01.340> away<00:04:01.520> with

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
overall I'm really quite blown away with

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.130 
overall I'm really quite blown away with
this<00:04:01.820> of<00:04:01.940> course<00:04:02.000> it's<00:04:02.300> smooth<00:04:02.570> like<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:03.020> was

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
this of course it's smooth like it was

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.860 
this of course it's smooth like it was
meant<00:04:03.950> to<00:04:04.010> be<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:04.400> like<00:04:04.520> it<00:04:04.640> was<00:04:04.790> talked<00:04:05.660> about

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
meant to be and like it was talked about

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.320 
meant to be and like it was talked about
in<00:04:05.990> the<00:04:06.050> past<00:04:06.200> but<00:04:07.010> overall<00:04:07.340> I<00:04:07.490> just<00:04:07.730> think<00:04:08.120> I

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
in the past but overall I just think I

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.990 
in the past but overall I just think I
think<00:04:08.840> this<00:04:08.930> is<00:04:09.080> a<00:04:09.110> unique<00:04:09.670> tobacco<00:04:10.670> in<00:04:10.880> the

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
think this is a unique tobacco in the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.030 
think this is a unique tobacco in the
dunghill<00:04:11.180> lineup<00:04:11.720> but<00:04:12.290> it's<00:04:12.440> still<00:04:12.590> very<00:04:12.650> much

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
dunghill lineup but it's still very much

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.180 
dunghill lineup but it's still very much
feels<00:04:13.520> and<00:04:13.850> acts<00:04:14.240> like<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.630> Dunhill<00:04:15.050> tobacco

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.680 

one<00:04:19.190> thing<00:04:19.370> that<00:04:19.400> I<00:04:19.549> did<00:04:19.729> want<00:04:19.910> to<00:04:19.940> add<00:04:20.120> is<00:04:20.389> that

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
one thing that I did want to add is that

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.520 
one thing that I did want to add is that
as<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.470> ball<00:04:21.650> burns<00:04:21.919> down<00:04:23.229> you're<00:04:24.229> not<00:04:24.350> going

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
as the ball burns down you're not going

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.920 
as the ball burns down you're not going
to<00:04:24.590> get<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.740> lot<00:04:25.010> more<00:04:25.300> flavor<00:04:26.300> wise<00:04:26.570> than<00:04:26.810> what

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
to get a lot more flavor wise than what

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.629 
to get a lot more flavor wise than what
you<00:04:27.080> already<00:04:27.290> had<00:04:27.650> like<00:04:28.100> nothing's<00:04:28.430> going<00:04:28.550> to

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
you already had like nothing's going to

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.879 
you already had like nothing's going to
develop<00:04:29.060> everything<00:04:29.389> just<00:04:29.630> gets<00:04:29.840> bigger<00:04:30.110> like

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
develop everything just gets bigger like
