00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:08.750
 hello youtube friends today I'm going to 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:12.710
 show how to turn on an xbox with a 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.960
 PC power supply first thing 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.880
 we have to know is that the green wire 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.560
 one that is here in the pins I what 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.490
 I have cut 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.380
 you have to take it and splice it with the 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.160
 negative one of the blacks you can 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.759
 do with a click or do what I have 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.230
 made me cut it and put it together and this for 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.110
 what's the use this is so that the source 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.800
 power is turned on without need 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.800
 from a computer 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.520
 it's worth first now what next 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.390
 we have to do is take three cables 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.690
 yellows 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.489
 three black and yellow are the ones who 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.030
 release 12 volt positive current 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.379
 and the black in the mass of the negative 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.170
 then we have to look for the cable 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.530
 purple that are 5 volts but of 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.390
 exit 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.210
 esp 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.200
 and if not we can also use one of 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.930
 The reds can be cut or as 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.120
 you want to do 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.130
 It's worth the next thing we have to do 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.680
 once we have the wires cut 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.680
 and not the back of the console 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.480
 so you do not see that much 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.990
 look good you can not see but I explain it 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:32.560
 the console there is one like 16 tipper to 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:36.640
 see if I can make it look good 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.409
 those down here these here are the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.360
 negative current there will have to go 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.520
 the three black cables 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.430
 up here the other one that has the 3 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.770
 yellow carl and where is that line by 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.729
 on top you have to go purple cable not what 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.729
 I will explain how it is done 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.610
 well now what we will do is place 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.520
 the cables 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.230
 the account that those below are 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.390
 negative 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.940
 this is above are the positives here 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.759
 should go the 3 yellows and here the 3 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.299
 blacks and now 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.239
 here to see if I can focus where is 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:19.670
 that line that is the main connector 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.079
 just up is where you will go 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.180
 just up is where the 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.890
 purple cable with crossed baix because 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.470
 has to do more to both with both 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.980
 connectors 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.740
 OK 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.580
 and we're going to start laying the cables 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.580
 and 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:45.959
 first we place to make it easier 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:48.290
 others to what are the three that are the 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.290
 blacks 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.230
 here I have taken the three blacks 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.370
 and we are going to start putting it if you 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.129
 look for there is another way 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.659
 for example a plug or something 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:09.010
 it would be easier'm not going to do it 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:11.870
 so with the same brightness that you see 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.430
 not that it looks stable 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.430
 and I started with the same and 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.130
 let us begin 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.130
 a good sentence up here 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.870
 and I start 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.870
 externally 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.170
 the blacks go down there 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:40.670
 As you can see, he has already inserted the first cable 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.620
 there would be a thing like that 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.620
 and both sides equal 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.510
 let's put the second 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.050
 I'm going to catch the light 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.210
 and we put it, let's go with the third 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.450
 we put it 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:25.430
 let's put it right that fit ready 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.889
 the three negatives are already set as 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.509
 We can check here 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.189
 they are already making the negative current 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.189
 now let's put the positives 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.820
 first as I this took it from the 4 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.130
 pins that are two calvaries that are more 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.870
 thin are easier to put but I'm going 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.320
 first put this one that is one of the 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:51.420
 hard drives that more complicated 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.420
 because it is thicker and costs work 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.970
 wrong 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.230
 let's enter enter while caesar 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.230
 to the people 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:12.820
 let's enter worth up to 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.529
 we can see has entered here one of the 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.469
 cables 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:19.469
 ok let's go and let's put the last 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.580
 one 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.580
 and I'm going to put the hair right 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:46.060
 students here that you do not see 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.070
 and ready is already what the 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.810
 current of the xbox 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.920
 the purple wire that is the sb 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.650
 we have here the exposed and now I'm going to 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.900
 show how to put the sb ls of the 5 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.630
 volts you see this is a purple wire 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.520
 which has the power supply 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.050
 and this is what we are going to do is 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.050
 put it on top of the pins 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.400
 wrong 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.110
 the one that looks like what you 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:25.140
 they work for 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.140
 this has to go here on top of all 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.480
 to see if I can see it look good 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.070
 you see it the purple one has to go over 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.640
 the tray that 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:53.330
 once we have made the connections 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:56.470
 what we are going to do now is plug 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.470
 the power supply 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.580
 we connect the cable 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:09.009
 and now 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:12.809
 we plug it in 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:12.809
 what everyone's head looked at 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.380
 we plugged it into the current 

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:27.090
 also that this source feed me 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:29.480
 it fails from time to time and I have to 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.480
 second 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.250
 good since we have the connections 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:34.569
 we're going to turn on this team 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.569
 console the problem that it has is that 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:39.550
 has the red light that's why aviation 

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:40.849
 before it worked and they must when andrada 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.099
 win 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:45.580
 functions conditions but we're going to 

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:49.980
 prove the foundation is connected 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:54.630
 when we give him he does not understand the console 

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:57.150
 and with this the video ends like this if 

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.560
 break the whole connection or you do not have the 

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.150
 cable 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.970
 the cable is weird because it could be this 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:06.350
 method for the console to work 

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.350
 good like and subscribe
