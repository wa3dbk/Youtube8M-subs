two and a half year old daughter loves
the<00:00:24.269> stuff<00:00:24.330> beats<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.900> up<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.109> have<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.560> two

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
the stuff beats it up we have one to two

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.679 
the stuff beats it up we have one to two
times<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:26.099> week<00:00:26.210> also<00:00:27.210> come<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> me<00:00:27.570> because

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
times a week also come to me because

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.630 
times a week also come to me because
it's<00:00:27.930> froze<00:00:28.140> its<00:00:28.410> frozen<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.340> comes<00:00:29.519> in

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
it's froze its frozen but it comes in

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.840 
it's froze its frozen but it comes in
pre-portioned<00:00:30.560> amount<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:32.460> two<00:00:32.700> to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
pre-portioned amount so it's two to

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.700 
pre-portioned amount so it's two to
three<00:00:33.120> servings<00:00:33.360> per<00:00:33.690> package<00:00:34.230> there's<00:00:34.440> 12

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
three servings per package there's 12

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.340 
three servings per package there's 12
ounces<00:00:35.070> per<00:00:35.309> package<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.270> usually<00:00:36.960> about<00:00:37.079> four

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
ounces per package so usually about four

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.799 
ounces per package so usually about four
to<00:00:37.530> six<00:00:37.559> ounces<00:00:38.010> per<00:00:38.280> piece<00:00:38.520> makes<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.629> very

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
to six ounces per piece makes it very

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.930 
to six ounces per piece makes it very
easy<00:00:39.989> terms<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.559> portion<00:00:40.920> control<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
easy terms a portion control this is a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.430 
easy terms a portion control this is a
great<00:00:42.180> buttery<00:00:42.480> flavor<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.170> interesting

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
great buttery flavor it's interesting

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.049 
great buttery flavor it's interesting
though<00:00:43.770> because<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:44.370> farmed

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
though because this is actually farmed

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
though because this is actually farmed
so<00:00:45.570> typically<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.079> think<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> farm<00:00:46.530> fish<00:00:46.739> is

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
so typically you think a farm fish is

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.160 
so typically you think a farm fish is
not<00:00:47.160> being<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.579> good<00:00:47.610> hiring<00:00:48.600> contaminates

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
not being as good hiring contaminates

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.959 
not being as good hiring contaminates
not<00:00:49.739> better<00:00:50.010> Monday<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.460> sustainably

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
not better Monday it's sustainably

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.850 
not better Monday it's sustainably
farmed<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.750> actually<00:00:52.110> got<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> best<00:00:52.620> choice

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
farmed and actually got the best choice

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.130 
farmed and actually got the best choice
of<00:00:53.129> recognition<00:00:54.090> from<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.600> Monterey<00:00:55.050> Bay

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
of recognition from the Monterey Bay

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.170 
of recognition from the Monterey Bay
Aquarium<00:00:55.340> which<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> highest<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.059> they

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
Aquarium which is the highest that they

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.630 
Aquarium which is the highest that they
give<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> sustainable<00:00:58.440> farming<00:00:59.039> practices

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
give for a sustainable farming practices

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.250 
give for a sustainable farming practices
so<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.359> free<00:01:00.570> mercury<00:01:01.020> free<00:01:01.199> of

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
so it's free mercury free of

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.900 
so it's free mercury free of
contaminants<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.460> said<00:01:02.640> high<00:01:02.850> in
