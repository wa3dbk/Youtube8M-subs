 Yes, it's a white hair. From this time on, I would like to see the real situation of gta 5 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.430
 Even the picture-towards the devil race of gta 5 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.580
 In particular it will be allowed to live 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:20.010
 a Occasionally interesting bug or 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:25.760
 Well funny with friends 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.760
 We will also be on-line live this time 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.550
 It's a bug , yes 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.790
 I think I have a place under if mon that can be either an on-line 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.760
 Well, I'm offline this time though 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:45.129
 I hope to cut it online someday 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.700
 By the way , you can do this by yourself . 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.050
 This brush mon can be alone 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.440
 It is a place- 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.079
 Lap's 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.199

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.780
 If it is a guy, it is something near the golf course 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.170
 I have no feel something is more of here I'm easy to fly rather than there 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.009
 Because there are no trees or obstacles 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.009
 I think that I want to fly immediately and make you there 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.520
 Then I would like to go ahead 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.050
