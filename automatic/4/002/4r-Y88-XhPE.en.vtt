00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the phone I can't record and set it up

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.020 
the phone I can't record and set it up
at<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.150> same<00:01:33.360> time<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.619> try<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> record

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
at the same time but I can try to record

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.670 
at the same time but I can try to record
my<00:01:36.150> computer<00:01:36.630> screen<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.110> show<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.409> or

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
my computer screen to show you or

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.999 
my computer screen to show you or
something<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.900> then<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.890> can

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
something and then with this you can

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.620 
something and then with this you can
also<00:01:41.159> livestream<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.630> what's

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
also livestream so if you have a what's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.050 
also livestream so if you have a what's
the<00:01:45.750> app<00:01:45.869> called<00:01:47.960> xsplit<00:01:48.960> broadcaster<00:01:49.909> if<00:01:50.909> you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the app called xsplit broadcaster if you

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.480 
the app called xsplit broadcaster if you
use<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.570> live<00:01:51.899> stream<00:01:51.930> your<00:01:52.619> 3ds<00:01:53.070> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
use that you can live stream your 3ds to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.460 
use that you can live stream your 3ds to
twitch<00:01:53.820> without<00:01:54.299> even<00:01:54.689> having<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.110> capture

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
twitch without even having a capture

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.550 
twitch without even having a capture
card<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.009> pretty<00:01:56.969> nice<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.390> mean<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.079> frame

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
card so pretty nice I mean the frame

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.859 
card so pretty nice I mean the frame
rates<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.159> good<00:01:59.340> but<00:01:59.610> my<00:02:00.119> laptop<00:02:00.659> is

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
rates not that good but my laptop is

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.679 
rates not that good but my laptop is
really<00:02:01.200> bad<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.770> that's<00:02:02.610> probably<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.479> reason

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
really bad so that's probably the reason

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.749 
really bad so that's probably the reason
