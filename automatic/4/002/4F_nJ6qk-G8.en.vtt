00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
whirlwind stabilizer system I'll just

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.130 
whirlwind stabilizer system I'll just
show<00:00:58.219> you<00:00:58.280> how<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:58.520> works<00:00:58.820> what<00:00:59.750> we<00:00:59.780> have<00:01:00.020> are

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
show you how that works what we have are

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.840 
show you how that works what we have are
these<00:01:00.230> velcro<00:01:00.680> tabs<00:01:00.920> which<00:01:01.160> are<00:01:01.280> already<00:01:01.460> pre

these velcro tabs which are already pre

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.940 
these velcro tabs which are already pre
attached<00:01:02.180> to<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.690> fly<00:01:02.870> sheet<00:01:03.079> and<00:01:03.290> these<00:01:03.829> are

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
attached to the fly sheet and these are

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.580 
attached to the fly sheet and these are
just<00:01:04.070> wrapped<00:01:04.339> around<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.790> poles<00:01:05.409> with<00:01:06.409> these

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
just wrapped around the poles with these

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.410 
just wrapped around the poles with these
velcro<00:01:06.950> tabs<00:01:07.189> and<00:01:07.459> then<00:01:07.609> held<00:01:07.880> in<00:01:07.999> position

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
velcro tabs and then held in position

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.599 
velcro tabs and then held in position
like<00:01:08.689> so<00:01:08.719> you'll<00:01:09.619> find<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:09.889> we<00:01:10.039> have<00:01:10.189> one<00:01:10.490> at

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:10.609 
like so you'll find that we have one at

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:12.099 
like so you'll find that we have one at
the<00:01:10.700> top<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.090> one<00:01:11.299> at<00:01:11.329> the<00:01:11.450> bottom<00:01:11.659> of<00:01:11.929> every

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
the top and one at the bottom of every

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:14.379 
the top and one at the bottom of every
pole<00:01:12.439> around<00:01:12.679> the<00:01:12.979> tent<00:01:13.219> what<00:01:13.789> that<00:01:13.939> does<00:01:14.149> is

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:14.389 
pole around the tent what that does is

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:16.149 
pole around the tent what that does is
it<00:01:14.509> pulls<00:01:14.689> a<00:01:14.840> whole<00:01:14.990> fly<00:01:15.229> sheet<00:01:15.530> taut<00:01:15.799> against

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
it pulls a whole fly sheet taut against

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.219 
it pulls a whole fly sheet taut against
a<00:01:16.249> frame<00:01:16.459> using<00:01:16.939> these<00:01:17.090> guy<00:01:17.810> lanes<00:01:18.049> that<00:01:18.170> are

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
a frame using these guy lanes that are

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.160 
a frame using these guy lanes that are
attached<00:01:18.590> here<00:01:18.859> once<00:01:19.399> they're<00:01:19.579> pulled<00:01:19.880> out

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
attached here once they're pulled out

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.149 
attached here once they're pulled out
speaking<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.409> guy<00:01:21.560> lanes<00:01:21.799> you'll<00:01:22.009> just

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
speaking of the guy lanes you'll just

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.949 
speaking of the guy lanes you'll just
see<00:01:22.310> as<00:01:22.459> well<00:01:22.639> that<00:01:23.209> we<00:01:23.359> are<00:01:23.479> using<00:01:23.689> our

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:23.959 
see as well that we are using our

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.499 
see as well that we are using our
floating<00:01:24.350> dialing<00:01:24.889> system<00:01:25.249> down<00:01:25.459> the<00:01:26.270> sides

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
floating dialing system down the sides

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.779 
floating dialing system down the sides
of<00:01:26.779> the<00:01:26.990> tent<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:27.439> what<00:01:28.189> that<00:01:28.310> means<00:01:28.520> is<00:01:28.670> we

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
of the tent so what that means is we

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.190 
of the tent so what that means is we
have<00:01:28.819> two<00:01:29.119> different<00:01:29.270> sections<00:01:29.719> to<00:01:29.990> the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
have two different sections to the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.599 
have two different sections to the
Guylaine<00:01:30.499> we<00:01:30.649> have<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:30.920> black<00:01:31.130> guy<00:01:31.369> line

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
Guylaine we have the black guy line

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.370 
Guylaine we have the black guy line
which<00:01:31.939> ties<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.420> with<00:01:32.539> the<00:01:32.689> color<00:01:32.869> of<00:01:32.929> the<00:01:33.049> tent

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
which ties in with the color of the tent

done is tinted these windows and that
serves<00:02:42.920> two<00:02:43.099> key<00:02:43.340> functions<00:02:43.790> one<00:02:44.150> is<00:02:44.360> to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
serves two key functions one is to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.170 
serves two key functions one is to
