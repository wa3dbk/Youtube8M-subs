 and as I always tell you, I have a 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.270
 video showing them four ideas for 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.070
 gifts this Christmas or they can even 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.110
 be things that can put this in your 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.880
 house as decoration and that's four 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.100
 ideas that I will show you as 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.989
 I'm doing and the materials I buy 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.059
 we have the same hands of a store of 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.440
 dollar and I do other things this that 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.090
 I found right here in my house as 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.030
 frasquito if so is it done 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.010
 super little bit and it really stays 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.379
 super nice feel will love 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.300
 that is one thing these ideas are something 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.760
 something nice to give away because I eat like 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.199
 when you give someone I do not know do not know 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.790
 I like that they give me things like 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.769
 what they did I feel like I do not know 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.050
 you think about that person you go to the store 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.730
 you buy things like it's something good 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.290
 nice to me I like it then spend it 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.270
 much month and it feels super nice 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.920
 when you give away you can also buy what 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.840
 that they thought to buy to give and 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.120
 accompany him with something they did 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.350
 yourselves for those people or for 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.360
 that special person that he wants 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.130
 give something like that is that it does not 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.990
 little bit as well as that nervous accelerated 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.940
 because I do not drink coffee regularly 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.520
 drinking coffee then it's like not 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.870
 but I'm very happy to show you 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.880
 this video I really hope that you 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.830
 like are super easy to do 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.900
 true that yes so we're not going to 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.280
 start I hope you like the first 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.020
 What I did was write in a notebook what 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.630
 that I wanted to put in my house and with a 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.760
 permanent marker I started writing it 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.830
 in this case I'm going to give it the rate 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.020
 my husband here is that's why I received 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.670
 these words and that but you guys 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.350
 they can put the name of the person what 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.610
 that you want because you 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.770
 want they can use their imagination 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.720
 get creative and leave your house 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.030
 very nice they can even use colors 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.200
 There are markers of all colors as well 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.530
 that nothing is super easy and after that 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.570
 Mark it several times and that's how I 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.220
 has been put my estrellitas the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.429
 initials of us in the part of 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.429
 down the date on which I made it 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:21.490
 I put the oven at 300 degrees 250 degrees 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.260
 and for 30 minutes be very careful of 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.150
 Do not burn yourself when you are using the oven 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.340
 and this will help to stop painting 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.680
 a marker and we have super super 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.570
 pretty then I'm going to decorate it with some 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.940
 test and that because doing likes 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.350
 a lot of chocolatito but you 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.090
 You can put whatever you want 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.530
 teach expression of what they like to 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.990
 the person who will give him here the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.640
 point is the rate that goes personalized and 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.710
 will prescribe is super supermint me 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.710
 love this idea and this is how they look 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.280
 ah 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.879
 to the next ideas as for this 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.840
 trust and so I had it in the house 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:08.239
 only clean it very well tontito 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.769
 coconut oil and granulated coffee and that's 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.260
 everything I 'm going to do I 'm going to put a 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.959
 little bit of coconut oil in the oven 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.940
 for you to make liquid and I'm going to 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.040
 put for a minute and a half later what 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.430
 I'm going to take out and I'm going to put a 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.110
 teaspoon of coffee in the cool 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.940
 there are exact measurements you can put 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.190
 what you think only that you 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.690
 It has a special consistency because I've 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.910
 mentioned but this is an exfoliant 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.739
 for the hands and in servile to leave their 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.450
 super super hands are results in 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.950
 serious that tim and now what I'm 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.180
 doing is decorating the then they can 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.680
 decorate it the way you 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.840
 want to use the colors that you 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.459
 want me to put that ribbon on him and a 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.079
 ribbon cited gold and I think it looks 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.640
 Super nice, they can make you a 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.380
 bigger pieces because it can be a 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.110
 Exfoliating for the body also tea 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.760
 leaves the body the skin in general super 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.860
 super golden, really, you try it 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.760
 you will love it and this is how I stay 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.760
 I loved 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.370
 for next let's connect a vial 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.020
 silicon scissors tape and let's put 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.000
 tape about halfway through the 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.570
 arm and with a cutter just having 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.160
 Be careful not to cut yourself again 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.930
 This will cut the tape but first 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.640
 what he did was mark it with the marker 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.120
 more or less to have an idea where what 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.340
 was going to cut these writings can they 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.110
 get outside anywhere is 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.990
 everywhere even in your house 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.880
 you can have it with coconut oil with 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.760
 a jam can not be checked which 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.010
 can serve them right away, cut the 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.350
 tape I remove all the tape and left the 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.810
 heart and then what I'm going to do is 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.140
 go out in the open air and paint 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.170
 my little bottle with spray paint with 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.580
 Carefully put a bag like me 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.660
 at the bottom so that no 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.790
 dirty 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.350
 and in this way we are going to paint our 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.350
 Careful formic vial 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.199
 once it is with our helmet 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.509
 we are going to remove the tape completely 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.100
 of transportation and give us our 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.810

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.699
 we are going to do immediately after removing the 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.770
 tape let's use our other pointer 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.449
 time and we're going to match all the lines 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.380
 of the heart so that we have a 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.380
 a little bit better 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.590

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.330

 how is it going to be the other year or anything 

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.380
