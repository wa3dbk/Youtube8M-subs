00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
just way too crowded anyway they're

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.839 
just way too crowded anyway they're
doing<00:02:08.420> fine<00:02:08.630> they're<00:02:08.869> growing<00:02:09.110> really<00:02:09.289> nice

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
doing fine they're growing really nice

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.180 
doing fine they're growing really nice
nice<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.120> big<00:02:11.299> I<00:02:11.599> mean<00:02:12.530> they're<00:02:12.709> almost<00:02:12.890> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
nice and big I mean they're almost the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.449 
nice and big I mean they're almost the
same<00:02:13.250> sizes<00:02:13.970> as<00:02:14.380> these<00:02:15.380> ones<00:02:15.620> at<00:02:15.769> 12<00:02:15.980> weeks<00:02:16.160> and

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
same sizes as these ones at 12 weeks and

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.420 
same sizes as these ones at 12 weeks and
I<00:02:16.519> think<00:02:16.730> there<00:02:16.880> are<00:02:16.910> three<00:02:17.180> weeks<00:02:17.359> younger<00:02:17.600> so

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
I think there are three weeks younger so

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.270 
I think there are three weeks younger so
