working<00:04:31.210> but<00:04:31.479> i<00:04:31.690> guess<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.380> speed<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.860> like

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
working but i guess the speed of like

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.580 
working but i guess the speed of like

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.310 
currently I think they've met the meta
the<00:05:22.610> current<00:05:22.940> matter<00:05:23.120> right<00:05:23.420> now<00:05:23.480> or<00:05:24.050> perhaps

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
the current matter right now or perhaps

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.830 
the current matter right now or perhaps
it<00:05:24.650> will<00:05:24.800> pass<00:05:25.010> from<00:05:25.190> you<00:05:25.370> or<00:05:25.490> so<00:05:25.670> i<00:05:25.910> think<00:05:26.210> has

it will pass from you or so i think has

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.830 
it will pass from you or so i think has
been<00:05:26.870> very<00:05:27.350> fast<00:05:27.650> and<00:05:28.120> just<00:05:29.120> very<00:05:29.300> easy<00:05:29.570> when
