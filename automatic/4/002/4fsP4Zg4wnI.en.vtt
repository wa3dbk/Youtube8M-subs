hey<00:00:02.280> guys<00:00:02.490> I<00:00:02.639> want<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.850> show<00:00:02.970> you<00:00:03.060> some<00:00:03.240> upgrade

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
hey guys I want to show you some upgrade

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.050 
hey guys I want to show you some upgrade
that<00:00:04.380> all<00:00:04.620> weighed<00:00:04.920> less<00:00:05.220> than<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.819> stock

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
that all weighed less than the stock

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.140 
that all weighed less than the stock
parts<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:06.750> should<00:00:06.990> be<00:00:07.109> stronger<00:00:07.500> as<00:00:07.620> well

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.150 
parts and it should be stronger as well

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.450 
parts and it should be stronger as well
first<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> micro<00:00:09.809> heli<00:00:10.019> main<00:00:10.830> rotor<00:00:11.130> hub<00:00:11.990> and

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
first is a micro heli main rotor hub and

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.150 
first is a micro heli main rotor hub and
it<00:00:14.460> does<00:00:14.670> weigh<00:00:14.910> less<00:00:15.150> than<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.870> stock<00:00:16.170> main

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
it does weigh less than the stock main

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.470 
it does weigh less than the stock main
rotor<00:00:17.460> hub<00:00:19.279> also<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.730> has<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.910> metal

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
rotor hub also like that it has a metal

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.750 
rotor hub also like that it has a metal
screw<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.170> goes<00:00:22.769> through<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> main<00:00:23.369> shaft

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
screw that goes through the main shaft

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.700 
screw that goes through the main shaft
and<00:00:24.000> screws<00:00:24.869> into<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.350> hub<00:00:27.260> which<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.470> better

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
and screws into the hub which is better

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.729 
and screws into the hub which is better
than<00:00:28.949> screwing<00:00:29.460> into<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.820> plastic<00:00:33.590> next<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.710> a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
than screwing into the plastic next is a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.130 
than screwing into the plastic next is a
new<00:00:34.980> tail<00:00:35.399> servo<00:00:35.850> mount

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.910 

it<00:00:42.680> weighs<00:00:42.980> less<00:00:43.280> as<00:00:43.520> well<00:00:43.760> as<00:00:44.480> four<00:00:45.079> screws<00:00:47.920> to

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
it weighs less as well as four screws to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.939 
it weighs less as well as four screws to
hold<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.309> server<00:00:49.760> lon<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:54.470> can<00:00:54.620> see<00:00:54.800> from

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
hold the server lon and you can see from

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.189 
hold the server lon and you can see from
the<00:00:55.100> design<00:00:55.520> if<00:00:55.790> you<00:00:55.910> need<00:00:56.270> to<00:00:56.390> move<00:00:56.540> the<00:00:56.720> servo

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
the design if you need to move the servo

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.369 
the design if you need to move the servo
further<00:00:58.100> forward<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:58.940> could<00:00:59.120> do<00:00:59.300> that<00:01:02.379> next

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
further forward you could do that next

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.420 
further forward you could do that next
is<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.530> carbon-fiber<00:01:04.600> boom<00:01:05.600> supports<00:01:06.430> they

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
is the carbon-fiber boom supports they

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.520 
is the carbon-fiber boom supports they
also<00:01:07.610> weighed<00:01:08.000> less<00:01:08.210> than<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.720> plastic<00:01:08.990> and

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
also weighed less than the plastic and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.149 
also weighed less than the plastic and
it<00:01:10.100> also<00:01:10.280> allows<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.270> move<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:12.530> boom

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
it also allows you to move the boom

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.010 
it also allows you to move the boom
mount<00:01:13.490> further<00:01:13.880> back<00:01:14.240> which<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:14.660> think<00:01:14.899> helps

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
mount further back which I think helps

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.950 
mount further back which I think helps
with<00:01:15.259> vibrations<00:01:17.289> and<00:01:19.060> last<00:01:20.060> is<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.539> new

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
with vibrations and last is the new

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.560 
with vibrations and last is the new
micro<00:01:21.350> le<00:01:21.560> boom<00:01:22.520> support<00:01:23.210> mount

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.920 

also<00:01:28.570> wave<00:01:28.780> left<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.580> plastic<00:01:31.120> mount<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
also wave left in the plastic mount and

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.070 
also wave left in the plastic mount and
I<00:01:35.260> don't<00:01:35.380> know<00:01:35.470> about<00:01:35.560> you<00:01:35.680> but<00:01:36.130> I've<00:01:36.280> had

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
I don't know about you but I've had

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.720 
I don't know about you but I've had
problems<00:01:38.080> stripping<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.950> screws<00:01:39.310> in<00:01:39.640> the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
problems stripping the screws in the

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.720 
problems stripping the screws in the
plastic<00:01:40.240> mount<00:01:40.510> in<00:01:40.810> these<00:01:41.380> or<00:01:41.650> metal<00:01:42.550> and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
plastic mount in these or metal and

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.210 
plastic mount in these or metal and
should<00:01:43.300> work<00:01:43.510> better<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:46.270> there<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.570> have<00:01:46.630> it

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
should work better so there you have it

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.220 
should work better so there you have it
if<00:01:48.220> you're<00:01:48.520> looking<00:01:48.880> for<00:01:48.910> some<00:01:49.360> ports<00:01:49.720> that

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
if you're looking for some ports that

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.190 
if you're looking for some ports that
are<00:01:50.290> stronger<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.130> lighter

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.259
