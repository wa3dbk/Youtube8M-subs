next year opening their way to women and

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.970 
next year opening their way to women and

I think the Marines are also have a

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.500 
I think the Marines are also have a
group<00:01:51.250> that<00:01:51.430> has<00:01:51.580> opened<00:01:51.940> up<00:01:52.060> their<00:01:52.240> way<00:01:52.450> so

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
group that has opened up their way so

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.240 
group that has opened up their way so
that<00:01:52.750> women<00:01:53.050> can<00:01:53.290> join<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.680> be<00:01:53.770> a<00:01:53.800> part<00:01:54.100> of

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
that women can join and be a part of

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.800 
that women can join and be a part of

now as far as my background being a
Christian<00:03:33.549> I<00:03:33.700> believe<00:03:33.730> men<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:34.930> women<00:03:35.349> are

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
Christian I believe men and women are

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.800 
Christian I believe men and women are
equal<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:36.400> believe<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:37.060> both<00:03:37.209> men<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:37.599> women

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
equal I believe that both men and women

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.140 
equal I believe that both men and women
are<00:03:38.139> created<00:03:38.200> in<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:39.160> image<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.579> God<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.000> we

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
are created in the image of God so we

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.960 
are created in the image of God so we
have<00:03:40.269> equal<00:03:40.780> dignity<00:03:41.349> a<00:03:41.859> man<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.579> not<00:03:42.730> better

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
have equal dignity a man is not better

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.970 
have equal dignity a man is not better
than<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.239> woman<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.930> woman<00:03:44.109> is<00:03:44.530> not<00:03:44.769> better

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
than a woman and a woman is not better

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.400 
than a woman and a woman is not better
than<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.280> man<00:03:45.609> where<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.299> difference<00:03:46.660> comes<00:03:46.989> in

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
than a man where the difference comes in

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.710 
than a man where the difference comes in
I<00:03:47.590> believe<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.069> God<00:03:48.489> created<00:03:49.090> us<00:03:49.450> for

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
I believe that God created us for

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.599 
I believe that God created us for
different<00:03:50.410> roles<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.130> I<00:03:51.220> think<00:03:51.430> there<00:03:51.579> are

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
different roles and I think there are

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.580 
different roles and I think there are
basically<00:03:52.180> things<00:03:52.540> that<00:03:52.690> men<00:03:52.959> specialize<00:03:53.560> in

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
basically things that men specialize in

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.800 
basically things that men specialize in
and<00:03:53.950> do<00:03:54.430> better<00:03:54.609> than<00:03:54.819> women<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:55.750> believe

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
and do better than women and I believe

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.569 
and do better than women and I believe
there<00:03:56.109> are<00:03:56.230> things<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.500> women<00:03:56.889> specialize

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
there are things that women specialize

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.610 
there are things that women specialize
in<00:03:57.609> and<00:03:58.030> do<00:03:58.180> better<00:03:58.389> than<00:03:58.660> men<00:03:59.109> you<00:03:59.500> know

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
in and do better than men you know

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.319 
in and do better than men you know
generally<00:04:00.430> speaking<00:04:00.730> there<00:04:00.970> are<00:04:01.030> some<00:04:01.180> women

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
generally speaking there are some women

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.670 
generally speaking there are some women
that<00:04:01.599> can<00:04:01.750> cross<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.139> line<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.319> everything

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
that can cross the line and everything

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.140 
that can cross the line and everything
like<00:04:03.069> that<00:04:03.129> and<00:04:03.459> then<00:04:03.579> that<00:04:03.760> kind<00:04:03.910> of<00:04:03.970> cross

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
like that and then that kind of cross

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.119 
like that and then that kind of cross
the<00:04:04.299> line<00:04:04.450> with<00:04:04.480> things<00:04:04.840> but<00:04:05.470> I<00:04:05.500> believe<00:04:05.829> you

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
the line with things but I believe you

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.000 
the line with things but I believe you
know<00:04:06.250> we<00:04:06.579> are<00:04:06.819> created<00:04:07.629> with<00:04:08.200> different<00:04:08.709> roles

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
know we are created with different roles

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.089 
know we are created with different roles
in<00:04:09.250> mind<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.609> I<00:04:09.700> believe<00:04:10.030> we<00:04:10.180> are<00:04:10.209> created<00:04:11.019> to

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
in mind and I believe we are created to

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.289 
in mind and I believe we are created to
complement<00:04:12.099> each<00:04:12.280> other<00:04:12.549> and<00:04:12.819> when<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:12.970> man

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
complement each other and when a man

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.869 
complement each other and when a man
comes<00:04:13.690> together<00:04:14.079> with<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.590> woman<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.129> believe<00:04:15.699> we

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
comes together with a woman I believe we

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.900

can<00:04:15.910> accomplish<00:04:16.419> a<00:04:16.750> lot<00:04:16.780> more<00:04:17.620> now<00:04:18.190> like<00:04:18.459> that

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
can accomplish a lot more now like that

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.089 
can accomplish a lot more now like that
society<00:04:19.510> though<00:04:19.690> says<00:04:19.989> men<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:20.650> women<00:04:20.919> are

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
society though says men and women are

society though says men and women are
equal<00:04:21.250> which<00:04:21.699> we're<00:04:22.240> okay<00:04:22.479> with<00:04:22.630> that<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:22.810> agree

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
equal which we're okay with that I agree

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.839 
equal which we're okay with that I agree
with<00:04:23.289> that<00:04:23.440> but<00:04:23.830> they<00:04:23.949> say<00:04:24.099> men<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.490> women<00:04:24.729> are

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849

with that but they say men and women are
the<00:04:25.000> same<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.360> you<00:04:25.630> think<00:04:25.870> about<00:04:26.080> it<00:04:26.229> that's

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
the same and you think about it that's

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.260 
the same and you think about it that's
at<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.860> heart<00:04:26.979> of<00:04:27.370> same-sex<00:04:27.640> marriage

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
at the heart of same-sex marriage

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.070 
at the heart of same-sex marriage
because<00:04:28.960> if<00:04:29.140> men

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
because if men

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.960 
because if men
women<00:04:30.349> are<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:30.560> same<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:31.310> really<00:04:31.580> doesn't

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
women are the same it really doesn't

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.570 
women are the same it really doesn't
matter<00:04:32.060> if<00:04:32.419> a<00:04:32.599> man<00:04:32.930> marries<00:04:33.259> a<00:04:33.439> man<00:04:33.710> or<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.340> man

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
matter if a man marries a man or a man

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.129 
matter if a man marries a man or a man
marries<00:04:35.180> a<00:04:35.210> woman<00:04:35.330> because<00:04:35.810> they<00:04:35.900> are<00:04:35.960> the

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
marries a woman because they are the

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.339 
marries a woman because they are the
same<00:04:36.379> but<00:04:36.650> if<00:04:37.159> God<00:04:37.639> did<00:04:38.090> create<00:04:38.599> us<00:04:38.870> for

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349
