bit<00:00:33.019> of<00:00:33.079> depth<00:00:33.319> to<00:00:33.499> it<00:00:33.530> it's<00:00:33.760> kind<00:00:34.760> of<00:00:34.819> hard<00:00:34.969> to

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
bit of depth to it it's kind of hard to

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.669 
bit of depth to it it's kind of hard to
see<00:00:35.239> from<00:00:35.359> here<00:00:35.569> but<00:00:35.749> all<00:00:35.899> the<00:00:36.019> little<00:00:36.260> sparkly

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.049 
don't see so much the orange peel it's
kind<00:00:54.889> of<00:00:54.920> hard<00:00:55.100> not<00:00:55.129> to<00:00:55.399> get<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.549> glare<00:00:55.850> off

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059

kind of hard not to get a glare off
anything<00:00:56.629> here<00:00:56.839> so<00:00:57.249> any<00:00:58.249> sort<00:00:58.489> of<00:00:58.519> light<00:00:58.699> first

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
anything here so any sort of light first

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.250 
anything here so any sort of light first
we'll<00:00:59.119> just<00:00:59.479> make<00:00:59.749> it<00:00:59.869> glow<00:01:00.489> anyways<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:02.260> this

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
we'll just make it glow anyways so this

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.010 
we'll just make it glow anyways so this
sounds<00:01:03.529> nearly<00:01:03.829> done<00:01:04.600> however<00:01:05.600> I<00:01:05.630> have<00:01:05.719> one

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
sounds nearly done however I have one

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.599 
sounds nearly done however I have one
small<00:01:06.140> issue<00:01:06.289> with<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:06.859> when<00:01:07.009> I<00:01:07.039> was<00:01:07.219> making

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:07.609 
small issue with it when I was making

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:08.859 
small issue with it when I was making
the<00:01:07.700> sound<00:01:07.909> of<00:01:07.969> it<00:01:08.000> was<00:01:08.149> kind<00:01:08.390> of<00:01:08.420> cold<00:01:08.659> outside

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
the sound of it was kind of cold outside

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.029 
the sound of it was kind of cold outside
and<00:01:09.289> i<00:01:10.250> think<00:01:10.549> the<00:01:11.229> quick<00:01:12.229> cast<00:01:12.469> didn't<00:01:12.829> set

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
and i think the quick cast didn't set

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.819 
and i think the quick cast didn't set
properly<00:01:13.430> it<00:01:13.820> keeps<00:01:14.240> setting<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.990> sleeping

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
properly it keeps setting the sleeping

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.480 
properly it keeps setting the sleeping
oils<00:01:16.359> and<00:01:17.359> the<00:01:17.659> paint<00:01:17.840> just<00:01:17.960> rubs<00:01:18.229> right<00:01:18.409> off

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
oils and the paint just rubs right off

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.830 
oils and the paint just rubs right off
as<00:01:19.490> has<00:01:19.670> been<00:01:19.789> sitting<00:01:20.000> for<00:01:20.240> two<00:01:20.390> days<00:01:20.539> and

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
as has been sitting for two days and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.590 
as has been sitting for two days and
paint<00:01:21.710> just<00:01:21.829> comes<00:01:22.039> right<00:01:22.159> off<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.700> it<00:01:23.210> sticks

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
paint just comes right off and it sticks

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.270 
paint just comes right off and it sticks
everywhere<00:01:23.780> else<00:01:24.200> but<00:01:24.320> except<00:01:24.799> for<00:01:24.829> their<00:01:25.070> i

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
everywhere else but except for their i

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.700 
everywhere else but except for their i
have<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.270> same<00:01:26.509> situation<00:01:26.990> going<00:01:27.409> on<00:01:27.469> back

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
have a same situation going on back

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.330 
have a same situation going on back
there<00:01:28.090> so<00:01:29.090> anyway<00:01:29.899> so<00:01:29.960> my<00:01:30.439> option<00:01:31.070> would<00:01:31.189> be<00:01:31.249> to

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
there so anyway so my option would be to

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.120 
there so anyway so my option would be to
cut<00:01:31.670> this<00:01:31.789> out<00:01:31.969> and<00:01:32.390> put<00:01:32.469> a<00:01:33.469> complete<00:01:33.920> new

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
cut this out and put a complete new

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.029 
cut this out and put a complete new
piece<00:01:34.969> of<00:01:34.999> plastic<00:01:35.479> in<00:01:35.600> there<00:01:36.009> using<00:01:37.009> the

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
piece of plastic in there using the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.700 
piece of plastic in there using the
quick<00:01:37.490> test<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:38.689> you<00:01:39.140> don't<00:01:39.259> have<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.439> do<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.619> on

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
quick test so you don't have to do it on

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.289 
quick test so you don't have to do it on
that<00:01:39.859> site<00:01:40.100> as<00:01:40.219> well<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:40.700> i<00:01:40.729> kind<00:01:40.999> of<00:01:41.030> set<00:01:41.179> me

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
that site as well so i kind of set me

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.050 
that site as well so i kind of set me
back<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.479> little<00:01:41.659> bit<00:01:42.579> so<00:01:43.579> then<00:01:43.850> i<00:01:43.880> have<00:01:43.969> to

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
back a little bit so then i have to

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.760 
back a little bit so then i have to
finish<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.359> and<00:01:44.600> do<00:01:44.749> the<00:01:44.869> same<00:01:45.049> as<00:01:45.350> everything

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
finish it and do the same as everything

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.670 
finish it and do the same as everything
else<00:01:45.890> because<00:01:46.340> it's<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.630> really<00:01:47.630> off

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
else because it's a really off

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.850 
else because it's a really off

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.450 
war machine this thing is nearly done I
keep<00:01:59.540> saying<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.110> but<00:02:00.380> every<00:02:01.070> time<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.340> look

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
keep saying that but every time you look

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.490 
keep saying that but every time you look
at<00:02:01.550> it<00:02:01.610> you<00:02:01.760> find<00:02:01.940> you<00:02:02.120> things<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.450> are<00:02:02.660> wrong

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
at it you find you things that are wrong

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
at it you find you things that are wrong
or<00:02:03.920> things<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.400> need<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.640> fix<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:06.520> it's

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
or things you need to fix so it's

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.859 
or things you need to fix so it's
getting<00:02:07.729> there<00:02:07.850> I<00:02:07.970> need<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.270> meet<00:02:08.420> meet<00:02:08.660> some

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
getting there I need to meet meet some

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.800 
getting there I need to meet meet some
deities<00:02:09.200> up<00:02:09.320> on<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.560> back<00:02:09.740> some<00:02:10.100> so<00:02:10.369> it's<00:02:10.520> a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
deities up on the back some so it's a

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
deities up on the back some so it's a
little<00:02:11.810> easier<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:14.080> take<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.230> back<00:02:15.410> piece<00:02:15.620> on

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
little easier to take the back piece on

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.820 
little easier to take the back piece on
and<00:02:15.980> off<00:02:16.070> but<00:02:17.000> anyway<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:17.690> that's<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.260> war

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
and off but anyway so that's the war

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.410 
and off but anyway so that's the war
machine<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.970> shiny<00:02:20.209> shiny<00:02:20.420> mark<00:02:20.750> 5<00:02:22.420> so

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
machine and the shiny shiny mark 5 so

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.840 
machine and the shiny shiny mark 5 so
