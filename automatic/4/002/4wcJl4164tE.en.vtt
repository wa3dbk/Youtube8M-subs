lower<00:01:59.009> specification<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> say<00:02:00.240> then<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
lower specification so I say then in the

lower specification so I say then in the
desktop<00:02:01.710> model<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.399> radeon<00:02:02.850> HD<00:02:03.140> 7970

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
so fifty percent of what for the 9000

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.410 
so fifty percent of what for the 9000
970<00:02:12.569> does

970 does

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
so what about next generation systems

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.870 
so what about next generation systems

such as the PlayStation 4 will just for
reference<00:02:19.030> although<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.540> have<00:02:19.840> done<00:02:19.989> any

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
reference although I have done any

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.080 
reference although I have done any
series<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.739> videos<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.280> an<00:02:21.370> article<00:02:21.819> on<00:02:21.910> this

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
series of videos and an article on this

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.940 
series of videos and an article on this
on<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.360> gaming<00:02:22.599> tech<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.110> if<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.739> want<00:02:23.890> to

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
on the gaming tech so if you want to

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.900 
on the gaming tech so if you want to
check<00:02:24.160> out<00:02:24.310> how<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.700> 7970<00:02:25.860> desktop<00:02:26.910> compares

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
check out how the 7970 desktop compares

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.820 
check out how the 7970 desktop compares
to<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.510> police<00:02:28.720> station<00:02:28.810> for<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.260> suggest<00:02:29.709> you

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
to the police station for I suggest you

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.559 
to the police station for I suggest you
check<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.069> out<00:02:30.340> however<00:02:31.239> just<00:02:31.420> for

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
check that out however just for

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.350 
check that out however just for
reference<00:02:31.750> there<00:02:32.290> are<00:02:32.440> 18<00:02:32.890> gcn<00:02:33.670> compute<00:02:34.060> units

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
reference there are 18 gcn compute units

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.110 
reference there are 18 gcn compute units
on<00:02:34.630> at<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:34.959> ps4<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.709> those<00:02:36.370> will<00:02:36.730> put<00:02:37.090> out

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
on at the ps4 and those will put out

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.360 
on at the ps4 and those will put out
1152<00:02:40.120> stream<00:02:40.630> processors<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:42.100> you're<00:02:42.250> looking

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
1152 stream processors so you're looking

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.740 
1152 stream processors so you're looking
at<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.700> difference<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.300> just<00:02:43.330> over<00:02:44.220> 3.5<00:02:45.220> times

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
at a difference of just over 3.5 times

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.660 
at a difference of just over 3.5 times
so<00:02:46.750> it's<00:02:47.200> pretty<00:02:47.410> profound<00:02:47.890> we'll<00:02:48.280> be<00:02:48.430> seeing

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
so it's pretty profound we'll be seeing

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.670 
so it's pretty profound we'll be seeing
a<00:02:48.819> lot<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:49.150> GPU<00:02:49.720> performance<00:02:49.900> once<00:02:50.410> again

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
a lot of GPU performance once again

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.009 
a lot of GPU performance once again
however<00:02:50.920> because<00:02:51.370> we<00:02:51.489> don't<00:02:51.700> know<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.900> actual

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
however because we don't know the actual

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.620 
however because we don't know the actual
clock<00:02:53.440> speeds<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.160> on<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.730> may<00:02:55.209> not<00:02:55.390> be<00:02:55.450> a

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
clock speeds and so on it may not be a

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.660 
clock speeds and so on it may not be a
big<00:02:56.049> deal<00:02:56.080> for<00:02:56.350> example<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.130> clock<00:02:57.340> speeds

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
big deal for example the clock speeds

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.440 
big deal for example the clock speeds
could<00:02:58.030> be<00:02:58.180> lower<00:02:58.569> as<00:02:59.350> an<00:02:59.890> example<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.910> 7970

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
could be lower as an example of the 7970

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.039 
could be lower as an example of the 7970
desktop<00:03:02.380> has<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:03.130> clock<00:03:03.400> speed<00:03:03.549> of<00:03:04.049> 925

ps4 version by the way just in case

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.140 
ps4 version by the way just in case
you're<00:03:11.799> wondering<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.400> hundred<00:03:12.880> megahertz

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
you're wondering is a hundred megahertz

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.400 
you're wondering is a hundred megahertz
so<00:03:13.780> for<00:03:13.989> example<00:03:14.459> because<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.180> 20nm<00:03:16.690> and

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
so for example because of the 20nm and

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.050 
so for example because of the 20nm and
affection<00:03:17.829> process<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.519> obviously<00:03:18.790> is<00:03:18.910> going

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
affection process and obviously is going

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.060 
affection process and obviously is going
to<00:03:19.120> be<00:03:19.180> fairly<00:03:19.390> darn<00:03:19.690> hot<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.410> could<00:03:20.560> be<00:03:20.769> close

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
to be fairly darn hot it could be close

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.699 
to be fairly darn hot it could be close
to<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.430> 800<00:03:21.880> megahertz<00:03:22.180> range<00:03:22.620> therefore<00:03:23.620> it

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
to that 800 megahertz range therefore it

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.979 
to that 800 megahertz range therefore it
won't<00:03:23.829> be<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.850> know<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.269> much<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.570> jump<00:03:25.840> as

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
won't be a you know so much of a jump as

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.800 
won't be a you know so much of a jump as
if<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.200> was<00:03:26.290> like<00:03:26.410> 900<00:03:27.040> or<00:03:27.420> 950<00:03:28.420> or<00:03:28.510> whatever

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
if it was like 900 or 950 or whatever

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.810 
if it was like 900 or 950 or whatever
megahertz<00:03:29.290> anyway<00:03:29.680> hope<00:03:30.280> think<00:03:30.640> I've<00:03:30.790> just

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
megahertz anyway hope think I've just

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.250 
megahertz anyway hope think I've just
about<00:03:31.060> covers<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.660> for<00:03:31.720> this<00:03:31.959> particular

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
about covers it for this particular

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.530 
about covers it for this particular
video<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:33.310> hopefully<00:03:33.850> you've<00:03:34.120> enjoyed<00:03:34.180> it

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
video and hopefully you've enjoyed it

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.509 
video and hopefully you've enjoyed it
and<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.959> will<00:03:34.989> see<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.320> soon<00:03:35.650> take<00:03:36.100> care<00:03:36.160> and

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
and I will see you soon take care and

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:55.340 
and I will see you soon take care and
